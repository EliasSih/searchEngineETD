The 2 ', 3 ' -dialdehyde derivative of ATP (oATP) was prepared by periodate oxidation, and on the following criteria was considered to be an affinity label of the MgATP &#178;&#8315;  binding site of sheep liver pyruvate carboxylase. The magnesium complex of this inhibitor (Mg-oATP &#178; &#8315; ) was shown to be a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to MgATP &#178; &#8315;  in both the acetyl CoA-dependent and -independent activities of the enzyme but was a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to bicarbonate and an un-competitive inhibitor with respect to pyruvate. Mg-oATP &#178; &#8315;  was covalently bound to pyruvate carboxylase by reduction using sodium borohydride with concurrent irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. Although pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and bicarbonate were ineffective, both acetyl CoA and MgATP &#178; &#8315;  protected the enzyme against this chemical modification. Mg &#178; &#8314;  enhanced the extent of chemical modification. At 100% inactivation, 1.1 &#177; 0.1 moles of Mg-oATP &#178; &#8315;  were bound to the enzyme per mole of biotin. The presence or absence of acetyl CoA had no affect on this stoichiometry. Chromatography of samples of an enzymic digest of Mg - o [&#185;  &#8308;  C ] ATP &#178; &#8315;  -labelled enzyme revealed one major band of radioactivity which co-chromatographed with authentic lys-oATP markers.  2. In order to further characterise the lysyl residue (s) in the biotin carboxylation site, the use of cyanate as a potential affinity label of the bicarbonate binding site was investigated. Cyanate was shown to chemically modify sheep liver pyruvate carboxylase, with concurrent inactivation of the enzyme. The rate of loss of acetyl CoA-independent catalytic activity was not pseudo first-order with respect to time. When the inactivation data were analysed assuming that modified enzyme retains some residual acetyl CoA-independent activity, it was found that only one kinetically significant residue per active site was modified, but cyanate appeared to form a reversible complex with the enzyme prior to modifying this residue. Acetyl CoA, pyruvate and oxaloacetate were found to have no affect on the rate of modification of the enzyme. Bicarbonate, MgADP, and MgATP &#178; &#8315;  all afforded protection against inactivation of the enzyme. MgATP2 &#8315;  afforded almost complete protection against loss of both the acetyl CoA-dependent and - independent catalytic activities. Analysis of the concentration dependence of protection by bicarbonate and MgATP &#178; &#8315;  suggested that cyanate could not inactivate the enzyme - MgATP &#178; &#8315;  and enzyme-bicarbonate complexes. The enzyme MgADP was found to be inactivated at about 30% of the rate of free enzyme. Modification of the enzyme with cyanate was found to inactivate the ATP/P [subscript i] isotopic exchange reaction, but to enhance the pyruvate/oxaloacetate isotopic exchange reaction. Inactivation of pyruvate carboxylase with [&#185;  &#8308;   C ] cyanate was shown to be associated with modification of at least six amino acid residues per mole of biotin. Chromato-graphy of samples of an enzyme digest of [&#185;  &#8308;  C ] cyanate-labelled enzyme revealed that only amino groups in the enzyme had been modified. A major band of radioactivity was shown to co-chromatograph with authentic homo-citrulline. 3. The stoichiometry of the products of the pyruvate carboxylase reaction was shown to vary as the concentration of pyruvate was altered. At high concentrations of pyruvate, the ratio of orthophosphate liberated to oxaloacetate produced approached one, but, as the pyruvate concentration decreased, the ratio increased. On the basis of this evidence, a model for the reaction pathway was proposed in which the carboxybiotin-enzyme complex could react either with pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate, or water to regenerate enzyme-biotin and bicarbonate. The non-productive breakdown of the enzyme-substrate complex provides an explanation for the non-linear double reciprocal plots obtained for both the overall reaction and the pyruvate/oxaloacetate exchange reaction. Since neither the rate of breakdown of the isolated carboxybiotin-enzyme complex, nor the rate of decarboxylation of oxaloacetate in the absence of pyruvate could account for the difference in the amounts of the two products formed in the overall reaction, it was postulated that the presence of pyruvate was necessary for hydrolysis to occur. Rate equations were derived describing the dependence of the initial velocity release of oxaloacetate in the overall reaction, and the rate of the pyruvate/oxaloacetate exchange reaction, on pyruvate concentration. By assigning appropriate values to the various rate constants, theoretical curves were obtained and fitted to the experimental data. The reaction pathway of the pyruvate carboxylase catalysed reaction was re-examined using two independent experimental approaches not previously applied to this enzyme. To avoid the variable stoichiometry associated with oxaloacetate formation, the reaction rate was measured by following orthophosphate release. Initial velocities, when plotted as a function of varying concentrations of either MgATP &#178; &#8315;  or bicarbonate, at fixed levels of pyruvate, gave, in double reciprocalform, families of straight, intersecting lines. Furthermore, when the reaction was determined as a function of varying MgATP &#178; &#8315;  concentration, using pyruvate, 2-ketobutyrate, and 3-fluoro-pyruvate as alternative keto-acid substrates, the slopes of the double reciprocal plots were significantly different. Both results suggest that the pyruvate carboxylase reaction has a sequential pathway, at least at high keto-acid substrate concentrations. However, an analysis of the slope replots of the initial velocity orthophosphate release data suggested that the reaction via a non-sequential pathway at low keto-acid substrate concentrations. Rate equations describing the dependence of initial velocity release of oxaloacetate and orthophosphate on the concentrations of substrates were derived and were shown to be consistent with the initial velocity kinetic data presently available. Possible extensions of the concept of hydrolytic breakdown of an intermediate enzyme complex to other enzymes were discussed. 4. The interaction of acetyl CoA with sheep liver pyruvate carboxylase was investigated using two independent experimental approaches. Evidence consistent with lack of co-operativity of acetyl CoA binding under initial velocity assay conditions was obtained from an analysis of the protection afforded by acetyl CoA against TNBS modification of the enzyme. Furthermore, the dependence of the rate of acetyl CoA deacylation on acetyl CoA concentration was found to be consistent with lack of co-operativity of binding of acetyl CoA. Evidence was obtained which suggested that the observed non-classical initial-velocity acetyl CoA profile arose because of acetyl CoA-dependent changes in the saturation of the enzyme with pyruvate and bicarbonate, and in the rate of dilution inactivation of the enzyme. The n [subscript H] value obtained from an analysis of the dependence of initial velocity oxaloacetate synthesis on acetyl CoA concentration using the Hill equation was shown to depend on the fixed concentrations of pyruvate and bicarbonate in the assay solutions. The fixed concentrations of MgATP &#178; &#8315;  and K &#8314;  were found to have no affect on the n [subscript H] value. The time period over which the reaction rate was linear with time was found to depend on the acetyl CoA concentration in the assay solution. At high concentrations of acetyl CoA, the process of dilution inactivation was prevented, and hence the reaction was linear with time for a longer period than at low concentrations of acetyl CoA. Dilution inactivation was shown not to involve formation of catalytically active pyruvate carboxylase dimers or monomers. When an experiment was designed in which all substrates and activators were present at saturating levels regardless of the acetyl CoA concentration, and the enzyme concentration was raised to a level where dilution inactivation did not occur, the dependence of the rate of oxaloacetate synthesis on acetyl CoA concentration was found to be consistent with lack of co-operativity of binding of acetyl CoA to pyruvate carboxylase.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pyruvate carboxylase</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37988</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the membrane lipids of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and their relation to extracellular protein secretion</field><field name="creator">Paton, James Cleland</field><field name="description">1. The major phospholipids extracted from Bacillus amylolique - faciens were cardiolipin, phosphatidylycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. 2. The distribution of these phospholipids between the two halves of the cytoplasmic membrane bilayer was studied using phospholipase C ( B. cereus ), phospholipase A2 ( Crotalus ) and the non - penetrating chemical probe trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid ( TNBS ). After treatment of intact protoplasts of B. amylolique - faciens with either phospholipase, approximately 70 % of total membrane phospholipid was hydrolysed ; specifically approximately 90 %, 90 % and 30 % of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin respectively. Under these conditions, protoplasts remained intact and sealed. However, when protoplasts that were permeabilized by cold shock treatment were incubated with either of the phospholipases, up to 80 % of cardiolipin was hydrolysed and phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine were hydrolysed virtually to completion. In intact cells, 92 % of the phosphatidylethanolamine could be labelled with TNBS under conditions in which the reagent did not penetrate the membrane to any significant extent. 3. These results suggest that 70 % of total phospholipid of this bacillus exists in the outer half of the bilayer. The distribution of phosphatidylethanolamine in this bilayer is highly asymmetric with it being located predominantly in the outer half. The results with phospholipases suggest that the distributions of cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol are also asymmetric but independent confirmation or this is required. 4. The fatty acid composition of cells grown at different temperatures was investigated. When cells were grown at 30 &#176; C, branched - chain saturated fatty acids made up over 80 % of the total fatty acids. Saturated straight - chain fatty acids made up the bulk of the remainder. Less than 1 % of the total fatty acids were unsaturated. Decrease in growth temperature was accompanied by an increase in the ratio of branched to straight - chain fatty acids and a marked increase in the level of unsaturation of branched - chain fatty acids. 5. When cells of this organism, grown at 30 &#176; C, were cold shocked, viability and ability to secrete extracellular protease were lost. Growth of this organism at lower temperatures or addition of Tween - 80 to cells caused the critical temperature zone for cold shocking to be significantly lowered. These results suggest a direct correlation between membrane fluidity and the susceptibility to cold shock. 6. The role of lipids in the process of extracellular enzyme secretion was studied using cerulenin, an antibiotic known to inhibit fatty acid synthesis in microorganisms. Cerulenin inhibited the secretion of alpha - amylase and protease in washed cell suspensions by 80 % and 75 % respectively over 3 hours. The effect was a general one since secretion of all protein species into the medium was drastically reduced by the antibiotic. At the concentration of cerulenin used ( 100 . &#181; g / ml ), [ 14C ] - acetate incorporation into cellular lipid was inhibited by approximately 50 % but total cellular protein and RNA synthesis were virtually unaffected. The inhibitory effect of cerulenin on alpha - amylase and protease secretion could be partially reversed if cell suspensions were supplemented with either fatty acids prepared from the lipids extracted from B. amyloliquefaciens, or various individual pure fatty acids. These results suggest that fatty acid synthesis may be required for protein secretion by this organism. 7. Attempts were made to detect precursors to extracellular enzymes either associated with the cells or in the culture medium, employing immunological techniques. These experiments, however, were not successful.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bacillus amyloliquefaciens, microbial lipids, secretion, microbial enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37989</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular genetics of DNA coding for avian feather keratins and for coliphages 186 and P2</field><field name="creator">Saint, Robert Bryce</field><field name="description">Restriction enzyme, molecular cloning and DNA annealing techniques have been used to study mRNA and DNA coding for the embryonic feather keratins of the chicken and the DNA genomes of coliphages 186 and P2. The coliphage DNAs were used to develop the techniques for application to the keratin system which awaited the availability of appropriate bio - hazard containment facilities before being undertaken. The following results were obtained. 1. Restriction endonuclease cleavage of chick DNA with BamHI, Bg&#239;II, EcoRI, or HindIII, fractionation on agarose gels, immobilization on nitrocellulose filters and annealing to DNA complementary to purified 12S mRNA isolated from the developing embryonic feather and coding for embryonic feather keratins, yielded a complex pattern of major and minor bands. These patterns consisted of 4 - 6 major bands and many minor bands. No simple repeat length could be deduced from these patterns, suggesting that keratin - coding DNA is heterogeneous in coding sequences, non - coding sequences or both. 2. Keratin gene expression was shown to be independent of DNA rearrangement, as the complex pattern of restriction fragments was identical in DNA isolated from germ - line tissue ( sperm ) the differentiated feather tissue and somatic tissue not synthesizing keratins ( erythrocytes ). Keratin gene expression must therefore involve the activation of pre - existing control regions in the DNA. 3. The purified 12S mRNA coding for feather keratin was transcribed into double - stranded DNA and individual species isolated by molecular cloning in E. coli. Sequence variation between species was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. 4. Preliminary analysis of the cloned species revealed the existence of two distinct groups of species comprising 12S mRNA : Group I ( the more abundant group ) and Group II ( the less abundant ). The fact that filter - bound DNA of individual Group I species bound more 12s cDNA than equal amounts of Group II species DNA and that pure Group I species and total 12S mRNA sequences ( coding for keratins in cell - free translation systems ) annealed to exactly the same complex set of EcoRI, HindIII, or Bg&#239;II restricted chick DNA fragments, compels the conclusion that Group I species represent true keratin coding sequences. Group II species annealed to restricted chick DNA fragments which were totally different to those annealing, to either Group I species or total 12S mRNA sequences. Different Group II species appeared to anneal to certain common fragments, suggesting that this less abundant group was comprised of a family of sequence related species and were not simply contaminating mRNA species coding for ' housekeeping ' functions. Their exact nature is at present, however, uncertain. 5. Group I species, the presumptive keratin - coding species, are members of a family of homologous species present in the chick genome. This is demonstrated by the fact that the two Group I species which have been examined so far, shown to be non - identical by restriction analysis, and total 12S mRNA sequences from which they were derived, annealed to the same set of between 20 and 30 BglII, HindIII or EcoRI restricted chick DNA fragments under annealing and washing conditions of low stringency, ( high salt ). Under stringent ( low salt ) washing conditions, however, all except between 1 and 3 of the duplexes formed by these fragments and the Group I species were differentially lost from the filter, indicating that the majority of duplexes were mis - matched and therefore that these multiple copies were homologous and not identical. In addition the two non - identical Group I species annealed to EcoRI generated chick DNA fragments of different sizes under the stringent ( low salt ) washing conditions, demonstrating that differences must exist in the sequence of adjacent non - coding and / or intervening sequences ( should they exist ) for these two species. 6. Although the two Group I species discussed above annealed to different EcoRI generated chick DNA fragments under the stringent ( low salt ) washing conditions, they both annealed under these conditions to a HindIII generated chick DNA fragment of size 3.0 kb. Assuming that this is a single fragment and not two fragments co - electrophoresing by chance, sequences identical to or with very close homology to both of these species lie on the same fragment and are therefore linked in the genome. The exact nature of this linkage and of the extent of gene clustering, should it exist, was not determined. 7. Restriction cleavage maps of coliphages 186 and P2 were determined for the enzymes BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, Sa&#239;I, XbaI, and XhoI. These maps were used to analyse four insertion or deletion mutants affecting the major control region of 186. 186ins2 and 186ins3 were shown to be insertions of an IS3 element in the cI. gene and int gene respectively. 186dell and 186del2 were shown to carry the same deletion affecting the cI gene, but 186del2 carried a cryptic insert in the repressor binding site ( operator ).</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">keratin, bacteriophages, chromosome mapping, molecular genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geology of the Adelaidean - Kanmantoo group sequences in the eastern Mount Lofty Ranges</field><field name="creator">Toteff, Stephen</field><field name="description">The metamorphosed sedimentary sequence of the Precambrian Adelaide Supergroup in the eastern Mt. Lofty Ranges closely resembles its lower grade stratotype in the western Mt. Lofty Ranges. Although rocks have been metamorphosed from biotite to high andalusite grade, the nature of the original succession can still be deduced. Stratigraphic thicknesses in the eastern and western sequences differ, however. The thickness of the Torrens Group metasediments in the eastern sequence above the Stoneyfell Quartzite equivalent is over four times that found in its type area. In contrast, the overlying Sturt Group is less than half the thickness of the stratotype whilst the Marino Group is only slightly thinner in the eastern sequence. In the region between Birdwood and Mt. Barker Creek, the Lower Cambrian Kanmantoo Group is in fault contact with the Adelaide Supergroup, the lower levels of the basal unit of the Kanmantoo Group ( the Carrickalinga Head Formation ) being absent. A conformable succession of Kanmantoo Group strata, closely resembling the lithologies in the type area on the south coast of Fleurieu Peninsula, occurs to the east of this contact. Evidence for a fault contact disproves earlier interpretations that the Kanmantoo Group unconformably overlies older strata in parts of this region and confirms the existence of the Nairne Fault. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether the Kanmantoo Group unconformably overlies older strata elsewhere in the eastern Mt. Lofty Ranges. Where there is a break in the normal Kanmantoo Group succession ( which exhibits a remarkable constancy of facies ), faulting is probably the cause. A well developed penetrative schistosity ( S2 ) occurs throughout the Nairne - Mt. Barker Creek area, being related to a deformation phase F2 which produced tight assymetric folds with easterly - dipping axial planes ( paralleled by S2 ) during the Early Palaeozoic Delemarian Orogeny. An earlier deformation ( F1 ) with accompanying metamorphism, earlier than generally recognized in the Mt. Lofty Ranges is evident in the schists. Metadolerite dykes in the area were probably emplaced pre - S2 to early syn - S2. Petrological examination of the metasediments in the Nairne - Mt. Barker Creek area revealed that critical minerals present in metashales of appropriate bulk composition are andalusite, staurolite and almandine whereas cordierite is absent. The origin of andalusite and staurolite is unresolved. Fibrolite ( + minor coarse sillimanite ) is present in all andalu - site - bearing rocks. The sillimanite problem is examined through the well developed textures in peraluminous schists. Green hornblende, diopside and scapolite occur in calc - silicates. Green hornblende, high - An plagioclase and minor epidote are present in the metadolerite dykes. P - T conditions at the peak of metamorphism ( based on mineral assemblages and metamorphic textures ) were probably around 3.5 to 3.75 kb and 500 to 550 &#176; C ( close to the andalusite - sillimanite phase boundary and near the Al2 SiO5 triple - point ). Temperatures of metamorphism deduced from the garnet - biotite geothermometer and more generally from muscovite compositions are compatible with this range. Fibrolite probably formed just within the upper limits of the andalusite stability field. It is uncertain, however, if fibrolite formed as a stable mineral under these P - T conditions or whether it formed metastably, perhaps as a result of rapid reactions induced by sudden temperature increases.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology, paleontology, metamorphism, Mount Lofty Ranges South Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the physiological basis of malting quality of grain developing under high temperature conditions</field><field name="creator">Blesing, Meredith</field><field name="description">Short periods ( up to 5 days ) of high temperatures have been shown to reduce grain weight in barley although the specific effects on malting quality are still not clearly understood. Controlled environment conditions were used in this study to investigate the physiological and biochemical responses in Schooner barley to 5 days of elevated temperatures during grain filling. Control plants were maintained at 21 / 16 &#176; C ( 14th day ) from anthesis to harvest ripeness. Plants undergoing heat treatment experienced increasing temperatures for two days ( from 16 days after anthesis ) followed by 3 days at high temperatures (35 &#176; C day / 25 &#176; C night ). The period of high temperature reduced individual grain dry weight by 18 %. Schooner barley endosperm ( the grain storage tissue ) exhibited greater sensitivity to high temperatures than the whole grain ( 25 % reduction in dry weight ) in response to high temperatures. Grain development was accelerated by exposure to high temperatures and a reduction of approximately 8 % in the duration of grain filling was observed in heat treated compared with control grain. Changes in endosperm composition provided evidence that exposure to high temperatures altered overall grain metabolism. Reduction in starch, the single most important grain component contributing to final grain weight was the major factor lowering final grain dry weight, b - glucan deposition was also reduced following high temperature exposure. Little change was observed in the absolute amount of nitrogen accumulated per endosperm, although nitrogen concentration was higher in heat - treated grain, due mainly to reduced grain size and lower starch content. The results of this study confirmed other reports that the conversion of sucrose to starch was limiting in grain exposed to a period of high temperature. The amount of substrate, sucrose, within heat treated endosperms was not found to be limiting starch accumulation. The reduction in starch synthesis appeared to result from the combined effects of diminished catalytic activity of several enzymes in the committed pathway of starch synthesis and / or delayed recovery of enzyme activity during the cooler conditions which followed the heating period. Soluble starch synthase ( SSS ) showed an immediate loss of catalytic activity, even at moderate temperatures, while sucrose synthase and uridine 5 ' - diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase showed greatest reduction in activity only after plants were returned to cooler conditions. Individual enzymes showed variation in the level of recovery under the cooler temperature conditions which followed the heating period. The high temperature conditions which induced changes in the metabolism of grains following high temperature exposure, were associated with alterations to the appearance of the starchy endosperm cells, including the distribution of starch granules and their growth. Under elevated temperatures the synthesis of endosperm starch did not appear to keep pace with cell division and cell enlargement and peripheral endosperm cells remained relatively empty of starch granules. A reduction in Calcofluor fluorescent cell wall material was observed in both the endosperm and the crushed cell layer of heat treated grains. Microscopic observations revealed that the lower levels of starch observed in heat treated barley grains were not only associated with reduced accumulation of starch, but also localised degradation of the barley endosperm. Increased embryo growth, which was observed to take place in heat treated grains, may have been due to the nutrients thus generated although further investigations are required to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Structural observations of harvest ripe grain developing under control conditions also revealed changes in the grain associated with early germination events, and the possibility of a continuum between development and germination has been put forward. High temperature exposure resulted in an overall decrease in malt extract potential, but there was evidence that the effects of heat on individual malt parameters were both beneficial and detrimental. While DP, beta - amylase deposition, beta - glucan and viscosity were improved, heat treatment was associated with a reduced quantity of starch and increased protein concentration. Grain and malt beta - glucan levels were reduced as a result of high temperature exposure and beta - glucan degradation was enhanced in these grains. The overall reduction in the amount of ' maltable ' grain ( due to reduced grain size ) represented one of the most significant effects of heat treatment. The effects of a period of high temperature on grain growth and subsequent malting quality were examined for barley varieties Schooner and Arapiles and advanced breeding line WI - 2875 * 22. All showed reduced final grain dry weight in heat treated grains but the response to high temperature exposure with respect to starch, protein and ( b - glucan accumulation varied. The continued synthesis of starch by Arapiles and WI - 2875 * 22 under high temperature conditions warrants further investigation. Evidence has also been presented indicating that water loss may not have a decisive role in the termination of grain filling. The effect of high temperatures on the non - endosperm component of the grain showed both genotypic and environmental variation. Changes in the contribution made by the non - endosperm component to final grain weight was observed to lead to alterations in the relative concentration of important grain storage components. This was found to be crucial where potentially important heat stable quality characteristics, such as reduced accumulation of nitrogen, were masked by changes in the contribution to final grain dry weight by the non - endosperm component of the grain.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">malt evaluation, barley, starch analysis, grain effect of temperature on</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Air fluorescence studies at the Pierre Auger Observatory</field><field name="creator">Clay, Sarah</field><field name="description">Cosmic rays measured by the fluorescence detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory contain two large sources of error; the degree of scatter created by the atmosphere and the amount of Cherenkov contamination that has been recorded by a detector. When an event is viewed in stereo, these two sources of error can be accounted for directly by using the light profiles calculated by the two detectors. In this thesis accounting for the atmospheric scatter was explored by the use of a program called AerosolMin described in Chapter 5. This program could reconstruct the scattering parameters of the atmosphere by comparing the two profiles of the light produced by an air shower, as calculated by two detectors, as they should be identical in size. When using AerosolMin it was found that only the highest energy events ( &gt; 10 [superscipt 20] eV ) could use this technique and that for the event that occurred at the GPS second of 799137161 a layer of fog was present that could not be accounted for with the simplistic atmospheric profile currently used by the reconstruction software. In Chapter 6 the Cherenkov profiles that had been miscalculated by a detector were replaced to increase the reconstruction statistics. The program that performed this replacement, FdCherenkovReplacer was most successful on events that had recorded a large amount of direct Cherenkov light. The event that occurred at the GPS second of 772256331 is explored in Chapter 7.

The design of a continuous flow pasteuriser is typically predicated on mathematical models developed from experimental data - usually batch, bench - scale, ethods. Of particular interest is the effect of combined pasteuriser temperature ( T ) and liquid pH on inactivation and survivor of contaminants. However, bench - scale thermal survivor data may not adequately mirror those in a continuous flow pasteuriser. This research presents the development and experimental validation of rigorous models for thermal pasteurisation of bacteria as affected by combined process T - pH in both batch, bench - scale capillary studies ( static ) and in a pilot continuous flow pasteuriser ( dynamic ), within a defined liquid and range of exposure time, temperature and pH ( t - T - pH ). Five integrated stages in synthesis and model analysis were undertaken using stringent criteria for goodness of fit of an adequate model established. First, four published predictive models were assessed against published static data ( n [subscript T] = 248 ) for the thermal inactivation of Escherichia coli ( ATCC 25922 ) in a Carbopol &#174; 941 liquid food simulant in batch capillaries over a range of t - T - pH. The models tested were the Classical Arrhenius, Davey Linear - Arrhenius ( D - LA ), Square - Root ( Belehradek ) and a third - order Polynomial model ( nOP ). Analysis showed the D - LA model best satisfied the criteria for model selection and explained 96.0 % V in the thermal inactivation rate coefficient. Second, the D - LA model was assessed against limited, published dynamic data ( n [subscript T] = 109 ) for the same E. coli strain in identical food simulant. The model explained 60 % V in the thermal inactivation rate coefficient. On average, model predictions of survivor numbers from the dynamic data were less than that predicted from the static data, i.e. for a given ( t - T - pH ) more bacterial cells were apparently inactivated in the continuous flow pasteuriser than in bench - scale, batch capillary studies. Overall, however it was not clear from extensive analyses of available data whether there is a statistically significant difference in survivor numbers of viable E. coli between batch static and continuous flow dynamic data. Third, although the D - LA model best satisfied the criteria for goodness of fit of a model, it failed to accurately predict the observed tails in the static survivor data. New models ( KDT and a modified KDT ) were synthesised to predict tails and shoulders in survivor data. The modified KDT ( MKDT ) form gave improved predictive capability over the KDT model when assessed against published static survivor data for E. coli and L. monocytogenes ( n [subscript T] = 355 ) in the Carbopol food simulant. This model, however, could not be readily integrated with equations describing the performance of a continuous flow pasteuriser. Analyses indicated that a greater density of dynamic survivor data for E. coli was needed. Fourth, a pilot continuous flow pasteuriser was constructed and used to generate a greater density of dynamic survivor data of E. coli ( ATCC 25922 ) in a Carbopol &#174; 941 carrier liquid for rigorous comparison with predictions from the Lin ( 1976 ) isothermal continuous laminar flow process model. Direct steam injection heating was used. Extensive dye and digital - video studies, in a section of glass holding tube confirmed the practical implementation of the assumptions of laminar flow and rapid condensation of steam. Extensive practical experiments highlighted a non - isothermal condition along the holding tube. A highly linear dependence ( R &#178; &gt; 0.90 ) of exposure temperature with holding tube length, i.e. exposure time, was demonstrated. This was accounted for using mathematical approaches and quantitatively incorporated into a D - LA model for the rate coefficient in an extended Lin process model. A block experimental design of 4 T ( 54, 56, 58, 60 &#176; C ) x 4 pH ( 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 ) x 3 replicates with a total of ( n [subscript T] = 834 ) exposure times ( 16 - 198 s ) was carried out in the pilot continuous flow pasteuriser. Findings highlighted that greater numbers of E. coli were thermally inactivated in the flow pasteuriser than predicted. From a practical operating view, the predictions from the extended Lin model were therefore conservative - with reduced risk to public health. Highly significant differences in the rates of heat - up of bacteria in the pilot pasteuriser ( dynamic ) ( 0.0104 s ) compared with that in the batch ( static ) capillary tubes ( 1.6 s ) and, mode of heat transfer, together with partial effects of dispersion with increasing length of pasteuriser holding tube, are postulated to be the controlling process influences for the difference between the experimental survivor data and the extended Lin model predictions. The lack of agreement between the continuous pasteuriser data and predictions from the extended Lin model indicated that this model cannot be practically applied. A direct comparison of the experimentally derived dynamic survivor data from the pilot pasteuriser ( as ln N / N [subscript 0] ) was also made with both the published static and dynamic data at a number of defined t - T - pH. This comparison revealed that overall, more E. coli were inactivated in the pilot continuous flow pasteuriser than described by published batch static capillary and dynamic data. Importantly, these comparisons showed that batch thermal survivor data for E. coli do not adequately mirror those obtained in continuous flow systems. Fifth, in a search for an improved model for the inactivation data, the newly derived MKDT model was assessed against the experimental pilot pasteuriser data. This model was rejected, however, because it could not account satisfactorily for all tails in survivor curves. A Weibull form model with two coefficients ( a scale factor ( &#945; ) and a shape factor ( &#946; ) ) also did not adequately predict tailing and could not be reliably extrapolated with holding time. However, a modified Weibull form, also with two model coefficients ( &#946; [subscript 0], &#946; [subscript 1] ), did give an improved fit to available experimental data. This research highlighted statistically significant differences between the dynamic thermal survivor data for E. coli and standard bench - scale static capillary data for a defined liquid and range of t - T - pH. It is likely that findings from this study can be generalised. However, validation should be carried out for a range of common indicator micro - organisms in a range of liquid foods.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">food -- microbiology, food -- effect of heat on, sterilization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long slender cylinders in axial and near-axial flow</field><field name="creator">Dekkers, Willem Arthur</field><field name="description">An experimental investigation of axial and near - axial flow over long slender cylinders, which involved both flow visualisation and hot - wire anemometry, is detailed. The investigation of this type of flow was instigated by the current interest in towed underwater sonar arrays. The need to discriminate between background noise of mechanical origin and the flow - induced noise generated on a moving underwater soundrecording device has produced a requirement for a greater understanding of the larger scale, lower frequency, turbulent flow processes in the wake and the boundary layer of a cylinder in both axial and near - axial flow. Of particular interest are any regular periodic fluid - dynamic processes. Thick axisymmetric boundary layers with the ratio of outer - layer length scale ( the boundary - layer thickness &#948; ) to cylinder radius a in the range 31 [approximately equal to or less than] &#948; / a [approximately equal to or less than] 38 and the corresponding ratio of cylinder radius to the inner - layer length scale ( the viscous length v / U [subscript &#964;] ) in the range 22 [approximately equal to or less than] aU [subscript &#964;] / v = a [superscript +] [approximately equal to or less than] 41 have been investigated. In accord with previous experimental results their mean - flow and turbulence properties are found to be strongly influenced by transverse curvature and to diverge significantly from those of flat - plate boundary layers. A characteristic feature of such thick axisymmetric layers is the occurrence of " spots " of low - speed fluid which are attributed to displacement of inner - layer fluid by large - scale turbulent cross - flows. A front of low - speed fluid which propagates radially across the boundary layer is identified as the primary large - scale, low - frequency, coherent structure within the boundary layer turbulence. A flow mechanism that describes the process by which these fronts are formulated on the basis of the experimental evidence formed from low - speed spots is obtained. The stripping of low - speed fluid from the cylinder surface by large - scale crossflows within the turbulent boundary layer is seen as an additional vorticity - and turbulence - generating mechanism, which cannot occur in a flat - plate layer. When the cylinder is yawed to the free - stream, an attached boundary layer persists over a small range of yaw angle, before flow separation occurs. In this range the boundary layer becomes extremely asymmetric, even at yaw angles less than 1 &#176;. The asymmetry and mean - flow properties of such layers have been investigated for yaw angles of 0.25 &#176; and 0.5 &#176; at several Reynolds numbers in the range 300 [approximately equal to or less than] Re [subscript a] [approximately equal to or less than] 600. At somewhat larger yaw angles, a new regime of regular vortex - shedding in near - axial flow has been identified. From the experimental results, an empirical relation for the vortex - shedding frequency ( in terms of yaw angle, vortex - shedding angle, and a Reynolds number based on the component of free - stream velocity normal to the vortex axes ) has been derived as an extension of the Roshko formula for the frequency of vortex shedding from cylinders with their axes normal to the flow. The results presented advance the current understanding of the fundamental fluid mechanics of cylinders in axial and near - axial flow, and thereby have the potential to contribute to the advancement of the signal - processing techniques applied to towed underwater sonar arrays.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shear flow, underwater acoustics, fluid mechanics, turbulent boundary layer, vortex-motion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Architectures for floating - point division</field><field name="creator">Nikmehr, Hooman</field><field name="description">Almost all recent microprocessors and DSP chips perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in hardware. However, studying their performance reveals that division is not carried out as fast as the other three operations. One investigation shows that while floating-point division, with about 3 % of the dynamic floating - point instruction count, seems to be a relatively unimportant instruction, it may cause about 40 % degradation to the overall system performance. Several mathematical algorithms have been developed over the past 50 years to perform division quickly, with high precision. However, only a few are suitable for implementation in VLSI. Among them, digit recurrence algorithms are the most widely accepted methods of performing floating - point division in the latest processors. A survey shows that out of 13 recent processors, 11 use SRT division &#185; for performing floating - point division. Investigations show that SRT division gives the best tradeoff between delay and area. Selecting SRT division for implementing floating - point division is a reasonable choice because, unlike the other class of division algorithms, i.e. functional, it produces a correctly rounded quotient conforming to the IEEE 754 standard. There are techniques for improving the performance of SRT division. Of these, increasing the speed of quotient digit selection ( QDS ), making the best balance between the radix and the redundancy factor, representing the partial remainder in a redundant form, converting the quotient from redundant to conventional form the on - the - fly and overlapping the division recurrence components are the most important. In this thesis a different method of implementing the QDS function is proposed. This approach, which is described mathematically and architecturally, is based on the new comparison multiples idea. Unlike the traditional implementation of the QDS function, which searches for the quotient digit in a lookup table, the proposed method calculates the quotient digit directly in sign and magnitude format. This approach almost halves the fan out of some critical path components, which therefore operate faster. Having received the truncated partial remainder, the QDS function compares it with truncated multiples of the divisor to find the range in which the partial remainder belongs. The results of the comparisons are converted to the magnitude of the quotient digit using simple logic called the coder. Concurrently, another circuit checks the truncated partial remainder to determine whether the quotient digit is negative. This circuit operates off the critical path since the comparison multiples based QDS function calculates the sign and magnitude of the quotient digit separately. Having applied these changes, a faster QDS function and consequently, a shorter critical path delay for the floating - point divider is obtained. Implementations of radix - 4 and radix - 16 floating - point dividers are investigated and optimised to further decrease the cycle time. The idea of comparison multiples is extended to radix 10 to implement a decimal floating - point divider complying with the IEEE 754R standard. To achieve this goal, decimal signed - digit arithmetic along with implementations of carry - free addition and subtraction are proposed. The original comparison multiples based implementation of high - radix SRT division is modified to suit radix 10. The binary and decimal implementations of comparison multiples based division are evaluated for delay. Using the method of logical effort, the radix - 4, radix - 16 and decimal floating - point dividers are found to be faster than corresponding circuits reported in the public literature. Note : &#185; SRT division is a type of non - restoring digit recurrence division.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer architecture, computer algorithms</field><field name="subject">Microprocessors</field><field name="subject">Computer architecture</field><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An algebraic formulation of quantum electrodynamics</field><field name="creator">Gaffney, Janice Margaret</field><field name="description">In 1967 Strocchi established that the quantisation of the electromagnetic field using a vector potential is impossible within the context of conventional field theory. Although this result is frequently referred to its significance is largely misunderstood. The fact that the electromagnetic field cannot be described in conventional field theory reflects more upon conventional field theory than theories of the electromagnetic field. A reappraisal of electromagnetic field theories should therefore be made. It could well be that features of these theories that have been previously regarded as deficiencies are not really deficiencies at all. This thesis is an account of the radiation gauge, Gupta - Bleuler and Fermi methods of quantising the electromagnetic field from that point of view. The radiation gauge and Gupta - Bleuler methods are well established schemes. Our discussion does not yield any results concerning these methods that cannot be found elsewhere. It does, however, serve to place them in a wider context. The Fermi method is little understood and hence most of this work is concerned with it. Even though the various formulations of field theory are by no means equivalent, they all eventually reproduce traditional field theory. Thus if we only require that the theory be rigorously formulated for such examples as the neutral scalar field it does not matter which formulation we choose. The differences are, however, important for applications to the quantisation methods of the electromagnetic field. The formulations have to be modified and the point at which such modifications must be made and their nature depends on both the general formulation and the quantisation method. The formalism that provides the most suitable framework for a rigorous formulation of the Fermi method turns out to be the C * algebra formulation of Segal. Following Segal, the Weyl algebra of the vector potential is constructed. The Fermi method is then related to a certain representation of the algebra. The representation is specified by a generating functional for a state on the algebra. Usually, dynamical and kinematical transformations are represented by unitarily implementable automorphisms of the algebra. We prove that this is not always true in the representation given by the Fermi method. The Weyl algebra of the physical field is then constructed as a factor algebra. Difficulties with both the Fermi and Gupta - Bleuler methods can he attributed to the need to use a factor algebra. The canonical commutation relations [ x [ subscript ] &#181; , p [ subscript ] &#957; ] = - i g [ subscript ] &#181; [ subscript ] &#957; are formulated as a Weyl algebra. We study the Schr&#246;dinger representation of the algebra and find that the Fermi method is just the generalisation of this representation to an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Further analogies are also possible. We can construct factor algebras from the Weyl algebra. The mechanics of such procedures can he studied without the additional complications of an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The Schr&#246;dinger representation of the Fermi method is then constructed. We conclude with a discussion of the results that have been obtained and an indication of ways in which the work might be extended.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics, mathematical analysis, quantum electrodynamics mathematics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geographic classification of wines using Vis-NIR spectroscopy</field><field name="creator">Liu, Liang</field><field name="description">The determination of wine authenticity and the detection of adulteration are attracting an increasing amount of attention for wine producers, researchers and consumers. Wine authentication and classification based on geographical origin has been widely studied. Most of these studies have achieved successful classification results. However, these studies have involved complicated and expensive procedures. Visible and near infrared spectroscopy (Vis-NIR) is recognized as a rapid and non-destructive technique. In recent years, several studies have been conducted using Vis-NIR spectroscopy to analyze wine for both quantitative and qualitative purposes. The aim of this research was to investigate the geographical classification of wines using Vis-NIR spectroscopy. The effect of temperature and measurement mode (transmission and transflectance) on Vis-NIR spectra was investigated to identify optimal conditions for wine sample analysis. It was found the optimal temperature is between 30 to 35&#176;C and the shorter pathlength measurement condition has better prediction ability. Classification by geographical origin using Vis-NIR spectroscopy was investigated for sixty-three Tempranillo wines from Spain and Australia, and fifty Riesling wines from Australia, New Zealand and Europe. Discriminant partial least square regression (DPLS) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on PCA scores were used to perform classification. Over 90% of the Tempranillo wines were correctly classified according to their geographical region using both DPLS and LDA. A classification rate of 72% was achieved for the Riesling wines. Vis-NIR technique provides a similar degree of reliability on wine classification comparable to those obtained using chemical composition. The results of this study demonstrate potential for Vis-NIR spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis as a rapid method for classifying wines by geographical origin.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wine and wine making Analysis</field><field name="subject">Wine and wine making Chemistry</field><field name="subject">Spectrum analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Penser l'&#233;cran sonore : les th&#233;ories du film parlant</field><field name="creator">McCann, Mark</field><field name="description">The thesis, entitled Penser l'&#233;cran sonore : les th&#233;ories du film parlant ( Thinking the sound screen : theories of the talking film ) aims to provide at once a survey and critique of such theories as have explicitly addressed themselves to film conceived of in its essence as a carrier of acoustically produced meaning. This position would seem to be the merest commonplace, however, review of the literature will show that the study of the cinematic sound object as such was hardly carried out in any systematic manner before the 1980s and the groundbreaking work of Rick Altman, Michel Chion, and Claudia Gorbman. Perhaps the most simple manner of illustrating previous theoretical approaches to this topos would be to indicate the " polar " extremes which mark the limits of the discursive space within which their coverage is inscribed - pessimism and mourning for the silents ( Bal&#225;sz ), dizzying mysticism ( Eisenstein ), Marxian ideological analysis ( Adorno and Eisler ), and various practical suggestions for filmmakers of the type proposed by Reisz and Spottiswoode. The thesis is divided into three along the familiar lines of sound qua sound - concerning that which is valid for all types of sound in the cinema - the voice in cinema, and cinema music. The main approaches to these objects can be similarly broadly characterised as semiological, second - wave semiological, ( i.e. semiology plus psychoanalysis ), cognitivist, and technopragmatic. The intention is to interrogate the merits and the defaults of these approaches by applying them to a range of problematics arising in the three areas listed above. It would of course be ideal if all approaches were to deal with identical questions, however, the internal dynamics of the various methodologies evidently privilege the framing of one question over another : in my opinion this presents its own interest, as the questions which can ( and, perhaps more importantly, cannot ) be posed within a given discursive structure are most revealing of the theoretical framework itself. The importance of cinema sound considered as representation rather than as simple transcription is insisted upon throughout. The limits of multichannelling are established as not greatly extending those already established by stereo. The practice of direct sound - of sound recorded on location or on set in real time - is found to have a distinctly theological dimension. The notion of subjective time as it is experienced by the spectator in the cinema is examined at length. A prominent feminist model of the functioning of sound in the cinema is found to be most unsteady. Finally, an aesthetic of the sound film which utilises the potential of the medium to the highest degree is proposed. A consideration of the lacunae in the field - which remain possibilities for further study - and an extensive bibliography complete the survey.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cinematography, motion pictures, sound effects, acoustics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myth and alchemy in creative writing: an exegesis accompanying the novel: ' Children of the Earth '</field><field name="creator">Walton, Gwenneth</field><field name="description">The novel Children Of The Earth is about transformation. It uses Ovid's Metamorphoses as a metaphor for the processes which occur in the psyche of each character, and is based on Jungian insights into myth and alchemy. Archetypes that underlie the unconscious processes of all humanity are seen in the symbolism of three very different religious traditions, namely Greek mythology, the Hebrew Old Testament and Australian Aboriginal beliefs. I explore the ways in which these three great mythologies might have converged in colonial South Australia. The story deals with the troubled marriage of isolated settler couple, Hestia and Adam George, and the effects on it of three people who come into their lives. Itinerant German mineralogist Johannes Menge ( based on a real life pioneer ) is a self-taught, eccentric polymath, and a devout but unorthodox exponent of the Bible. In Jungian terms he fulfils the role of an archetypal, but flawed, ' Wise Old Man'. Menge represents nineteenth century Protestantism, albeit still trailing some arcane superstitions. His prot&#233;g&#233;, a disgraced young teacher of classics, calls himself Hermes, and represents the role of Greek mythology in European civilization. Reliving the life of the mercurial god in the antipodes, he becomes messenger, trickster and seducer. Unatildi, an Indigenous girl whom Adam finds in a burnt-out tree trunk, is an archetypal maiden. She introduces the Europeans to the mythology of their new land, as sacred for her people as the Bible is for Johannes Menge. Each of these three characters plays a part in transforming the marriage of Adam and Hestia, and each, in turn, undergoes a personal metamorphosis. Aboriginal women act as midwives at the birth of the love-child of Hestia and Hermes. Named Sophia, after the goddess of wisdom, the new child is thought to have inherited the miwi spirit of Unatildi's lost infant. On his deathbed, as Menge bequeaths his wisdom to his Australian friends, he predicts that Sophia will understand the sacredness of all spiritual life. Eventually Hestia and Adam find themselves changed by their encounters with the archetypes of myth. News of Menge's death on the goldfields gives them the courage they need to begin rebuilding an honest relationship. The novel is 107,400 words in length and is accompanied by an exegesis of 20,170 word, entitled Myth And Alchemy In Creative Writing. The exegesis describes the interactive process of researching and writing, as well as exploring the value of Jungian concepts for creative writing, and current issues of creating Indigenous characters. There is an emphasis on the Jungian approach to mythology and alchemy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">myth in literature, mythology in literature, psychoanalysis and literature, archetype (psychology) in literature, Aboriginal Australians in literature, alchemy in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of blackleg disease of canola, caused by Leptosphaeria maculans</field><field name="creator">Naseri, Bita</field><field name="description">Blackleg, caused by L. maculans, is of major economic importance in the canola growing areas of Australia. The aim of this research was to gain information about factors affecting the epidemiology of blackleg in south - eastern Australia. The effect of temperature on a number of aspects of the life cycle of L. maculans was studied in a controlled environment. Germination of ascospores was greater on agar and cotyledons than on leaves, on susceptible cultivars than resistant cultivars, and at 15 and 20 &#176;C than at 5 and 10 &#176;C. Elongation of germ tubes was greater at higher than lower temperatures and generally greater on cotyledons than on leaves of the cultivars after incubation for 24 h at 10 - 20 &#176; C. Temperature had a greater influence than plant organ or cultivar on ascospore germination and the elongation of germ tubes. Temperature, wetness duration, cultivar and leaf position ( leaves 1 - 3 ) influenced the incubation period of L. maculans on canola. Ascospores infected six canola cultivars over 10 - 20 &#176; C following leaf wetness duration of 16 - 72 h. Incubation period ( from inoculation to the appearance of first lesions ) was generally shorter at higher temperatures and following longer wetness periods. Incubation period decreased with increasing leaf age, regardless of the blackleg - resistance rating of the cultivars. Pseudothecia developed on naturally infested canola stubble incubated at 5 - 20 &#176; C under continuous wetness and a 12 h photoperiod. The time taken for pseudothecia to mature after harvest, ranged from 58.3 days at 5 &#176; C to 22.2 days at 15 &#176; C. Fewer pseudothecia developed on stubble incubated in darkness at 15 &#176; C than in light. Pseudothecia took longer to mature when wetness was interrupted than continuous. More ascospores were released at 20 &#176; C than 5 - 15 &#176; C, although peak sporulation occurred earlier at 5 - 10 &#176; C. Discharge of ascospores continued for 8 h at 5 - 10 &#176; C, for 10 h at 15 &#176; C, and for 12 h at 20 &#176; C. The effect of burial of infested canola stubble in sand and field soil ( in pots ) on pathogen survival, pathogenicity and stubble - associated fungi was studied over 13 months in ambient conditions. The isolation frequency of L. maculans from stubble decreased by 63.3 % after 13 months of burial, regardless of soil type. Although the frequency of isolation of L. maculans and Alternaria spp. from stubble decreased over time, that of Stachybotrys chartarum, Fusarium spp. and Coprinus sp. increased substantially over the sampling period. Stubble buried in field soil underwent more decay than in sand over the 13 months. Pseudothecium formation on buried stubble decreased with increasing duration of burial and ceased after 11 months in the field soil and 13 months in sand. The time required for pseudothecia to mature was 25 days for stubble retrieved after one month and 30 days when retrieved 10 months after burial, regardless of soil type. Ascospores from the stubble recovered from burial caused typical Phoma leaf spots on canola over the first 9 months of burial. Over the year, 16 genera of fungi and 12 colony types of bacteria were isolated from the field soil on peptone - rose bengal agar ( PRA ) and on crystal violet agar ( CVA ), respectively. Populations of fungi and bacteria isolated on soil - extract agar were markedly greater than those on PRA and on CVA, respectively. Growth and sporulation of L. maculans on agar media and on infested canola stubble was affected by a variety of fungi obtained from stubble buried in soil or from field soil. Antagonistic activities observed included lysis, deformation, overgrowth and inhibition of L. maculans hyphae, and reduction of pseudothecium density on stubble to one - third or less than that on controls following inoculation with F. equiseti, Gliocladium roseum, Trichoderma aureoviride, Sordaria sp. and an unknown Coelomycete. S. chartarum and Coprinus sp. reduced the mass of canola stubble in vitro. Findings will contribute to a better understanding of blackleg and to the development of more effective control measures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Canola Australia</field><field name="subject">Fungal diseases of plants</field><field name="subject">Phytopathogenic fungi</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability in municipal solid waste management in Bamenda and Yaounde, Cameroon</field><field name="creator">Achankeng, Eric</field><field name="description">In Cameroon, and most other developing countries, the problem of inefficient municipal solid waste management ( MSWM ) is endemic. This is easily identified by persistent heaps of uncollected waste found on street sides or ubiquitous illegal dumps. This thesis examines the sustainability of MSWM in Cameroon using two contrasting city cases of Yaound&#233; ( 1.5m people ) and Bamenda ( 300 000 people ). As major contributions the thesis generates the much - needed basic original data, critically examines and compares the sustainability of MSWM in both cities ' systems, evaluates the environmental impacts and uses these findings to suggest valuable research, policy and strategic - planning recommendations needed to make both systems, and others in similar situations, sustainable. To achieve these goals multiple triangulated methods were used. In Bamenda, where reliable basic data are non - existent, solid waste from sampled households was collected and analysed for generation rates, quantities and characteristics. In both cities questionnaire were administered to sampled household units selected from four stratified quarters. The survey questions addressed waste management issues and sustainability indicators that were needed to study, compare and evaluate the systems within the wider concept of the waste management hierarchy. The statistical programme for social sciences ( SPSS ) computer software was used to analyse the survey results. Field observations, interviews and a review of secondary sources complemented the data. New findings show that Bamenda city generates 120 - 160 tonnes of municipal solid waste daily ( 0.40-0.54 kg per capita ), 76 % of which is biodegradable and 24 % non - biodegradable. About 90 % of all solid waste comes from households. Bamenda Urban Council ( BUC ) regularly covers only 1 / 20th of the city area and collects and transports 20 - 30 tonnes of waste from its skips, accounting for only 17 - 25 % of the total daily waste generation. The waste is disposed of at an uncontrolled dump on the Mezam River flood plain. The citizens illegally dump the rest. Skips are crucial to the system but their total capacity and access are grossly inadequate ( 37m &#179; over 28 sites ), with a further 465m &#179; needed. Citizens move an average of 105 m to waste disposal sites. This suggests a sustainable inter - skip distance of 210 m for Bamenda city, far from the present 700 m. Yaound&#233; ' s daily per capita MSW generation rate is estimated at 0.79 kgs or 1200 tonnes for the entire city, three - quarters of which is biodegradable. Only one - third of the city area is regularly served with about 40 - 50 % ( ~ 540 tonnes ) of the waste collected and disposed of at the sanitary landfill on the Nfoulou River valley. Total available skip capacity is 1440m &#179; with 3048m &#179; lacking. The primary waste disposal average distance is 87 m. Yaound&#233; and Bamenda cities are unique in physical conditions and status but neither is able to deal adequately with the increasing waste generation rates, quantities and varieties that are driven by rapid urban population growth, spatial expansion and improved affluence and consumption among selected groups. Yaound&#233; ' s management has an edge over Bamenda ' s in terms of performance rates but leaves behind five times more uncollected and illegally dumped waste than Bamenda. Though Yaound&#233; ' s system is private and Bamenda ' s is public, both systems apply the same conventional approach that concentrates on imported technologies while neglecting waste prevention, recycling, safe disposal, involvement and integration of citizens and other stakeholders. This limited and monopolistic approach makes the system unworkable and equally creates huge environmental and health - related problems present at all the stages of the waste management cycle. Government devolves the waste function to urban councils but centralises funds and power. Its waste policies are limited, fragmented and confusing. The garbage tax law yields only 5 % in Bamenda and 7 % in Yaound&#233;, making both cities rely heavily on extra financial support from Cameroon and abroad. In all, neither city in the study demonstrates sustainability in any aspects of its MSWM system. The existing systems are not sustainable. A new system based on an integrated sustainable model operated within the context of good urban governance is proposed. This model accommodates the uniqueness of cities and is recommended for other cities in the country, Africa and the developing world.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sewage, waste products, refuse collection, recycling (waste etc.)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetic studies of some solid-state reactions of metal sulfides</field><field name="creator">Wang, Haipeng</field><field name="description">This thesis is submitted as a portfolio of peer-reviewed publications.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">monosulfide solid solution, metal sulfides</field><field name="subject">Metal sulphides</field><field name="subject">Chemical kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polar middle atmosphere dynamics</field><field name="creator">Dowdy, Andrew J.</field><field name="description">The dynamics of the polar mesosphere and lower thermosphere ( MLT ) is investigated using MF radars at Davis ( 69 &#176; S, 78 &#176; E ), Syowa ( 69 &#176; S, 40 &#176; E ) and Rothera ( 68 &#176; S, 68 &#176; W ) in the Antarctic, and Poker Flat ( 65 &#176; N, 147 &#176; W ) and Andenes ( 69 &#176; N, 16 &#176; E ) in the Arctic. Mean winds and gravity waves are investigated on a climatological scale and also during sudden stratospheric warmings. Mean wind climatologies in the MLT show differences that are often hemispheric in nature. For example, summer peaks in westward and equatorward winds occur earlier ( closer to the solstice ) in the Antarctic than in the Arctic. The greater symmetry around the solstice of phenomena such as these indicates that radiative effects may play a greater role in controlling the state of the Antarctic MLT than in the Arctic, where dynamical effects might be more important. Gravity wave observations are consistent with this theory, suggesting more wave drag may occur in the Arctic MLT. The equatorward jet persists for about 2 weeks later in summer in the Arctic than in the Antarctic, as do satellite observations of polar mesospheric clouds ( PMCs ) ( a temperature dependent phenomenon ). It is proposed that the meridional winds can be used as a proxy for gravity wave driving and consequent adiabatic cooling in the MLT. VHF radar observations of polar mesospheric summer echoes ( PMSEs ) at Davis, and the satellite PMC observations, both occur at a similar time to the equatorward jet. Seasonal variations in gravity wave activity are generally a combination of annual ( with winter maxima and summer minima ) and semi - annual ( with maxima near the solstices and minima near the equinoxes ) components. The winter maxima and spring / summer minima both occur about 3 weeks later in the Antarctic than in the Arctic, with the difference in magnitude between these extrema being about 90 % larger in the Antarctic. The available MF radar data include six major sudden stratospheric warmings in the northern hemisphere, and the unprecedented southern event which occurred during 2002 splitting the Antarctic ozone hole apart. Three of the six northern events are relatively weak and could almost be classed as minor warmings, while the larger three are similar in strength and duration to the southern event. Gravity wave activity reduces dramatically at Davis during the southern event, but not at Syowa ( possibly due to differences in critical level filtering ). The influence of major warmings on mesospheric gravity wave strength and polarisation varies significantly between locations, and individual events. Zonal wind reversals associated with the large major warmings are all weaker and occur earlier in the mesosphere than in the stratosphere. Another hemispherically common response is zonal wave - 1 planetary wave signatures in the mesospheric meridional winds ( i.e., a flow over the pole ). The planetary wave signatures have 14 - day periodicity and are westward propagating leading up to the southern event. The zonal winds are weaker than average during the 2002 southern winter, and also during the transition to the summer circulation. This is not seen for the large northern major warmings. There appears to be both hemispheric similarities and differences in polar middle atmosphere dynamics during stratospheric warmings, and also on a climatological scale.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meteorology and atmospheric dynamics, atmosphere observations, polar regions, Antartica Artic regions,</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electromagnetic properties of baryons from lattice QCD</field><field name="creator">Boinepalli, Sharada</field><field name="description">Electromagnetic properties of the octet and decuplet baryons are calculated in quenched QCD on a 20 &#179; x40 lattice with a lattice spacing of 0.128 fm using the fat - link irrelevant clover ( FLIC ) fermion action. FLIC fermions enable simulations to be performed efficiently at quark masses as low as 300 MeV. By combining FLIC fermions with an improved conserved vector current we ensure that discretization errors occur only at &#927; ( &#945; &#178; ) while maintaining current conservation. Magnetic moments, charge radii and magnetic radii are extracted from the electric and magnetic form factors for each individual quark sector. From these the corresponding baryon properties are constructed. Our results for the octet baryons are compared with the predictions of Quenched Chiral Perturbation Theory ( Q &#967; PT ) and experimental values where available. Results for the charge radii and magnetic moments of the octet baryons are in accord with the predictions of the Q &#967; PT, suggesting that the sum of higher order terms makes only a small contribution to the chiral expansion. The regime where chiral physics dominates remains to be explored. We establish the non - analytic behavior of the charge radii and magnetic moment in the case of octet baryons. The neutron charge radius suggests that the chiral regime is still far away. We establish substantial environment sensitivity in the quark behavior in the low mass region. We establish that the u and d quarks make substantial and important contribution to the magnetic moment of the &#923; contradicting the predictions of the Simple Quark Model. We present the E0 and M1 form factors of the decuplet baryons and the charge radii and magnetic moments. We compare the decuplet baryon results with the lattice calculation of charge radii and magnetic moments of octet baryons. We establish that the environment sensitivity is far less pronounced in the case of the decuplet baryons compared to that in the octet baryons. A surprising result is that the charge radii of the decuplet baryons are generally smaller than that of the octet baryons. Magnetic moment of the &#916; + shows a turn over in the low quark mass region, making it smaller than the proton magnetic moment. This is consistent with the expectations of the Quenched Chiral Perturbation Theory. A similar turn over is also noticed in the magnetic moment of the &#8721; * [superscript 0], but not for &#926; * where only kaon loops can appear in Quenched QCD. We present results for the higher order moments of the decuplet baryons, i.e., the electric quadrupole moment E2 and the magnetic octupole moment M3. With these results we provide the first conclusive analysis which shows that decuplet baryons are deformed. The electric quadrupole moment of the The electric quadrupole moment of the &#937; &#8254; baryon is postive when the negative charge factor is included, and is equal to 0.014 &#177; 0.0005 fm &#178;, indicating an oblate shape.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lattice theory, octet decuplet baryons, quantum chromodynamics QCD</field><field name="subject">Lattice field theory</field><field name="subject">Quantum chromodynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maternal overnutrition and the regulation of energy balance and appetite before and after birth</field><field name="creator">Muhlhausler, Beverly Sara</field><field name="description">Based on a large series of epidemiological studies, it has been proposed that exposure to an increased nutrient supply before birth increases the risk of developing obesity in postnatal life. The physiological mechanisms underlying the association between increased nutrition before birth and later obesity are, however, poorly understood. This thesis has investigated the impact of an increased fetal nutrient supply on the programming of key systems within the appetite - regulating network and / or the adipocytes before and after birth. The studies in this thesis have demonstrated that plasma concentrations of the adipostatic hormone leptin are directly related to adiposity and the size of adipose cells in fetuses of ewes fed at or above maintenance energy requirements, which suggests that leptin may act as a peripheral signal of fat mass before birth. It has also been demonstrated that the components of the central network for appetite regulation are expressed in the hypothalamus of the fetal sheep from at least 110 d gestation ( term = 150 &#177; 3 d gestation ), and that the expression of the appetite - regulating neuropeptides is responsive to signals of increased nutrient supply before birth. This thesis has also demonstrated that an increase in maternal nutrition in late pregnancy results in increases in both food intake and glucose concentrations in the lamb in early postnatal life and in a significant increase in subcutaneous adiposity on postnatal day 30. Importantly, increased maternal nutrition resulted in an altered relationship between signals of increased fat mass and nutrition and expression of a central appetiteinhibitory neuropeptide, CART, in the lamb hypothalamus. It was also demonstrated that there was an interaction between the prenatal and postnatal nutritional environments in the determination of lipogenesis in the early postnatal period. The findings presented in this thesis provide evidence that programmed changes to the sensitivity of the appetite - regulating neuropeptides to signals of increased adiposity and nutritional status in early postnatal life are an important part of the physiological pathway through which exposure to an increased nutrient supply before birth may lead to an increased risk of obesity in later life.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fetal growth, lambs growth, human obesity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of nitrogen in limiting the abundance of animals / by T.C.R.

The design of a multi-carrier system,such as an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system, enables high system capacity suited for these wideband wireless services. This system capacity can be further optimised with a resource allocation scheme by exploiting the characteristics of the wireless fading channels. The fundamental idea of a resource allocation scheme is to efficiently distribute the available wireless resources, such as the sub-carriers and transmission power, among all admitted users in the system. In this thesis, we present the findings of the investigation into the impact of several resource allocation schemes in an OFDMA environment. We show that in an OFDMA environment without the consideration of sub-carrier assignment, the sub-optimal power allocation closed-form solution can be derived via a constrained optimisation with the duality theorem. With a perfect feedback of channel condition, the proposed low-complexity algorithm that utilises the closed-form solution can maximise the sum capacity to approach near-optimal capacity. We derive the sub-optimal sub-carrier and power allocation closed-form solution via a similar constrained optimisation process. With an imperfect or outdated feedback of channel condition, the adaptive sub-carrier and power allocation scheme not only fails to improve but also further deteriorates the system throughput. We present and discuss the formation of the finite-state Markov channel. We show that by using the dynamics of the Markov channel, the channel quality can be reliably predicted in advance. We analyse via simulation the spectral efficiency achieved by this channel prediction scheme on an OFDMA system. We address the importance of fairness in resource allocation from a game-theoretic perspective. With different utility and preference functions that best describe the gain in users&#8217; throughput as more sub-carriers are allocated to the individual user, we formulate the resource allocation problem into cooperative and non-cooperative games. We study via simulation the effectiveness and fairness of the cooperative and non-cooperative resource allocation schemes on an OFDMA system. Finally, we draw conclusions on our research work and outline the future research topics in connection with our current studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Personal communication service systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A not so innocent vision: re-visiting the literary works of Ellen Liston, Jane Sarah Doudy and Myrtle Rose White (1838-1961).</field><field name="creator">Hancock, Janette Helen.</field><field name="description">Foundational narratives constitute intricate and ideologically driven political works that offer new information about the colonial moment. They present divergent and alternate readings of history by providing insight into the construction of &#8216;national fantasies&#8217; and the nationalist practice of exclusion and inclusion. White middle class women wrote a substantial body of foundational histories. They were influential mythmakers, historians in a sense, who actively manufactured compelling foundational stories of colonial possession and conquest, settler belonging and nation building. An interrogation of their writing casts fresh light on understanding how cultural discourses of national representation and identity often relied on a system of omission, misremembering and the dehumanisation of the Aboriginal peoples. This thesis examines various literary works by three little known writers, Ellen Liston, Jane Sarah Doudy and Myrtle Rose White between the years 1838-1961 and investigates how they used prescriptive ideas on race, nation, landscape, domesticity and progress to advance notions of successful settlement in South Australia. Their narratives were much more than &#8216;sentimental diversions&#8217;. They were political works that operated within white structures of power, privilege and control. They were designed to validate colonial expansion and white occupation by normalising the position of the white settler subject while simultaneously marginalising the &#8216;disorderly&#8217; Aboriginal presence. This thesis provides an analysis of these women&#8217;s novels, short stories, articles and unpublished manuscripts to reveal the unique agentive role that white women writers possessed. These authors didn&#8217;t just write to participate on the public scene and to advance women&#8217;s role as nation builders, they wrote as &#8216;politicians in print&#8217;, intent on constructing very clear ideas about social behaviour, cultural norms, national patriotism and racial hierarchies. Indeed, the concern over who rightfully belonged and who did not pervaded much of their writing, as did the derogatory scripting of others. In short, these women were assertive &#8216;nationalist managers&#8217; who had a lot to say about the creation of their &#8216;homely nation&#8217;. By applying theoretical understandings, such as the colonial rhetoric of exclusion and control, the historicisation of whiteness and the decolonisation of &#8216;national fantasies&#8217;, to these women&#8217;s narratives, this body of work builds on, and advances, new understandings of white women writers and the ethnocentric cultural assumptions which coloured their writing. It not only rediscovers previously published works but also introduces new unpublished archival material as evidence for re-conceptualising the power involved in producing and consuming women&#8217;s writing from the nineteenth and early twentieth century.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">End of the night girl: a novel.</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Amy T.</field><field name="description">v. 1 [Novel]: End of the night girl [Embargoed] -- v. 2 [Exegesis]: Navigating the kingdom of night: writing the holocaust</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian literature - 21st century - history and criticism; Creative writing</field><field name="subject">Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945), in literature.</field><field name="subject">Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945), in literature -- Moral and ethical aspects.</field><field name="subject">Genocide in literature.</field><field name="subject">Australian literature -- 21st century -- History and criticism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Socioecology and phylogeography of the Yellow-bellied Glider (Petaurus australis)</field><field name="creator">Brown, Meredeth</field><field name="description">Marsupials have complex and interesting socioecology and life history strategies that differ quite markedly to much - studied eutherian mammals. However, the socioecology and life history strategies of a number of Australian marsupials are most often observed only within the context of a much larger study on their ecology. My aim was to study, using a combination of behavioural observations and molecular DNA techniques, aspects of the socioecology of a population of yellow - bellied gliders ( Petaurus australis ) in Rennick State Forest, south - western Victoria. Petaurid gliders feed on plant and insect exudates, pollen / nectar and arthropods. Yellow - bellied gliders are arboreal, rare, nocturnal and cryptic, have persistent pair bonds, are territorial and exist in low population densities. In particular, I sought to confirm that the Rennick population of yellow - bellied gliders maintained a predominantly monogamous mating system. I also sought to confirm that the timing of reproduction in this population of yellow - bellied gliders would be seasonal, and timed to coincide with peaks in the abundances of two indices of protein food resources ( i.e. flowering and bark shed ). In a more broadscale study, I sought to examine the geographic distribution of mitochondrial haplotyes and morphological variation of the yellowbellied glider throughout its range. Polymorphic microsatellite loci are the choice of genetic marker for fine - scale studies, such as relatedness and paternity. Microsatellite loci had previously only been characterised and optimised for Petaurus norfolcensis ( squirrel gliders ). However, close inspection of the GenBank sequences revealed the presence of replicates differing only by sequencing errors. A panel of seven polymorphic tetranucleotide loci in Petaurus breviceps ( sugar gliders ) and three polymorphic trinucleotide loci in P. australis were isolated and optimised. Five P. breviceps loci were polymorphic in P. norfolcensis and two were polymorphic in P. australis. Only one P. australis locus was variable in P. breviceps and P. norfolcensis. No locus showed a deficit in heterozygotes according to Hardy - Weinberg expectations, and the large number of alleles for some of the loci confirmed their usefulness for studies in relatedness and paternity. A number of Australian arboreal marsupials have been reported to show monogamous and polygynous mating systems in different populations, but previous studies have not included genetic analyses to confirm the observations. My aim was to test the hypothesis that monogamy was the predominant mating system in a population of yellow - bellied gliders ( Petaurus australis ) in south - western Victoria. Home range overlap, cohesiveness of pairs, rates of den site co - occupancy and location of den trees within the home ranges of 13 gliders were determined via radio - tracking. A monogamous social system predominated, demonstrated by extensive home range overlap between cohabiting adult males and females ( 40 - 100 % ) and little home range overlap between adjacent territories ( &lt; 7 % ). Males spent approximately 55 % of their active time within 25m of their female partners and 55 - 85 % of their sleeping time in dens with their female partner. The paternity of all juveniles within the population was analysed using five microsatellite DNA markers. Of 37 individuals genotyped, 12 of 13 juveniles could be attributed to the resident adult male. My results suggest that social monogamy equates with genetic monogamy in this population of yellow - bellied gliders. Mammalian taxa living in seasonal environments usually coincide energy - demanding reproductive activities with the seasonal availability of food resources. However, few studies on arboreal marsupial taxa in Australia have focussed upon the interplay of forest phenology and the timing of breeding. This study examined forest phenology in a temperate environment, and the timing of reproduction the yellow - bellied glider. I captured adult females once per month between August 2001 and August 2003 to determine reproductive condition, and monitored indicators for two key food resources over the same period. Flowering phenology ( as an index of pollen availability ) was assessed in 170 manna gum ( Eucalyptus viminalis ) and brown stringybark ( E. baxteri ) trees, while bark shed ( as an index of arthropod availability ) was assessed in 45 manna gum, the only eucalypt species at this site that sheds it bark. Aseasonal reproduction was indicated within this population of gliders, as distributions of births were not statistically different from random. However, yellow - bellied gliders did exhibit distinct birth peaks in spring, summer and winter, when data were combined for both years. The temporal distributions of flowering for both eucalypt species were statistically different from random, indicating seasonal availability of nectar and pollen. Peak flowering occurred in summer for brown stringybark, and autumn for manna gum in both years, although for manna gum peak abundance of flowers was one month earlier in the second year. While the temporal distribution of bark shed on the trunks of trees did not differ from random, it did show seasonality on the main and outer branches, peaking in summer and declining thereafter. Thus, it appears that yellow - bellied gliders breed aseasonally in a predictable, seasonal environment. However, yellow - bellied gliders have a reliance on the complex temporal interplay of different seasonal food resources. Subspecific status has often been used as a surrogate for conservation unit, but does not always reflect intra - specific lineages with different evolutionary histories. One contentious case of subspecific classification occurs in the yellow - bellied glider, a marsupial species showing considerable decline in population size and requiring conservation management. Our aim was to assess the current subspecific status of populations and define units of conservation using a combination of phylogeographical analyses of mitochondrial DNA and morphological analyses. Analyses of the mitochondrial ND4 gene provided evidence for significant phylogeographic structure within yellow - bellied gliders. Isolated populations in north Queensland ( NQ ) and Victoria / South Australia were genetically distinct from populations in New South Wales and southern Queensland. Morphological analyses provided little evidence for discrimination of populations, although NQ specimens were generally smaller in size compared to southern forms. My analyses do not support the classification of subspecies, P. a. reginae, for the original type specimen from southern Queensland. Taking into account other behavioural and ecological data, and the disjunct distribution of NQ populations from southern populations, I propose that the NQ population represents a distinct Evolutionarily Significant Unit, a lineage showing highly restricted gene flow with the rest of the species.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gliders (Mammals) Victoria Ecology</field><field name="subject">Marsupials Victoria Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the gastrointestinal tract in postprandial blood pressure regulation</field><field name="creator">Gentilcore, Diana</field><field name="description">This thesis presents studies relating to the role of the gastrointestinal tract in postprandial blood pressure regulation. The areas that have been addressed include : ( i ) the methodological approaches to the evaluation of gastric emptying, blood pressure, splanchnic blood flow, intraluminal manometry and gut hormones and ( ii ) the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying postprandial hypotension, with a particular focus on ' gastric ' and ' small intestinal ' mechanisms and their potential therapeutic relevance. All of the studies have been either published or manuscripts have been prepared for publication. While scintigraphy represents the ' gold standard ' for the measurement of gastric emptying, recent studies suggest that three - dimensional ( 3D ) ultrasonography may also allow a precise measure of gastric emptying. Concurrent scintigraphic and ultrasonographic measurements of gastric emptying of liquids were performed in healthy young volunteers. There was a good correlation and agreement between scintigraphic measurements of gastric emptying and 3D ultrasonography after ingestion of both low - and high - nutrient drinks, indicating that 3D ultrasonography, provides a valid measure of gastric emptying of liquid meals in normal subjects. Postprandial hypotension, defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of &#8805; 20mmHg,occurring within two hours of a meal is now recognised as an important clinical problem, particularly in the elderly and in patients with type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms mediating postprandial hypotension are poorly understood. The effects of variations in concentration of intraduodenal glucose on the magnitude of the fall in blood pressure were evaluated in healthy elderly subjects. Blood pressure fell, and heart rate and blood glucose increased over time during infusions, however, there was no difference in blood pressure, heart rate or blood glucose concentrations between the study days. These observations suggest that glucose induced postprandial hypotension is a load rather, than concentration, dependent phenomenon. The effect of meal composition has been reported to influence the hypotensive response to a meal and information relating to the effects of triglyceride and protein on blood pressure is inconsistent. The comparative effects of isocaloric and isovolaemic intraduodenal infusions of glucose, triglyceride and protein on the magnitude of the postprandial fall in blood pressure and rise in heart rate and superior mesenteric artery blood flow were evaluated in healthy elderly subjects. There were comparable falls in systolic blood pressure and rises in heart rate, however, the maximum fall in systolic blood pressure occurred later after triglyceride and protein and the stimulation of superior mesenteric artery blood flow was less after protein. These observations suggest that the relatively slower systolic blood pressure response after triglyceride and protein may potentially reflect the time taken for digestion of triglyceride to free fatty acids and protein to amino acids. Acarbose is an antidiabetic drug that slows both gastric emptying and small intestinal glucose absorption. The effects of acarbose, on blood pressure, heart rate, gastric emptying of, and the glycaemic, insulin, glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) and glucosedependent insulinotropic - polypeptide ( GIP ) responses to, an oral sucrose load were evaluated in healthy elderly subjects. Acarbose attenuated the fall in blood pressure and increase in heart rate induced by oral sucrose. Acarbose slowed gastric emptying and was associated with increased retention in the distal stomach. Stimulation of GLP - 1 may contribute to the slowing of gastric emptying and suppression of postprandial glycaemia by acarbose. These findings suggest that acarbose may represent a therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with postprandial hypotension. Recent studies indicate that gastric distension attenuates the postprandial fall in blood pressure. The effects of gastric distension on blood pressure and heart rate during intraduodenal infusion of glucose at a constant load and concentration were evaluated in healthy elderly subjects. Intragastric administration of water markedly attenuated the falls in systolic and diastolic blood pressure induced by intraduodenal glucose. Heart rate increased, with and without gastric distension, in response to intraduodenal glucose infusion but not after intraduodenal saline infusion. This study suggests that gastric distension may potentially be used as a simple adjunctive treatment in the management of postprandial hypotension. Studies employing nitric oxide synthase blockers have established, in animals, that nitric oxide mechanisms are important in the regulation of splanchnic blood flow and, hence, may effect postprandial blood pressure. The role of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG - nitro - L - arginine - methyl - ester ( L - NAME ), on gastric emptying, postprandial blood pressure, plasma insulin concentration and incretin hormone ( ie GIP and GLP - 1 ) release, following an oral glucose load, were evaluated in healthy elderly subjects. L - NAME attenuated the postprandial fall in blood pressure and increase in heart rate but had no effect on gastric emptying of glucose. L - NAME attenuated the glucose - induced rise in plasma insulin but had no effect on the incretin ( GIP and GLP - 1 ) hormone response to oral glucose. The study indicates that the magnitude of the fall in blood pressure and increase in heart rate and stimulation of insulin secretion induced by oral glucose in healthy elderly subjects are mediated by nitric oxide mechanisms by an effect unrelated to changes in gastric emptying, or the secretion of GIP and GLP - 1. Studies utilising 5 - hydroxytryptamine ( 5 - HT ) infusions in animals have demonstrated regional variations in intestinal blood flow suggesting a role for 5 - HT in postprandial haemodynamic responses. The effects of the 5 - hydroxytryptamine 3 ( 5 - HT3 ) antagonist, granisetron, on the blood pressure, heart rate, antropyloroduodenal motility and glycaemic responses to intraduodenal glucose infusion were assessed in healthy elderly subjects. Granisetron had no effect on blood pressure, heart rate or antral and pyloric motor responses but modulated the duodenal motor response, to intraduodenal glucose. This study indicates that while the cardiovascular response to intraduodenal glucose does not appear to be influenced by the stimulation of 5 - HT3 receptors, this receptor may be involved in the modulation of the duodenal motor activity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gastric emptying, gastrointestinal system, digestive organs, blood pressure, hypotension in old age,</field><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system</field><field name="subject">Hypotension</field><field name="subject">Blood pressure Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance of photonic oversampled analog-to-digital converters.</field><field name="creator">Clare, Bradley</field><field name="description">In an increasingly digital world, the need for high speed and high fidelity analog-to-digital (A/D) converters is paramount. Performance improvements in electronic A/Ds have not kept pace with demand, hence the need to consider alternative technologies. One such technology is photonics, as it takes advantage of optical sampling, high speed optical switches and low cross-talk interconnects. Optical sampling derives its advantage from the application of ultra low timing jitter (&lt;100fs) mode locked lasers utilised to provide high speed clock pulses. In this thesis the feasibility and simulated performance of three different types of photonic oversampled A/D converters was investigated. The first, and simplest design is that of oversampled pulse-code-modulation (PCM), where a 2-level photonic comparator is used to sample the analog input at a frequency much greater than the Nyquist frequency. Subsequent low pass filtering produces a digital representation of the input. The other two architectures that were investigated are the first-order sigma-delta and error diffusion, which add one level of error correction to the PCM technique. These two architectures require the functional elements of a subtractor, comparator and delay. The photonic comparator and subtractor functionality was provided by Self-Electro-Optic Effect devices (SEED) based upon multiple quantum well (MQW) p-i-n devices. To facilitate calculation of the performance of the different architectures and aid in device design, a simulation of SEED operation based upon experimental data was developed. The simulation&#8217;s accuracy was demonstrated by agreement with the results from experimental S-SEED switching and optical subtraction. To emphasize the utility of the model, the simulation was subsequently used to demonstrate tristability of an S-SEED and critical slowing down in a bistable S-SEED. These effects were experimentally verified. To provide enhanced comparator contrast ratio and subtractor dynamic range, resonantly enhanced microcavity multiple quantum well (MQW) p-i-n devices were designed and grown by MOCVD. The operation of the subtractor and comparator was experimentally demonstrated and utilising temperature tuning, optimised performance was achieved with devices from the same wafer. Furthermore, the inclusion of gain was shown to improve the subtractor performance to that demanded by the sigma-delta. The constraints on each architecture imposed by the unipolar nature of the light intensity were derived and the sigma delta architecture was shown to be superior to the error diffusion for a photonic implementation. Using the numerical simulation based upon experimentally derived data, the entire sigma delta architecture was simulated to calculate the expected performance. The signal-to-quantisation-noise ratio (SQNR) was calculated as a function input amplitude and a peak SQNR of 54dB was obtained for an oversampling ratio of 100.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital-to-analog converters; Analog-to-digital converters; Digital communications</field><field name="subject">Digital-to-analog converters</field><field name="subject">Analog-to-digital converters</field><field name="subject">Digital communications</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of hypoxia on respiratory sensation and reflexes in healthy subjects : implications for sleep and respiratory disease</field><field name="creator">Eckert, Danny Joel</field><field name="description">Hypoxia is a common feature of many respiratory disorders including acute severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Hypoxia also occurs during sleep - disordered breathing in conditions such as sleep hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea. In most respiratory diseases hypoxia is coupled with increased respiratory load. Compensatory protective mechanisms are activated to oppose these impediments to respiration. However, hypoxia is associated with impaired neurocognitive function and recent studies have demonstrated that hypoxia suppresses respiratory load perception in healthy individuals and asthma patients. These recent findings raise the possibility that a variety of protective physiological reflex responses to increased respiratory load may be impaired during periods of hypoxia. The effects of hypoxia on several of these protective responses and possible mechanisms of respiratory sensory depression by hypoxia are explored in the experiments outlined in this thesis. In the first study, the respiratory related evoked potential ( RREP ) was used to investigate the mechanisms underlying hypoxia - induced suppression of respiratory load sensation in healthy individuals. As a positive control the effects of hypoxia on respiratory load perception to inspiratory resistive loads were also measured. The amplitude of the first and second positive peaks ( P1 and P2 ) of the RREP were significantly reduced during hypoxia. P1 is thought to reflect the arrival of the ascending respiratory signals to the somatosensory area of the cortex. The perceived magnitude of externally applied inspiratory resistive loads was also reduced during hypoxia. These data provide further support that hypoxia suppresses respiratory load perception and suggest that this is mediated, at least in part, by suppression of respiratory afferent information prior to its arrival at the cortex. In the second study, the effects of acute sustained hypoxia on the cough reflex threshold and cough tachyphylaxis to inhaled capsaicin were explored in healthy individuals. Acute sustained hypoxia suppressed cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin. This finding raises the possibility that the cough reflex, important for protecting the lungs from inhalation or aspiration of potentially injurious substances and for clearing excess secretions, may be impaired during acute exacerbations of hypoxic - respiratory disease. In the third study, reflex responses of the genioglossus and scalene muscles to brief pulses of negative airway pressure were compared between hypoxia and normoxia during wake and sleep in healthy males in the supine position. Cortical RREPs to the same stimuli were also examined under these conditions. The genioglossus is the largest upper airway ( UA ) dilator muscle and can be reflexively augmented in response to negative UA pressure. A diminished response of this muscle during sleep has been postulated to be a contributing mechanism to obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) in individuals with an anatomically narrow UA. Cortical activation ( i.e. arousal ) to sudden airway narrowing in OSA is an important protective response to help restore ventilation during an obstructive event. In this study, genioglossus reflex responses to negative pressure pulse stimuli were maintained during mild overnight hypoxia. Conversely, reflex inhibition of the scalene muscle to the same stimuli was prolonged during hypoxia. In addition, a previously undescribed morphology of the genioglossus negative pressure reflex consisting of activation followed by suppression was observed with greater suppression during sleep than wake. The amplitude of the P2 component of the RREP was also significantly reduced during hypoxia. In summary, the potential mechanisms underlying hypoxia - induced suppression of respiratory load sensation and the effects of hypoxia on several protective respiratory responses have been investigated in healthy subjects. The potential implications of these findings for patients with hypoxic - respiratory disease are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep apnea syndromes</field><field name="subject">Sleep disorders</field><field name="subject">Respiratory organs Diseases</field><field name="subject">Anoxemia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the simultaneous influence of intrinsic and extrinsic cues: an examination of the interaction between country of origin, price and selected sensory variables.</field><field name="creator">Veale, Roberta.</field><field name="description">The research was undertaken to quantify the power of selected extrinsic (price and country of origin) and intrinsic cues (acid in chardonnay and fat in brie) on consumer evaluations of both experienced and expected product quality, and further, to measure the respective influences of objective knowledge, subjective knowledge and self-confidence on these quality assessments. The study also seeks to determine if a survey conducted measuring expectations of quality would yield comparable results with quality assessments based on actual product experience. The study was comprised of sensory experiments using full profile conjoint analysis experimental design to measure quality perception, followed by a survey where only product description profiles were provided. The analysis from both stages show findings that are remarkably similar in most respects.  Results of the sensory experiment for chardonnay show both extrinsic cues tested to be more important than acid levels, while results for the survey show price maintained the strongest influence, with comparable expectations regarding the importance of country of origin and acid. For brie (both stages) consumer opinions were consistent; with price found the most influential; and while country of origin was considered relatively important, fat levels were more influential for both groups. Whilst for chardonnay (both stages) respondents held consistent beliefs regarding each acid level tested, for brie respondents experiencing the highest level of fat held an opposite view to respondents assessing quality based on their expected liking for this type of product. The influence of knowledge (objective and subjective) and self-confidence was found to be sporadic and weak, likely due to respondents&#8217; general lack of objective knowledge in both stages of the survey. In the case of self-confidence, results are surprising given that respondents in both studies exhibited reasonably healthy degrees of self-confidence. The research provides important information to marketers seeking to exploit the most attractive aspects of their products and platform for a number of subsequent studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">country of origin, extrinsic cues, intrinsic cues, consumer knowledge, consumer self confidence</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Consumers' preferences Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics identifying young drivers at a higher risk of crashing.</field><field name="creator">Wundersitz, Lisa.</field><field name="description">In Australia and other developed countries, young drivers are more likely to be involved in crashes than older, more experienced drivers. However, not all young drivers are crash involved. There is increasing evidence within road safety literature suggesting the existence of a subgroup of young drivers with an elevated risk of crashing. The aim of this thesis was to examine characteristics of young drivers (aged 16 to 24 years) that identify those with an elevated risk of crash involvement and to validate high-risk driver subtypes among different young driver populations. Young driver interventions might be more effective if tailored to the needs and motivations of these specific subgroups of young drivers identified as being at a higher risk of crash involvement. The first of four studies examined the ability of previous driving behaviour, reflected in driver records, to identify high-risk drivers, that is, drivers deemed culpable for a fatal crash. The official driver records, both crashes and traffic offences, of drivers involved in a multiple vehicle fatal crash were tracked for five years prior to the fatal crash (N=388). This analysis was repeated for a subset of young drivers aged 16 to 24 years (n=82). Although driver records (i.e., prior drink driving offences) had some value in identifying high-risk drivers, they were not useful in identifying the subset of high-risk young drivers. The second study involved an examination of personality characteristics, motivations, driving related attitudes, and behaviours to ascertain whether they could differentiate young traffic offenders (N=336), drivers detected engaging in risky driving, from other young drivers (i.e., university students N=270). Based on a wide variety of questionnaire measures, the profile of characteristics for the offenders indicated that they were well adjusted and generally did not differ greatly from the students. However, there were notable differences on some measures related to aggression. In addition, offenders generally had less safety-oriented attitudes towards road safety issues than students. Considering that young drivers are not a homogenous group, the third and fourth studies examined whether personality characteristics and attitudes could identify different subtypes of young drivers, specifically subtypes with an elevated crash risk. The existence of subtypes was examined and validated among the two young driver populations: university students (N=270) and young traffic offenders (N=336). Based on questionnaire measures, cluster analysis identified four meaningful young driver subtypes in each of the young driver populations. High-risk young driver subtypes were more clearly differentiated among young drivers already identified by their driving record as high-risk (i.e., traffic offenders). Of significance, the high-risk young driver subtypes had a similar profile (i.e., "emotional, hostile" and "thrill-seeking") to those found in previous research. Interventions that matched the needs of these high-risk subtypes were discussed. A 12-month follow up of driver records showed that high-risk subtypes continued to be detected for more traffic offences than other subtypes, and there was a trend of greater crash involvement. It is recommended that further research follow these driver records for a number of years to allow comprehensive validation of these subtypes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automobile driver education Australia</field><field name="subject">Teenage automobile drivers Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diabetes: the challenge in burns units.</field><field name="creator">Abu-Qamar, Ma'en Zaid</field><field name="description">People with diabetes are at a greater risk of burn injuries than those without diabetes. This stems from the epidemiological profiles of the conditions and the effects of morbidities associated with diabetes. Both conditions share some similarities in terms of metabolic alterations and suboptimal immune functions which may result in poor outcomes for patients. For that reason, it is reasonable to deduce that patients with diabetes are a challenging group to manage in burns units. However, this deduction should be taken cautiously because of lack of supporting evidence. Accordingly and after consulting with clinical experts, the research in this portfolio investigated the association between diabetes and burn injuries. In particular, two different aspects of this association were investigated in two individual quantitative and descriptive inquiries. The first was a case note review of patients hospitalised with a principal diagnosis of a foot burn injury in a large tertiary hospital in South Australia from 1999 to 2004. The second study investigated management of diabetes in burns units treating adults. This study is an e-mail survey of clinical leaders of burns units in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. The clinical leaders were approached indirectly through key liaison persons in each identified unit. In the first study, outcomes for twelve subjects with and fifty-two without diabetes were described using descriptive and non-parametric statistics. In the second study, descriptive frequencies and content analysis were adopted to analyse twenty-nine responses from seventeen out of thirty burns units which participated in the study. Supporting findings in the literature, the first study showed that burn injuries among subjects with diabetes were mainly resulted from household devices. There were no statistically significant differences between subjects with and without diabetes in terms of size and depth of burn injuries and treatment received. In spite of this, there was a statistically significant association between diabetes and the experience of local post-burn complications and longer duration of hospitalisation.  The second study indicated that more than twenty-five percent of the respondents believed that multidisciplinary centres should only occasionally be involved in the process of care. Participants reported that the individual profile of each patient plays a major role in determining the management of diabetes. Additionally, it was found that the insulin sliding scale was commonly used in the management of diabetes in burns units. The association between diabetes and a burn injury is a serious issue in terms of health and cost. This association need be addressed firstly and most importantly at the prevention level; secondly through proper management of both diabetes and burns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Burns and scalds</field><field name="subject">Foot Blood-vessels Diseases Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Diabetes Complications and sequelae</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trajectory design, optimisation and guidance for reusable launch vehicles during the terminal area flight phase.</field><field name="creator">Chartres, James T. A.</field><field name="description">The next generation of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) require significant improvements in guidance methods in order to reduce cost, increase safety and flexibility, whilst allowing for possible autonomous operation. Research has focused on the ascent and hypersonic re-entry flight phases. This thesis presents a new method for trajectory design, optimisation and guidance of RLVs during the terminal area flight phases. The terminal area flight phase is the transitional phase from hypersonic re-entry to the approach and landing phase. The trajectory design, optimisation and guidance methods within this thesis are an evolution of previous work conducted on the ascent and re-entry flight phases of RLVs. The methods are modified to incorporate the terminal area flight phase through the adaption of the problem definition and the inclusion of the speed brake setting as a steering parameter. The methods discussed and developed in this thesis are different to previous methods for the terminal area flight phase as they encompass optimisation, trajectory design and guidance based on the definition of the steering parameters. The NLPQL nonlinear optimiser contained within the International Mathematics Standards Library (IMSL) is utilised for trajectory design and optimisation. Real-time vehicle guidance is achieved using the restoration steps of an accelerated Gradient Projection Algorithm (GPA). The methods used are evaluated in a three degrees of freedom (3DOF) simulation environment. To properly evaluate the programs and gain a better understanding of the terminal area flight phase, two different vehicles are utilised within this study. These vehicles are the German sub-orbital Hopper concept vehicle, a previously proposed replacement for the Ariane series of launch vehicles and the recently cancelled joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Lockheed Martin sub-orbital test bed vehicle, X-33. The two vehicles each have a terminal area flight phase, but their mission profiles and vehicle characteristics are significantly different. The Hopper vehicle is a winged re-entry vehicle, whereas the X-33 vehicle is a lifting body. The trajectory design method takes into account the initial and final conditions, in-flight restrictions such as dynamic pressure and vehicle loads as well as safety margins. The designed trajectories are evaluated to analyse the terminal area flight phase and to assist in the development of the guidance program. The guidance method is evaluated utilising an program consisting of two parts, a real world simulator with high order models and a representation of the on-board guidance computer, the predictor, which uses low order models for computational efficiency. The guidance method is evaluated against a variety of off-nominal conditions to account for dispersions within the high order real world models and common errors experienced by re-entry vehicles. These off-nominal conditions include atmospheric disturbances, winds, aerodynamic, mass, navigation, steering and initial condition errors. The results of this study include a detailed analysis of the terminal area flight phase highlighting the major influences for vehicle and trajectory design. The study also confirms the applicability of the non-linear programming method utilising the vehicle steering parameters as a viable option for trajectory design and guidance. A comparison to other available results highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TAEM; guidance; reusable launch vehicles; RLV; trajectory; Hopper; X-33; optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The principalship : a study of prescriptions, practices and perceptions within a Christian school context.</field><field name="creator">Sears, George A.</field><field name="description">The Principalship occupies a unique and defining position that influences the shape of schooling. It is the role of the school principal that has great significance for determining the quality of the education that students receive, and for securing the best outcomes from the educational enterprise in modern society. This portfolio of research explored a deeper understanding of the role of the principal via a three part investigation of the prescriptions, practices and perceptions of the principalship. In Section One, a study of the literature on the principalship was used to define the prescriptions, as a theoretical basis for understanding the principalship. Observation and personal journals were used in Section Two, to document and subsequently analyse 338 hours of day-to-day principalship practice, in five Christian schools. Section Three focussed on perception as a powerful dynamic in the field of social discourse, which has particular relevance for principalship interactions. Perceptions of the principalship from staff, parent, student and board members, in the five Christian schools, were analysed from a total of 840 survey responses. Previous studies, in the area of perceptions of the principalship, have undertaken to identify congruence in the various interest-group's perceptions of the principalship. In contrast, this study examined the perceptions of the principalship in relation to principalship prescriptions in the literature and principalship practice in the field study. The analysis of data was focussed on the nature and extent of variance and congruence between the perceptions of the principalship and the prescriptions, on the one hand, and actual practices, on the other. The results of this study established that there was variance in the prescription, practice and perception data of the principalship. Idealized concepts of the principalship, concerning curriculum and visionary leadership, were challenged by principalship practice which was overwhelmingly administrative. While patterns of perceptual congruence were identified in prescriptions of personal qualities and professional skills for the principalship, there was considerable variance in the perceptions of what the principal actually did. The perceptual variances identified were relevant not only to existing principalship practice, as regards expectations and performance assessment, but also, to the recruitment of future principalship candidates and the development of training strategies for pre-service programs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of genes involved in leukaemia and differentiation induced by activated mutants of the GM-CSF receptor &#946; subunit.</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, Brenton James</field><field name="description">Interleukin (IL)-3, IL-5 and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are cytokines that affect the growth, survival and differentiation of many cells within the haematopoietic system. The functions of these factors are mediated by membrane bound receptor complexes that are composed of specific ligand binding subunits (&#945;)and a common signal transducing subunit(h&#946;c). Constitutively activated mutants of h&#946;c have been previously identified that are able to confer factor-independent signalling in a number of haematopoietic cell lines (including FDC-P1 and FDB-1). These activated mutants fall into two classes defined by the location of the mutation and their biochemical and leukaemogenic properties. In particular, the transmembrane mutant, V449E, causes an acute myeloid leukaemia in vivo, whereas the extracellular mutants (FI&#8710; or I374N) cause chronic myeloproliferative disorders. The work described in this thesis used the activated h&#946;c mutants to uncover novel transcriptional events induced by the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor complex and to define pathways associated with proliferation and differentiation. Large-scale gene expression profiling techniques were used to investigate the genes involved in these biological processes in the murine myelomonocytic cell line FDC-P1, and the bi-potent FDB-1 myeloid cell line, which are responsive to IL-3 and GM-CSF. Membrane arrays were used to identify differences in gene expression between I374N and V449E expressing FDC-P1 cells. This technique revealed that the gene Ptpmt1 was differentially expressed between V449E and I374N, which was subsequently confirmed by Northern blotting. This finding suggested that the phosphatase encoded by Ptpmt1 may be involved in the different outcomes induced by these two h&#946;c mutants. Northern analysis also revealed Ptpmt1, Nab1 and Ddx26b to be regulated in response to human GM-CSF in FDC-P1 cells expressing human GM CSF&#945; and h&#946;c. A large-scale cDNA microarray experiment was also performed to identify genes that are selectively expressed during differentiation of FI&#8710; expressing FDB-1 cells, compared to proliferating V449E expressing FDB-1 cells over 24 hours. A comprehensive analysis approach was adopted to examine the microarray data and identify differentially expressed genes. Among the genes displaying differential expression were Btg1, S100a9, Cd24, and Ltf found to be differentiation-associated and Bnip3, Cd34, Myc, Nucleophosmin, and Nucleostemin found to be proliferation-associated. Hipk1, Klf6, Sp100, and Sfrs3 were also identified as potential transcriptional regulators during growth and differentiation. Northern analysis was used to confirm differences in expression for these 13 genes between FI&#8710; and V449E expressing FDB-1 cells. Eleven of the 13 genes examined were confirmed to be differentially expressed between FI&#8710; and V449E expressing FDB-1 cells over 24 hours. Furthermore, six genes (Btg1, Hipk1, Cd24, Cd34, Klf6 and Nucleostemin) examined over 72 hours revealed differences in gene expression at early (6-12 hours) and late (48-72 hours) time points. Cell surface expression of CD24 protein was also shown to be induced upon FI&#8710; expression or GM-CSF induced differentiation of FDB-1 cells, consistent with elevated levels of Cd24 mRNA in FI&#8710; cells over time. Based on their confirmed gene expression differences seen on the microarrays and Northern analysis, four genes (Btg1, Cd24, Klf6 and Nucleostemin) were selected for over-expression analysis in FDC-P1 or FDB-1 cells, in order to gain insights into the function of these genes. Optimisation of the retroviral infection process was performed so that the role of these genes in proliferation and differentiation could be investigated in the FDB-1 model. Such preliminary functional experiments in FDB-1 cells will enable prioritisation of the genes for further analysis of their function in primary cells. Thus, the work in this thesis describes the first use of microarrays to identify gene expression differences between h&#946;c mutants with differential activities affecting myeloid growth and differentiation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leukemia--Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Cytokines.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DHA-rich fish oil and regular moderate exercise: a combined intervention to improve cardiovascular, metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers in obesity.</field><field name="creator">Hill, Alison M.</field><field name="description">The current obesity epidemic has intensified research on lifestyle interventions aimed at combating obesity and associated cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic risk. This clustering of risk factors with obesity is known as the &#8220;Metabolic Syndrome&#8221; (MS). There is now a large body of evidence detailing the ability of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) and regular moderate exercise to independently ameliorate several CV risk factors; however the combination of these interventions may be a more effective strategy in reducing CV risk than either treatment alone. This thesis describes the independent and combined effects of supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) rich fish oil, and regular moderate exercise, on CV, metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. Sedentary, overweight volunteers (BMI &gt; 25kg/m2) with mild hypertension (140/90 &#8211; 160/100mmHg), elevated plasma triglycerides (TAG) (&gt;1.6mmol/L) or elevated total cholesterol (TC) (&gt;5.5mmol/L) were recruited in three cohorts for a 12-week intervention trial. Subjects were randomised to one of the following interventions: fish oil, fish oil and exercise, sunflower oil (placebo), sunflower oil and exercise. Subjects consumed 6 g/day of DHA-rich fish oil (26% DHA, 6% EPA; ~1.9g n-3 FA) or sunflower oil. The exercise groups walked 3 days/wk for 45 min, at 75% age-predicted maximal heart rate (HR). Outcome measures were assessed and compared across each intervention group at Weeks 0, 6 and 12, with the exception of body composition, heart rate variability (HRV) and immune functions, which were assessed at Weeks 0 and 12 only. Apart from the consumption of allocated capsules, all subjects were instructed to maintain their normal diet during the study. If not asked to exercise as part of the intervention subjects were also instructed to maintain their normal level of physical activity. Supplementation with DHA rich fish oil resulted in substantial increases in total long chain n-3 FA and DHA levels in erythrocyte membranes, accompanied by reduction of TAG, increase of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and reduction of superoxide production by stimulated neutrophils. Both the increase in HDL and the decrease in superoxide production were correlated with the change in erythrocyte DHA. Endothelium dependent arterial vasodilation (assessed by flow-mediated dilatation, FMD), HRV and HR response to exercise were also improved in subjects supplemented with the DHA-rich fish oil. Regular moderate intensity exercise, either alone or in addition to the DHA-rich fish oil supplementation, had no effect on these parameters, although it improved the compliance of small resistance arteries. Interestingly, however, both DHA-rich fish oil and regular exercise reduced body fat and these effects were additive when the interventions were combined. The change in fat mass was accompanied by an increase in fat oxidation during exercise, as measured by the respiratory exchange ratio. For the population as a whole, reductions in total and abdominal fat mass were associated with reductions in blood pressure. In summary, this study is the first to evaluate the metabolic and CV benefits that can be achieved by combining n-3 FA supplementation from fish oil and regular aerobic exercise in overweight/obese adults. While this combination did not produce any synergistic effects, several independent benefits were attained. The high compliance rate (&gt;85%) within this study indicates that this intervention is well tolerated and may therefore be sustainable in the longer term. Future research should evaluate the mechanisms underlying the n-3 FA - mediated improvements in body composition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fish oils Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Omega-3 fatty acids Health aspects.</field><field name="subject">Exercise Health aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Craniofacial growth changes in Malaysian Malay children and young adults: a cross-sectional 3-dimensional CT study.</field><field name="creator">Yusof, Asilah</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) analysis of craniofacial morphology and growth changes in Malaysian Malay subjects. A large number of CT scans (n=205) from birth to adulthood were gathered for this purpose. CT scans were obtained using a GE Lightspeed Plus Scanner. Craniofacial morphology has been analysed based on cephalometric landmarks located in three-dimensions, using specially-designed computer software. The main aims were to produce new 3D normative reference data for selected craniofacial variables in Malaysian Malays and to study growth changes in different craniofacial regions. The specific areas of investigation included: 1. Construction of craniofacial growth references (in tabular and graphical formats) for Malaysian Malays; 2. Quantitative analysis of growth changes in the craniofacial complex using linear and angular measurements derived from landmark data; 3. Comparison of craniofacial measurements between males and females to determine the extent of sexual dimorphism; 4. Quantitative analysis of the nature and extent of directional asymmetry of selected craniofacial regions; 5. Comparisons of selected variables with published data from other ethnic groups. Craniofacial morphology and growth changes were analysed using 3D osseous landmarks. A computer program, PERSONA, was used to locate and analyse the three-dimensional cephalometric landmarks. The accuracy of landmark location was assessed using double determinations. Selected measurements were derived from the landmark data to describe the morphology of different craniofacial regions, e.g. facial skeleton, cranial base and cranial vault. Normative reference data for a large number of variables covering the skull, cranial base and face at selected age categories for males and females were constructed. These data were presented in tables and scatter plots of variables against age. From the normative data collected, patterns of growth changes of different craniofacial regions in three-dimensions were also investigated. Generally, each craniofacial region showed a unique growth pattern as observed from differential growth patterns. All measurements showed size increase from infancy to adulthood. Periods of increased size differences were also noted for most variables in all regions that corresponded to the timing of mid- and adolescent growth spurts. These extensive normative reference data, specific for age categories and sexes, provide normal references against which the craniofacial morphology of individuals with craniofacial abnormalities can be compared. Clinical applications of this quantitative approach to the craniofacial skeleton should facilitate the management of craniofacial abnormalities. Following the construction of normative data and description of growth changes for different craniofacial regions, intra-populational differences were studied. This included analysis of sexual dimorphism of the craniofacial structures and an investigation of asymmetry between paired left and right measurements. Sexual dimorphism was observed for linear variables in this study. Differences in size between males and females were not very obvious during infancy as only a few variables showed significant differences. The number of variables that showed sexual dimorphism in size increased from infancy to adulthood. Sexual dimorphism in the craniofacial region was most evident during adulthood with 46% of variables displaying significant differences between the sexes. During infancy, only 3% of the variables showed significant size differences between the sexes, increasing to 7% during childhood. Magnitudes of sexual dimorphism were calculated to highlight the pattern of dimorphism in different craniofacial regions and across different ages. A small degree of directional asymmetry was noted in all of the craniofacial regions investigated. Asymmetry analysis revealed that the cranial base, face and mandible tended to be larger on the right side than the left. Other regions exhibited asymmetry but without any clear trend in direction. Asymmetry percentages were also calculated to enable the patterns and magnitudes of asymmetry in different craniofacial regions to be compared. Generally, the amount of asymmetry exhibited in the craniofacial structures for Malaysian Malays was small. Having established that differences existed within the Malay sample, craniofacial data for Malays were compared with published data for two Caucasian populations. This analysis revealed that differences exist in craniofacial morphology between different ethnic groups. Some of the differences can be discerned from childhood but many variables only display differences during adulthood. Craniofacial structures tended to be smaller in Malays than in Caucasians. The intent of this investigation has been to provide clinicians with normative values of measurements that will be useful in diagnosis, treatment planning and post-operative care of patients with craniofacial abnormalities. Important treatment goals include producing balanced cranial and facial form to approximate that of unaffected people and also improving the quality of life of patients. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to be able to recognise the nature and extent of normal variation in craniofacial structures and also appreciate the growth changes that may occur over time, before investigating these changes in patients with craniofacial abnormalities. Comparisons of measurements of affected patients with well-characterised referent data can facilitate diagnosis and overall patient management. Moreover, quantification based on three-dimensional data provides new insights into craniofacial growth changes and morphology compared with conventional 2D approaches.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Craniometry -- Malaysia.</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional imaging in biology -- Malaysia.</field><field name="subject">Skull -- Growth -- Malaysia.</field><field name="subject">Skull -- Imaging -- Malaysia.</field><field name="subject">Face -- Growth -- Malaysia.</field><field name="subject">Face -- Imaging -- Malaysia.</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic imaging -- Case studies -- Malaysia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marginal cost water pricing: welfare effects and policy implications using minimum cost and benchmarking models, with case studies from Australia and Asia.</field><field name="creator">Altmann, David</field><field name="description">Recent studies in water management policy point to insufficient recognition of water as a scarce commodity and the failure of pricing policies to account for the full economic costs of its production and supply. These costs include opportunity costs related to alternative uses of water; user costs associated with managing a scarce resource; and costs of externalities such as ground water depletion, pollution of waterways, and greenhouse gas emissions. Existing cost recovery based pricing policies may lead to inefficiencies such as excess consumption, under-investment in water infrastructure, and unnecessary subsidisation. Water scarcity can be managed in several ways. We can increase supply by investment in additional harvesting capabilities or new technologies such as desalination; we can constrain consumption so that existing supplies last longer; or we can use water in more efficient ways. As a short term measure, most countries adopt water restrictions when supplies are at critical levels. In the future, as urban population growth continues, harvesting of storm water and reuse of grey water may become part of a sustainable water management strategy. Water trading can be used to move water to where the marginal benefits are highest. Considerable water savings are possible through the use of more efficient industrial and domestic appliances. There is evidence in some countries that higher water tariffs have reduced consumption and promoted awareness of conservation. If we accept that water is an economic good, then we need to understand the costs related to its production, the patterns of its use, and the benefits received by different users. This thesis is an examination of theoretical and applied aspects of urban water pricing based on analysis of cost, demand, and welfare. We present theoretical models of cost that include economies of scale as a parameter, and a model of water demand by households with heterogeneous preferences. We determine marginal cost at the efficient level of output based on a partial equilibrium of supply and demand. We also show that when water is produced with increasing returns to scale, the efficient price will be insufficient to recover all costs, and therefore a form of second best pricing is required. We contrast conventional notions about water suppliers being cost minimisers with an alternative frontier model of cost efficiency. Two case studies examine the provision of water services under different forms of ownership. The first case study examines the provision of water to domestic households in the state of Victoria, Australia. The second case study examines the supply of water to the residents of Manila, one of the world&#8217;s largest cities that privatised its water service in 1997 under a form of concession agreement. A third case study derives an efficient cost frontier for a sample of water utilities from Asia and Australia and proposes a form of best practice pricing. The thesis concludes with a summary of the main results and policy conclusions, and ideas for future research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Water supply -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An approach to rural suicide.</field><field name="creator">Fleming, Graham.</field><field name="description">Suicide rates have been relatively constant in Australia for over a hundred years, albeit peaking in 1997 and since returning towards historically average levels. Suicide now represents the commonest cause of violent deaths and exceeds deaths from motor vehicle accidents and armed conflict. There have been a number of national programs following the lead of Finland in the 1980s. Modern research has clearly demonstrated many of the risk factors, but they lack specificity in terms of prediction, and therefore the numbers needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of any intervention are particularly daunting. This makes research problematic and it is probably impossible to ever get Level 1 evidence because of the large numbers and expense required. Therefore many research studies are either epidemiologically oriented or directed to crisis care and treatment algorithms. Rural suicide presents particular challenges because of the increasing numbers of young and elderly men who take their lives, the lack of services available locally and the paucity of research in rural societies, with it usually being confined to examining risk factors and comparing them with urban populations. This thesis describes an approach to rural suicide which, whilst cognisant of the broad range of risk factors, was more directed to tackling poor mental health on a community basis, utilising local resources. It used four main approaches: educating the community to enhance mental health literacy by appreciating the causes of poor mental health; building the social capital or community capacity of existing resources; emphasising early identification and intervention of problems; and the establishment of a community child and adolescent program based in the local school, but with close liaison with the local medical practitioners. The educative approach to mental health literacy was to engage the whole community as widely as possible with special programs for general practitioners, nurses, and teachers; community capacity and social capital were increased by teaching the community warning signs, techniques to engage and refer to known entry points into the system; early identification was undertaken by screening for poor mental health within the doctors&#8217; office, the hospital and the school; and a child and adolescent program was devised to detect dysfunctional students, formulate an assessment and management plan, and then evaluate the outcome. The most important results were a statistically significant reduction of suicides from twelve in ten years to one in the following decade, as well as a statistically significant reduction in the number of suicide attempts. In addition there was the establishment of a primary mental health service within the community which was independent of specific government finance and resources.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural; community; suicide; mental health; child and adolescents</field><field name="subject">Rural health South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Suicide South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Mental health Environmental aspects.</field><field name="subject">Mental illness Environmental aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser diagnostics in MILD combustion.</field><field name="creator">Medwell, Paul R.</field><field name="description">Despite mounting concerns of looming global warming and fuel shortages, combustion will remain the predominant source of fulfilling the world&#8217;s ever-increasing demand for energy in the foreseeable future. In light of these issues, the combustion regime known as Moderate and Intense Low oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion has the potential of offering increased efficiency whilst lowering pollutant emissions. Essentially, MILD combustion relies on the reuse of the exhaust gases from the combustion process to simultaneously dilute the oxygen concentration of the oxidant stream, and increase its temperature. The benefit of this technique is that it results in a vast reduction in emissions, especially oxides of nitrogen. In addition, the thermal efficiency of the combustion process is increased, reducing fuel demands, as well as producing a more uniform heating profile and subsequently better product quality for many applications. The recirculation of exhaust gas and heat has been utilised for applications in the past. MILD combustion aims to extend the advantages of heat recovery and exhaust gas recirculation beyond the boundaries that are otherwise possible using conventional techniques. The relatively new concept of MILD combustion is a major advancement to the previous technology, and many fundamental issues have not yet been resolved. In a furnace environment, the dilution and preheating of the reactants generate a unique &#8220;distributed&#8221; reaction zone. There is a need to better understand the structure of this combustion regime and the parameters which control it. To emulate MILD combustion conditions in a controlled experimental environment, a Jet in Hot Coflow (JHC) burner is used in this study. The MILD combustion regime is examined using laser diagnostic techniques. The two key flame intermediates hydroxyl radical (OH) and formaldehyde (H2CO), as well as temperature, are imaged simultaneously to reveal details relating to the reaction zone. Simultaneous imaging enables not only the spatial distribution of each scalar to be investigated, but also the combined effect of the interactions of the three measured scalars. The role of four key variables are investigated as part of this work, namely; the coflow oxygen (O2) level, the jet Reynolds number, fuel dilution and fuel type. Also considered is the effect of surrounding air entrainment into the hot and diluted coflow, which causes a deviation from MILD combustion conditions. The local oxygen (O2) concentration is a key parameter in the establishment of MILD combustion conditions. The effect of lowering the O2 level is to lead to reductions in the OH and temperature in the reaction zone, in effect leading to a less intense reaction. When comparatively high oxygen laden, cold surrounding air mixes with the hot and low O2 coflow, MILD combustion conditions no longer exist. In this case, the flame front can become locally extinguished and subsequent premixing with the high O2 concentrations can lead to increased reaction rates and hence higher temperatures. It is therefore essential that fresh air must be excluded from a MILD combustor to maintain the stable reaction which typifies MILD combustion. It is found that the flame structure is relatively insensitive to both the type of hydrocarbon fuel and the Reynolds number. Each of these parameters can lead to changes in some intermediate species, namely formaldehyde, yet the OH and temperature measurements show comparatively minor variation. Nevertheless, fuel type and Reynolds number, in the form of increased flow convolution, can lead to striking differences in the flame structure. One of the most prominent effects is noted with the dilution of the fuel with various diluents. Some of the flames visually appear lifted, whereas the measurements reveal the occurrence of pre-ignition reactions in the &#8220;lifted&#8221; region. The unique characteristics of the stabilisation for these particular cases has lead to the term transitional flames. The fundamental aspects discovered by this study shed new light on the reaction zone structure under MILD combustion conditions. By advancing understanding of MILD combustion, future combustion systems will be able to better utilise the efficiency increases and lower pollutant benefits it offers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">combustion; MILD; vitated flow; non-premixed flames; turbulent flames</field><field name="subject">Combustion.</field><field name="subject">Flames.</field><field name="subject">Fuel.</field><field name="subject">Combustion engineering.</field><field name="subject">Combustion -- Research.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Substrate deprivation as a novel therapy for the mucopolysaccharidoses.</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Ainslie Lauren Kemp</field><field name="description">Reduction of an enzyme required for the lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycan (gag) chains will result in a mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) disorder. Substrate deprivation therapy (SDT), a new therapy option for MPS, aims to reduce the synthesis of gag chains, the natural substrate for the deficient enzyme. Reduced substrate levels would balance the reduced level of enzyme in patient cells resulting in normalised gag turnover. Rhodamine B, a non-specific inhibitor, reduced gag synthesis in a range of normal and MPS cells and also decreased lysosomal storage of gag in MPS VI (72%) and MPS IIIA (60%) cells. This positive response in vitro was extended to an in vivo therapy trial in the MPS IIIA mouse. Bodyweight gain of male MPS IIIA mice treated with 1 mg/kg rhodamine B was reduced compared to untreated MPS IIIA mice and was indistinguishable to that of normal mice. Liver size, total gag content and lysosomal gag was reduced in treated MPS IIIA animals as was urinary gag excretion. The alteration in MPS IIIA clinical pathology by rhodamine B combined with the observation that treatment had no effect on the health of normal animals demonstrates the potential for this type of therapy for MPS disorders. The water cross maze was found to be the only learning and memory test capable of detecting differences in learning behaviour in MPS IIIA and normal untreated mice. MPS IIIA mice treated with SDT rhodamine B showed an improved outcome with better learning capabilities than MPS IIIA untreated mice observed using this test. This means that rhodamine B is likely to cross the blood-brain barrier. These results are the first evidence of a positive response by the CNS to a systemic therapy for MPS IIIA. Rhodamine B administration over 4 generations did not produce any deleterious side effects in MPS IIIA. In utero therapy over four generations did not cause a reduction in litter size or bodyweight profile demonstrating that reduction of gag over a combined timeframe of two years was safe. A higher dose of 5 mg/kg rhodamine B did not produce any additional benefits on MPS IIIA pathology and no signs of hepatoxicity were noted. Rhodamine B proved to be a general inhibitor of gag synthesis and had a positive outcome on a number of clinical parameters in MPS IIIA mice. SDT in MPS IIIA mice improved learning capabilities as detected by the water cross maze which has not been previously reported. This provides evidence that small molecules such as rhodamine B, that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, can have some effect on neurological pathology. This proof of principle study showed that SDT can be used to have a positive outcome on MPS pathology. Additional inhibitors of gag synthesis can also be investigated before this type of therapy can be translated into clinical use in MPS patients. Although it may be feasible to use rhodamine B as a SDT agent in vivo, other inhibitors may be more practical.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">therapy; MPS; lysosome; mice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Derridean deconstruction and feminism: exploring aporias in feminist theory and practice.</field><field name="creator">Papadelos, Pam.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the politics of deconstruction within the interdisciplinary field of Women&#8217;s Studies and the question as to whether deconstruction has a politics, or can enhance the political goals of western feminism. This thesis argues that philosophy, and deconstruction in particular, is extremely useful for re-thinking feminist issues, especially around subjectivity and agency, but is not always seen to be so by some Australian feminists. As a result, Australian feminism, like feminism in other Anglophone countries, founded on the dichotomy of sameness-difference, has run out of theoretical and political steam. This thesis explores deconstruction within feminist debates and practices from the mid-1980s to present. In exploring both the contribution of deconstruction to rethinking difference and agency, and the failure on the part of most Australian women&#8217;s studies programs to apply the full potential of deconstruction, an argument is put forward for the value of deconstruction as a way of rethinking the question of woman&#8217;s subordination. While this is not a new area of study, this thesis focuses on the political efficacy of deconstruction, which is not always directly addressed in feminist texts. The first three chapters focus on the ways deconstruction has been interpreted, often negatively, by Anglo feminists or feminists in the English speaking world. It identifies the central issues taken up by feminist critics of deconstruction; argues that confusion has arisen largely due to interpretative misunderstandings of Derrida&#8217;s central tenets; and presents an elucidation of the radical potential of deconstruction for a feminist politics, especially in relation to female subjectivity. The last two chapters turn their attention to the debates over the meaning of deconstruction and the ways deconstruction entered the academy in Australia through Women&#8217;s Studies courses. They examine the specific discursive and institutional frameworks that aided or impeded the critical reception of new theoretical directions in Australia; argue that deconstruction entered Australian feminist discourse mainly in response to a dissatisfaction with the philosophy of Marxism/socialism; and detail major influences and theoretical works that made possible a more positive reception of deconstructive tenets within Australian feminism. The thesis concludes with a brief discussion of the crosscurrents between Australian and international feminist philosophy and outlines how deconstruction might continue to advance feminist understandings of subjectivity and enhance feminist practice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminism; deconstruction; women's studies</field><field name="subject">Derrida, Jacques Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Deconstruction Political aspects</field><field name="subject">Feminist theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsibility, compensation and accident law reform.</field><field name="creator">Vincent, Nicole A.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers two allegations which conservatives often level at no-fault systems &#8212; namely, that responsibility is abnegated under no-fault systems, and that no-fault systems under- and over-compensate.

Based on these measurements empirical models for predicting hourly night-time IR sky temperatures clear skies have been developed. These models showed very good performance and better prediction to the measured sky temperatures. Some of these new models showed excellent predictive power for the presence of the cloud over the site. It was found that under some extreme conditions other factors, e.g. aerosols, have great influence on the atmospheric radiation and need to be accounted for. MODTRAN software was used to give the theoretical justifications for the proposed models and was used to investigate some of these factors. A unified model for clear sky temperature from all the sites was found. The applicability of some existing clear sky models to the sites was also tested.

A separate subdiscipline of health economics has grown out of the welfare economics tradition to develop specific methods for economic inquiry into health care issues. The encroachment of economics into health care and public health has not occurred without consternation from within the health field. Part of the reason for this concern arises from a mismatch between the worldview of public health and that of mainstream economics. However, this mismatch is largely unexamined, and there has been limited attempt to address the mismatch and to propose alternative approaches to economic questions in public health. This thesis examines the project of public health in some detail, making reference to the consensus documents of the World Health Organization that set out the values base of public health and define its approach and some of its activities. Public health is a collective activity, mostly undertaken outside of markets and is primarily concerned with impacts on populations. It is inherently political and focuses on populations as its unit of analysis. This contrasts to the approach of mainstream economics, which presumes that economic decisions are primarily private decisions and focuses on individuals as its unit of analysis. The differing worldviews constitute an impasse between mainstream economics and this view of public health. The solutions of neo-classical economics are often at odds with the public health approach. An alternative view of economics, from the heterodox Institutional School may provide an alternative approach to economic questions in public health. In contrast to neoclassical economics, it claims to be holistic and not to engage in methodological individualism and to be explicitly concerned with questions of power. The case studies of role of government and ageing as a public health issue provide a lens through which the neoclassical approach can be examined and contrasted to the public health approach. These case studies are based on reports written for Australian governments by neoclassical economists. The two case studies are then inspected from an institutional perspective to examine whether this approach does indeed generate explanations and solutions that are more compatible with a public health approach. Other insights into the reports that can be gained from an institutional perspective are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public health Economic aspects; Public health administration; Medical policy Economic aspects;</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aboriginal Housing In South Australia, An Overview of Housing at Oak Valley, Maralinga Tjarutja.</field><field name="creator">Grant, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This work presents an overview of housing at Oak Valley, a remote Aboriginal community in the Maralinga Tjarutja Lands and paints a broad contextual picture of the political processes and resultant housing.

It will be shown that successive groups of people arrived in Australia before its settlement by Europeans. These people made their presence felt in various ways, which have been considered. Some in ancient and later times may have arrived from Africa, perhaps being blown off course and carried by the currents and winds of the Indian Ocean. Later migrations came from Asia, and finally technologically advanced peoples of Indonesia and China came to Australia. Some of these people left artefacts, practices and language that became part of some Aboriginal languages and some religious beliefs and practice, along with some physical biological traces. The peoples named &#8220;Aborigines&#8221; by European settlers were a diverse set of groups with a diverse set of physical and cultural influences.

This work was carried out in order to better elucidate the petroleum migration and accumulation histories and exploration potential of the region. The study area extended from the southern limit of the Swan Graben in the south-west to the northern part of the Cartier Trough in the north-east. The results from the basin modelling have been compared with the seafloor bathymetry and physiography, the spatial distributions of hydrocarbon related diagenetic zones (HRDZs) in the region, as well as the distribution of other leakage and seepage indicators. A new method for identifying potential HRDZs using seismic data has also been developed. The 2D/3D modeling results from the Swan Graben indicate that horizontal and downward oil expulsion from the source rocks of the Late Jurassic Lower Vulcan Formation into the upper Plover Formation sandstones was active from the Early Cretaceous to the present day. Oil migration from the Lower Vulcan Formation into the Late Cretaceous Puffin Formation sands in the Puffin Field was simulated via lateral migration along the bottom of an Upper Vulcan Formation seal and by vertical migration above the seal edge. Modelling also indicates that Late Jurassic sequences over the Montara Terrace are thermally immature and did not contribute to the hydrocarbon accumulations in the region. On the other hand, 3D modelling results indicate that the Middle Jurassic Plover Formation in the Montara Terrace became thermally mature after the Pliocene and hence it could have contributed to both the specific hydrocarbon accumulations and the overall hydrocarbon inventory in the area. In the southern Cartier Trough, the Lower Vulcan Formation is typically at a lower thermal maturity than that seen in the Swan Graben, due to a combination of a relatively recent (Pliocene) increased burial and a thinner Lower Vulcan Formation. Here, horizontal and downward oil/gas expulsion from the Lower Vulcan Formation into the Plover Formation sandstone was active from the Late Tertiary to the present day, which is significantly later than the timing of the expulsion in the Swan Graben. In the central Cartier Trough, the areal extent of both generation and expulsion increased as a result of rapid subsidence and deposition from about 5.7 Ma to the present day. This Pliocene loading has resulted in the rapid maturation of the Early to Middle and Late Jurassic source system and expulsion of oil very recently. Oil migration from the Lower Vulcan Formation into the Jabiru structure, via the Plover Formation carrier bed, was simulated in both the 2D and the 3D modelling. In particular, the 3D modelling simulated oil migration into the Jabiru structure, both from the southern Cartier Trough (after the Miocene) and also from the northern Swan Graben (in the Early Cretaceous). Early gas migration, and the attendant formation of a gas cap, was also simulated. Importantly, this result provides a potential alternative interpretation for the formation of at least some of the residual zones in the Timor Sea, as well as in other areas. Traditionally, most of the residual zones within the Timor Sea have been attributed to fault seal reactivation and failure. However, the simulated early gas cap in the Jabiru structure has formed as a result of gas exsolution as the migrating hydrocarbons entered the Jabiru trap (and its shallow flanks), which was then only located a few hundred metres below the surface. The rapidly decreasing pressure allowed the gas to form a separate phase, with the result that in the Early Cretaceous, in the 3D model, the Jabiru trap was composed of a relatively large gas cap with a thinner (&#8220;black oil&#8221;) oil leg. Progressive burial through the Tertiary, and the attendant increase in pressure, resulted in the gas going back into solution. The associated decrease in the bulk volume of the hydrocarbon accumulation produced a &#8220;residual&#8221; oil zone at the base of the column, purely through a change in phase, rather than through loss of hydrocarbons from fault seal failure, for example. The processes outlined in this scenario would be essentially indistinguishable from those produced by fault seal failure when assessing traps using fluid history tools such as GOI. Such a process could be critically important in the case of shallow, low-relief traps, where only the exsolved gas could be trapped, with the &#8220;black oil&#8221; component displaced below the spill of the trap. Small, sub-commercial gas fields would thus be located around the periphery of the source depocentres - though these would be the result of an early, rather than late, gas charge. Small black oil accumulations could be developed inboard from such gas fields. A new method to extract HRDZs from 3D seismic data has predicted the location of new HRDZs in the northern Vulcan Sub-basin. Further investigation is needed to confirm/refine the method but it has the potential to significantly aid HRDZ mapping (and seal assessment and hydrocarbon migration studies). A workflow for future studies is proposed which includes inputs from basin modelling, leakage and seepage mapping, and fault seal and fault reactivation studies. Implementation of this workflow should ultimately allow a more reliable estimation of GOR prior to drilling.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology; petroleum; sedimentary basins; basins (geology); petrology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The C+A theory of time: explaining the difference between the experience of time and the understanding of time.</field><field name="creator">Turner, Andrew J.</field><field name="description">The central problem addressed by this thesis is to attempt and reconcile our experience of time with our scientific understanding of time. Science tells us that time is static yet we experience it as dynamic. In the literature there tend to be two positions. Those who follow the science and claim that time is static and that our experience is mind-independent; those who favour our experience and question the science. I attempt to reconcile these positions. To do this I adopt terminology set out by McTaggart (1908) who termed the static view the B series and the dynamic view the A series. The literature that has developed out of this breaks down into the A Theory where time is the past, present and future; and the B Theory, where time is just involves events being earlier than or later than other events. I reject both positions as accounts of ontology. I adopt McTaggart&#8217;s C series, a series of betweenness only, on the grounds that it is this series that is mostly aligned to science. Given the C series, our experience requires explanation. A claim of mind-dependency is insufficient. I argue that the A series really refers to mind-dependent features that are brought out by our interaction with the C series; much like the way that colour is brought out by our interaction with a colourless world. The B series is the best description of the contents of time, not time itself. To examine the experience of time I adopt phenomenology to describe that experience. From within experience I show that certain features of that experience cannot be attributed to a mind-independent reality and use this as further evidence for the above claims. Finally I suggest that most theories of time are driven by the view that a theory of time has to be consistent. I examine recent developments in logic to see whether such a consistent requirement is needed. I conclude that the most we can get out of paraconsistent approaches is inconsistent experiences, not inconsistent reality. I conclude that the A series is the best description of our experience of time, the C series the best description of the ontology of time, and the B series as the best description of the contents of time. This reconciles our experience with our understanding of time.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">McTaggart; A theory; B theory; C theory</field><field name="subject">Time</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of macroeconomic announcements on the Australian fixed income market.</field><field name="creator">Mak, Nixon.</field><field name="description">New information has an important role in asset price movement. This paper investigates the role of scheduled domestic news releases on the Australian government bond market. Specifically, it examines the impact of pre-announced macroeconomic news release on bond futures markets and associated market volatility. Furthermore, an EGARCH-in-mean model is used to determine the asymmetric response of the conditional volatility to either news release or unexpected changes of some news content. The results indicate that excess return of bond futures in the research period was leptokurtic (fat-tailed) with time-varying conditional heteroscedasticity. Day of the week volatility was also present but with a declining pace. It&#8217;s generally attributed to the release dates of announcements and information flow from offshore markets. Although announcement effects to the bond futures market were significant, they depended on the type of maturity. Finally, results from EGARCH indicate that fundamental lagging indicators such as CPI and GDP are always important in explaining the impact of news release on market volatility, whereas the unemployment rate has a reasonable role in announcement surprises. The data suggest the following conclusion: investors are seriously concerned with news releases on macroeconomic variables they can feasibly forecast because they are always fundamental and provide a partial indication of the future economy. Surprises from news content are also critical to investors because some important variables can only be forecasted with limited accuracy. Therefore, deviation from anticipated outcomes in the actual content also causes significant market movement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">impact; macroeconomic; announcements; Australian fixed income</field><field name="subject">Fixed-income securities--Australia.</field><field name="subject">Australia--Economic policy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the life cycle and cellular interactions of AM fungi with the reduced mycorrhizal colonization (rmc) mutant of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.)</field><field name="creator">Manjarrez-Martinez, Ma De Jesus.</field><field name="description">The broad aim of the work described in this thesis was to use the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) defective rmc tomato to explore the development and function of different types of fungus-plant interfaces (phenotypes) and to characterize the cellular modifications preceding colonization of rmc by a range of different AM fungi. Three main patterns of colonization with rmc have been described: 1) Pen- phenotype in which the AM fungus is restricted to the root surface with several attempts to penetrate the epidermal cells without success; 2) Coiphenotype where AM fungi penetrate the epidermis but cannot develop cortical colonization; and 3) Myc+ phenotype (with G. intraradices WFVAM23), where the AM fungus penetrates the cortex and forms a &#8220;normal&#8221; colonization after a delayed penetration of the epidermal cells (Review of literature). Little is known about cellular interactions, nutrient transfer or the ability of the fungi to complete their life cycles in the different phenotypes. These aspects were the main foci of this work. In addition further fungal isolates were screened to asses their ability to colonize rmc. The first experiments involved compartmented pots to follow the fungal life cycle, production of external mycelium and spores in the different rmc phenotypes (Chapter 3). The results showed that in the Pen- and Coiphenotypes, AM fungi are unable to form spores to complete the life cycle. However, in the Coi-phenotype, the fungus remained alive up to week 18, suggesting that some C transfer occurred. The fungus forming the Myc+ phenotype, G. intraradices WFVAM23, was able to produce spores, although they were significantly smaller than those produced with the wild-type tomato. The results suggested that arbuscules are essential for completion of the fungal life cycle. Labeled 32P was used to determine whether arbuscules are also essential for P transfer (Chapter 4). A compartmented pot system was used in which only fungal hyphae but not roots could obtain 32P. 32P was found in the shoots of rmc inoculated with S. calospora (Coi- phenotype), indicating that interfaces other than arbuscules can be involved in transfer of P. A nurse pot system was used to obtain synchronized colonization to determine how long AM fungi stay alive during the interactions with rmc and to elucidate the cellular modifications preceding colonization of rmc by a range of different AM fungi (Chapter 5). The results showed that rmc did attract the AM fungi, that the plant nucleus moved to the middle of the plant cell only after fungal penetration of plant roots and that callose deposition in rmc was not involved in blocking the AM fungi. Fourteen AM fungi with different taxonomic affiliations and fourteen different G. intraradices isolates were screened to try to relate phylogeny of AM fungi with phenotypes in rmc (Chapter 6). There were a large number of interactions, depending on the inoculated AM fungi, and although there were some similarities in the rmc phenotypes within phylogenetic groups, there was no clear relationship between phylogeny and development of interactions with rmc. This study showed the following. 1) Arbuscules/arbusculate coils are necessary for the completion of the AM fungal cycle. However, intraradical hyphae also participate in transfer of both P and C as demonstrated with the Coi- phenotype. 2) rmc clearly attracted AM fungi and the fungi stay alive and induce plant cellular responses such as nuclear movement only after penetrating rmc roots. 3) Plant defense responses such as callose deposition are not involved in blocking AM fungi in rmc; and 4) there was no relationship between the phenotypes described in rmc and phylogeny of the Glomeromycota.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AM fungi; rmc; life cycle; cellular interactions; plant defense reactions; AM fungal phylogenie</field><field name="subject">Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas.</field><field name="subject">Plant defenses.</field><field name="subject">Plant-fungus relationships.</field><field name="subject">Mycorrhizas in agriculture.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dialogic learning in tutorial talk: a case study of semiotic mediation as a learning resource for second language international students.</field><field name="creator">Wake, Barbara Julienne.</field><field name="description">This thesis is a case study of dialogic learning in a university context as demonstrated in tutorial talk. The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness or otherwise of dialogic learning as applied in an economics curriculum. More specifically, the thesis examines the learning experiences of a second language international student cohort as they attempted to understand the role of prediction and causality in economic principles and theories through spoken dialogue. This approach means interpreting the students&#8217; learning as a semiotic process and the students&#8217; cognitive development as shaped by their language in use. The theoretical framework for this examination is offered by the analytical resources of systemic functional linguistics, as developed by M.A.K. Halliday (from 1975 to 2004) combined with frameworks for mediated learning offered by Vygotsky (1986, 1987); Bakhtin (1986); Hasan (from 1985a to 2001); Bernstein (from 1971 to 2001) and Cloran (from 1994 to 2006 draft); and more recent research in &#8216;scaffolded learning&#8217;. The study applies these resources to analyse significant rhetorical functions of economic discourse, such as predictive reasoning and argumentation, and to examine how these were negotiated and mediated by the students and their lecturer. The method for analysing negotiation and mediation in these students&#8217; learning draws on Rhetorical Unit (RU) analysis as devised by Cloran. Linguistically, the analysis takes account of categories and relations between the Rhetorical Units on the basis that these are able to provide theoretical explanations for the predictive reasoning construed in the interactions. The analysis of Rhetorical Units primarily involved the identification of relations between the basic constituent of the text, ie, the message, and how these relations constructed the units of rhetorical meaning in the discussion. The advantage of adopting this approach is the possibility of realising rhetorical activities as an abstraction at the semantic stratum, and, as such, how they were realised by lexicogrammatical phenomena. The analysis examined: first, the use of Rhetorical Units by the lecturer and students in their construal of the critical pedagogic discourses identified by Bernstein, being the regulative and the instructional; and second, the adjustments and shifts to more congruent explanations as a result of contingency strategies taken by both the lecturer and students in response to the students&#8217; difficulties. The findings throw a different light onto dialogic learning in a new social constructivist pedagogical approach in a university context. The study reveals that while the students&#8217; learning was a highly collaborative dialectical process, any transformations in understanding were not at all neatly incremental as described in the literature. Indeed, the negotiations were highly &#8216;peripatetic&#8217;; any increments in understanding were overall devolutionary. While the lecturer&#8217;s initial guidance reflected the monologic discourse of written economics, her responses became more congruent and reactive. It was shown that a key predictor of these contingency strategies was the kinds of meanings sought by the students&#8217; extensive questioning. Hence, in this case study, the contingency strategies undertaken within the interactional dynamic reveal a different view of semiotic mediation, necessarily a process of semiotic remediation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peer-group tutoring of students; English language - Study and teaching; Foreign study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cathelicidins and surfactant proteins in chronic rhinosinusitis: a clinical and experimental study.</field><field name="creator">Ooi, Eng Hooi</field><field name="description">Objectives: To study the expression of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides (CAMP) and surfactant protein D (SP-D) in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and eosinophilic mucus chronic rhinosinusitis (EMCRS) and by a nasal explant in vitro model cultured with fungal allergens. Methods: Nasal biopsies from 59 CRS and EMCRS patients, stratified into Allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS), Nonallergic fungal eosinophilic sinusitis (NAFES), and Nonallergic nonfungal eosinophilic sinusitis (NANFES) were studied by quantitative real-time (q)RTPCR, Western blot, immunostaining and ELISA. Nasal tissue from CRS and EMCRS patients were cultured with increasing concentrations of fungal allergens in a nasal explant in vitro model for 24 hours and CAMP and SP-D mRNA and protein levels in response to the fungi were determined by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Results: The expression of CAMP mRNA was significantly increased in EMCRS patients compared to CRS patients (p=0.0004). By immunohistochemistry, expression of CAMP was localised to nasal epithelial, submucosal glands and inflammatory subepithelial cells. Western blotting demonstrated the presence of CAMP in the study patients. Culturing nasal explants with fungal allergens demonstrated significant upregulation of CAMP mRNA expression in CRS, but not EMCRS patients, by Aspergillus (mean 4-fold increase) and Alternaria (mean 6-fold increase) extracts with a significant dose-response effect (p&lt;0.001). CAMP protein levels in the nasal tissue from CRS patients increased in response to Alternaria (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, with EMCRS patients the expression of CAMP peptide in nasal tissue increased with Aspergillus (p&lt;0.001) but decreased with Alternaria. Staining for SP-D was detected in the submucosal glands from the nasal biopsies in all patient groups except for AFS. By ELISA, SP-D was undetectable in AFS and decreased in NAFES, NANFES, and CRS compared to controls. CRS patients cultured with Aspergillus and Alternaria allergens in the in vitro nasal explant model induced significant upregulation of SP-D mRNA (p&lt;0.0001). In contrast, NANFES nasal tissue explants cultured with Aspergillus allergens induced downregulation of SP-D and only a modest upregulation of SP-D mRNA to Alternaria allergens. Conclusion: This study demonstrates expression of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides and surfactant proteins in nasal mucosa supporting its potential role in innate defences against inhaled pathogens. There is significant upregulation of CAMP mRNA in the EMCRS group implying an increased inflammatory state. In vitro, CAMP is significantly upregulated at the mRNA and protein level in CRS tissue explants to Aspergillus and Alternaria allergens. However, EMCRS tissue cultured with Alternaria in vitro does not demonstrate increased CAMP at the mRNA or protein level. The expression of SP-D in nasal tissue is reported for the first time. SP-D expression in the CRS, but not the EMCRS group, is upregulated in vitro by Aspergillus and Alternaria. The EMCRS group compared to CRS group demonstrate abnormal CAMP and SP-D expression to common fungal allergens. These important findings in understanding the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis are discussed in this thesis and may provide potential novel therapies for chronic rhinosinusitis in the future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rhinosinusitis; sinusitis; sinusitis treatment</field><field name="subject">Sinusitis.</field><field name="subject">Peptide antibiotics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cortisol perturbation in the pathophysiology of septicaemia, complicated pregnancy and weight loss/obesity.</field><field name="creator">Ho, Jui Ting.</field><field name="description">Cortisol, the principal glucocorticoid secreted from the adrenal glands, is essential for life. Healthy cortisol levels are maintained through negative feedback on the central nervous system (CNS) &#8211; pituitary stimulatory apparatus which regulates production of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and contains a light&#8211;entrained intrinsic CNS driven diurnal rhythm. Cortisol participates in a regulatory mechanism where inflammatory cytokines stimulate cortisol release and cortisol in turn suppresses cytokine release. The effects of cortisol in inflammatory states include elevating blood pressure and metabolic regulation. This thesis contains three exploratory studies examining circulating cortisolaemia using the best available methodologies (total and free cortisol and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)) in clinical states characterized by immune activation/ inflammation and altered blood pressure. These clinical states include: (1) septic shock, (2) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and (3) obesity-induced hypertension. Prior to the studies described here, little was know about cortisolaemia in these common pathological states. Septic shock is a life threatening condition that complicates severe infection and is characterized by systemic inflammation and refractory hypotension. High plasma total cortisol levels and attenuated responses to synthetic ACTH stimulation are associated with increased mortality. The use of corticosteroids in septic shock has been highly controversial for decades, however recent trials have reported haemodynamic and survival benefits associated with the use of physiologic steroid replacement in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) &#8211; currently defined as a total cortisol increment of 248 nmol/L or less following ACTH (250 &#956;g) stimulation. However, CBG and albumin levels fall by around 50% with an increase in plasma free cortisol in critical illness. Hence, total cortisol may not reflect the biologically active free (unbound) cortisol, suggesting that standard assays for plasma cortisol (which measure total plasma cortisol) underestimate HPA axis activity. In this study, we have showed that plasma free cortisol is a better guide to circulating glucocorticoid activity in systemic infection than total cortisol. We have also validated the use of Coolens&#8217; method in estimating free cortisol in systemic infection, using plasma total cortisol and CBG measurements as plasma free cortisol is not performed in clinical laboratories. Free cortisol measurement allows better categorization of RAI and non-RAI groups with a free cortisol increment of 110 nmol/L as cut-off. Moreover, we have shown that survivors of RAI have normal adrenocortical function on follow-up testing suggesting a lack of functional adrenal reserve rather than adrenal damage during critical illness. Larger randomized controlled trials will be required to redefine RAI using free cortisol measurements and relate that to clinical outcomes and responses to corticosteroid therapy. Nitric oxide (NO) is normally produced in the endothelium by the constitutive form of the NO synthase and this physiologic production is important for blood pressure regulation and blood flow distribution. Studies have shown that an overproduction of NO by the inducible form of NO synthase (iNOS) may contribute to the hypotension, cardiodepression and vascular hyporeactivity in septic shock. Clinical studies of non-selective inhibitors of the L-arginine nitric oxide pathway showed increased mortality from cardiovascular complications. However, glucocorticoids, which improve vasopressor sensitivity, may act by partially suppressing NO synthesis through selective direct inhibition of iNOS, and suppression of inflammatory cytokine synthesis. Hence, plasma nitrate/ nitrite (NOx) levels may provide a titratable end point to individualize glucocorticoid therapy in sepsis. The NOx study in this thesis showed that cortisol (total and free), CBG and NOx correlated to illness severity. Free cortisol, and to a lesser extent total cortisol, but not NOx levels, predicted septic shock. NOx levels were characteristically stable within individuals but inter-individual differences were only partly accounted for by illness severity or renal dysfunction. NOx levels correlated weakly with cortisol, did not relate to the need for vasopressors and were not suppressed by hydrocortisone treatment. Thus, NOx is not a suitable target for glucocorticoid therapy in septic shock. Pregnancy is the only sustained physiologic state of hypercortisolism in humans. A large body of data suggests that excessive foetal and prenatal glucocorticoid exposure leads to reduced birth weight and adverse health in offspring such as elevated blood pressure and insulin resistance. Pre-eclampsia and gamete donor pregnancies are associated with immune activation, elevated inflammatory cytokines as well as elevated blood pressure. Prior to the study described in this thesis however, there was no prospective data on maternal cortisolaemia in these complicated pregnancies. My study has demonstrated for the first time that there was a substantial fall in plasma CBG levels in the last few weeks of gestation with a corresponding rise in free cortisol in normal pregnancy, a finding obscured for methodological reasons in past studies. This free cortisol elevation in late pregnancy may facilitate organ maturation in the foetus and perhaps prepare the mother for the metabolic demands of labour. In pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, plasma CBG, total and free cortisol levels were lower in late third trimester; and in IUGR, plasma CBG levels were suppressed from 28 weeks gestation until delivery but with no significant difference in plasma total and free cortisol. Women with assisted reproduction using donor gametes/ embryos had significantly lower plasma CBG, total and free cortisol levels even in those with normal pregnancy outcomes. Low CBG may be due to reduced synthesis or enhanced inflammation-driven degradation. Low maternal cortisol may be due to a lack of placental corticotropin-releasing hormone, or reduced maternal ACTH, driving cortisol production. This unanticipated maternal hypocortisolism in complicated pregnancies may trigger precocious activation of the foetal HPA axis and could have implications for postnatal and adult health. Speculatively, since excess prenatal GCs increase HPA axis activity, we proposed that maternal hypocortisolism may predispose to the hypocortisolaemic state characterized by fatigue, pain and stress sensitivity, in offspring. The third state of immune/ inflammatory activation associated with blood pressure dysregulation studied in this thesis is obesity. The epidemiologic relationship between obesity and hypertension is widely recognised. Central obesity in particular has been associated with exaggerated HPA responses to stimuli. Studies of severe dieting and starvation resulted in hypercortisolism and a significant decrease in CBG. The HPA axis and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity-induced hypertension. However, there is little data on the effect of moderate weight loss (30% caloric restriction) on adrenocortical function, and the relation of adrenal hormones to altered blood pressure with weight loss. In this study, measures of HPA axis and RAAS and blood pressure monitoring were performed in twenty-five obese subjects before and after a 12-week diet program (6000kJ/day). Short-term, moderate weight loss (mean 8.5 kg) was associated with a small reduction in blood pressure (mean arterial pressure 6 mmHg) and significantly reduced levels of aldosterone and renin but not cortisol levels. These findings suggest that aldosterone may have an important role in the blood pressure reduction with weight loss via a renin mediated mechanism, perhaps involving renal sympathetic tone. In contrast to severe caloric restriction, HPA axis activation does not occur with moderate weight loss. This suggests a threshold effect of weight loss on the HPA axis where greater caloric restriction is required for HPA stimulation, or a counterbalancing of central and direct adrenal effects on HPA axis function. Overall, these three exploratory studies have provided novel data on HPA axis function in systemic infection, pregnancy and in diet-induced weight loss. Each study offers a basis for further studies of HPA axis function in these disorders.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cortisol; corticosteroid-binding globulin; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; septicaemia; pregnancy; obesity</field><field name="subject">Hydrocortisone</field><field name="subject">Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</field><field name="subject">Septicemia</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ripening behaviour of capsicum (Capsicum annuum L.) fruit.</field><field name="creator">Pham Thi, Ngoc Thang.</field><field name="description">Fruit of Capsicum annuum L. (capsicum or pepper) are one of the major sources of red food colourant and pungency for spice production. In the spice production industry, fruit are mechanically harvested at different ripeness stages and fruit colour needs to be synchronised before being processed. However, even though capsicum ripens normally on the plant it often fails to ripen fully and turn red once harvested at the green stage. Attempts to promote ripening of harvested fruits have had limited success and the reason for this has been unclear. This project, therefore, investigated ripening behaviour on and off the plant of capsicum fruit grown in Australia and examined effects of pre- and postharvest applications on ripening of green harvested fruit. To examine ripening behaviour on and off the plant, capsicum fruit from three different cultivars (a mild paprika type cv. &#8220;Papri Queen&#8221;, a cayenne chilli cv. &#8220;Caysan&#8221;, and a sweet type bell pepper cv. &#8220;Aries&#8221;) were either allowed to ripen naturally on the plant or harvested at three different maturity stages: light green, deep green and breaker. Harvested fruit were stored individually at room temperature and several ripening characteristics including internal ethylene (C2H4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, extractable colour, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase and oxidase activity, and total soluble solid content (TSSC) were studied during storage. There was very limited involvement of C2H4 during ripening of capsicum and the change in ACC synthase and ACC oxidase (two enzymes in C2H4 biosynthesis pathway) activity was not closely related to that of C2H4. However, it appeared that colour development in cv. &#8220;Papri Queen&#8221; was closely associated with what C2H4 production did occur while a climacteric-like peak of C2H4 could be observed in all fruit from cv. &#8220;Caysan&#8221;. For all three cultivars, the level of internal CO2 concentration, extractable colour and TSSC were greater in fruit ripened on the plant followed by fruit harvested at the breaker, deep green and light green stage, respectively. Fruit harvested at the light green stage failed to change colour properly and had very low levels of internal CO2 concentration and TSSC while fruit harvested from the breaker stage onwards ripened normally and developed sufficient colour for spice processing. This may suggest a role of external carbon-supply during ripening. To study the effect of the external-carbon supply during ripening, the stem of fruit were cinctured when fruit reached the light green stage and fruit were left to ripen on the plant. Cincturing delayed colour development of fruit by approximately five days but cinctured fruit were still able to turn red and develop extractable colour higher than the acceptable level of 140 ASTA units. Cincturing did not significantly alter other ripening behaviour such as CO2 concentration or TSSC. The lack of external carbon-supply is, therefore, unlikely to play a major role in the failure of green harvested fruit to ripen. To study the effect of application of plant growth regulators (both pre- and postharvest), an effective method of solution application utilising cincturing was firstly developed. Different plant growth regulator solutions including ethephon, naphthalene acetic acid, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, sucrose, and different combinations of these were applied to fruit at the light green stage to study preharvest effects on ripening parameters during storage. Only treatment with high concentrations of ethephon increased the extractable colour higher than the acceptable level of 140 ASTA units and induced the complete degradation of chlorophyll. To study effects of postharvest application, 10 &#181;L of various plant growth regulators was dropped into the hole created on the stem of harvested fruit for ten consecutive days. Treatment with ethephon significantly increased extractable colour and degraded chlorophyll content of fruit. Pre- and postharvest ethephon treatment strongly up-regulated Capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (Ccs) gene expression in a manner similar to the up-regulation of Ccs observed in fruit ripened on the plant. This explains the effect of C2H4 on colour development and also indicates the possible reason for the failure of green harvested fruit to ripen. However, the Ccs gene expression and chlorophyll degradation induced by ethephon was not visible until 14 days after harvest which indicated it may not be a direct effect and other signal transduction factors may be involved. When fruit are ripened on the plant, colour development may, therefore, be induced by ripening-related factors (other than C2H4) which is possibly inhibited or inactivated when fruit are harvested at the green stage. C2H4 application to fruit at this stage may help to reactivate or recover these factors which in turn induce colour development. Thus, although capsicum fruit show typical non-climacteric behaviour, C2H4 appears to be involved in some aspects of the ripening process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethylene; ripening behaviour; ACC; caroterioid; capsanthin; capsorubin; ethephone; plant growth regulator</field><field name="subject">Peppers -- Ecology.</field><field name="subject">Peppers -- Physiology.</field><field name="subject">Fruit -- Ripening.</field><field name="subject">Growth (Plants) -- Regulation.</field><field name="subject">Ethylene.</field><field name="subject">Plant regulators.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular evolution of the carboxy terminal, the putative sperm-ZP binding site, of the zona pellucida 3 glycoprotein in old world murine rodents.</field><field name="creator">Swann, Christine A.</field><field name="description">In mammals, before fertilisation can occur, sperm have to bind to, and penetrate, the extracellular coat of the oocyte, the zona pellucida (ZP). In the laboratory mouse, which has been used as a model system for fertilization studies, sperm-ZP binding has been found to be mediated by a region near the carboxy terminal, encoded by exon 7 of the Zp3 gene. This region shows considerable interspecific sequence diversity in North American cricetid rodents, with some evidence of adaptive evolution, suggesting that this may contribute to species specific sperm-ZP binding. However, by contrast, in a preliminary study of three species of Australian murine rodents an identical protein sequence of the region encoded by exon 7 of Zp3 was found to be present. The aim of this present study was to determine the pattern of sequence diversity of this region in the most speciose subfamily of mammals, the murine rodents, and to obtain insight into the selective pressures involved in its evolution. For this, DNA was extracted from murine rodents of Africa, Eurasia, South-east Asia, New Guinea and Australia. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of exons 6 and 7 of Zp3 in 96 murine species from 14 divisions, as recently defined by Musser and Carleton (2005), was determined and compared. Generally, it was found that closely related species shared a highly similar ZP3 sequence. Maximum likelihood analyses of codon substitution models using representatives from 14 murine divisions, suggested that positive selection had occurred within only a few lineages at several different codon sites adjacent to, or within, the putative combining-site for sperm of ZP3. Positive selection was not evident when the analysis was restricted to the Australian taxa which showed low levels of both intra- and inter-generic sequence divergence. There was no good evidence that this region contributes to species specificity of sperm-ZP binding in these species. These findings thus suggest that the selective forces acting on the Zp3 exon 7 region during the evolution of the murine rodents have varied possibly due to a range of selective pressures not necessarily restricted to the prevention of hybridization. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the amino acid sequence of the exon 7 coding region contributes to species specificity of sperm-ZP binding within most of the lineages from this most speciose subfamily of eutherian mammals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fertilization; sperm-ZP binding; zona pellucida; ZP3; positive selection; murine rodents</field><field name="subject">Muridae Reproduction.

There is a pressing need for high throughput software that can annotate protein or DNA sequences with functional information due to the exponential growth in sequence data. In Chapter 1 we briefly introduce the molecular biology and bioinformatics that is assumed knowledge, and the objectives for the research presented here. In Chapter 2 we discuss the development of a method of comparing competing designs for software annotators, using precision and recall metrics, and a benchmark method referred to as Best BLAST. From this we conclude that data-mining approaches may be useful in the development of annotation algorithms, and that any new annotator should demonstrate its effectiveness against other approaches before being adopted. As any new annotator that utilises sequence similarity to predict the function of a sequence will rely on the quality of existing annotations, we examine the error rate of existing sequence annotations in Chapter 3. We develop a new method that allows for the estimation of annotation error rates. This involves adding annotation errors at known rates to a sample of reference sequence annotations that was found to be similar to query sequences. The precision at each error rate treatment is determined, and linear regression then used to find the error rate at estimated values for the maximum precision possible given assumptions concerning the impact of semantic variation on precision. We found that the error rate of curated annotations based on sequence similarity (ISS) is far higher than those that use other forms of evidence (49% versus 13-18%, respectively). As such we conclude that software annotators should avoid basing predictions on ISS annotations where possible. In Chapter 4 we detail the development of GOSLING, Gene Ontology Similarity Listing using Information Graphs, a software annotator with a design based on the principles discovered in previous chapters. Chapter 5 concludes the thesis by discussing the major findings from the research presented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioinformatics, computer science</field><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">Computer science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between climate variation and selected infectious diseases: Australian and Chinese perspectives.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Ying</field><field name="description">Background Climate variation has affected diverse physical and biological systems worldwide.

Australia is grappling with developing politically acceptable responses to global warming. In China, few studies have been conducted to examine the effect of climate variation, including global warming, on population health. As residents of developing countries may suffer more from climate change compared with people living in more developed countries, this thesis has significance for both countries. Aims This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of climate variation on population health, and to provide scientific evidence for policy makers, researchers, public health practitioners and local communities in the development of public health strategies at an early stage, in order to prevent or reduce future risks associated with ongoing climate change. The objectives of this study include: (1) to quantify the association between climate variation and selected vectorborne diseases and enteric infections in different climatic regions in Australia and China; (2) to project the future burden of selected vector-borne diseases and enteric infections based on climate change scenarios in different climatic regions in Australia and China. Methods This ecological study has two components. The first uses time-series analyses to quantify the relationship between meteorological variables and infectious diseases, whereas the second projects the burden of selected infectious diseases using future climate and population scenarios. Temperate and subtropical climatic zones in both Australia and China were selected as the primary study areas, and a study of an Australian tropical region was also conducted. Study of Australia&#8217;s temperate zones was conducted in Adelaide, South Australia, as well as the Murray River region in that State. The study of China&#8217;s temperate zone was carried out in Jinan, Shandong Province. Subtropical studies were conducted in Baoan, Guangdong Province, China, and Brisbane in Queensland, whilst research for the tropics centred on Townsville, also in Queensland, Australia. The selected infectious diseases - one vector-borne disease and one enteric infection in each country - are Ross River Virus (RRV) infection and salmonellosis in Australia, and malaria and bacillary dysentery in China. Study periods vary from eight to sixteen years (depending upon the availability of data). Climate data, infectious disease surveillance data and demographic data were collected from local authorities. Data analyses conducted in the ecological studies include Spearman correlation analysis, time-series adjusted Poisson regression and the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model with consideration of lag effects, seasonality, long-term trends, and autocorrelation, on a weekly or monthly basis depending on data availability, and Hockey Sticky model to detect potential threshold temperatures. In the burden of disease component, analyses include the calculation of an indicator of the burden of disease - Years Lost due to Disabilities (YLDs) - and use scenario-based models to project YLDs for the selected diseases in 2030 and 2050 in Australia and 2020 and 2050 in China respectively. The projections consider both different scenarios of projected temperature and future population change. Results Relationship between climate variation and selected infectious diseases In all the study regions in Australia, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall and humidity are all significantly related to the number of RRV infections, with lag effects varying from 0 to 3 months. Additionally, high tides in the two seaside regions with tropical (Townsville) or subtropical (Brisbane) climates, and river flow in the temperate region (Murray River region), are related to the number of cases without any lag effects. A potential 1&#176;C increase in maximum or minimum temperature may cause 4%~23% extra cases of RRV infection in the temperate region, 5~8% in the subtropical region, and 6%~15% in the tropical region. Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity and air pressure are significantly related to malaria cases in the temperate city Jinan and subtropical city Baoan in China, with a lag effect range of 0 to 1 month. An association between rainfall and malaria cases was not detected in either region. A potential 1&#176;C increase in maximum or minimum temperature may lead to 4%~15% extra malaria cases in the temperate region, and 12%-18% in the tropical region in China. Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall and humidity are all significantly related to the number of salmonellosis cases in the three study cities in Australia, with lag effects varying from 0 to 1 month. A potential 1&#176;C increase in maximum or minimum temperature may cause 6%~19% extra salmonellosis cases in the temperate region (Adelaide), 5%~10% in the subtropical region (Brisbane), and 4%~15% in the tropical region (Townsville). The thresholds for the effects of maximum and minimum temperatures are 20&#186;C and 12&#186;C respectively in Adelaide. No threshold temperatures are detected in Townsville and Brisbane. Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, air pressure and rainfall are significantly related to bacillary dysentery cases in the temperate city Jinan and subtropical city Baoan in China, with the lag effect range of 0 to 2 months. A potential 1&#176;C increase in maximum or minimum temperature may cause 7%~15% extra bacillary dysentery cases in the temperate region and 10% ~ 19% in the subtropical region in China. The thresholds for the effects of maximum and minimum temperatures on bacillary dysentery are 17&#186;C and 8&#186;C respectively in Jinan. No threshold temperatures are detected in Baoan. Projection of YLDs from target diseases In Australia, considering both climatic and population scenarios, if other factors remain constant, compared with the YLDs observed in 2000, the YLDs for salmonellosis might increase by up to 48% by 2030, and nearly double by 2050 in South Australia, while the YLDs might double by 2030 and increase by up to 143% by 2050 in Brisbane, Queensland. The YLDs for RRV infection might increase by up to 66% by 2030, and nearly double by 2050 in South Australia. They might increase by up to 61% by 2030 and double by 2050 in Brisbane, Queensland. In China, considering both climatic and population scenarios, if other factors remain constant, compared with the YLDs observed in 2000, the YLDs for bacillary dysentery might double by 2020 and triple by 2050 in both Jinan and Baoan. The YLDs for malaria might increase by up to 108% by 2020 and nearly triple by 2050 in Jinan, the temperate city, and increase by up to 144% by 2020 and nearly triple by 2050 in Baoan, the subtropical city. Conclusions 1. Both maximum and minimum temperatures are important in the transmission of vector-borne diseases in various climatic regions in both Australia and China. River flow or high tides may also play an important role in the transmission of such diseases. 2. Both maximum and minimum temperatures play an important role in the transmission of enteric infections in various climatic regions in both Australia and China, with a threshold temperature detected in the temperate regions but not in subtropical and tropical regions. 3. The effects of rainfall and relative humidity on selected infectious diseases vary in different study areas in Australia and China. 4. The burden of temperature-related infectious diseases may greatly increase in the future if there is no effective preventive intervention. Public health implications 1. Implication for health practice &#8226; Public health practitioners, together with relevant government organisations, should monitor trends in infectious diseases, as well as other relevant indexes, such as vectors, pathogens, and water and food safety. They should advise policy makers of the potential risks associated with climate change and develop public health strategies to prevent and reduce the impact of infectious disease associated with such change. &#8226; Doctors and other clinical practitioners should be prepared and supported in the provision of health care for any expected extra cases associated with climate variation and should play an important role in relevant health education on climate change. &#8226; Community participation is of significance to adapt to and mitigate the risk of climate change on population health. Community involvement helps to deliver programmes which more accurately target local needs. Therefore, community should be involved in the partnerships of climate change as early as possible. &#8226; Relevant education programs on the potential health impact of climate change should be conducted by government at all levels for different stakeholders, including industries, governments, communities, clinicians and researchers. &#8226; Advocacy for adapting to and mitigating climate change should be a longstanding public health activity. 2. Implication for researchers &#8226; The main task for researchers is to identify the independent contribution made by key climatic variables and whether there are exposure thresholds for infectious disease transmission. Further studies should include various infectious diseases in different climatic regions. &#8226; Developing countries and rural regions are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change so more research should be conducted for people living in those regions. &#8226; Studies using summary measures that combine prevalence of disease, quality of life and life expectancy, such as Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), to assess the burden of disease due to climate change is necessary to assist in decision making. &#8226; More research should be conducted on the assessment of adaptive strategies and mitigation to future climate change. 3. Implication for policies &#8226; Public and preventive health strategies that consider local climatic conditions and their impact on vector and food borne diseases are important in reducing such impact due to climate change in the future. &#8226; The extra health burden that may be caused by future climate change may have a great impact on the currently overloaded public health system in both developed and developing countries. Long-term planning about health resource allocation, infrastructure establishment, and relevant response mechanisms should be developed at relevant government levels. &#8226; Effective prevention and intervention strategies will be possible only if the efforts of relevant sectors, including governments, communities, industries, research institutions, clinical professionals and individuals, have coordinated responses. &#8226; International and regional collaborations are necessary to address this global issue. In addition, strategies of an international dimension should be translated into regional and local actions. This is extremely important to developing countries such as China and India. &#8226; Sustainable development policies with consideration given to reducing green house gases and environmental degradation need immediate action which will benefit future generations. Health priorities should include the prevention of climate change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">climate; Ross River virus infection; dysentry; malaria; salamonellosis; disability adjusted life years</field><field name="subject">Medical climatology.

Nonlinear behaviour: the component parts do not act in linear ways, that is the superposition of the actions of the parts is not the output of the system. 2. Emergent behaviour: the output of the system may be inexpressible in terms of the rules or equations of the component parts. 3. Self-organisation: order appears from the chaotic interactions of individuals and the rules they obey. 4. Layers of description: in which a rule may apply at some higher levels of description but not at lower layers. 5. Adaptation: in which the environment becomes encoded in the rules governing the structure and/or behaviour of the parts (in this case strictly agents) that undergo selection in which those that are by some measure better become more numerous than those that are not as &#8220;fit&#8221;. A single cell is a complex system: we cannot explain all of its behaviour as simply the sum of its parts. Similarly, DNA structures, social networks, cancers, the brain, and living beings are intricate complex systems. This thesis tackles all of these topics from a complex systems approach. I have skirted some of the philosophical issues of complex systems and mainly focussed on appropriate tools to analyse these systems, addressing important questions such as: &#8226; What is the best way to extract information from DNA? &#8226; How can we model and analyse mutations in DNA?  &#8226; Can we determine the likely spread of both viruses and ideas in social networks? &#8226; How can we model the growth of cancer? &#8226; How can we model and analyse interactions between genes in such living systems as the fruit fly, cancers, and humans? &#8226; Can complex systems techniques give us some insight into the human brain?</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complex systems; cancer; signal processing; metabolomics, gene regulatory networks, nonlinear dynamics, EEG, mutation</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="subject">System analysis.</field><field name="subject">DNA--Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Mutation (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An immunohistochemical study of neurotrophic factors and associated cells in the rat dento-alveolar complex subjected to orthodontic forces.</field><field name="creator">Ho, Shu Hang</field><field name="description">Biological responses to orthodontic forces involve various cell types, these include fibroblasts, endothelial cells, blood vessels and sensory nerves in the periodontal ligament as well as osteoblasts, osteoclasts and cementoblasts in roots and bone surfaces. Neurotrophins are believed to interact with these cells to initiate the process of bone resorption particularly during orthodontic tooth movement. Neuropeptides released from sensory neurons have been shown to modulate the tissue inflammatory responses. In addition, neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), play an important role in neural cell differentiation and survival. The exact localization and function of neurotrophins and neurotrophic receptors in the dento-alveolar complex remains unclear. Moreover, the identity and distribution of structures expressing neurotrophins and neurotrophic receptors has yet to be fully determined. It is reasonable to propose that periodontal ligament and alveolar bone remodelling may be influenced by NGF. In addition, anti-NGF may block neurochemical changes and, hence, inhibit orthodontic tooth movement. The aims of this research were to investigate the cells responsible for NGF secretion within the periodontal ligament (PDL), pulp and bone, and the effect that anti-NGF might have on orthodontic tooth movement. 28, 8 week-old, male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control and experimental groups. Fourteen experimental animals had anti-NGF injected paradentally. Animals were sacrificed at 7 and 14 days. Sections from an earlier study were examined and stained using TRAP for osteoclast identification and analysed histomorphometrically to enable comparisons between control and experimental groups. The findings of this investigation indicated that injections of anti-NGF did not significantly affect the rate of tooth movement with the use of different tooth movement measurement methods. TRAP staining proved to be a useful and reliable marker of osteoclasts. TRAP-positive osteoclastic cells were detected in both anti-NGF and control groups. However, the TRAP-positive cells were not stained intensely with NGF immunolabelling. On the other hand, cells that were stained intensely with NGF, were TRAP-negative. The results suggested that both sympathetic and nociceptive nerves might function in counter balance to modulate bone resorption, and osteoclasts might not be directly responsible for NGF secretion within the PDL and bone. Further studies to determine the effect of NGF on tooth movement are warranted to more clearly identify the NGF expressing cells within the rat dento-alveolar complex and possible role played by NGF in orthodontic tooth movement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orthodontic; tooth movement; neurotrophins; rat</field><field name="subject">Neurophysiology.</field><field name="subject">Orthodontics.</field><field name="subject">Rats.</field><field name="subject">Nerve growth factor.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship of epithelial cells and nerve fibres to experimentally induced dentoalveolar ankylosis in the rat.</field><field name="creator">Di lulio, Darren Scott</field><field name="description">The current study investigated the distribution of periodontal epithelial cells and nerve fibres within the furcations of rat maxillary molar teeth subjected to hypothermic injury. The upper right first molars of 30 Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a single 20 minute application of dry ice in order to produce aseptic necrosis within the periodontal ligament, while the contralateral first molar served as an untreated control. Five animals were each sacrificed via cardiac perfusion after 7, 10, 14, 18, 21 and 28 days respectively and the maxillae were dissected out. After fixation in paraformaldehyde and processing, the tissues were embedded in paraffin wax and cut into 7&#181;m serial coronal sections through the furcation region. Consecutive sections were then stained with H&amp;E, cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and PGP 9.5 immunostains. Light microscopic examination of the H&amp;E stained sections revealed that ankylosis had not developed in all of the experimental teeth, and in some of the observation groups fewer teeth were ankylosed than unaffected. The morphology of the ankylotic areas appeared to change with time, initially consisting of fine bony trabeculae, then progressing to solid bone occupying the entire furcation before becoming less solid again by the latest observation periods. Root resorption was often seen adjacent to areas of ankylosis, but the cementum of the tooth root at the point of ankylotic union was usually intact and free of resorption. Changes within the pulp chambers of the experimental teeth were also noted, with reduction in cellularity and tissue disorganisation initially, then increasing cellularity and formation of a cementum-like material on the chamber walls later. Cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunostaining successfully identified epithelial cells within the periodontal ligament and their distribution around control teeth was similar to previous reports. Counting of these cells revealed lower numbers around experimental teeth, with the lowest counts around experimental teeth which had developed ankylosis. No change in the epithelial cell counts was detected over time, and these cells did not appear to regenerate after necrosis regardless of whether or not ankylosis developed. Statistical analysis indicated that the probability of ankylosis decreased as the number of epithelial cells increased. The PGP 9.5 immunostain identified periodontal nerve fibres, but the use of this stain was quite technique sensitive. The furcations of the molar teeth were noted to have relatively sparse innervation, with most of the visible nerve fibres being closely associated with blood vessels and located in the outer two-thirds of the ligament. Counting of the nerve fibres revealed fewer fibres around experimental teeth compared to control teeth, especially in the part of the ligament closest to the tooth root. There was no relationship detected between nerve count and time or between nerve and epithelial cell counts. Resorption was found to be more prevalent in experimental teeth, and the probability of resorption in a given tooth decreased as the epithelial cell count increased. The findings of this study suggest that the epithelial cells within the periodontal ligament have a protective function in the prevention of dentoalveolar ankylosis and resorption. Evidence of an intimate interrelationship between periodontal nerve fibre and epithelial cell numbers could not be confirmed. The null hypothesis that epithelial cell rests of Malassez do not provide a protective function against ankylosis and external root resorption was rejected, and the null hypothesis that nerve fibres and epithelial cells are not inter-dependent was retained.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epithelial cell rests of malassez; dentoalveolar ankylosis; dental root resorption; peridontal ligament</field><field name="subject">Epithelial cells.</field><field name="subject">Ankylosis.</field><field name="subject">Rats.</field><field name="subject">Teeth--Roots.</field><field name="subject">Periodontal ligament.</field><field name="subject">Resorption (Physiology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cancer and the older person.</field><field name="creator">Cleary, Ann</field><field name="description">Older people represent an increasing proportion of new cancer diagnoses yet little is known about their experiences with cancer or their knowledge about risk factors, benefits of lifestyle modification to decrease risk or participation in early detection programs.

Australia&#8217;s total health expenditure for 2004-05 was $87.3 billion. The use of health care services and expenditure pattern is well established and Australia follows the pattern found in most developed countries, with the greatest expenditure occurring on services for the elderly. Australia is experiencing a shift in population structure, with the proportion of older people forecast to increase. It is expected there will be a need for a greater level of expenditure on health care as the number of elderly people increase. There is an emerging gap between the ability to supply health services and the demand for them. Furthermore, acute care hospital treatment is generally considered expensive and governments have been keen to control this expenditure. It is imperative that governments are able to make decisions based upon robust policy advice. There are serious consequences in both economic resource allocation and patient (and population) health outcomes if decisions about future health service structures are incorrect. In particular, there is a need for better decision-making around bed management at the strategic level. Strategic decision-making relates to decisions that will occur in a longer time frame. Decision-making can benefit from the use of modelling. Models represent a simplified version of reality that preserve the essential features of the situation being examined and can be used as a tool to investigate decision-making options, particularly in complex environments such as the health sector. Historically decision-making relating to hospital beds has used either simple &#8220;back of the envelope&#8221; calculations or adherence to &#8220;rule of thumb&#8221; approaches. Most of the approaches have relied upon using the average length of stay metric. While the modelling of hospital bed numbers is not new, much of this work has relied upon the average length of stay, which is known to be a poor measure. Harrison and Millard (1991) introduced the application of the compartmental flow model for modelling hospital bed occupancy and noted its potential to be used to influence policy decision-making. The flow model results are plausible and easily interpreted. However, relatively little work has focussed on the ability of these models to be generalized and be used for predictive purposes. The research undertaken for this thesis consisted of a series of modelling experiments that can be grouped into two key stages: whether the models could be successfully applied to the acute care data; and whether the models could be used for novel purposes, such as forecasting, evaluation of service change, and benchmarking. This entailed the further development of the model, and a consideration of basic modelling issues such as the balance between data-fit and model complexity, in order to capture better variation in the data and also to facilitate linkage to changes in population and seasonality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bed occupancy; bed modelling; flow modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reproductive biology of grapevines: factors that affect flowering and fruitset.</field><field name="creator">Longbottom, Mardi L.</field><field name="description">Molybdenum experiments: In Australia young Merlot vines sometimes suffer from vegetative disorders such as slow, zigzagged growth and leaf distortion. Merlot is also particularly known as a low- and inconsistent-yielding grape variety. Previous research showed that when foliar applications of molybdenum (Mo) were applied to Merlot vines the vegetative symptoms improved. More recently, when sodium molybdate was applied to Mo-deficient Merlot, yield improved; a function of increased bunch weight brought about by bigger berries. It has also been reported that at high concentrations, molybdenum might be detrimental to yield. Experiments were conducted on own-rooted Merlot (clone D3V14) vines in commercial vineyards in the Adelaide Hills (Hills) and at McLaren Vale, South Australia. Effects of molybdenum deficiency on the vegetative growth and yield of Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot: The aims of the current study were to: a) elucidate the mechanism by which molybdenum affects yield of Merlot; b) to monitor the effects of Mo-treatment on the balance between vine reproductive and vegetative growth; c) to monitor the residual effects of Mo-treatment on growth and yield of Merlot and; d) to determine whether high concentrations of molybdenum are detrimental to yield. Three rates of sodium molybdate were applied to vines in springtime (control = 0g, rate 1 = 0.101g and rate 2 = 0.202g sodium molybdate per vine). Vine molybdenum status was measured prior to treatment and again at flowering time using petiole, shoot tip and inflorescence analysis. The effects on vegetative growth were monitored at veraison, during dormancy and at budburst in the seasons following Mo-treatment. At flowering time, pollen vitality, pollen tube growth and flower structure were examined. Bunch number per vine, fruitset, berry weight and berry composition were measured at harvest. In the Hills, the controls had adequate molybdenum however, at McLaren Vale petiolar molybdenum concentration fell within the suggested deficiency range of 0.05-0.09 mg/kg in the petioles at flowering time. No visual symptoms of Mo-deficiency were observed on the experimental vines. At McLaren Vale, Mo-treatment reduced pruning weight and improved vine balance. Mo-treated vines in the Hills and at McLaren Vale were affected by delayed budburst in the season following Mo-treatment irrespective of their Mo-status. However, no seasonal carryover of molybdenum could be detected in tissue analysis at flowering time. Juice total soluble solids, pH and titratable acidity were not affected by Mo-treatment at McLaren Vale or in the Hills. However, juice from Mo-treated vines in the Hills had a significantly higher concentration of molybdenum than the controls. At McLaren Vale there was no significant difference in juice molybdenum concentration between treatments. In the Hills, yield was not affected by Mo-treatment. However, Mo-treated vines at McLaren Vale had significantly higher yields (approximately double) than the Mo-deficient controls. Bunch number per vine was not affected by Mo-treatment, either in the year that treatments were applied or in the following season. However, bunches from Mo-treated vines had significantly better fruitset resulting in more berries per bunch. Berry weight was affected by Mo-treatment in one season only. Yield was not detrimentally affected on vines that received the higher rate of sodium molybdate. In the Hills, Mo-treatment did not affect pollen numbers, pollen vitality or pollen tube growth. At McLaren Vale, where the controls were Mo-deficient, pollen vitality was not affected by Mo-treatment. However, pollen tube growth was significantly enhanced by Mo-treatment. Significantly more pollen tubes penetrated the ovules from Mo-treated vines and a higher proportion of ovaries had at least one penetrated ovule. Structural observations revealed that a significantly higher proportion of ovules from Mo-deficient vines were defective. The absence of an embryo sac in those ovules is probably the cause of pollen tube growth inhibition and subsequent poor fruitset. Effects of mode of pollination on yield of Merlot and the interacting effects of sodium molybdate sprays: Pollination experiments were conducted on field-grown own-rooted Merlot (clone D3V14) vines in commercial vineyards in the Adelaide Hills and at McLaren Vale in 2003-04 and in 2004-05. Inflorescences were supplied with supplementary Merlot pollen (self-pollination), with pollen from another variety (cross-pollination) or they were left to pollinate naturally (open pollination). In the Hills, mode of pollination did not affect fruitset or berry weight. In 2003-04 fruitset increased significantly at McLaren Vale when inflorescences were cross-pollinated with Semillon. Applying supplementary Merlot pollen also tended to improve fruitset, however none of the treatments affected berry weight. In 2004-05 there was no significant difference between treatments. These results indicate that Merlot may be a poor producer of pollen and may suffer from self-incompatibility. Given the significant improvements in yield gained by spring foliar applications of sodium molybdate to Mo-deficient Merlot vines, in 2005-06 a reciprocal experiment was conducted to separate the effects of Mo-treatment and mode of pollination on the male and female flower parts. The aims of this experiment were to: a) determine whether the male or female reproductive organs are more important in determining the success of fruitset of Merlot and; b) determine which remedial measure, Mo-treatment or pollination, is more effective at overcoming poor fruitset. Supplementary pollination treatments&#8212;cross-pollination (Semillon); self-pollination (Mo-deficient pollen); self-pollination (Mo-treated pollen) and; open-pollination&#8212;were applied to Mo-treated and Mo-deficient vines. Cross-pollinating Mo-deficient vines with Semillon significantly improved fruitset of Merlot compared to other pollination treatments on those vines, however applying molybdenum to the vines in springtime was more effective at improving fruitset. Within the Mo-treated vines the effects of supplementary pollination on fruitset were not thought to be of any practical significance. The results of this experiment provide further evidence that Mo-deficiency affects the female flower parts more than the male reproductive organs of Merlot. The occurrence of &#8216;star&#8217; flowers in Australia: In 2003 faulty flowers were discovered on Canada Muscat grown in the Coombe Vineyard at the University of Adelaide&#8217;s Waite Campus. The Canada Muscat flowers opened from the top in &#8216;star&#8217; formation in contrast to normal grape flowers, which shed the calyptra from its base. Star flowers were reported in French literature in the late 1800s. They were reported to as a symptom of a &#8216;disease&#8217; that caused &#8216;coulure&#8217;, the cure for which was vine removal. The current report is the first known report of star flowers occurring in Australia. Through dissemination of the news of this discovery, several star flower variants were found in other varieties in South Australia. The association of star flowers with poor berry development and the frequency of the occurrence of star flowers suggest that this flower aberration may be affecting yield to a greater extent than previously recognised. This study provides a detailed description of two types of star flowers: those that occur in response to environmental conditions and those that occur every season. Other star flower variants are also documented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapevine; reproductive biology; Vitis vinifera; Merlot; flowering; pollen tube; ovules, molybdenum; fruitset</field><field name="subject">Grapes Propagation Australia.</field><field name="subject">Plant-breeding Australia.</field><field name="subject">Viticulture Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in sustainable tomato production.</field><field name="creator">Martin, Ashley William</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis aimed to demonstrate the contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to the yield and fruit quality of field-grown processing tomatoes, and the potential to increase the sustainability of tomato production through greater fertiliser use efficiency by inoculating tomato seedlings with beneficial AM fungi. Previously, the conclusion that tomato growth is unresponsive to AM colonisation, particularly in high-P soils, has often been based on only a part of the tomato life-cycle. However, there is increasing evidence that that positive AM yield responses can occur in soils with relatively high plant-available P, and that AM responsiveness of tomato during vegetative growth may be a poor predictor of reproductive growth. A preceding industry study found that AM colonisation of field-grown processing tomatoes was very low, mostly less than 5%. The reason for the low colonisation was unclear since previous studies have shown that tomato can become relatively highly colonised by AM fungi. It was not known if farm practices, such as soil cultivation and chemical sterilisation, which have been shown to decrease AM colonisation of tomato and other crops, could have contributed to the low colonisation. Furthermore, it was unclear what contribution AM fungi were making to the yield and fruit quality of tomato in commercial production, and what their potential contribution might be if greater AM colonisation could be achieved through inoculating seedlings. Yield and fruit quality are important to tomato growers as both are used to calculate payment when the fruits are sold. Large amounts of soluble fertilisers, particularly P, are applied during tomato production with the aim of increasing yield and quality. However, fertiliser use efficiency, particularly P, on tomato farms has been identified as being low, and needing to be improved in order to increase the economic and environmental sustainability of tomato farming. Increasing P, and also other nutrients, such as Zn and Ca, in tomatoes could also help to improve agricultural sustainability by alleviating human malnutrition in developing countries and, in the case of Ca, have the potential to reduce blossom end rot, which can severely reduce marketable yield. There is considerable potential for AM fungi to assist in the supply of these nutrients to field-grown tomatoes. AM fungi are widely accepted to increase plant uptake of P. This has mostly been demonstrated in low-P soils, as increases in plant-available P are generally known to be detrimental to AM colonisation and any subsequent growth effects. However, there is increasing evidence of the ability of AM fungi to increase P uptake and yield even in high P soils. There is also good evidence of increased Zn uptake by mycorrhizal supply to plants. Evidence for increased Ca uptake in mycorrhizal plants is in comparison limited and conflicting, but has been demonstrated in some cases. It is possible that AM fungi could allow applications of these nutrients, particularly P, to be reduced while maintaining or increasing fruit yield and quality. However, the ability of indigenous or inoculated AM fungi to do so in the relatively high-P farm soils used in this project was unknown. In order to address these uncertainties a series of pot studies and a field experiment were conducted using field soils from tomato farms and an adjacent nature reserve for comparison. Data on soil characteristics from five farms, collected during the previous industry study, was analysed in conjunction with data from another farm located nearby with contrasting soil properties. Two farm soils and an unfarmed comparison were selected on the basis of their having contrasting levels of P, Zn and Ca, and pH, with the constraint that they were located within 50 km of each other to minimise travel time in the study area. The two farmed soils had a relatively high concentration of plant-available P (103 and 58 mg/kg Colwell), while plant-available P in the unfarmed soil was probably marginal to that required for healthy tomato growth (27 mg/kg Colwell). Samples of the soils were taken soon after commencement of the work and used in pot studies. Firstly, a bioassay was conducted to establish the ability of tomato to become colonised in the three field soils. AM colonisation of tomato and medic, which is known to be highly susceptible to AM colonisation, was compared between three harvests over an approx. 16 week period. Vegetative growth was also measured. The total colonisation of tomato mostly did not differ from that of medic at each harvest in any soil. Furthermore, despite the large differences in plant-available P between the three soils, colonisation and vegetative growth of tomato did not differ between soils at any harvest. In a subsequent pot experiment, the effect of colonisation by AM fungi in the three field soils on the vegetative and reproductive growth, and nutrient status of tomato was determined using the tomato mutant rmc (reduced mycorrhizal colonisation) and its progenitor 76R. A number of non-destructive vegetative and reproductive growth measurements were repeatedly measured over an approx. 24 week period. Destructive measurements were carried out at two harvests, 39 and 164 days after planting. Tomato 76R was again well colonised in all soils. Tomato rmc remained uncolonised, and was therefore an effective non-mycorrhizal control. AM colonisation had little effect on plant growth or nutrient status in any soil at the first harvest, but significant growth and nutrient responses were recorded at the second harvest. In particular, AM colonisation markedly increased vegetative growth in the unfarmed soil. AM colonisation did not affect vegetative growth in either of the farmed soils. However, AM colonisation increased reproductive growth, particularly yield over time, in all soils. AM colonisation increased shoot P concentration and content, but effects on Zn were mixed and largely inconclusive. Shoot Ca concentration and content were mostly reduced by AM colonisation. Similar patterns were observed in fruit nutrient status. The potential of pre-inoculation with AM fungi to increase AM colonisation and/or AM growth and nutrient effects in the field was considered. A commercial AM fungal inoculum was initially proposed for use, but was found to be unreliable and laboratory cultures of Scutellospora calospora and Glomus mosseae were used instead. Tomato seedlings were inoculated by amending a commercial seed-raising medium with an equal mixture of S. calospora and G. mosseae inocula. Seeds of tomato rmc, 76R and the commercial processing tomato cultivar U941 were sown and raised according to the practices followed by a commercial seedling nursery. After 9 weeks a sub-sample of inoculated seedlings of 76R and U941 had become colonised by both AM fungi, although the total colonisation was relatively low (approx. 10%). There was no difference in the shoot or root dry weights between inoculated and non-inoculated seedlings. The remaining seedlings were then used in the field experiment. Seedlings were transplanted amongst a commercial processing tomato crop on two farms and grown to maturity. A substitute farm with soil of moderate P (66 mg/kg Colwell) was used as tomatoes were no longer being grown on the initial farm with moderate P. Two P treatments, &#8216;normal&#8217; and &#8216;reduced&#8217; P fertilisation, were imposed in order to investigate the effect of P fertilisation on colonisation by indigenous and inoculated AM fungi, and growth and nutrient status of tomato in the field. Non-destructive growth measurements and soil core samples to assess mycorrhizal colonisation were taken mid-season (approx. 10 weeks after transplanting). Destructive growth measurements and core samples to assess colonisation were taken at harvest (approx. 19 weeks after transplanting). Colonisation of rmc was insubstantial and it again served as an effective non-mycorrhizal control to 76R. Colonisation was insubstantial in all treatments on the farm where soil had moderate plant-available P. On the other farm, where soil had relatively high plant-available P, colonisation of all plants was low mid-season, but was mostly substantial (&gt;20%) in 76R and U941 at harvest. Low colonisation on both farms was probably the result of farming practices, particularly soil cultivation. However, a combination of inoculation and reduced P fertilisation increased colonisation. Colonisation by indigenous AM fungi had no effect on the growth or nutrient status of field grown tomatoes. In contrast, pre-inoculation with AM fungi increased fruit yield by a mean of approx. 40% in 76R and U941. This was the result of an 18% increase in the fresh weight of individual fruits and, when inoculation was combined with reduced P fertilisation, a 21% increase in the number of fruits on each plant. The increase in the number of fruits on each plant was associated with an increase in the number of flowers at the most advanced growth stage. Inoculation also increased vegetative growth, and fruit P, Zn and Ca contents. A small (4%) decrease in fruit brix was more than offset by increased yield. This study has shown that while AM fungi indigenous to tomato farm soils have the ability to substantially colonise tomato, they appear to have little effect on tomato growth, yield or nutrition in the field. In contrast, inoculation of tomato seedlings with mutualistic AM fungi during nursery production can substantially increase the growth, yield and fruit nutrient contents of field-grown tomatoes under commercial conditions. This increase could also be enhanced by a reduction in P fertilisation. Increased yield and fruit nutrient contents, and decreased P fertilisation neatly address the aims of increased agricultural sustainability. Incorporating pre-inoculation of tomato into existing farming practices has a potential to increase the productivity and sustainability of processing tomato production worldwide.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; tomato; Solanum lycopersicum; growth response; reproduction; field studies; nutrient response</field><field name="subject">Mycorrhizal fungi.

It improves with weight loss, however currently no specific dietary recommendations exist and there may be abnormalities in appetite regulation in PCOS that contribute to difficulty in weight management. Aims To assess the effect of 1) short and long-term weight loss and weight maintenance strategies on weight loss, reproductive and metabolic parameters in overweight women with PCOS and to 2) assess the relative effect of weight loss on cardiovascular risk factors and 3) postprandial appetite, appetite hormones (ghrelin, CCK, PYY) and food intake in overweight women with and without PCOS. Results Overweight women with PCOS followed an 8-week weight loss (2 meal replacements/day, 4904.4&#177;127 kJ, n=32) followed by a 6 month carbohydrate (&lt;120 g/day) or fat restricted (&lt;50 g/day) weight maintenance regime (n=23). Reductions in weight (5.6&#177;2.4 kg) and improvements in body composition, insulin, reproductive hormones and menstrual cyclicity occurred and were sustained equivalently for both diet groups. We then assessed the effect of weight loss (4.2&#177;0.7 kg over 8 weeks as described above) in overweight women with (n=15) and without (n=17) PCOS on cardiovascular risk factors. All subjects had similar improvements in body composition, triglycerides, reproductive hormones and fasting and post-prandial insulin. C-reactive protein decreased with weight loss for non-PCOS women (-1.2&#177;0.5 mg/L, P=0.025) but not for PCOS women. We finally assessed appetite regulation in PCOS. Women with (n=20) and without (n=12) PCOS followed a standard protein (55% carbohydrate, 15% protein) or high protein diet (40% carbohydrate, 30% protein) for 16 weeks (~6000 kJ/day). Non-PCOS subjects were more satiated (P=0.001) and less hungry (P=0.007) after the test meals and had a 70% higher fasting baseline ghrelin (P=0.011), a greater increase in fasting ghrelin (57.5 versus 34.0%, P=0.033), a greater post-prandial ghrelin decrease at week 16 (113.5&#177;46.3 versus 49.3&#177;12.2 pg/mL, P=0.05) and a greater maximal decrease in post-prandial ghrelin (-144.1&#177;58.4 versus -28.9&#177;14.2 pg/mL, P=0.02) following weight loss than subjects with PCOS. Lastly, women with (n=14) and without (n=14) PCOS undertook an 8-week weight loss regime (4.2&#177;0.7 kg as described above). At week 0 and 8, women with PCOS again displayed lower ghrelin levels (P=0.01 and P=0.097 respectively) and a lesser post-prandial ghrelin decrease (P=0.048 and P=0.069 respectively) but similar post-prandial appetite, buffet consumption and fasting or post-prandial peptide YY and cholecystokinin compared to women without PCOS. Conclusion Meal replacements and moderate macronutrient restriction are effective strategies for the dietary management of PCOS. Equivalent weight losses improved cardiovascular risk factors similarly for overweight women with and without PCOS with the exception of CRP which did not decrease with weight loss for overweight women with PCOS. PCOS status is associated with altered fasting and post-prandial ghrelin levels but is not consistently associated with other impairments in post-prandial gut peptides or food intake. Further investigation is required to assess if appetite regulation is impaired in PCOS and the optimal strategies and amount of weight loss for improvement of reproductive and metabolic parameters in PCOS.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polycystic ovary syndrome Diet therapy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological attributes of drought-adaptation and associated molecular markers in the seri/babax hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.) population.</field><field name="creator">Olivares-Villegas, Juan Jose</field><field name="description">Agronomic and physiological traits associated with drought adaptation were assessed within the Seri/Babax recombinant inbred line population, derived from parents similar in height and maturity but divergent in their sensitivity to drought.  Field trials under different water regimes were conducted over three years in Mexico and under rainfed conditions in Australia.  Under drought, canopy temperature (CT) was the single-most drought-adaptive trait contributing to a higher performance (R2= 0.71, p&lt;0.0001), highly heritable (h2= 0.65, p&lt;0.0001) and consistently associated with yield phenotypically (r= -0.75, p&lt;0.0001) and genetically [R(g)= -0.95, p&lt;0.0001]. CT epitomises a mechanism of dehydration avoidance expressed throughout the growing season and across latitudes, which can be utilised as a selection criteria to identify high-yielding wheat genotypes or as an important predictor of yield performance under drought. Early response under drought, suggested by a high association of CT with estimates of biomass at booting (r= -0.44, p&lt;0.0001), leaf chlorophyll (r= -0.22,p&lt;0.0001) and plant height (r= -0.64, p&lt;0.0001), contrast with the small relationships with anthesis and maturity (averaged, r= -0.10, p&lt;0.0001), and with osmotic potential (r= -0.20, p&lt;0.0001). Results suggest that the ability to extract water from the soil under increasing soil water deficit is a major attribute of drought adaptation.  Ample genetic variation and significant transgressive segregation under drought suggested a polygenic governance feasible of dissection via molecular markers of CT and associated physiological and agronomic traits. Bulked segregant analysis of selected secondary traits was utilised as an alternative to complete genome mapping, due to a low polymorphism (27%) within the cross and limited chromosomic linkage of loci. The assessment of the extremes of expression in a genotypic subset with a composite molecular database of 127 markers (PCR-based and AFLPs) allowed evaluation of the three hexaploid wheat genomes and coverage of all chromosomic groups, except 3D. One-way analysis of variance indicated significant associations of loci explaining phenotypic variance under drought and rainfed conditions, of 20-70% in Mexico and 20-45% in Australia (F&gt;5.00, p&lt;0.05).  Significant loci were established in both latitudes for all physiological and agronomic traits assessed via BSA, with CT being the trait with the most numerous associations (in Mexico, 34 loci; in Australia, 24).  Results demonstrate an efficient development of molecular markers associated to physiological traits under specific soil water conditions in Mexico and Australia, and suggest further genomic and transcriptomic studies be conducted for unravelling the complex relationship between drought adaptation and performance under drought.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drought adaptation, canopy temperature, physiological breeding, yield potential, bulked segregant analysis, molecular markers</field><field name="subject">Wheat Physiology.

It investigates some of the ways in which traditional folk melodies are utilised in violin repertoire and considers the implications for performance. It recognises that when performing music inspired by folk idioms the classical violinist often needs to adopt a different set of technical and musical objectives relevant to the cultural origin of the work. The submission takes the form of two CD recordings with a supporting exegesis. The exegesis discusses those aspects of the performances that stem from the cultural traditions to which the repertoire is related. Due to the broad nature of this topic my investigation was confined to selected works that stemmed from English and Hungarian traditional music. The exegesis examines the relevance of the research and the application of these discoveries in performance. The main focus is the incorporation of traditional Hungarian characteristics in the performance of Bart&#243;k&#8217;s Rhapsody No 2 for Violin and Piano, and Kod&#225;ly&#8217;s Duo for Violin and Violoncello, Op 7.

They are often used as components in cinema sound systems where the sound can be broadcast evenly onto the audience at all frequencies, improving the listening experience. The sound distribution, or beamwidth, is related to the shape of the horn and is not predicted adequately by existing analytical horn models. The aim of the work described in this thesis is to develop a method to optimise the shape of the horn to give a specified beamwidth, which is ideally frequency independent, thus giving a high quality listening experience. This thesis begins with a thorough review of the literature relevant to modelling and optimising horn loaded loudspeakers. It gives an introduction to horn loaded loudspeakers, and describes traditional modelling approaches and their limitations. The applications of alternative modelling techniques to horn loaded loudspeakers, which have been found in the literature, are critiqued as are horn optimisation techniques. To examine the validity of the plane wave radiation assumption made by a number of horn models, experiments were undertaken to measure the sound field at the mouth of two small horns. These horns are representative of the size and design required for cinema loudspeaker systems, but are axisymmetric. The sound field was measured by an automated microphone traverse with almost 3500 measurements made across the face of each horn, providing a high spatial resolution. The results of the measurements showed that at low frequencies the sound fields from both the conical and exponential horns were similar and that above a certain frequency the sound field became more complex. An analysis of the data, using a modal decomposition with cylindrical duct modes of the same diameter as the mouth of the horns, revealed that almost all of the energy in the system existed in modes with no circumferential variation, and that above a certain limiting frequency, plane waves ceased to exist at the mouth of each horn. This work showed that any numerical model developed must be capable of efficiently modelling variations in the sound field across the mouth of the horn, and that models based on plane wave approximations should not be used for modelling these experimental horns, at least above a certain critical frequency. Numerical models able to accurately and quickly calculate the far field pressure from arbitrary shapes are also investigated. Calculations of the beamwidth from the analytical solutions for a 45? vibrating spherical cap, mounted on the surface of a unit sphere, were compared with those obtained from an implementation of the direct Boundary Element Method (BEM) and a source superposition technique. The investigation found excellent agreement between these results for mesh densities of 6 elements per wavelength, the generally recommended minimum mesh density for BEM simulations. The source superposition technique was significantly faster than the direct BEM for comparable accuracy in the far field. There was also excellent agreement between analytical calculations and all of the numerical methods for a mesh density of 3 elements per wavelength. This is a significant finding as it allows a reduction in mesh density, and hence matrix size and solution time, for a given accuracy of far field solution. Alternatively, higher frequencies can be reached for a given mesh density. It was also found that the source superposition technique produced matrices that are highly diagonally dominant, and well suited to fast iterative solution techniques. The validation of the numerical methods for modelling the beamwidth of horn loaded loudspeakers was undertaken by comparing the source superposition technique to experiment, as well as with an alternative numerical method, the direct BEM. It was shown that such models are capable of modelling the sound field generated by a horn loaded loudspeaker from a specification of the horn geometry. This accuracy of the model is adequate for design purposes within the given frequency range. Both the direct BEM and the source superposition technique are capable of modelling the experimental beamwidth; however, the source superposition technique is considerably faster and hence more suitable for use in optimisation techniques. During the literature review, a type of sonar transducer called a Constant Beamwidth Transducer (CBT) was found that was able to produce an easily specified frequency independent beamwidth. These are desirable characteristics for the design of a horn. The concept used in the development of these transducers, a specified velocity profile over the surface of a sphere, is explored in this thesis in relation to horn design. A semi-analytical technique, using solutions to the Helmholtz equation in spherical coordinates and numerical integration of Legendre functions, was developed to efficiently calculate the beamwidth for an arbitrary velocity profile over the surface of a sphere. It was used to calculate the beamwidth for four different velocity profiles: a spherical cap mounted on the surface of a sphere; a CBT profile; and two smooth tailed CBT velocity profiles. The results showed that the smooth tailed CBT velocity profiles produce the smoothest beamwidth, possibly at the expense of low frequency performance. It was also found that the performance of each velocity profile is consistent with CBT theory, with the best performing profile having the highest rate of energy decay in the spherical Legendre modes. CBT theory also suggests that the performance of the CBT transducers is unaffected by the removal of the inactive part of the sphere, i.e. that part over which the velocity profile is zero. This was confirmed numerically by simulations using the source superposition technique. The numerical model developed to investigate the CBT was used to test robust optimisation techniques suitable for optimising horn loaded loudspeakers. Two different objective functions were considered, one that uses least squares to drive the velocity profile to a minimum, and the other that uses a constrained optimisation of a smoothness parameter. It was found that constrained optimisation was able to robustly find an optimal solution in an acceptable number of objective function evaluations. As the cost of evaluating the objective function for horn loaded loudspeakers is high, the potential of surrogate modelling techniques, designed to reduce the overall number of objective function evaluations, was investigated. Optimal solutions were found for two different parameterisations of the velocity profile. One parameterisation was similar to the smooth tailed CBT velocity profiles and the other, which allowed a more variable velocity profile, was defined by B&#40617;er curves. The idea of CBT theory, that is, defining an optimal velocity profile over a spherical cap, was applied to the optimisation of horn loaded loudspeakers. A number of different horn geometry parameterisations were developed, with the aim of producing an optimal velocity profile over the mouth of the horn. The robust optimisation techniques developed previously were applied, and an optimal horn geometry calculated. It was found that a very simple geometry parameterisation could produce near constant beamwidth performance while keeping the desired design (or nominal) beamwidth, and that a more complicated parameterisation (using splines) could not keep the nominal beamwidth but provided superior constant beamwidth performance. A series of optimisations using the spline parameterisation were undertaken to map the design space, with the result being a design chart for constant beamwidth horns. The desired performance characteristics of a constant beamwidth horn such as length, mouth to throat ratio or nominal beamwidth can be specified, and the horn performance and specifications easily read from a chart. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop fast and reliable optimisation techniques for horn loaded loudspeakers to achieve a robust horn design method for cinema loudspeakers. This thesis achieved this aim for axisymmetric horn geometries by: developing fast and well validated numerical methods for calculating the beamwidth of horn loaded loudspeakers; by examining how optimal beamwidth control is achieved in CBTs, and how this can be achieved in horn loaded loudspeakers; by developing robust objective functions and optimisation techniques capable of finding an optimal beamwidth from a parameterised geometry; and by developing a design chart for constant beamwidth horns.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Loudspeakers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arid land condition assessment and monitoring using mulitspectral and hyperspectral imagery.</field><field name="creator">Jafari, Reza</field><field name="description">Arid lands cover approximately 30% of the earth&#8217;s surface. Due to the broadness, remoteness, and harsh condition of these lands, land condition assessment and monitoring using ground-based techniques appear to be limited. Remote sensing imagery with its broad areal coverage, repeatability, cost and time-effectiveness has been suggested and used as an alternative approach for more than three decades. This thesis evaluated the potential of different remote sensing techniques for assessing and monitoring land condition of southern arid lands of South Australia. There were four specific objectives: 1) to evaluate vegetation indices derived from multispectral satellite imagery for prediction of vegetation cover; 2) to compare vegetation indices and field measurements for detecting vegetation changes and assessing land condition; 3) to examine the potential of hyperspectral imagery for discriminating vegetation components that are important in land management using unmixing techniques; and 4) to test whether spatial heterogeneity in land surface reflectance can provide additional information about land condition and effects of management on land condition. The study focused on Kingoonya and Gawler Soil Conservation Districts that were dominated by chenopod shrublands and low open woodlands over sand plains and dunes. The area has been grazed predominately by sheep for more than 100 years and land degradation or desertification due to overgrazing is evident in some parts of the region, especially around stock watering points. Grazing is the most important factor that influences land condition. Four full scenes of Landsat TM and ETM+ multispectral and Hyperion hyperspectral data were acquired over the study area. The imagery was acquired in dry seasons to highlight perennial vegetation cover that has an important role in land condition assessment and monitoring. Slope-based, distance-based, orthogonal transformation and plant-water sensitive vegetation indices were compared with vegetation cover estimates at monitoring points made by state government agency staff during the first Pastoral Lease assessments in 1991. To examine the performance of vegetation indices, they were tested at two scales: within two contrasting land systems and across broader regional landscapes. Of the vegetation indices evaluated, selected Stress Related Vegetation Indices using red, nearinfrared and mid-infrared bands consistently showed significant relationships with vegetation cover at both land system and landscape scales. Estimation of vegetation cover was more accurate within land systems than across broader regions. Total perennial and ephemeral plant cover was predicted best within land systems (R2=0.88), while combined vegetation, plant litter and soil cryptogam crust cover was predicted best at landscape scale (R2=0.39). The results of applying one of the stress related vegetation indices (STVI-4) to 1991 TM and 2002 ETM+ Landsat imagery to detect vegetation changes and to 2005 Landsat TM imagery to discriminate Land Condition Index (LCI) classes showed that it is an appropriate vegetation index for both identifying trends in vegetation cover and assessing land condition. STVI-4 highlighted increases and decreases in vegetation in different parts of the study area. The vegetation change image provided useful information about changes in vegetation cover resulting from variations in climate and alterations in land management. STVI-4 was able to differentiate all three LCI classes (poor, fair and good condition) in low open woodlands with 95% confidence level. In chenopod shrubland and Mount Eba country only poor and good conditions were separable spectrally. The application of spectral mixture analysis to Hyperion hyperspectral imagery yielded five distinct end-members: two associated with vegetation cover and the remaining three associated with different soils, surface gravel and stone. The specific identity of the image end-members was determined by comparing their mean spectra with field reflectance spectra collected with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) Field Spec Pro spectrometer. One vegetation end-member correlated significantly with cottonbush vegetation cover (R2=0.89), distributed as patches throughout the study area. The second vegetation end-member appeared to map green and grey-green perennial shrubs (e.g. Mulga) and correlated significantly with total vegetation cover (R2=0.68). The soil and surface gravel and stone end-members that mapped sand plains, sand dunes, and surface gravel and stone did not show significant correlations with the field estimates of these soil surface components. I examined the potential of a spatial heterogeneity index, the Moving Standard Deviation Index (MSDI), around stock watering points and nearby ungrazed reference sites. One of the major indirect effects of watering points in a grazed landscape is the development around them of a zone of extreme degradation called a piosphere. MSDI was applied to Landsat red band for detection and assessment of these zones. Results showed watering points had significantly higher MSDI values than non-degraded reference areas. Comparison of two vegetation indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Perpendicular Distance vegetation index (PD54), which were used as reference indices, showed that the PD54 was more sensitive than NDVI for assessing land condition in this perennial-dominated arid environment. Piospheres were found to be more spatially heterogeneous in land surface reflectance. They had higher MSDI values compared to non-degraded areas, and spatial heterogeneity decreased with increasing distance from water points. The study has demonstrated overall that image-based indices derived from Landsat multispectral and Hyperion hyperspectral imagery can be used with field methods to assess and monitor vegetation cover (and consequently land condition) of southern arid lands of South Australia in a quick and efficient way. Relationships between vegetation indices, end-members and field measurements can be used to estimate vegetation cover and monitor its variation with time in broad areas where field-based methods are not effective. Multispectral vegetation indices can be used to assess and discriminate ground-based land condition classes. The sandy-loam end-member extracted from Hyperion imagery has high potential for monitoring sand dunes and their movement over time. The MSDI showed that spatial heterogeneity in land surface reflectance can be used as a good indicator of land degradation. It differentiated degraded from nondegraded areas successfully and detected grazing gradients slightly better than widely used vegetation indices. Results suggest further research using these remote sensing techniques is warranted for arid land condition assessment and monitoring in South Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arid land assessment and monitoring; Landsat imagery; vegetation indices; hyperion imagery; spectral mixture analysis; landscape spatial heterogeneity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological benefits of 'environmental flows' in the Eastern Mt. Lofty Ranges.</field><field name="creator">Deegan, Brian Martin</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the impact of anthropogenic alterations in four riverine catchments of the Eastern Mt. Lofty Ranges, South Australia, to identify if creek restoration via environmental flows is a viable management option and if so, to determine; 1) Whether an aquatic/riparian viable seed bank was present and if so what was its composition 2) The ecological condition of selected riverine reaches. This in combination with the seed bank study would identify those creeks that would most benefit from the imposition of environmental flows 3) The response of key species to the water regimes likely to result from the imposition of environmental flows 4) The influence of nutrient enrichment under a fluctuating water level and to use this information to formulate best practice policy for environmental flows 5) Whether aquatic plants promoted by environmental flows were a significant fraction of the diet for higher trophic levels represented by Trichopterans and Amphipods. The seed banks were of comparable density (ranging from 4,000 to 110,000 seeds m-2) and species richness (ranging from 13 to 20 aquatic / riparian species) to the seed banks of other Australian rivers and wetlands, but this varied significantly among riverine sections and across catchments. Out of a total of 81 species recorded, 51 were classified as terrestrial (63% of all species recorded). What is of greater concern was the number of exotic (both aquatic and terrestrial) species recorded: 43% of the species recorded in the Angas, 47% of the species in the Finniss, 39% of the species in Tookayerta creek and 43% of the species recorded in Currency creek were exotic, which are significantly higher in comparison to other Australian studies. There were 24 to 28 aquatic/riparian species recorded in the extant vegetation of each catchment that were not recorded in their seed banks. Likewise, a number of species (3 to 7) were recorded in each catchments seed bank that were not recorded in the extant vegetation of those catchments. A species of particular interest is Crassula sieberana, which is on the State endangered plant species list. Indices for assessing the ecological condition, health or integrity of a river or riparian habitat were employed to investigate the relationship between the river/riparian habitat and the land and water management practices associated with those habitats. Of the four catchments surveyed, each catchment identified a unique set of site parameters (subindex indicators) that were strongly correlated with its ecological condition. Indicator species analyses revealed pasture grasses to be a significant indicator of reaches in very poor condition (p = 0.0010) along the Finniss and Baumea juncea of those reaches in good condition (p = 0.0230). Along the Angas, Cotula coronopifolia was an indicator of those reaches in average condition (p = 0.0240) and along Currency creek, Cladium procerum was an indicator of those reaches in good condition (p = 0.0190). However, when all 115 surveyed reaches were analysed together, those reaches of average to excellent ecological condition were all strongly correlated (R2 = 0.50) with the subindex indicators: bank stability, % riparian cover, grazing, fenced, aquatic wood, and width of the riparian vegetation. This would indicate that these subindex indicators are the main site parameters determining the ecological condition of a riverine reach and hence its restoration potential. Those catchments or sub-catchments containing a high proportion of reaches classified to be in poor to very poor condition had significantly reduced seed banks. The influence of water level fluctuations (&#177;15 cm, &#177;30 cm and &#177;45 cm) on the growth of four species of emergent macrophytes (Cyperus vaginatus, Phragmites australis, Typha domingensis and Triglochin procerum) were species dependent. These species naturally inhabits different zones across the elevation gradient. C. vaginatus, which has a high elevation preference, was strongly inhibited by increasing water depth and fluctuations in water levels. In contrast, species with an intermediate elevation preference, such as Phragmites australis and Typha domingensis, were more tolerant to both depth and water level fluctuations. However, the biomass and relative growth rate (RGR) of T. domingensis and P. australis were depressed when grown under the combination of deep elevation and a highly fluctuating water level (&#177;45 cm). Between the static and &#177;45 cm amplitude treatments, growth of T. domingensis was inhibited by 52%. The growth of P. australis appeared to be enhanced by fluctuating water levels and only showed a severe drop-off in growth in the deep elevation, &#177;45 cm amplitude treatment. In C. vaginatus the RGR was dependent of the average emergent surface area (and the implied rate of carbon acquisition)(p&lt;0.0001; r2=0.7196; F=87.276; n=36; RGR (mg g-1 day-1) = -5.096 + 4.313 &#215; ln (Average emergent surface area (cm2)), but this was not the case in P. australis and T. domingensis (p&gt;0.05) even when the photosynthetic canopy was partially inundated by rising water levels. Yet these two species demonstrated different growth rates when grown under different water regime amplitudes and at different elevations. Growth of T. procerum did not respond to either amplitude or elevation, but its RGR remained negative. This suggests that another factor(s) was limiting the growth of P. australis, T. domingensis and possibly T. procerum, a factor that varies with water level. Cyperus gymnocaulos had significantly increased plant performance (p &lt;.0001) with increased nutrient loading rates but this effect was significantly reduced under a fluctuating water regime (p =0.0007). Remarkably, under a fluctuating regime, P. australis had a significant reduction in performance with increased nutrient loading rates (p =0.0013), whereas T. domingensis performance was significantly limited (p =0.034) even with increased nutrient loading rates. T. procerum too had increased plant performance with increased nutrient loading rates but this effect was reduced under a fluctuating regime. The morphological response by T. procerum demonstrates that it is mainly limited by the nutrient loading rates and not the water regime. However, it was significantly limited/reduced by its increased turnover rates caused by a stochastic fluctuating water regime. Illustrating that in fact the effects of nutrient enrichment on T. procerum were independent of water regime but bearing in mind that water regime is the primary factor determining the productivity of this species. For those species with higher elevation preferences, e.g. C. gymnocaulos, or low elevation preference, e.g. T. procerum, the effects of nutrient loading are independent of water regime, whereas those species with an intermediate elevation preference, e.g. P. australis and T. domingensis the effects of nutrient loading are largely dependent on the water regime. Amphipoda and Trichoptera selectively fed on succulent semi-emergent macrophytes across sites of average to excellent ecological condition (31-64% to 65-97% of diet), depending on availability. These semi-emergent macrophytes contained the lowest C:N ratio (&#8776;10:1), closest to that of their consumers (&#8776;5:1) and therefore the highest nutritional content. In degraded riverine reaches, there were limited food resources available, hence course particulate organic matter (CPOM) formed the main dietary components of Amphipoda (20-53% of diet) even though it had the highest C:N ratio (&#8776;40:1). At site VP. 1, filamentous algae was the main dietary component of Trichoptera (48-64% of diet) due to its availability and its low C:N ratio (&#8776;14:1) in comparison to the other primary sources available. The imbalanced consumer-resource nutrient ratios in these degraded riverine reaches are likely to impose constraints on the growth and reproduction of their aquatic shredder communities with probable knock-on effects at higher trophic levels. The installation of environmental flows to restore and promote aquatic/riparian plant communities, which in turn would benefit higher trophic organisms, is a viable and realistic management option along selected reaches. Those selected reaches contain a significant aquatic/riparian seed bank and with sufficient physical habitat remaining to promote their germination and establishment. However, the imposition of environmental flows as a control measure to prevent the colonisation and dominance of particular species (T. domingensis and P. australis) was deemed to be redundant as a management technique given the limited water resources available.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rivers Environmental aspects South Australia Lofty, Mount, Ranges.</field><field name="subject">Riparian ecology South Australia Lofty, Mount, Ranges.</field><field name="subject">Watershed management South Australia Lofty, Mount, Ranges.</field><field name="subject">Lofty, Mount, Ranges (S.

Modification of dietary intake and weight loss can ameliorate these risk factors and may impede the development of atherosclerosis. CVD risk can be assessed by measurement of both traditional e.g. lipid levels, glucose and blood pressure and novel risk markers of CVD e.g. FMD, levels of adhesion molecules, inflammatory markers and adipokines. Changes in these measurements are used to determine effects, if any, of dietary interventions. The studies in this thesis focus on the relationship between nutrition and vascular function and the effects of modifying dietary composition either with, or without weight loss. The primary hypotheses addressed were that a high saturated fat diet would have adverse effects on markers of CVD risk., that short and long term weight loss would have beneficial effects on these markers, that a conventional low fat, high glycaemic load diet would also have adverse effects on these markers and that weight loss would attenuate the BP response to salt. Six studies were conducted to address these hypotheses. The effects of saturated fat were investigated in chapters 3 and 6. In chapter 3, a high saturated fat diet impaired FMD and increased the level of the adhesion molecule Pselectin compared with a high MUFA, a high PUFA, or a low fat, high glycaemic load diet in weight stability. The high fat, high glycaemic load caused increases of 23-39% in TG and decreases of 10-15% in HDL-C but despite these adverse effects there was no change in FMD. In chapter 6, subjects on a very low carbohydrate/high saturated fat diet lost approximately 1 kg more weight over 8 weeks than those on a conventional low fat diet. While other CVD risk factors, glucose, insulin, E and P-selectin, ICAM-1 and PAI-1 levels all improved FMD did not change in either diet. Reductions in LDL-C and CRP were greater on the conventional diet. The effects of weight loss on CVD risk factors were also investigated in the studies in chapters 4, 5, 7 &amp; 8. In chapter 4, moderate weight loss using 2 different low fat diets resulted in improvements in PAI-1 and sICAM-1 but there was no change in FMD. Similarly in chapter 5 weight loss on a low carbohydrate/low saturated fat diet did not change FMD but there were other benefits including reductions in glucose and insulin, LDL-C, adhesion molecules, VCAM1 and ICAM1. Adiponectin did not change after short term weight loss in either of the studies in chapters 5 or 6. In chapter 7 salt loading increased ambulatory day time BP and this response was not altered by short term moderate weight loss. The long term effects of weight loss were investigated in chapters 5, 7 and 8. In chapter 5, after 52 weeks, there was sustained weight loss of 5% but no change in FMD while adiponectin levels increased and LDL-C and insulin were substantially reduced. In chapter 7 the BP response to salt loading remained unchanged despite weight loss maintenance. Finally in chapter 8 weight loss was predicted by protein intake and there were reductions in CVD risk demonstrated by decreases in insulin, TG and CRP and increases in HDL-C. The studies in this thesis demonstrate that moderate weight loss has beneficial effects on traditional and novel cardiovascular disease risk markers but does not have a beneficial effect on FMD regardless of dietary composition. A high saturated fat diet has detrimental effects on novel CVD risk markers in weight stability but weight loss attenuates this effect. A high saturated fat diet may have detrimental effects on adhesion molecules in weight stability and may attenuate the beneficial effects of weight loss on LDL-C and CRP. Moderate long term weight loss maintenance has beneficial effects on most but not all CVD risk markers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition; weight loss; hypertension; obesity; flow mediated dilatation</field><field name="subject">Nutrition.</field><field name="subject">Blood-vessels Diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The clinical pharmacology of methadone induction.</field><field name="creator">Morton, Erin Brooke</field><field name="description">Methadone is the foremost, long-standing pharmacological treatment for opioid addiction. It has been shown to have considerable cost benefit to the community and to decrease mortality. Despite methadone's decades-long use, much is still unknown regarding its clinical pharmacology, particularly during the induction phase of Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT). Contrary to previous reports, I found systemic methadone clearance does not increase significantly between induction and steady state phases of MMT, and did not approach the previously reported 3-fold increase. Clinical dose prescription based on the premise of metabolism auto-induction could increase risk of respiratory depression. Significant differences between R- and S-methadone pharmacokinetics showed the importance of stereoselective measurement in a clinical situation and significant plasma concentration-effect relationships demonstrated their potential influence on induction pharmacodynamics.  Small increases in CYP3A4 activity as measured by the Erythromycin Breath Test from Day 1 to Day 40 of MMT were not correlated with changes in methadone clearance. CYP3A4 activities were informative but would be insufficient for use as a sole predictor of methadone clearance during MMT. Clinically significant respiratory depression occurred in 20% of subjects, at times of peak plasma R-methadone concentrations, after reports of withdrawal symptoms at pre-dose sampling times, and irrespective of illicit opioid use. Utilisation of both respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation measurements provided a good indication of respiratory risk for individuals.  Although prior opioid use was a strong predictor of continued use during MMT, adoption of a new equation ("abc") and comprehensive documentation of each individual's MMT may increase prediction of MMT success. Even in light of recent advances in opioid substitution therapies, MMT's advantages ensure it is still at the forefront of addiction treatment. Careful choice of methodology enabled narrowing of this investigation to those factors most relevant in methadone pharmacology and most responsible for MMT success or failure, and therefore extending previous knowledge of this area. Such data might be utilised to develop a clinically applicable model for MMT, and help provide clients with a safe and uncomplicated transition from heroin use to methadone induction in the future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methadone maintenance.</field><field name="subject">Opioid abuse Treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semantically annotated multi-protocol adapter nodes: a new approach to implementing network-based information systems using ontologies.</field><field name="creator">Falkner, Nickolas John Gowland</field><field name="description">Network-based information systems are an important class of distributed systems that serve large and diverse user communities with information and essential network services. Centrally defined standards for interoperation and information exchange ensure that any required functionality is provided but do so at the expense of flexibility and ease of system evolution. This thesis presents a novel approach to implementing network-based information systems in a knowledge-representation-based format using an ontological description of the service. Our approach allows us to provide flexible distributed systems that can conform to global standards while still allowing local developments and protocol extensions. We can share data between systems if we provide an explicit specification of the relationship between the knowledge in the system and the structure and nature of the values shared between systems. Existing distributed systems may share data based on the values and structures of that data but we go beyond syntax-based value exchange to introduce a semantically-based exchange of knowledge. The explicit statement of the semantics and syntax of the system in a machine-interpretable form provides the automated integration of different systems through the use of adapter nodes. Adapter nodes are members of more than one system and seamlessly transport data between the systems. We develop a multi-tier software architecture that characterises the values held inside the system depending on an ontological classification of their structure and context to allow the definition of values in terms of the knowledge that they represent. Initially, received values are viewed as data, with no structural information. Structural and type information, and the context of the value can now be associated with it through the use of ontologies, leading to a value-form referred to as knowledge: a value that is structurally and contextually rich. This is demonstrated through an implementation process employing RDF, OWL and SPARQL to develop an ontological description of a network-based information system. The implementation provides evidence for the benefits and costs of representing a system in such a manner, including a complexity-based analysis of system performance. The implementation demonstrates the ability of such a representation to separate global standards-based requirements from local user requirements. This allows the addition of behaviour, specific to local needs, to otherwise global systems in a way that does not compromise the global standards. Our contribution is in providing a means for network-based information systems to retain the benefits of their global interaction while still allowing local customisation to meet the user expectations. This thesis presents a novel use of ontologically-based representation and tools to demonstrate the benefits of the multi-tier software architecture with a separation of the contents of the system into data, information and knowledge. Our approach increases the ease of interoperation for large-scale distributed systems and facilitates the development of systems that can adapt to local requirements while retaining their wider interoperability. Further, our approach provides a strong contextual framework to ground concepts in the system and also supports the amalgamation of data from many sources to provide rich and extensible network-based information system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic data processing -- Distributed processing.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks -- Design and construction.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular systematics and conservation genetics of gliding petaurids (Marsupialia: petauridae).</field><field name="creator">Malekian, Mansoureh</field><field name="description">The gliding petaurids are small sized arboreal and nocturnal marsupials restricted to Australia and the New Guinean region. They have suffered range contractions since European settlement, and most of the species are of conservation concern, either nationally or at a state level. This study applied molecular approaches to investigate several questions involving Petaurus species which may provide valuable insights for their conservation and management of species. The objectives of this study included an examination of phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships among Petaurus species, an assessment of phylogeographic structure within P. breviceps and an investigation of genetic diversity, social structure and mating system of P. breviceps in fragmented habitats. A broad molecular systematics study of the genus Petaurus was first undertaken. Two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and ND4) and a nuclear gene marker (&#969;-globin) were screened for sequence variation in samples obtained from across the distribution of petaurid species, including Australia, New Guinea and its surrounding islands. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the monophyly of the genus Petaurus and revealed that, with the exception of P. gracilis, the currently recognised species were associated with divergent mtDNA clades. It also revealed considerable mtDNA diversity within the widely distributed species P. breviceps. The existence of at least seven distinct and divergent mtDNA lineages within P. breviceps was supported, with two lineages located in Australia and at least five lineages in New Guinea. However, the distribution of these evolutionary lineages did not correspond with current morphological subspecies boundaries. Analyses of &#969;-globin sequence provided support for a number of these distinct populations, suggesting the possible presence of cryptic species within P. breviceps. Molecular analyses also suggested that squirrel gliders, P. norfolcensis, may occur in both South Australia and the Northern Territory, extending the current known range of the species. The presence of P. norfolcensis in SA was further verified by examining museum skins. Population structure and current pattern of gene flow within P. breviceps in Australia was examined further to elucidate phylogeographic structure within the species, and explore potential causes of geographic variation. Evidence for significant phylogeographic structuring across the range of the species in Australia was provided from population genetic (AMOVA) and phylogenetic analyses of both mitochondrial DNA and the &#969;-globin gene. In particular, there was evidence for the existence of two divergent clades that were distributed over distinct geographical regions. Divergence dates calculated for the two major mtDNA clades suggested that environment and climate changes which occurred during the Pliocene may have facilitated this diversification. Habitat fragmentation is generally considered to be a major factor threatening the viability of forest dependent species such as gliders. Effects of habitat fragmentation were therefore investigated in P. breviceps in the highly disturbed landscape of southeastern South Australia. Genetic mating system and social structure of the species in these fragmented habitats was explored in 13 populations, using nine polymorphic microsatellite loci. Social groups consisted of two to seven gliders, and these were often close relatives, including parents with their offspring. Parentage analyses provided some evidence for a polygamous mating system, with a number of males found to have fathered offspring from multiple female partners. Some direct evidence of inbreeding was also found within a small isolated patch. Genetic diversity within P. breviceps populations was moderate compared to the range reported in other marsupial species. Population structure analyses indicated that gene flow between some patches was restricted. Small patches surrounded by a matrix of pine were more likely to show inbreeding and potentially suffer from inbreeding depression, although further data are required to verify this result. Overall, results suggest that, although the species is still present in these small and isolated patches, it may face threats from a lack of dispersal and inbreeding. Maintaining the size of patches and establishing corridors between isolated populations needs to be considered in conservation and management of species in these fragmented habitats.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular systematics and conservation; gliders; petaurus, petauridae; conservation genetics; habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">Marsupials Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Random allocations: new and extended models and techniques with applications and numerics.</field><field name="creator">Kennington, Raymond William</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a general methodology for classifying and describing many combinatoric problems, systematising and finding theoretical expressions for quantities of interest, and investigating their feasible numerical evaluation. Unifying notation and definitions are provided. Our knowledge of random allocations is also extended. This is achieved by investigating new processes, generalising known processes, and by providing a formal structure and innovative techniques for analysing them. The random allocation models described in this thesis can be classified as occupancy urn models, in which we have a sequence of urns and throw balls into them, and investigate static, waiting-time and dynamic processes. Various structures are placed on the relationship(s) between cells, balls, and the selection of items being distributed, including varieties, batch arrivals, taboo sets and blocking sets. Static, waiting-time and dynamic processes are investigated. Both without-replacement and with-replacement sampling types are considered. Emphasis is placed on the distributions of waiting-times for one or more events to occur measured from the time a particular event occurs; this begins as an abstraction and generalisation of a model of departures of cars parked in lanes. One of several additional determinations is the platoon size distribution. Models are analysed using combinatorial analysis and Markov Chains. Global attributes are measured, including maximum waits, maximum room required, moments and the clustering of completions. Various conversion formulae have been devised to reduce calculation times by several orders of magnitude. New and extended applications include Queueing in Lanes, Cake Displays, Coupon Collector's Problem, Sock-Sorting, Matching Dependent Sets (including Genetic Code Attribute Matching and the game SET), the Zig-Zag Problem, Testing for Randomness (including the Cake Display Test, which is a without-replacement test similar to the standard Empty Cell test), Waiting for Luggage at an Airport, Breakdowns in a Network, Learning Theory and Estimating the Number of Skeletons at an Archaeological Dig. Fundamental, reduction and covering theorems provide ways to reduce the number of calculations required. New combinatorial identities are discovered and a well-known one is proved in a combinatorial way for the first time. Some known results are derived from simple cases of the general models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">random allocations; occupancy urn models, static models; dynamic models; waiting-time models; without-replacement; with-replacement; Psi-processes; probability theory; P. of I.E. for the mini-max; Bonderroni's inequalities; asymptotic distributions; the game SET; coupon-collector's problem; cake display problem; zig-zag problem</field><field name="subject">Combinatorial probabilities.</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Confronting the limits: renditions of the real in the edge of the Construct Film Cycle.</field><field name="creator">Greenwood, Kate</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the fragile perimeter that separates an illusory reality from the supposedly more authentic Real it conceals, which forms a key focus of Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek&#8217;s work, and in this thesis I offer a study of the relations between this aspect of &#381;i&#382;ek&#8217;s work and film theory. In particular, this thesis is an elaboration on and interrogation of &#381;i&#382;ek&#8217;s employment of the Lacanian notion of the Real in critiques of the inadequacy of 1970s and 1980s film theory and its widespread adoption of a Lacanian model of film-spectator relations. By way of illustration, I consider the microgenre of films released between the years 1998 to 2000 that includes the Matrix trilogy, David Fincher&#8217;s Fight Club, Peter Weir&#8217;s The Truman Show, and Alex Proyas&#8217; Dark City, which are all similarly fascinated by the border between a fake reality and an ostensibly more genuine real. However, I also argue that this cycle of films does more than illustrate a fascination with that which is in excess of signification: this cycle of films equally participates in the reappraisal of this important phase of film theory. This thesis proceeds from a consideration of &#381;i&#382;ek&#8217;s assertion that Lacanian psychoanalysis is missing from the dominant field of film theory. To assess this claim, I re-examine the era of political modernism. From this it becomes clear that what &#381;i&#382;ek is noting is not the total absence of Lacanian psychoanalysis, but, rather, an absence of the version of Lacan to which he is drawn. This thesis considers aspects of the Real that contaminate the form and matter of these films, in addition to the thematic exploration of the shadowy world beyond reality. In pursuing this investigation, this thesis utilises the insights of the deconstructive work of Jacques Derrida, to consider the terms &#8216;form&#8217;, &#8216;content&#8217; and &#8216;matter&#8217;. These words are ubiquitous in film studies, and I aim to explicate not their final meaning, but the way in which the Real interrupts the very stability of vocabulary used in film studies. I interrogate the concepts of gaze and voice as privileged instances of the way in which the Real can rupture the symbolic in narrative film. Without seeking to reject these aesthetic figures, through critical readings of key theories of embodiment, the grotesque and the abject (such as those of Marks, Shaviro, Sobchack, Bakhtin and Kristeva), I suggest how the body and its representation provides a more sustained motif where the Real leaves its trace in these films. This thesis proposes that it is above all through such representations that these films offer a response to the themes with which politically modernist film theory has been historically concerned. The Edge of the Construct films achieve this in their evocation of an intolerable namelessness at the centre of the human subject and the social world it inhabits.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">The Real; Slavoj Zizek; film theory; The Matrix; Fight Club; embodiment; Jacques Derrida</field><field name="subject">Z&#780;iz&#780;ek, Slavoj Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures History and criticism Theory, etc.</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures Philosophy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathogenesis of aortic valve stenosis: bench to bedside approach.</field><field name="creator">Ngo, Doan Thi Minh</field><field name="description">Experiments described in this thesis address the pathogenesis of aortic valve sclerosis/stenosis using a bench to bedside approach. In particular, the thesis begins with development of a technique using ultrasonic backscatter analyses to quantitate the early stages of aortic stenosis. Subsequent chapters utilized this methodology to quantitate aortic valve structural changes in a model and intervention study of aortic stenosis in rabbits. The last chapters are human studies designed to identify factors associated with presence of aortic sclerosis/stenosis; with particular interest in potential association of endothelial dysfunction/inflammation/platelet aggregation with abnormal aortic valve structure quantitated by ultrasonic backscatter. In Chapter 1 (Introduction) the relevant literature is reviewed. Development of ultrasonic backscatter to quantitate aortic sclerosis (Chapter 2) Aortic valve sclerosis (ASc) is detected when there is visual assessment of focal increases in echogenicity of the aortic valve most commonly assessed by echocardiography. However, there is no previously described method to quantitate degree of aortic valve structural abnormality as ASc is not associated with marked hemodynamic obstruction quantifiable by Doppler echocardiography. The current study used ultrasonic backscatter to quantitate aortic valve structural abnormality in patients assessed as having ASc based on valve appearances, compared to young healthy volunteers with normal aortic valves. The results of the study indicate: 1) that the mean levels of aortic valve backscatter in ASc patients are approximately 60% greater than in young healthy volunteers (ie aortic valve backscatter scores &#8805; 16dB are not consistent with normal aortic valve structure), 2) ultrasonic backscatter scores in ASc patients are directly correlated with subjective scoring of sclerosis and with a positive trend with transvalvular pressure gradients in patients with mild-moderate aortic stenosis, and most importantly, 3) ultrasonic backscatter is a reproducible technique, with mean differences between estimates based on repeat echocardiograms of 2.3 &#177; 1.7 (9.1%). These results indicate that ultrasonic backscatter could be used as a quantitative measure of aortic valve structural abnormality in epidemiology and for examination of interventions. In vivo studies Development of an animal model of aortic stenosis with vitamin D2 (Chapter 3) The aim of the study was to develop an appropriate animal model for AS. The study used vitamin D2 alone at 25,000IU/4 days weekly (vit-D2) for 8 weeks to induce AS in rabbits. Results showed that: 1) rabbits in the vit-D2 group had significantly increased in transvalvular velocity and pressure gradients compared to rabbits in the control group (normal chow + drinking water); this was consistent for aortic valve ultrasonic backscatter scores; 2) aortic valve immunohistochemistry/histology showed marked calcification, neutral lipids, macrophage, and leukocyte infiltrations for rabbits in the vit- D2 group (ie consistent with histology of human AS); 3) significant elevation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations in the vit-D2 group occurred compared to controls over the 8 weeks treatment period; the change in ADMA concentrations correlated significantly with the change in transvalvular pressure gradients for rabbits in the vit-D2 group; 4) rabbits in the vit-D2 group had significantly impaired endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation, and this effect was completely abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME); 5) the addition of 0.5% cholesterol-supplemented diet to the vitamin D2 regimen did not accentuate the development of AS. Thus, treatment with vitamin D2 at 25,000IU/4 days weekly for 8 weeks significantly induced AS with similar aortic valve pathology to that of human AS; therefore, the model is suitable for use in examining potential therapeutic interventions in AS. Effects of ramipril on development of AS in rabbits (Chapter 4) Using this animal model, this study aimed to examine the effects of the angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) ramipril on development of AS. Rabbits (n=28) treated for 8 weeks were divided into 2 groups: (a) vitamin D2 alone (n=10) (normal chow + 25,000IU vitamin D2 in drinking water); (b) vitamin D2/Ramipril (n=12) (normal chow+25,000IU vitamin D2/Ramipril (0.5mg/kg) in drinking water). Six further rabbits constituted a normal reference group (no treatment was given). The results for comparisons between vitamin D2/ramipril vs vitamin D2 alone were as follows: 1) ramipril-treated rabbits had significantly less severe hemodynamic obstructions (p&lt;0.05, for both) as assessed by transvalvular velocity, and aortic valve area; with borderline reduction in aortic valve backscatter (p=0.08); 2) ramipril significantly reduced plasma ADMA concentrations; 3) there was improvement in acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation (p=0.056), with significant improvement in sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation (p&lt;0.05); 4) there was a strong inverse correlation between acetylcholineinduced aortic relaxation and aortic valve backscatter score (0&lt;0.001), thus providing further evidence of the potential role of nitric oxide in retarding the development of AS in this model. These data provide a strong rationale for the inception of a randomized trial of ACE inhibition as a strategy for limitation of AS progression in humans. Human studies Aortic stenosis is associated with elevated plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations in humans (Chapter 5). Given the findings that aortic stenosis induced by vitamin D2 in rabbits also caused elevation of plasma ADMA concentrations, a physiological inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, a mediator and marker of endothelial dysfunction and an indicator of incremental cardiovascular risk. The study sought to determine whether plasma ADMA concentrations are elevated independently of pre-existing coronary risk factors in subjects with at least moderate aortic stenosis (n=42) compared to age-matched patients with normal aortic valves (n=42): as determined both by visual assessment and with aortic valve backscatter scores &lt; 16dB. Results for this study were as follows: 1) plasma ADMA concentrations were not statistically different between the AS and non-AS group (median 0.59 vs 0.54 &#181;mol/L, p=0.13, Mann-Whitney test) on univariate analysis; 2) backward stepwise multiple linear regression showed the presence of AS was a significant predictor of elevated ADMA concentrations (p=0.04, 95% CI =0.001, 0.072). 3) in addition, elevated plasma ADMA concentrations were also associated with history of atrial fibrillation (p=0.009, 95% CI=0.015, 0.100), and negatively associated with creatinine clearance (p=0.01, 95% CI=-0.002, 0.000), and the use of statin therapy (p=0.01, 95% CI=-0.081, -0.011). Therefore, in conclusion, this study found that AS is independently associated with elevation of ADMA concentrations, beyond that implied by &#8220;conventional&#8221; risk factors for endothelial dysfunction. The clinical status of AS as an incremental marker of cardiovascular risk may reflect ADMA-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Assessment of factors associated with ASc in a random ageing population study (Chapter 6). There have been few clinical studies of factors associated with ASc. Previous population studies have established that ASc is an independent correlate of incremental risk of coronary events. Having established that patients with AS have increased plasma ADMA concentrations (Chapter 5), it was now aimed to determine whether subjects with increased aortic valve backscatter scores (ASc) also have other markers of endothelial dysfunction/NO effects, independent of preexisting coronary risk factors. The study was designed to identify such anomalies, if they existed, on an incremental basis to other putative correlates of ASc, including coronary risk factors, renal dysfunction and vitamin D levels. Random selected subjects (n=253) aged between 51 to 77 years were evaluated. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography examination; aortic valve ultrasonic backscatter score (AVBS), was used to quantitate echogenicity of the aortic valve. Conventional coronary risk factors were identified on history. Integrity of NO generation/response was assessed via (i) plasma ADMA concentrations; (ii) inhibition of platelet aggregation by the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP); (iii) aortic augmentation index (AIx), a measure of arterial stiffness/wave reflection. All putative correlations with AVBS were examined by univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression analyses. On the basis of echocardiographic appearances, ASc was present in 63 subjects (25.4%); mean AVBS scores was 14.9&#177;4.6dB (SD) vs 11.2&#177;3.9dB (SD) in the presence vs absence of ASc (p&lt;0.001). Univariate analyses revealed that platelet responsiveness to NO was inversely correlated with AVBS (&#946;=-0.16, p=0.02); but [ADMA] and AIx were not. On multiple linear regression, significant correlates of increased AVBS were: (i) advanced age (&#946;=0.21, p=0.003), (ii) low body mass index (&#946;=-0.23, p=0.001); and (iii) impaired platelet responsiveness to NO (&#946;=-0.16, p=0.02). In Chapter 7, the implications of the overall findings in this thesis are discussed in relation to future perspective.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aortic valve stenosis; endothelial function; nitric oxide; echocardiography</field><field name="subject">Aortic valve Abnormalities.

This input appears to have many functions including the transmission of non-photic information during the day and the modulation of photic information at night. However, it has emerged that this input may also be involved in the transmission of light information with activation of 5-HT2C receptors at night having a photo-mimetic effect. The studies described in this thesis aim to clarify the role of 5-HT2C receptors in the control of circadian rhythms in the rat model and compare their actions to light. The acute effects of 5-HT2C receptor agonist administration on clock gene expression were investigated in the rat SCN. Systemic administration of the 5-HT2A/2C agonist DOI to rats during early night induced c-fos, Per1 and Per2 expression in a manner similar to light. This response was time of day dependent with maximal induction occurring in the early night, and no response during the day. The role of 5-HT2C receptors in this response was confirmed with the use of the selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist RO-60 0175. The effect of 5-HT2C receptor activation on the phase of expression of various circadian rhythms including temperature, melatonin and clock gene expression in the SCN and periphery was examined. Both DOI administration and light exposure at night phase delayed rhythms of melatonin and temperature. Similarly, the selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist RO-60 0175 phase delayed rhythms of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin, a response which was antagonised by the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB-242084. The expression of functional and clock genes within the pineal was also phase delayed following both light and 5-HT2C receptor agonist administration. However, the phase of expression of clock genes within the SCN or liver did not shift in response to either a single nocturnal light pulse or agonist administration. To investigate the site of action of 5-HT2C receptor agonists, rat SCN explants were maintained in culture allowing exposure of agonists to denervated tissue. The acute effect of DOI administration at various circadian times on c-fos and Per1 expression was assessed. 5-HT2C receptor activation significantly increased Per1 expression when administered during early subjective night, but had no effect during either subjective day or late subjective night, similar to that observed in vivo. Finally, the suitability of immortalised rat SCN cells for investigation of the intracellular actions of 5-HT2C receptors in the circadian system was assessed. Using RT-PCR the expression of various serotonin receptors in the SCN2.2 cell line was compared with that observed in punches of adult rat SCN. The mRNA for 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor was expressed in both the SCN2.2 cell line and the adult rat SCN. However, 5-HT2C receptor mRNA along with 5-HT3 receptor, 5-HT5A receptor and 5-HT7 receptor mRNA was expressed in the adult rat SCN tissue but not the SCN2.2 cells. These significant differences in serotonin receptor expression limit the usefulness of this cell line for further investigation. Together these experiments further implicate 5-HT2C receptors in the control of circadian rhythms. The role of these receptors appears limited to early night, with activation showing photo-mimetic responses. Furthermore, the location of action appears to be post-synaptic within the SCN, altering the core clock genes, which in turn phase delay various circadian rhythms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">serotonin; circadian; light</field><field name="subject">Serotonin.

Along with other immigration destination countries, Australia is now accepting nurses from more diverse national and educational backgrounds than ever before, in order to secure adequate staffing for its nursing workforce. This thesis reports on a research project which investigated the lived experiences of overseas-qualified nurses (OQNs) from non-English-speaking backgrounds (NESB) in coming to, and working in, Australia. The study used a qualitative design informed by the philosophy of Hermeneutic Phenomenology of Heidegger and Gadamer. The researcher individually interviewed a total of 24 OQNs of NESB from all over the world using a semi-structured interview method. The data were analysed by the case studies and thematic analysis method. From the analysis, a total of four important themes emerged that structured the lived experiences of the OQNs from NESB. 1) From the Past to the Future is concerned with Heidegger's notion of temporality (lived time). The two sub-themes are: the Past which describes the cultural, social and linguistic backgrounds of the OQNs which brought them to their present experiences in Australia, and the Future, which refers to future possibilities which have been opened up by their experiences in Australia. The past and the future co-exist within the OQNs' understanding of their present moment. 2) New Environment is concerned with Spatiality (lived space). The OQNs&#8217; felt working environment in Australia is described. 3) Living in the English Language considers the notion of &#8216;lived body&#8217; in relation to English-learning when working as nurses in Australia. 4) Shared World is concerned with Heidegger's notion of Shared World; the OQNs from NESB&#8217;s needs for a supportive inter-subjective environment is described and discussed. By using Parse&#8217;s phenomenological synthesis method, these four themes were then conceptualised into a core structure of phenomena that describes the core nature of the participants: &#8220;The lived experience of OQNs from NESB working in Australia is the process of obtaining a new identity in the English language, while actively formulating reality through interplay with new surroundings&#8221;. In conclusion, recommendations for improved support for OQNs from NESB derived from the study are presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nurses, Foreign -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Nurses -- Study and teaching -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caring to death: a discursive analysis of nurses who murder patients.</field><field name="creator">Field, John Gregory</field><field name="description">Murder is not a phenomenon that sits comfortably with the typical image of nurses and yet the number of cases of nurses accused and convicted of murdering patients is mounting. The nursing literature is quiet on the subject and therefore what is generally known on the topic predominantly comes from the media. An analysis of this seemingly unfathomable phenomenon is required to re-consider the problem and understand from new perspectives how and why this is happening. The aim of the study is to provide information for health professionals and organisations that will help them work together to recognise situations in which murder by nurses can occur. The research question is: How do the various discourses surrounding murder committed by nurses on patients in the course of their work shape the definition and treatment of these crimes? A discursive analysis of texts guided by a number of discourse theorists is undertaken to reveal the social construction of murder of patients by nurses. Texts related to the media and professional reporting of over 50 cases of registered nurses, enrolled and licensed nurses and assistants were retrieved from searches of Factiva, CINAHL and MEDLINE between 1980 to 2006. The software program JBI-NOTARI&#174; (Joanna Briggs Institute, 2003b) houses the texts and facilitated analysis. Discursive constructions are reported in four findings chapters and include: the profile of murderous nurses; types of murders; contexts in which murder takes place; factors that aid detection and apprehension; legal processes that guide charges, convictions and punishment; and finally the reactions of the public, the profession, the regulators and the families. The murder of patients by nurses is construed as a combination of extraordinary nurses, extraordinary deeds in ordinary contexts. While members of the nursing profession may not be held accountable for the actions of aberrant nurses who murder there is a responsibility to understand how hospitals and units form crucibles in which murder can take place. The recommendations from this study relate to both practice and research. Practitioners are recommended to critically reflect on structures and processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homicide.</field><field name="subject">Nurse and patient.</field><field name="subject">Nurse and patient -- Moral and ethical aspects.</field><field name="subject">Nursing ethics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-invasive assessment of trabecular bone structural anisotropy: relevance to mechanical anisotropy.</field><field name="creator">Badiei, Arash</field><field name="description">Although there are now many theories describing empirical relationships between strength properties of bone and various explanatory variables, the need for improved non-invasive diagnostic techniques to assess bone fragility is of core importance in clinical problems such as osteoporosis. The aim of this thesis was to develop non-invasive radiological methods to assess trabecular bone architecture. Measures of structural anisotropy and bone structure from X-ray or radiological projections have been developed. The first measure, the projected mean intercept length (PMIL), allows extraction of the total bone surface (BS/TV) and the mean intercept length (MIL) from projections of trabecular structure. The second measure, the line projection deviation (LPD), is a technique that quantifies the preferential alignment of trabecular bone from projections of the trabecular structure. Hence, in combination, the PMIL and LPD allow non-invasive extraction of BS/TV and more detailed preferential alignment from projections of the trabecular structure. In this thesis the PMIL and LPD are introduced and their properties explored. The PMIL and LPD are used to examine the anisotropy and architectural properties of a number of human vertebral body trabecular bone samples. When used in combination with clinical densitometry, these measures improve explanation of the variance in strength, elastic modulus and toughness of vertebral body trabecular bone samples by up to 40% when compared to densitometric values alone. While &#181;CT can provide the information needed to access trabecular architecture, it cannot be used in clinical settings since its high radiation dose makes it only applicable to small objects ex-vivo. At present, clinically available CT does not provide sufficient resolution to resolve trabecular structures. Thus, the methods described in this thesis will allow estimates of structural parameters from plain X-rays, providing for the first time, the possibility of clinical use of such estimates.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">osteoporosis; trabecular; bone; anisotrophy; biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Osteoporosis.</field><field name="subject">Bone densitometry.</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Radiography.</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Diseases -- Radiography.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/42075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The representation of the colonial past in French and Australian cinema, from 1970 to 2000.</field><field name="creator">Emerson, John James.</field><field name="description">France and Australia possess such distinctive national traits that they are not habitually compared in relation to their history, identity and culture. However, their national cinemas reveal that they have much in common. A significant number of recent films from both nations bear the mark of a similar obsessional quest for national identity that is linked to the exploration of a troubled colonial past. This shared preoccupation constitutes the starting point for this thesis, which compares the representation of colonial history in the cinema of France and Australia since 1970. It is of course evident that the two nations have had widely differing experiences of colonisation. Modern France is among the ranks of the major empire builders, and Australia is the product of one of Great Britain's most successful colonies. If neither nation can forget its colonial past, it is also for different reasons: France is the principal destination of migrants from her former colonies, and Australia faces landrights claims from her indigenous populations. If these differences provide the distinct social, political and geographical contexts of French and Australian cinema, they do not, however, impinge upon the stylistic and ideological analysis of their colonial thematics. For the purposes of this thesis, three fundamental criteria determine the inclusion of a film in the corpus: it must have an historical colonial setting; its narrative must focus principally on aspects of the colonisation process; and its director must be a descendant of the former colonisers. Around a dozen films released since 1970 in each country have been identified as matching these criteria and, for the purposes of the thesis, have been called postcolonial films. The content and structures of the films dictate the analytical approach and theories are drawn upon as tools when needed. These theories are widely varied across the disciplines and the theorists include Pierre Sorlin, Edward Sa&#239;d and Albert Memmi. The approach to representing colonial issues varies widely, with the majority of the films in the corpus neither appearing to confront openly nor to support the ideology of colonialism. Two exceptions are Coup de torchon (Tavernier, France, 1981) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (Schepisi, Australia, 1978). More typical of the ambivalent treatment of colonialism are the popularly attended films such as Indochine (Wargnier, France, 1991) and Picnic at Hanging Rock (Weir, Australia, 1975). In the first chapter an analysis of the relationship of the films to documented history demonstrates that French films are frequently set during the period between 1910 and 1950, and Australian films during the last half of the nineteenth century. The following chapter examines the relationship of the colonisers to their colonised lands and asks if the exceptional attention paid in all the films to the colonial geography has the effect of assimilating an alien landscape into the Western settlers&#8217; culture and mythology. The following two chapters address the core element of colonial life - in Franz Fanon's terms - its division into two worlds. The first of these chapters examines the interaction between the coloniser and the colonised through individual relationships between the two, and addresses the problem that all of these relationships end in permanent separation. The following chapter explores the interaction between coloniser and colonised as social groups that are divided by notions of race and discusses the general epistemological problem of the representation of the Other. The fifth chapter analyses the symbolic mechanisms being used to structure the films and manipulate the unconscious effect on the viewer. For example, there are a number of films with journeys of some kind, orphan-like characters and characters with strong noble savage qualities. Finally, the sixth chapter compares two of the films to the books from which they are derived. The object of this double comparison is to isolate differences in the films which are better explained by changing colonial politics than by inherent differences between cinema and literature. In the conclusion, it is argued that there appear to be few sustained attempts at confronting and resolving the problematic aspects of colonialism&#8217;s legacy. This is especially evident from the predominance of fictitious stories over the depiction of actual documented events. This tendency in both the French and Australian cinemas to contain the representation of the colonial past within a fictional framework has the inevitable consequence of masking history and thus avoiding the necessity of dealing with it. A further notable tendency was the preference for selecting certain periods and avoiding others, hence stripping the colonial past of its most embarrassing aspects. For example, no film could be found which showed the initial phase of the establishment of a colony. Despite the rarity of films released in France and Australia that openly challenge colonialism as a whole, many signs are evident throughout these films that the practices and values defending or justifying colonisation are nevertheless being questioned.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">France; Australia; cinema; colonial past; Australian films; Australian cinema; French films; French cinema; landscape and cinema; indigenous Australians; French colonies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/42129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape evolution of the Umbum Creek Catchment, Western Lake Eyre, Central Australia.</field><field name="creator">Waclawik, Victor G.</field><field name="description">Landscape evolution is important for mineral and petroleum exploration concepts, especially in dryland continental settings. This study seeks to understand the main issues and controls on landscape evolution that have produced the regolith and young sediments around the western side of Lake Eye, in the arid heart of Australia. Several methods were employed including satellite image analysis, geomorphometry, geological mapping, regolith mapping and surveying. Outcomes indicate that the underlying structural fabric of the basement has controlled the development of the surface morphology of the Umbum Creek Catchment. The arrangement of basement faults is reflected in the distribution of surface landforms and in the topography of the land surface. Significant deformation of the Etadunna and Eyre formations indicate tectonic activity occurred at the end of the Miocene and was probably related to movement in the Lake Eyre Fault Zone. Pleistocene faulting is expressed as minor blind faulting associated with pre - existing basement faults. These faults remain active and current seismic activity is driven by changes in hydrostatic pressure (hydroseismicity). The scale of Pleistocene faulting and modern seismic activity demonstrates that since the Pliocene tectonic activity has been subdued. Climate change caused landforms developed under wet conditions during the Palaeogene and Neogene to be preserved by the development of aridity in the Pleistocene. High erosion rates associated with tectonism and the onset of aridity in the Pleistocene led to topographic inversion of many features. Palaeo-Proterozoic inliers formed inselbergs, silcrete outcrops formed capstones, gypsum hardpans protected underlying sediment from erosion creating plateaux of gypsum patterned ground and palaeo-channels on the Neales Fan were eroded to make heavily armoured mounds and associated sand dunes and sand sheets. The dominant factor influencing the evolution of the landscape in the Umbum Creek Catchment was the deposition of sedimentary sulphides within the Bulldog Shale. The excess sulphur that this sediment supplied to the landscape over time created the necessary conditions for the formation of a range of landscape features that would not otherwise exist. Weathering, oxidation and leaching of the sedimentary sulphides led to the development of silcrete. Subsequent weathering and tectonic activity led to the breakdown of the silcrete and the distribution of silcrete pebbles widely across the landscape forming gibber plains. Sulphur from the Bulldog Shale continued to contribute to the landscape forming intra-formational gypsum and precipitating as gypsum hardpans. This study has implications for petroleum exploration in dryland continental settings as potential reservoirs may be affected by secondary diagenetic processes, such as the formation of gypsum or silcretes, that could act as baffles or result in reduced porosity within the reservoir. The broad-scale architecture of fluvial systems, like the Neales Fan, may not conform to traditional fan-shaped models being, instead, comprised of structurally rearranged channels. In terms of earthquake risk assessment, the identification of hydroseismicity active within the Lake Eye Basin allows for a new level of predictability of earthquake behaviour within Central Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landforms Australia Eyre, Lake, Basin.</field><field name="subject">Geomorphology Australia Eyre, Lake, Basin.</field><field name="subject">Geology, Structural Australia Eyre, Lake, Basin.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/42833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The colour of red wine.</field><field name="creator">Birse, Maria Josephine</field><field name="description">The behaviour of pigments in red wine, namely anthocyanins and anthocyaninderived pigments, was investigated at natural wine pH, at low pH and after addition of SO2, namely SO2 bleaching. An examination of current literature demonstrated absences in wine pigment research. Firstly, few researchers have published the colour properties of a particular wine pigment at different pH values and post-SO2 bleaching. This was demonstrated using the CIELab colours of two individual anthocyanin-derived wine pigments (4-vinylcatechol and 4-vinylsyringol adducts to malvidin 3-glucoside), and an anthocyanin, malvidin 3-glucoside. The colours of the anthocyanin-derived pigments and their resistance to pH change and SO2 bleaching were compared to malvidin 3-glucoside which was affected by media. Generally, in the literature, wine pigments are characterized as individual components. But many pigments contribute to wine colour. So, two novel methods were created and demonstrated using red wines: Shiraz wines from four regions in Australia, and Cabernet Sauvignon wines made using two different strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) or Saccharomyces bayanus (SB). The first method can be used to determine the CIELab colour of chromatographically separated wine pigments and allows their colours to be re-created, regardless of their identity. Thus objective measurement of pigment colour at its natural concentration in wine is now possible. An additional method, the &#8220;post-column adjustment method&#8221; to pH-adjust and SO2 bleach HPLC-separated wine pigments was created. The concentration and colour of HPLC-separated wine pigments at low pH, at wine pH and post-SO2 bleaching can be measured. The method has highlighted the importance of the pH value when quantifying a wine pigment. For example, from low pH to wine pH, the apparent anthocyanin and pigmented polymer concentration was reduced, but the Vitisin A concentration was unchanged. SO2 bleaching resulted in negligible anthocyanin concentration and a further reduction in pigmented polymer concentration, with Vitisin A unaffected. Relative quantities of wine pigments in both SC and SB Cabernet Sauvignon wines were not affected by pH change or SO2 bleaching. Also, using the Shiraz wines and Cabernet Sauvignon red wines, existing and improved colour measurement techniques were discussed. For the Australian Shiraz wines, grape origin was found to influence red wine colour, CIELab values provided enhanced colour measurements, and high wine colour (at natural wine pH) cannot be attributed to individual monomeric anthocyanins (measured by HPLC analysis at low pH). Vitisin A was not responsible for differences in wine colour. SO2-stable wine colour was related to regional differences. The percentage of SO2 non-bleachable pigments was independent of wine region. Chemical index (ii) values indicated that the colour at 520 nm was attributable to pH-dependent wine pigments. Vitisin A and pigmented polymer concentrations correlated well with SO2-stable wine colour. Pigmented polymer concentration may be the driving force behind wine colour density. Copigmentation was of no importance in the young red wine samples studied. With the Cabernet Sauvignon red wines, the yeast strains used for fermentation affected wine colour and SO2-stable wine colour. The change in wine colour density was not related to change in total red pigment colour or anthocyanin concentration. Pigmented polymer concentration, SO2-stable wine colour and the percentage of SO2 non-bleachable pigments were consistently higher in the SB wines. The pH value was important when determining the colour of a wine or pigment. At low pH, the SC wines were more coloured than the SB wines. However, at real wine pH, the converse was true. For both wines, at low pH, the anthocyanin concentration was greater than the pigmented polymer concentration, indicating the importance of anthocyanins to wine colour only at low pH. But, at wine pH, the apparent anthocyanin concentration was much lower in both wines (for example, malvidin 3- glucoside provided more colour at low pH than at wine pH) than the apparent pigmented polymer concentration. Therefore, at wine pH, anthocyanins were less important to wine colour than pigmented polymers. The concentrations of Vitisin A were similar in all three media, but colour losses were observed at wine pH and post-SO2 bleaching. SB Vitisin A was more coloured. At low pH and at wine pH, Vitisin A was more coloured than malvidin 3-glucoside in both wines, even though the apparent Vitisin A concentration was lower. Differences in the colours of the SC and SB pigmented polymers peaks were observed at low pH, at wine pH and following SO2 bleaching. The SB pigmented polymers were darker and more colourful, exhibited more colour absorbance and a slight bathochromic shift of lmax value. From low pH to wine pH and following SO2 bleaching, pigmented polymers become lighter, whilst retaining orange-red hues.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthocyanins</field><field name="subject">Plant pigments.</field><field name="subject">Grapes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/42834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of HIV-1 derived gene transfer technology: optimisation of vector safety, processing and production.</field><field name="creator">Koldej, Rachel Marie</field><field name="description">Vectors derived from Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) are being widely developed for gene therapy applications, principally because they are able to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells and result in stable, long term gene expression. However, these vectors are difficult to produce in high titres and sufficient volumes for large scale experiments and clinical application. Therefore, an investigation into methods to improve the production of HIV-1 derived gene transfer vectors was undertaken. One factor that limits the production of recombinant virus is the amount of viral genomic RNA available for packaging into virions. Therefore, a transfer vector was modified with the aim of increasing the amount of genomic RNA produced. Substitution of the polyadenylation (pA) signal, mutation splice donor sites and removal of unnecessary sequences were all examined. pA signal readthrough was quantified to determine the effect of these modifications on the rate of pA signal readthrough. Insertional mutagenesis and vector mobilisation are recognised risk factors with all integrating vectors. Self inactivating (SIN) vectors, which contain a deletion of U3 sequences in the 3&#8217; LTR, demonstrate a reduced rate of mobilisation. Transduction with these vectors results in a provirus containing no viral promoter elements, with transcription of the transgene being controlled from an internal promoter. However, LTR repair of SIN vectors occurs at an appreciable frequency. Therefore, the extent of this deletion was maximised and the effect on the frequency of the repair examined. The production of lentiviral gene therapy vectors by large-scale transient transfection is both time consuming and technically difficult. Therefore, methods to increase the scale of production without compromising virus titre were developed. This resulted in fewer transfections and less handling of the cells when making virus on a large scale (3-4 L). In order to process the virus on this scale in a single day (i.e. 8 hours), new concentration and purification methods were established. The protocol consisted of low speed centrifugation, 0.45 &#956;m filtration, 750 kDa ultrafiltration, 0.8 &#956;m filtration and ultracentrifugation. However, the use of ultracentrifugation means that this protocol is not amenable to further scale up. Therefore, the replacement of the ultracentrifugation step with anion exchange was investigated. A number of different resins and anion exchange devices were investigated, two of which show promise for large scale purification of HIV-1 derived gene transfer vectors. In an ideal world, HIV-1 derived gene transfer vectors would be produced using stable packaging cell lines engineered to produce the desired virus. However, previous attempts to produce such a cell line with the desired properties have had limited success and have generally used outdated helper systems. Therefore, in an attempt to combine the efficiency advantages of having a single helper plasmid with the safety advantages of expressing each protein separately, a single packaging construct that contained separate transcription units for each of the required proteins was produced. Transcription of cyotoxic proteins was controlled by inducible promoters. Initial results suggest that such a system is technically feasible but that further work is required to optimise the expression of helper functions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gene therapy; HIV-1; lentiviral vectors; lentivirus purification; stable packaging; cell lines; HIV-1 purification; lentivirus concentration; HIV-1 concentration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/42907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the developmental competence of pig oocytes matured in vitro.</field><field name="creator">Bagg, Melanie Anna</field><field name="description">Pre-pubertal pig oocytes possess lower developmental competence than those from adult pigs following in vitro maturation (IVM). Previous studies have demonstrated that exposure of pre-pubertal oocytes to 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP), a membrane permeable cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analogue, for the first 20 h of IVM improves the rate of blastocyst development. Developmental competence of in vitro matured pig oocytes has been reported to increase with increasing follicle size. In this thesis, experiments were carried out using pre-pubertal and adult pig oocytes to investigate the relationship between donor age, intra-oocyte cAMP level and follicle size in terms of oocyte maturation and developmental competence. These experiments demonstrated that, while ovarian, follicular and oocyte morphology are immediately altered with the onset of puberty, pre-pubertal oocytes must be exposed to more than the first oestrous cycle to achieve improved developmental competence in vitro. Later experiments demonstrated that pre-pubertal oocytes accumulate less cAMP during IVM, undergo more rapid meiotic progression and display reduced rates of blastocyst development compared to in vitro matured adult oocytes. Treatment with dbcAMP for 22 h IVM increased the cAMP content of pre-pubertal oocytes, slowed meiotic progression during IVM and improved the rate of blastocyst formation. While the cAMP concentration of pre-pubertal oocytes was increased to levels similar to that of adult oocytes, rates of blastocyst formation remained lower, suggesting that additional factor(s) are required for oocyte maturation. This thesis also examined the follicle size cohorts that make up the 3-8 mm aspiration range on pig ovaries. The surface of pre-pubertal ovaries contained around double the number of 3 mm follicles compared with adult ovaries. Blastocyst development of pre-pubertal oocytes increased with increasing follicle size and was highest using oocytes from 5-8 mm follicles, while adult oocytes from all follicle size cohorts displayed similar high rates of blastocyst formation. The interaction between follicle size and cAMP content in pre-pubertal oocytes was examined next. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) from 3 mm follicles accumulated less intra-oocyte and inter-COC cAMP and displayed reduced cumulus expansion compared with COCs from 5-8 mm follicles. While dbcAMP treatment increased the cAMP content of oocytes from 3 mm follicles, it had no effect on the cAMP content of the whole COC. These findings suggest that inadequate levels of intra-oocyte cAMP during IVM contribute to the low developmental competence of pre-pubertal oocytes from 3 mm follicles, suggesting that cAMP transfer, production or degradation processes are incomplete. Analysis of steroid content from different follicle size cohorts revealed that the progesterone content of prepubertal follicular fluid (FF) increased with increasing follicle size, yet overall was lower than that of adults. This suggests that differences may exist in the gonadotropinstimulated steroidogenic activity of granulosa cells of pre-pubertal COCs from different follicle sizes. Since progesterone secretion did not differ between pre-pubertal and adult COCs, it appears that the downstream pathway from the granulosa cell response rather than the actual quantity of progesterone is important for subsequent maturation processes. These studies then examined gap junction communication (GJC) within the pre-pubertal COC during IVM to examine whether the positive effects of increasing follicle size and dbcAMP on intra-oocyte cAMP levels relates to improved cAMP transfer between the cumulus cell layer and oocyte. Cumulus cell-oocyte GJC during IVM was maintained for a longer period in pre-pubertal COCs from 3 mm follicles than in those from 5-8 mm follicles. Treatment with dbcAMP had minimal effect on GJC in either COC type, thus the dbcAMP-induced increase in intra-oocyte cAMP levels appears independent of GJC. Differences in GJC during IVM together with the COCs ability to increase intraoocyte cAMP levels during IVM, suggests that differences may exist in the quantity of gonadotropin receptors, which are responsible for cAMP production, within the cumulus layer of COCs from 3 mm compared with 5-8 mm follicles. In conclusion, this thesis has demonstrated that an increase in intra-oocyte cAMP is necessary during maturation for completion and synchronisation of maturation and high developmental competence of the pig oocyte. Comparison of 3, 4 and 5-8 mm follicle sizes in the pre-pubertal pig, as described here, provides an excellent model for further investigation into the role of cAMP and the other factors required for co-ordination of oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation and subsequent embryo production.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oocyt maturation; IVM; IVF; cAMP; gap junction communication; reproduction</field><field name="subject">Ovum--Physiology.</field><field name="subject">Swine--Reproduction.</field><field name="subject">Fertilization in vitro.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/42908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in Australia between 1983 and 1996: implications for manufacturing and industry policy.</field><field name="creator">Cook, Ian Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to establish whether Australia&#8217;s manufacturing competitiveness improved during the Hawke-Keating period of government (1983-1996), based on its performance prior to 1983. To achieve this aim it was necessary to identify what are the key characteristics impacting on competitiveness, and indeed, how do these factors interact? Importantly, the review was conducted from a broad-based strategic management perspective and not from an econometric standpoint. As a means of determining the above a detailed examination of the development of competitiveness was undertaken. It was found there was no single determinant insofar as, competitiveness cannot be attributed to one specific aspect, but is in fact influenced by a number of factors acting simultaneously. This involved a review of the informed contributions reflecting the development of competitiveness. Findings suggested the roots of competitiveness could largely be traced back to the doctrine of comparative advantage. However, much of this thinking was inevitably surpassed, when the correlation between competitiveness and strategy was better understood. Thus, in terms of manufacturing, this demanded the analysis of factors which appeared to independently and jointly influence competitiveness. It also showed within the manufacturing sector there was an inextricable link between productivity, increased competitiveness and growth. The contribution to the assessment of competitiveness by Professor Michael Porter was also studied in detail. The application of his work was examined with a view to the appropriateness of using his Determinants of National Advantage model in an Australian manufacturing context. Notably, this model provided a process which consistently explained the unique differences between participants within industrial environments. It also facilitated the identification of specific reasons for failure within an industry, which if left unchecked impacted on a nation&#8217;s competitiveness. Relative to competitiveness and, to the significance of Porter&#8217;s theories, an amended version of the &#8216;Diamond Model&#8217; was considered more appropriate for this thesis. Historically, Australia&#8217;s manufacturing sector has been traditionally underpinned by tariff protection to sustain its existence. Political efforts to counter the impact of competition appeared to remain a central part of industry policy. For instance, politicians such as McEwen shaped Australia&#8217;s post-war interventionist role by the use of politically imaginative industry policies to help shelter manufacturing from the threat of growing international competition. In 1965, the manufacturing sector underwent its first major restructure, driven by the objective to make it less reliant on government subsidies and support. This was followed by similar reform initiatives such as the Jackson Report (1977) and Crawford Committee Report (1979). The Hawke-Keating Government came to office in 1983 amidst a shattered economy. Mid-way through its administration period, however, the Hawke-Keating Government had to contend with the internationalisation of world economies. This led to a deliberate change in industry policy, particularly at a microeconomic level to a free market persuasion. An accelerated tariff reduction program was also introduced. Whilst there was genuine support for the manufacturing sector to improve its competitiveness, many thought a more measured and strategic change was warranted. Research suggested Australian manufacturing was highly dependent on multinationals for technology and employment but by the same token, lacked specialization, and economies of scale and scope in terms of utilising its capabilities. Australia&#8217;s manufacturers similarly failed to capitalize on aspects of research and development and innovation, languishing in a climate devoid of competition. Moreover, the manufacturing sector was not considered a prime investment target for international finance. In order to test these assertions a number of key hypotheses were developed. Following analyses, with the exception of the impact of manufactured imports on the economy, it was determined that manufacturing had improved in each of the categories assessed. However, largely, the sector&#8217;s performance was well below that of its international counterparts. Overall, these results add to the body of knowledge of competition literature, and also contribute to a better understanding of the factors which influence growth, sustainability, and the competitiveness of Australia&#8217;s manufacturing in general.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">manufacturing industries Australia; competition Australia evaluation; Australia economic conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/44234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short-chain fatty acid modulation of apoptosis in gastric and colon cancer cells.</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Geoffrey Mark</field><field name="description">Introduction: Gastric and colon cancer are major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Gastric cancer is often detected at an advanced stage and current chemotherapeutics are only modestly effective against this neoplasm. Novel chemotherapeutics, chemopreventive agents and treatment strategies are required to prevent and treat gastric cancer. The ideal method to eliminate cancer cells may be the induction of apoptosis, further preventing cell proliferation and tumour growth. Recently, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) butyrate and propionate have been investigated as potential chemotherapeutic agents, particularly in colon cancer. Butyrate is reported to induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells and is demonstrated to modulate intracellular redox state by altering the levels of an antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). GSH availability is controlled by the oxidative pentose pathway (OPP). Very few studies have investigated the effects of butyrate on cell types other than colon cancer cells, and even less is known regarding the effects of propionate. This thesis investigated the potential for SCFAs to induce apoptosis in a gastric cancer cell line, Kato III, compared to the colon cancer cell line, Caco-2. Cell cycle regulation, OPP activity, GSH availability and glucose metabolism were also assessed. Methods: Initial studies developed a new technique to measure 1-13C-D-glucose metabolism. Following this, Kato III and Caco-2 colon carcinoma cells were treated with butyrate or propionate (1mM, 5mM or 10mM) or a 5mM combination of both SCFAs. The induction of apoptosis and cell cycle alterations by these SCFAs were assessed using flow cytometry. OPP activity and GSH availability were assessed in both cell lines using colorimetric techniques. Butyrate metabolism was assessed using 13C-butyrate. Results: Butyrate and propionate significantly induced apoptosis and G2-M arrest in Kato III and Caco-2 cells, although to a significantly greater extent in the latter cell line. Moreover, butyrate induced apoptosis to a significantly greater extent than propionate, in both cell lines. SCFA treatment led to the significant up-regulation of OPP activity in both cancer cell lines while GSH availability was significantly reduced. Glucose metabolism was initially increased by all SCFA treatments, however, 72hr butyrate treatment led to its reduction. Importantly, glucose metabolism was measured using a new technique developed within this thesis. The rate of butyrate metabolism was demonstrated to correlate with the sensitivity of each cell line to this SCFA. Conclusions: This thesis provides evidence that SCFAs, particularly butyrate, induce apoptosis in gastric and colon cancer cells in vitro. The response of cancer cells to SCFAs appears complex, and involves multiple distinct mechanisms and pathways, including p53, Fas, changes to intracellular redox state and glucose metabolism. The capability of butyrate to induce apoptosis also appears to be directly related to the rate of its metabolism. Butyrate has the potential to be utilised as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of gastric cancer and colon cancer.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apoptosis.</field><field name="subject">Stomach--Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy)--Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Fatty acids.</field><field name="subject">Butyric acid.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/44402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and interactions of the C-terminal domain of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2.</field><field name="creator">Kuang, Zhihe</field><field name="description">"October, 2006" Bibliography: leaves 216-238. 6, xi, 238 leaves : ill.

The present-day stress tensor has been determined using petroleum well data in the Gippsland and Otway Basins in Southeast Australia (Papers 1 and 4) and the Cooper Basin in Central Australia (Paper 5). In the Gippsland Basin, the present-day stress regime is transitional between one of reverse and strike-slip faulting and the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) is oriented ~139&#176;N. The present-day stress regime in the Victorian sector of the Otway Basin is also transitional between one of reverse and strike-slip faulting and SHmax is oriented ~135&#176;N. Horizontal stresses are lower in the South Australian sector of the Otway Basin where the stress regime is one of strike-slip faulting and SHmax is oriented ~124&#176;N. The orientations of SHmax in Southeast Australia are consistent with focal mechanism solutions, neotectonic structures and modelling of plate-boundary forces (Paper 4). Closure pressures from mini-frac injection tests are commonly used to determine the minimum horizontal stress (Shmin) magnitude. However, in high stress basins such as the Cooper and Gippsland Basins, these pressures may not reliably yield Shmin (Papers 2 and 5). In the Cooper Basin, high closure pressures (&gt;18 MPa/km) were observed in tests where pressure-declines indicated complex hydraulic fracture growth. Closure pressures in these injections are unlikely to be representative of Shmin. They are believed to reflect the normal stress incident on pre-existing planes of weakness that are exploited by hydraulic fluid during the mini-frac injection (Paper 5). Sub-horizontal fabrics that are open at the wellbore wall were observed on image logs in the Cooper and Gippsland Basins (Papers 2 and 5). This fabric is believed to be at least partially responsible for the complex growth of hydraulic fractures observed in the Cooper Basin. The occurrence of these sub-horizontal fabrics and knowledge of rock strength have been used to constrain the magnitudes of SHmax and Shmin independently of mini-frac injections in the Cooper and Gippsland Basins (Papers 2 and 5). The present-day stress tensor is often quoted as a single gradient at a sedimentary basinor petroleum field-scale. Image logs and mini-frac data from Central and Southeast Australia indicate significant stress differences between stratigraphic units (Papers 3 and 5). Finite element modelling of the stress distribution between interbedded sands and shales in the Gippsland Basin indicates that stress is &#8216;partitioned&#8217; to &#8216;hard&#8217; lithological units in high stress areas. This accounts for the observation that borehole breakout only occurs in hard, cemented sandstones in the Gippsland Basin (Paper 3). A generic &#8216;mechanical stratigraphy&#8217; derived from knowledge of wellbore failure (from image logs), rock strength and rock properties in individual rock units in the Cooper Basin allows an approximation of the present-day stress-state to be made directly from image-logs for individual rock units prior to mini-frac injection (Paper 6). This is important for predicting and understanding hydraulic fracture growth and containment. When considered together, the papers comprising this thesis provide significant new data on the orientation and magnitude of present-day stresses in Central and Southeast Australia. They also provide insight into the tectonic origin of those stresses and their distribution within sedimentary basins. In particular the papers develop and use new methods for constraining the present-day stress in regions of high tectonic stress. They also discuss implications for problems in petroleum development including wellbore stability and hydraulic fracturing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology - South Australia - Cooper Basin; Geology - Victoria - Gippsland; Geology, Stratigraphic; Sedimentary basins</field><field name="subject">Geology, Structural Australia.</field><field name="subject">Geology Victoria Gippsland.</field><field name="subject">Geology South Australia Cooper Basin.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/45071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aggregate coalescence and factors affecting it.</field><field name="creator">Hasanah, Uswah</field><field name="description">The phenomenon called soil aggregate coalescence occurs at contact-points between aggregates and causes soil strength to increase to values that can inhibit plant root exploration and thus potential yield. During natural wetting and drying, soil aggregates appear to &#8216;weld&#8217; together with little or no increase in dry bulk density. The precise reasons for this phenomenon are not understood, but it has been found to occur even in soils comprised entirely of water stable aggregates. Soil aggregate coalescence has not been widely observed and reported in soil science and yet may pose a significant risk for crops preventing them from achieving their genetic and environmental yield potentials. This project used soil penetrometer resistance and an indirect tensile-strength test to measure the early stages of aggregate coalescence and to evaluate their effects on the early growth of tomato plants. The early stages of aggregate coalescence were thought to be affected by a number of factors including: the matric suction of water during application and subsequent drainage, the overburden pressure on moist soil in the root zone, the initial size of soil aggregates prior to wetting, and the degree of sodicity of the soil aggregates. Seven mainexperiments were conducted to evaluate these factors. The matric suction during wetting of a seedbed affects the degree of aggregate slaking that occurs, and the strength of the wetted aggregates. The matric suction during draining affects the magnitude of &#8216;effective stresses&#8217; that operate to retain soil structural integrity as the soil drains and dries out. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of matric suction (within a range of suctions experienced in the field) on aggregate coalescence using soils of two different textures. Sieved aggregates (0.5 to 2 mm diameter) from a coarse-textured and two fine-textured (swelling) soils were packed into cylindrical rings (4.77 cm i.d., 5 cm high) and subjected to different suctions on wetting (near-saturation, and 1 kPa), and on draining (10 kPa on sintered-glass funnels, and 100 kPa on ceramic pressure plates). After one-week of drainage, penetrometer resistance was measured as a function of depth to approximately 45 mm (penetrometer had a recessedshaft, cone diameter = 2 mm, advanced at a rate of 0.3 mm/min). Tensile strength of other core-samples was measured after air-drying using an indirect &#8220;Brazilian&#8221; crushing test. For the coarse-textured soil, penetrometer resistance was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation, despite there being no significant increase in dry bulk density; this was not the case for the finer-textured soils, and it was difficult to distinguish the effects of variable bulk density upon drying from those of the imposed wetting treatments. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, the tensile strength was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation. Thus wetting- and draining-suctions were both found to influence the degree of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. Aggregate coalescence in irrigated crops is known to develop as the growing season progresses. It was therefore thought to be linked to the repeated occurrence of matric suctions that enhance the phenomenon during cycles of wetting and draining. An experiment was conducted to determine the extent of aggregate coalescence in a coarsetextured and two fine-textured (swelling clay) soils during 8 successive cycles of wetting and draining. Sieved aggregates (0.5 to 2 mm diameter) from each soil were packed into cylindrical rings (4.77 cm i.d., 5 cm high) and wetted to near saturation for 24 h. They were then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week, after which penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured as described above. The degree of expression of aggregate coalescence depended on soil type. For the coarse-textured soil, repeated wetting and draining significantly increased bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. For the fine-textured soil, penetrometer resistance and bulk density did not vary significantly with repeated wetting and draining; on the contrary, there was evidence in these swelling clay soils to suggest bulk density and penetrometer resistance decreased. However, there was a progressive increase in tensile strength as cycles of wetting and draining progressed. The expansive nature of the fine-textured soil appears to have masked the development of aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance, but its expression was very clear in measurements of tensile strength despite the reduction in bulk density with successive wetting and draining. Field observations have indicated that aggregate coalescence is first expressed at the bottom of the seedbed and that it develops progressively upward to the soil surface during the growing season. This suggests that overburden pressures may enhance the onset of the phenomenon by increasing the degree of inter-aggregate contact. Soils containing large quantities of particulate organic matter were known to resist the onset of aggregate coalescence to some extent. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of soil organic matter and overburden pressures, by placing brass cylinders of various weights (equivalent to static load pressures of 0, 0.49, 1.47 and 2.47 kPa) on the top of dry soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2 mm diameter) having widely different soil organic carbon contents placed in steel rings 5 cm high and 5 cm i.d. With the weights in place, the aggregates were wetted to near-saturation for 24 h and then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured when the samples were removed from the pressure plates and they all increased significantly with increasing overburden pressure in the soil with low organic matter content, but not in the soil with high organic matter content. The amount of tillage used to prepare seedbeds influences the size distribution of soil aggregates produced &#8211; that is, more tillage produces finer seedbeds. The size distribution of soil aggregates affects the number of inter-aggregate contact points and this was thought to influence the degree of aggregate coalescence that develops in a seedbed. Previous work has shown that soil organic matter reduces aggregate coalescence and so an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of aggregate size and organic matter on the phenomenon. For soils with high and low organic matter contents, aggregate size fractions of &lt; 0.5, 0.5 &#8211; 2, 2 &#8211; 4, and &lt; 4 mm were packed into soil cores (as above) and wetted to near-saturation then drained to 100 kPa suction as described above. Penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured and found to increase directly with the amount of fine material present in the soil cores &#8211; being greater in the &lt; 0.5 mm and &lt; 4 mm fractions, and being less in the 0.5 &#8211; 2 mm and 2 &#8211; 4 mm fractions. In all cases, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were lower in the samples containing more organic matter. The rate at which soil aggregates are wetted in a seedbed affects the degree of slaking and densification that occurs, and the extent to which aggregates are wetted influences the overall strength of a seedbed. Both wetting rate and the extent of wetting were believed to influence the onset of aggregate coalescence and were thought to be affected by soil organic matter and irrigation technique. An experiment was therefore designed to separate these effects so that improvements to management could be evaluated for their greatest efficacy &#8211; that is, to determine whether management should focus on improving irrigation technique or increasing soil organic matter content, or both. The rate of wetting was controlled by spraying (or not spraying) soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2 mm diameter) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Samples of coarse- and fine-textured soils were packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to different application rates of water (1, 10 and 100 mm/h) using a dripper system controlled by a peristaltic pump. Samples were brought to either a near-saturated state or to a suction of 10 kPa for 24 h, and then drained on a pressure plate at a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Measurements of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were then made as described above. As expected, penetrometer resistance was lower in samples treated with PVA before wetting (slower wetting rates) and in samples held at a greater suction (10 kPa) after initial wetting (greater inter-aggregate strength). The effects were more pronounced in the coarse-textured soil. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, tensile strengths increased with increasing wetting rate (greatest for 100 mm/h) and extent of wetting (greater when held at near-saturated conditions). The rate of wetting was found to be somewhat more important for promoting aggregate coalescence than the extent of wetting. Because aggregate coalescence often occurs with little or no increase in bulk density, an explanation for the increase in penetrometer resistance and tensile strength is unlikely to be explained by a large increase in the number of inter-aggregate contacts. An increase in the strength of existing points of inter-aggregate contact was therefore considered in this work. For inter-aggregate bond strengths to increase, it was hypothesized that small increases in the amount of mechanically (or spontaneously) dispersed clay particles, and subsequent deposition at inter-aggregate contact points could increase aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. An experiment was devised to manipulate the amount of spontaneously dispersed clay in coarse- and fine-textured soils of high and low organic matter content. The degree of sodicity of each soil was manipulated by varying the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of soil aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 2mm) above and below a nominal threshold value of 6. Dry aggregates were then packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to wetting near saturation, then draining to a suction of 100 kPa for one week as described above. Measurements were then taken of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength, both of which were affected by ESP in different ways. In the coarse-textured soil, sodicity enhanced aggregate slaking and dispersion, which increased bulk density. While penetrometer resistance also increased, its effect on aggregate coalescence could not be separated from a simple effect of increased bulk density. Similarly, the effect of sodicity on aggregate coalescence in the fine-textured soil was confounded by the higher water contents produced by greater swelling, which produced lower-than-expected penetrometer resistance. Measurements of tensile strength were conducted on air-dry samples, and so the confounding effects of bulk density and water content were eliminated and it was found that tensile strength increased with sodicity in both coarse- and fine-textured soils. The presence of dispersed clay was therefore implicated in the development of aggregate coalescence in this work. Finally, a preliminary evaluation of how the early stages of aggregate coalescence might affect plant growth was attempted using tomatoes (Gross lisse) as a test plant. Seeds were planted in aggregates (0.5 &#8211; 4 mm) of a coarse- or fine-textured soil packed in steel rings. These were wetted at a rate of 1 mm/h to either near-saturation (for maximum coalescence) or to a suction of 10 kPa (for minimum coalescence) and held under these conditions for 24 h. All samples were then transferred to a ceramic pressure plate for drainage to 100 kPa suction for one week. Samples were then placed in a growth-cabinet held at 20C with controlled exposure to 14 h light/day. Germination of the seeds, plant height, and number and length of roots were observed. Germination of the seeds held at near-saturation in both coarse- and fine-textured soils was delayed by 24 h compared with seeds held at 10 kPa suction. Neither the number nor the length of tomato roots differed significantly between the different treatments and soils. In the coarse-textured soil, however, the total root length over a period of 14 days was somewhat greater in the uncoalesced samples than in the coalesced samples, but this difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that aside from delaying germination, aggregate coalescence may not have a large effect on early growth of tomato plants. However, this is not to say that detrimental effects may not be manifest at later stages of plant growth, and this certainly needs to be evaluated, particularly because aggregate coalescence increase with repeated cycles of wetting and draining. In conclusion, the primary findings of the work undertaken in this thesis were: &#8226; Rapid wetting of soil aggregates to near-saturation enhanced the onset of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by (in some cases) penetrometer resistance at a soil water suction of 100 kPa, and (in most cases) tensile strength of soil cores in the air-dry state. The rate of wetting appeared to be more important in bringing on aggregate coalescence than how wet the soil eventually became during wetting. This means reducing the rate at which irrigation water is applied to soils may reduce the onset of aggregate coalescence more effectively than controlling the total amount of water applied &#8211; though both are important. The literature reports that aggregate coalescence occurs in the field over periods of up to several months, involving multiple wetting and draining cycles, but the work here demonstrated that this can occur over much shorter time periods depending on conditions imposed. &#8226; Aggregate coalescence occurred in coarse-textured soils regardless of whether the bulk density increased during wetting and draining. In finer-textured soils, the response to wetting conditions varied and was complicated by changes in bulk density and water content due to swelling. &#8226; Small overburden pressures enhanced the onset of aggregate coalescence, but these effects were diminished in the presence of high soil organic matter contents. &#8226; Finer aggregate size distributions (which are often produced in the field by excessive tillage during seedbed preparation) invariably led to greater aggregate coalescence than coarser aggregate size distributions. The effects of aggregate size were mitigated to some extent by higher contents of soil organic matter. &#8226; Sodicity enhanced aggregate coalescence as measured by tensile strength, but when penetrometer resistance was measured in the moist state, the effects were masked to some extent by higher water contents generated by swelling and dispersion. This work suggests that tensile strength (in the air dry state) may be a more effective measure of aggregate coalescence than penetrometer resistance. &#8226; Early plant response to aggregate coalescence was not large, but the response may become magnified during later stages of growth.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aggregate; bulk density; coalescence; matric suction; organic matter; penetrometer resistance; sodicity; tensile strength; water content</field><field name="subject">Soil structure.</field><field name="subject">Soil penetration test.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/45428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new in vitro method for the study of micro-leakage of dental restorative materials.</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Chin</field><field name="description">Microleakage is an important topic in restorative dentistry.

Good error correcting performance enables efficient and reliable communication. However, a LDPC code decoding algorithm needs to be executed efficiently to meet cost, time, power and bandwidth requirements of target applications. The constructed codes should also meet error rate performance requirements of those applications. Since their rediscovery, there has been much research work on LDPC code construction and implementation. LDPC codes can be designed over a wide space with parameters such as girth, rate and length. There is no unique method of constructing LDPC codes. Existing construction methods are limited in some way in producing good error correcting performing and easily implementable codes for a given rate and length. There is a need to develop methods of constructing codes over a wide range of rates and lengths with good performance and ease of hardware implementability. LDPC code hardware design and implementation depend on the structure of target LDPC code and is also as varied as LDPC matrix designs and constructions. There are several factors to be considered including decoding algorithm computations,processing nodes interconnection network, number of processing nodes, amount of memory, number of quantization bits and decoding delay. All of these issues can be handled in several different ways. This thesis is about construction of LDPC codes and their hardware implementation. LDPC code construction and implementation issues mentioned above are too many to be addressed in one thesis. The main contribution of this thesis is the development of LDPC code construction methods for some classes of structured LDPC codes and techniques for reducing decoding time. We introduce two main methods for constructing structured codes. In the first method, column-weight two LDPC codes are derived from distance graphs. A wide range of girths, rates and lengths are obtained compared to existing methods. The performance and implementation complexity of obtained codes depends on the structure of their corresponding distance graphs. In the second method, a search algorithm based on bit-filing and progressive-edge growth algorithms is introduced for constructing quasi-cyclic LDPC codes. The algorithm can be used to form a distance or Tanner graph of a code. This method could also obtain codes over a wide range of parameters. Cycles of length four are avoided by observing the row-column constraint. Row-column connections observing this condition are searched sequentially or randomly. Although the girth conditions are not sufficient beyond six, larger girths codes were easily obtained especially at low rates. The advantage of this algorithm compared to other methods is its flexibility. It could be used to construct codes for a given rate and length with girths of at least six for any sub-matrix configuration or rearrangement. The code size is also easily varied by increasing or decreasing sub-matrix size. Codes obtained using a sequential search criteria show poor performance at low girths (6 and 8) while random searches result in good performing codes. Quasi-cyclic codes could be implemented in a variety of decoder architectures. One of the many options is the choice of processing nodes interconnect. We show how quasi-cyclic codes processing could be scheduled through a multistage network. Although these net-works have more delay than other modes of communication, they offer more flexibility at a reasonable cost. Banyan and Benes networks are suggested as the most suitable networks. Decoding delay is also one of several issues considered in decoder design and implementation. In this thesis, we overlap check and variable node computations to reduce decoding time. Three techniques are discussed, two of which are introduced in this thesis. The techniques are code matrix permutation, matrix space restriction and sub-matrix row-column scheduling. Matrix permutation rearranges the parity-check matrix such that rows and columns that do not have connections in common are separated. This techniques can be applied to any matrix. Its effectiveness largely depends on the structure of the code. We show that its success also depends on the size of row and column weights. Matrix space restriction is another technique that can be applied to any code and has fixed reduction in time or amount of overlap. Its success depends on the amount of restriction and may be traded with performance loss. The third technique already suggested in literature relies on the internal cyclic structure of sub-matrices to achieve overlapping. The technique is limited to LDPC code matrices in which the number of sub-matrices is equal to row and column weights. We show that it can be applied to other codes with a lager number of sub-matrices than code weights. However, in this case maximum overlap is not guaranteed. We calculate the lower bound on the amount of overlapping. Overlapping could be applied to any sub-matrix configuration of quasi-cyclic codes by arbitrarily choosing the starting rows for processing. Overlapping decoding time depends on inter-iteration waiting times. We show that there are upper bounds on waiting times which depend on the code weights. Waiting times could be further reduced by restricting shifts in identity sub-matrices or using smaller sub-matrices. This overlapping technique can reduce the decoding time by up to 50% compared to conventional message and computation scheduling. Techniques of matrix permutation and space restriction results in decoder architectures that are flexible in LDPC code design in terms of code weights and size. This is due to the fact that with these techniques, rows and columns are processed in sequential order to achieve overlapping. However, in the existing technique, all sub-matrices have to be processed in parallel to achieve overlapping. Parallel processing of all code sub-matrices requires the architecture to have the number of processing units at least equal to the number sub-matrices. Processing units and memory space should therefore be distributed among the sub-matrices according to the sub-matrices arrangement. This leads to high complexity or inflexibility in the decoder architecture. We propose a simple, programmable and high throughput decoder architecture based on matrix permutation and space restriction techniques.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LDPC codes; quasi-cyclic codes; girth; distance graphs; overlapping techniques; LDPC decoder</field><field name="subject">Error-correcting codes (Information theory) Coding theory.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/45525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contribution of periodontal mechanoreceptors to physiological tremor in the human jaw.</field><field name="creator">Sowman, Paul Fredrick</field><field name="description">The human jaw, like all other articulated body parts, exhibits small oscillatory movements during isometric holding tasks. These movements, known as physiological tremor, arise as a consequence of the interaction of various factors. One of these factors is reflex feedback from peripheral receptors. In the human jaw, receptors that innervate the periodontium are able to transduce minute changes in force. This thesis examines the contribution of these periodontal mechanoreceptors (PMRs) to the genesis of physiological tremor of the human jaw. By using frequency domain analysis of time series recorded during isometric biting tasks, the character of physiological jaw tremor can be revealed. Physiological jaw tremor was observed in force recorded from between the teeth as well as from electromyograms recorded from the principal muscles of mastication. These recordings have shown us that jaw physiological tremor consists of a frequency invariant component between 6 and 10Hz. This frequency remains unaltered under various load conditions where the mechanical resonance of the jaw would be expected to vary greatly (Chapter 2). Such findings indicate a &#8216;neurogenic&#8217; origin for this tremor. A possible candidate for this neurogenic component of physiological tremor in the jaw is the reflex feedback arising from the PMRs. Using local anaesthetisation, it has been shown in this thesis, that by blocking outflow from the PMRs, the amplitude of neurogenic physiological jaw tremor can be reduced dramatically. This procedure caused a dramatic reduction in not only the mechanical recordings of tremor but also in the coupling between masseteric muscles bilaterally (Chapter 3) and between single motor units recorded from within a homonymous muscle (Chapter 4). The obvious mechanism by which periodontal mechanoreceptor anaesthetisation could reduce the amplitude of physiological tremor in the jaw would be by reducing the amplitude of the oscillatory input to the motoneurones driving the tremor. This interpretation remains controversial however as physiological tremor in the jaw can be observed at force levels above which the PMRs are supposedly saturated in their response. In light of this knowledge, the saturating characteristics of these receptors in terms of reflex output were examined. To do this, a novel stimulation paradigm was devised whereby the incisal teeth were mechanically stimulated with identical stimulus waveforms superimposed upon increasing tooth preloads. This necessitated the use of a frequency response method to quantify the reflexes. An optimal frequency for stimulation was identified and used to confirm that the hyperbolic saturating response of PMRs observed previously, translated to a similar phenomenon in masticatory reflexes (Chapter 5). These data reinforced the idea that physiological tremor in the jaw was not just a consequence of rhythmic reflex input from PMRs, as the dynamic reflex response uncoupled from the input as the receptor-mediated reflex response saturated. An alternative hypothesis was then developed that suggested the effect of PMR suppression in physiological tremor was via tonic rather than rhythmic effects on the masseteric motoneurone pool. By utilising a novel contraction strategy to manipulate the mean firing rate of the motor neuron pool at a given level of force production, data contained in Chapter 6 shows that population motor unit firing statistics influence the expression of physiological tremor, and such manipulations mimic, to an extent, the changes in firing statistics and tremor amplitude seen during anaesthetisation of the PMRs. This thesis therefore posits a mechanism whereby periodontal input influences the firing rate of motoneurones in such a way as to promote tremulous activity (Chapter 5). However, as this proposed mechanism did not explain the full extent of tremor suppression seen during PMR anaesthetisation it can therefore only be considered a contributing factor in a multifactor process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human; jaw; masseter; tremor; mastication; coherence analysis; EMG; single motor units; mandible; periodontal mechanoreceptors; teeth; periodontium; periodontal ligament</field><field name="subject">Jaws Muscles.

R.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the physical effects of improved actions combined with improved operators in the framework of lattice QCD. All calculations are done in the quenched approximation, that is, when all of the dynamical fermion interactions have been suppressed by setting the determinant of the fermion matrix to a constant. The thesis first briefly introduces lattice QCD to familiarize the reader with the basic concepts. It then describes the common numerical procedures used. It is made up of three major sections. The first is the exploration of gauge field configurations and the study of the role of instantons in lattice QCD. In this work the Wilson gauge action and a standard 1 loop topological charge operator are used to determine the relative rates of standard cooling and smearing algorithms in pure SUc(3)-color gauge theory. I consider representative gauge field configurations on 16&#179; &#215; 32 lattices at &#946; = 5.70 and 24&#179; &#215; 36 lattices at &#946; = 6.00. I find the relative rate of variation in the action and topological charge under various algorithms may be succinctly described in terms of simple formulae &#185;. The results are in accord with recent suggestions from fat-link perturbation theory. This work is then extended to O(a&#178;)-improved gauge action and O(a&#178;)-improved operators &#178;. In particular, an O(a&#178;)-improved version of APE smearing is motivated by considerations of smeared link projection and cooling. The extent to which the established benefits of improved cooling carry over to improved smearing is critically examined. I consider representative gauge field configurations generated with an O(a&#178;)-improved gauge field action on 16&#179; &#215; 32 lattices at &#946; = 4.38 and 24&#179; &#215; 36 lattices at &#946; = 5.00 having lattice spacings of 0.165(2) fm and 0.077(1) fm respectively. While the merits of improved algorithms are clearly displayed for the coarse lattice spacing, the fine lattice results put the various algorithms on a more equal footing and allow a quantitative calibration of the smoothing rates for the various algorithms. I find that the relative rate of variation in the action may also be described in terms of simple calibration formulae for O(a&#178;)-improvement which accurately describes the relative smoothness of the gauge field configurations at a microscopic level. In the second section the first calculation of the gluon propagator using an O(a&#178;)- improved action with the corresponding O(a&#178;)-improved Landau gauge fixing &#179; condition is presented &#8308;. The gluon propagator obtained from the improved action and improved Landau gauge condition is compared with earlier unimproved results on similar physical lattice volumes of 3.2&#179; &#215; 6.4&#8308; fm. It is found that there is good agreement between the improved propagator calculated on a coarse lattice with lattice spacing a = 0.35 fm and the unimproved propagator calculated on a fine lattice with spacing a = 0.10 fm. This motivated us to calculate the gluon propagator on a coarse very large-volume lattice of 5.6&#179; &#215; 11.2&#8308;fm. The infrared behavior observed in previous studies is confirmed. The gluon propagator is enhanced at intermediate momenta and suppressed at infrared momenta. The observed infrared suppression of the Landau gauge gluon propagator is not a finite volume effect. This work is then extended to a variety of lattices with spacing ranging from a = 0.17 to a = 0.4 fm &#8309; to further explore finite volume and discretization effects. In this work a technique previously used for minimizing lattice artifacts, known as &#8220;tree-level correction&#8221;, has also been extended. It is demonstrated that by using tree-level correction, determined by the tree-level behavior of the action being considered, it is possible to obtain scaling behavior over a very wide range of momenta and lattice spacings. This makes it possible to explore the infinite volume and continuum limits of the Landau-gauge gluon propagator. As a final part of this thesis I present the first results for the quark propagator using an Overlap fermionic quark action &#8310;. I compare the results with those obtained from the standard Wilson fermion. The overlap quark action is O(a)-improved compared with the Wilson fermion. This action realizes exact chiral symmetry on the lattice unlike the Wilson fermion and it demonstrates that the fastest way forward in this field is with improved lattice operators. The idea of studying improved actions in lattice gauge theory was suggested to me by A/Prof. Anthony G. Williams during the &#8220;Nonperturbative Methods in Quantum Field Theory&#8221; workshop in early February 1998. Initially it was suggested to me that a calculation of the gluon propagator using improved action on large volumes, following a study just done with standard gauge action in Ref. [62]. The point of interest was to study the effect an improved gauge field action would have on the gluon propagator. This study would then be extended to quark actions. In the meantime when generating gauge field configurations using a computer code written in Fortran 77 (provided by Dr. Derek B. Leinweber), it occurred to me that it would be good to explore the content of these gauge field configurations. In order to do realistic calculations on large lattices we needed a gauge field configuration generator that would run on our CM5 computer and so Connection Machine Fortran (CMF) became the adopted language. I started writing the computer code to generate the gauge field configuration in the SUc(2) with the help of Dr. Derek B. Leinweber, who introduced me to the basic concepts in lattice QCD. I then extended this code to the SUc(3) gauge group. This is commonly known as the standard Wilson gauge action. After investigating with some of the optimization possibilities, I moved on to code an O(a&#178;)-improved gauge action. The code uses a masking procedure for the link update. I have generalized the masking procedure for any planar gauge field action in SUc(N), Ref. [18]. From there it was very obvious that by applying a continuous repetition of some sections of code that I written, that some bigger Wilson loops could easily be included in the action and hence highly improved actions could be easily constructed. The only difficulty was to calculate the improvement coefficients. I then moved on to study smearing algorithms. I adapted the gauge field configuration code to a cooling and a 1 &#215; 2 and 2 &#215; 1 improved cooling code in which we inserted higher order loop operators. This was the tool used to explore gauge field configurations and their topological structures. Once the short range quantum fluctuations are removed it is possible to see instantons. Instantons are believed to play a crucial role in the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking mechanism. We improved the topological charge operator from the clover term to an (1 &#215; 2 and 2 &#215; 1) O(a&#178;)&#8211;improved topological charge operator (see Appendices, Sections E.16 and E.17). This code was subsequently adapted by Sundance Bilson-Thompson so that he could insert higher order loops. I have also inserted my O(a&#178;)&#8211;improved operator to construct an O(a&#178;)&#8211;improved smearing algorithm. Using these tools I have calibrated the relative rates of cooling and smearing. Another piece of work on gauge fixing, reviewed in Chapter 8, was led by Dr. Patrick O. Bowman, Ref. [63]. There I supplied the gauge field configurations and checked some of the analytical work. For the gluon propagator work I supplied all of the lattice configurations with the exception of the 32&#179; &#215; 64 used in Ref. [62]. The analysis was primarily carried out by Dr. Patrick O. Bowman and partly inspired by the one carried out in hep-lat/0106023. While this gluon propagator work is not being presented here as my own Ph. D. qualifying work, I am a co author on the subsequent papers and so I have therefore decided to include a review of this work in Chapter 9. I have also made some contribution in the construction of the Fat&#8211;link quark action (with and without the clover term) developed by James M. Zanotti. These contributions involve the code for the Reunitarization of the smeared links, Appendix E.21. Because of the code developed for the improved lattice definition of the F&#181;&#957;(x) term I have also made some contribution to the Fat&#8211;link clover quark action although I will not discuss about this work in the following thesis. My main contribution for the overlap quark propagator study was in the analysis of the propagator data. The overlap propagators were generated by Dr. Jianbo Zhang and the research was also carried out in collaboration with A/Prof. Anthony G. Williams and Dr. Derek B. Leinweber. The quark propagators for the Wilson fermion were generated by a computer code parallelized by James M. Zanotti and originally written by Prof. Frank X. Lee. The anisotropic lattice code has not been used in any calculations yet although it has been tested and verified. The code was extended from the isotropic improved generator code in SUc(3). After a literature search, we decided to implement the action described in Ref. [31] for the anisotropic Wilson action and in Ref. [11, 32] for the improved anisotropic case. Apart from the work on the gauge fixing and the gluon propagator, done in collaboration with Dr. Patrick O. Bowman, and which for completeness is briefly reviewed in Chapters 8 and 9 respectively, this thesis contains no material which has been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma in any university or other institution and to the best of knowledge and belief, contains no material previously published or written by another person, except where due reference has been made in the text.

HD is one of nine neurological disorders caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that encodes an extended polyglutamine tract within the respective disease proteins (which, in the case of HD, is Huntingtin). Curiously, despite these proteins having mostly widespread patterns of expression in the brain, a specific subset of neurons is preferentially affected in each disease, whilst other neurons also expressing the mutant protein are relatively unaffected. Furthermore, although the expression patterns of these disease proteins often overlap in distribution within the brain, the population of neurons that is most vulnerable differs from one disease to the next. Knowledge of what determines the specificity of neuronal vulnerability is likely to provide insight into the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the pathology in these diseases. The aim of this work was to use the zebrafish model organism to investigate two factors hypothesised to contribute to the specificity of neuronal vulnerability in HD: 1) region-specific somatic expansion of the disease allele, and 2) disruption of normal Huntingtin (Htt) protein function. The most significant findings of this study resulted from the investigation into the normal function of Htt. Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were used to specifically knock down Htt expression in early zebrafish development, resulting in a wide variety of developmental defects. Most notably, Htt-deficient zebrafish had pale blood due to a decrease in haemoglobin production, despite the presence of (apparently unavailable) iron within these cells. Provision of additional iron in a bio-available form to the cytoplasm restored haemoglobin production in Htt-deficient embryos. Since blood cells acquire iron via receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, these results suggest a role for Htt in the release of iron from endocytic compartments into the cytosol. Iron is required for the function of many cellular proteins and enzymes that play key roles in oxidative energy production. Disrupted iron homeostasis and decreased energy metabolism are features of HD pathogenesis that correlate to the major sites of degeneration in the HD brain. The findings of this study raise the possibility that perturbation of normal Htt function (by polyglutamine expansion) may contribute to these defects, thereby providing a novel link between Htt function and specificity of neuronal vulnerability in HD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Huntington's disease; Huntington&#8217;s chorea</field><field name="subject">Huntington's chorea.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/45728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of polyacrylamides on the physical properties of some light-textured soils.</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Shane</field><field name="description">The work presented in this thesis represents a combination of laboratory and field experiments designed to explain some field observations I made on some coarse sands in South Australia in 1999: that much of the irrigation water and nutrients applied to the sands under drip-irrigation simply passed through the root zone leaving the crops water-stressed shortly after irrigation events. There was clearly only minimal lateral spread of the water in these coarse sands. However, by applying small concentrations of polyacrylamide or &#8216;PAM&#8217; in the irrigation water, the crops seemed to do better. Furthermore the timing of irrigation events appeared to be more flexible on the PAM-treated properties. I found this intriguing and saw an opportunity to increase the lateral spread of water in the root zone and thereby increasing the stored volume and residence time of water. By retaining more water in the rootzone, there was potential to save a considerable amount of costly irrigation water, and also improve crop production and quality. With encouragement from my then employer (Elders Pty Ltd) and from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Australia, I undertook to explore my findings in greater detail and to attempt to explain them based on some &#8216;hard&#8217; (experimental) evidence. Increasing the lateral spread of water under drippers in coarse-textured soils requires water to be retained in the root zone for longer periods during irrigation, but the practical methods for doing this are limited to: &#8226; Altering the pore size distribution to create a finer average range of pore sizes, either by compaction or by stabilization of smaller pores using organic matter or additions of clay. &#8226; Reducing the wettability of the soil so that less water can be taken in and the soil never becomes saturated. (This of course risks surface runoff and suboptimal placement of irrigation water). &#8226; Altering the physical properties of irrigation water (eg. viscosity, surface tension) so that it interacts differently with soil pores and moves through them more slowly. The aim of the research was therefore to evaluate the potential for some commercially available PAMs to reduce hydraulic conductivity and to increase water retention on some drip-irrigated coarse sandy soils of South Australia and Victoria. I worked with two commonly available anionic polyacrylamides, designated PAM-1011 and PAM-135, and measured ponded infiltration in laboratory columns of seven different sandy soils from around South Australia and Victoria. I varied the concentration of the polymer within the range typically used in the field (0, 1 and 10 ppm for PAM-1011; 0, 2.5 and 25 ppm for PAM-135) and I also varied the quality of the irrigation water used to mix the PAM solutions in terms of salinity and sodicity (distilled water, 10 and 20 mmol(+) salt/L, using either sodium chloride, calcium chloride, or both). I measured the effects of PAM on pore-size distribution of one of the sands (by the water retention characteristic), on water repellence of the soils (by measuring water droplet penetration times), and the kinematic viscosity of the PAM solutions at various concentrations with various qualities of irrigation water. I also set up transparent cases of sand to observe infiltration and wetting behaviour of the PAM solution. Finally, with some understanding of how the physical and chemical properties of the PAMs, I conducted a field trial to measure the soil water matric potential at various depths and locations around drippers in vine rows receiving PAM in the irrigation water. Laboratory findings: The polymer PAM-1011 significantly reduced the steady-state infiltration rate in all sands, and it did this with relatively modest concentrations (&lt; 10 ppm). The polyacrylamide PAM-135 was not effective for this purpose, which indicated that the chemical properties of the polymer (not investigated here) influenced its physical behaviour. Further work with PAM-135 was therefore discontinued in favour of PAM-1011. The effectiveness of PAM-1011 in reducing steady-state infiltration rates was related to changes in the properties of the irrigating solution caused by PAM-1011 rather than by a change in the properties of the soils to which it is applied. For example, PAM-1011 had only minimal (if any) influence on the pore size distribution (water retention) of a coarse sandy soil and had no significant impact on water repellence (wettability) of another sandy soil. It did, however, have a large impact on the kinematic viscosity of the irrigating solution, and the more PAM-1011 that was dissolved, the more viscous the solutions became. The effectiveness of PAM-1011 in reducing steady-state infiltration rates was reduced in salty irrigation water, and there was evidence to suggest that cation-effects may have been involved. When PAM-1011 was dissolved in distilled water, infiltration rates were reduced by the greatest amount. When PAM-1011 was dissolved in salty water containing the monovalent cation, sodium, infiltration rates were not reduced as much; furthermore, if the solvent water contained the divalent cation, calcium, PAM-1011 was even less effective than in sodium-rich water. Thus electrolytes affected the physical conformation of PAM-1011 solutions, altering viscosity. To overcome the salt-water effects, higher concentrations of PAM-1011 needed to be used. The cation-effects were primarily related to the way each cation interacted with the polymer to alter its kinematic viscosity. PAM-1011 in distilled water had the greatest viscosity, while PAM-1011 in sodium-rich water had a lower viscosity, and PAM-1011 in calcium-rich water had the lowest viscosity. A practical implication from this is that irrigators using salty waters will need to dissolve more PAM-1011 in their water-sources to increase the viscosity and thus gain the retarding effects of the polymer on infiltration rates. The data suggest that the amount of polymer required to overcome the salt effects is about 10 ppm PAM-1011. Rates as low as 1 ppm can be used when irrigators have access to high-quality water with &lt; 10 mmol(+) salt/L present. Visual observations of the wetting fronts during infiltration showed that irrigation water containing PAM-1011 at between 1 and 10 ppm reduced the depth of percolation and increased its lateral spread in coarse sands. Field study: The field work was largely unsuccessful because shortly after the treatments were applied, a 1-in-100 year hailstorm struck that completely wiped out the vegetation on the vines in the study. I spent most of the season simply trying to keep the vines alive and to recover some of the leaf area for future years. Overall, however, this work identified the ability of PAM-1011 to reduce water movement through the root zone of coarse sands, and demonstrates the potential to conserve a great deal of water &#8211; a significant move toward higher water- and nutrient-use efficiencies on the coarser textured soils in the Murray-Darling Basin.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polyacrylamide, physical properties</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/45729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SALMO-OO : a process-based simulation library for lake ecosystems.</field><field name="creator">Cetin, Lydia T.</field><field name="description">Over the past three decades numerous lake ecosystem models incorporating algal population dynamics have been developed and published. However, most of these models have been constructed, calibrated and validated ad hoc to suit one specific lake application. Even though many models, including SALMO (Benndorf and Recknagel, 1982; Recknagel and Benndorf, 1982), were designed and validated as being generic for a range of lake properties they were always rigid in their process equations and parameter values. This study discusses the concept, implementation and testing of SALMO-OO towards a more generic simulation library for lakes by taking advantage of object oriented design and Java programming. A library of three phytoplankton growth and three grazing process models have been implemented in SALMO-OO, with the aim to increase the generality and flexibility of SALMO-OO for simulations of lakes with different trophic states and mixing conditions. The initial focus was on phytoplankton models that were of the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that displayed a similar model rationale to the original SALMO model. Three phytoplankton growth and three grazing models implemented in the full object-oriented version of the model (SALMO-OO) as a simulation library of alternative process models. Combinations of different growth and grazing functions were tested within the simulation library to find generic model structures for lakes with different trophic state and mixing conditions. The validation of the SALMO-OO simulation library was based on comparison between the simulation library experiments and the results produced by the original SALMO-OO growth and grazing functions for phytoplankton biomass, zooplankton biomass, phosphate concentration and algal functional groups abundances. Root-mean square error (RMSE) and r2 values are given as a quantitative measure of fit between the measured data and the model outputs for each state variable. The results demonstrate the ability of the SALMO-OO model to simulate a variety of trophic and mixing conditions for freshwater lakes using a generic approach, and the ability of the simulation library to improve the validation results for each lake simulated. Generic model structures were found for different categories of lakes based on trophic state (eu-/hyper-, meso- and oligotrophic) and mixing conditions (dimictic and warm monomictic). A key factor that has determined a particular generic model structure has been the realistic simulation of phytoplankton functional groups dynamics. By providing the simulation library as an additional validation toolbox this has improved the overall model performance to give more accurate and realistic results for phytoplankton dynamics. As a result, the SALMO-OO model is a more comprehensive decision support tool for lake and reservoir management, which can be used to support the ranking of management scenarios and to base decisions on understanding and expert knowledge. Future research for the SALMO-OO simulation library includes the integration of a multiple parameter optimisation option based on evolutionary algorithms. This will calibrate parameter values within their range of variance to improve the accuracy of simulation results. It is concluded that the object-oriented implementation of ODE based ecosystem models significantly improves its knowledge base, functionality and accuracy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/45816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetics of barley yellow dwarf virus resistance in barley and rice.</field><field name="creator">Collins, Nicholas C.</field><field name="description">Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), an aphid transmitted luteovirus, is the most widespread and economically damaging virus of cereal crops. The work in this thesis aims to characterise the basis of the naturally occurring resistance to BYDV in cereals in three ways: Firstly, by facilitating the isolation of the Yd2 gene for BYDV resistance from barley by a map-based approach. Secondly, by determining if a BYDV resistance gene in rice is orthologous to Yd2. Thirdly, by establishing if other BYDV resistance genes in non- Ethiopian barleys are allelic to Yd2. It is hoped that the information generated in this study will ultimately assist in the production of BYDV resistant cereal cultivars. A detailed genetic map of the Yd2 region of barley chromosome 3 was constructed, containing 19 RFLP loci, the centromere and the Yd2 gene. Yd2 mapped on the long arm, 0.5 cM from the centromere, and in the mapping population of 106 F2 individuals, perfectly cosegregated with the RFLP loci XYlp, and Xwg889. This map represents the first stage in a project to isolate the Yd2 gene by a map-based approach. The isolation of Yd2 could help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the Yd2-mediated BYDV resistance, and may allow the production of BYDV resistant cereals by genetic transformation. The RFLP markers mapped closest to Yd2 could also be useful in barley breeding, by enabling selection for both the presence of Yd2 and the absence of agronomically undesirable traits known to be closely linked to Yd2. Genetically Directed Representational Difference Analysis (GDRDA) is a technique based on subtractive hybridisation, which can be used to identify RFLP markers closely linked to a gene of interest. Two GDRDA experiments were performed with the intention of generating additional RFLP markers close to Yd2. However, the first experiment yielded RFLP probes that were not derived from the barley genome, while the second experiment yielded probes that detected repetitive sequences. It was concluded that GDRDA is of limited use in generating further markers close to Yd2. To isolate the Yd2 gene by a map-based approach, a much larger mapping population will need to be analysed to genetically resolve markers tightly linked to Yd2. If the two morphological markers uzu dwarf and white stripe,,j flank Yd2, then they could assist in this task by enabling the visual identification of F2 seedlings resulting from recombination close to Yd2. However, in this study, both morphological markers were found to be located distal to Yd2. Therefore, these two morphological markers can not be used together to facilitate high resolution genetic mapping of the Yd2 locus. It may be possible to use large-insert genomic DNA clones from the relatively small genome of rice to generate further RFLP markers close to the Yd2 gene in barley, provided that the order of orthologous sequences in barley and rice is conserved close to the Yd2 locus. To assess the feasibility of this approach, RFLP probes used to identify loci close to Yd2 were mapped in rice using a segregating rice F2 population. Five of the RFLP loci mapped together and in the same order as RFLP loci mapped close to Yd2 in barley using the same probes. By comparing the location of RFLPs mapped by other researchers in rice using probes mapped close to Yd2, the region of conserved linkage between rice and the Yd2 region was tentatively identified as the central portion of rice chromosome 1. The collinearity shown by orthologous sequences in barley and rice indicated that it may indeed be possible to use rice to assist in generating RFLP markers close to Yd2. Of all the cereals, rice is the most amenable to map-based gene isolation, due to its small genome, well developed physical and genetic maps, and its ability to be genetically transformed with high efficiency. If a BYDV resistance gene that is orthologous to Yd2 could be identified in rice, this gene could be isolated with relative ease, and then used to identify barley cDNA clones corresponding to Yd2 gene by virtue of the sequence homology expected between these genes. To test if a BYDV resistance gene from an Italian rice line is orthologous to Yd2, recombinant-inbred rice lines previously characterised for this gene were analysed using probes mapped close to Yd2 in barley. No genetic linkage was detected between the RFLP loci and the BYDV resistance gene, indicating that the gene is unlikely to be orthologous to Yd2. BYDV resistance alleles at the Yd2 locus which are of a non-Ethiopian origin may show interesting differences to Ethiopian Yd2 resistance alleles. To identify barleys which may contain resistance alleles of Yd2, ten BYDV resistant barleys not known to contain Yd2 were assessed for their resistance to the PAVadel isolate of BYDV in the glasshouse. CI 1179, Rojo, Perry, Hannchen, Post and CI 4228 were found to be the most resistant under these conditions, and were analysed further. If the resistance from these barleys is controlled by alleles of Yd2, RFLP markers close to Yd2 will be expected to cosegregate with the resistance in F2 families derived from crosses between these resistant barleys and the BYDV susceptible barleys Atlas and Proctor. RFLPs suitable for use in these allelism tests were identified using probes mapped close to Yd2. However, time did not permit the analysis of these F2 populations.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">barley yellow dwarf viruses; barley - disease and pest resistance - genetic aspects; rice - disease and pest resistance - genetic aspects; barley - genetics; rice - genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/46063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From plateau pastures to urban fringe: sedentarisation of nomadic pastoralists in Ladakh, north-west India.</field><field name="creator">Goodall, Sarah K.</field><field name="description">The sedentarisation of nomadic pastoralists in Ladakh, north-west India, is taking place amidst a global trend toward settlement. Despite a few exceptions, where pastoralism either continues to thrive or is being revitalised by market reform, many nomadic pastoral communities are facing a period of unprecedented change, as they are increasingly drawn into national and international economies. This study focuses on the migration of Ladakh&#8217;s nomadic pastoralists from their traditional grazing lands to the rapidly urbanising capital Leh. Three separate communities were studied to determine their levels of out-migration and settlement and to explore the causes and consequences of the decision to settle. The research design encompassed both sending and receiving communities and uses a multi-level approach to assess the combined influence of macro-level (structural) and micro (individual and household-level) factors on the decision to migrate. Data from a survey of 103 migrant households and in-depth interviews conducted in each of the three nomadic pastoral communities shed light on the complex nature of population mobility. The data reveal the communities to be characterised by distinct forms of mobility (large scale, permanent out-migration from one community, seasonal circulation from the second, and low-level traditional forms of out-migration from the third). It is argued that the community-level differences in out-migration are not indicative of a progressive decline of nomadic pastoralism in the region. The nomadic communities are facing substantial pressure from external socio-economic change and migration to the urban area is seen as a strategy for survival and security optimisation. However, the extent to which the communities utilise this strategy is influenced by locally specific normative and regulatory factors.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/46332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimism in child development: conceptual issues and methodological approaches.</field><field name="creator">Farrall, Edwina M.</field><field name="description">Past research into optimism and pessimism has tended to view these constructs as polar opposites of a fixed personality trait that function in mutually exclusive ways. In the field of child development in particular, this has led to theory-driven work that not only accepts this dichotomy but also uses it to drive and explicate larger issues of resilience and vulnerability. The current thesis challenges the assumptions underpinning this conceptual framework, and, through the use of divergent methodologies, seeks to establish children&#8217;s optimism as a dynamic and adaptive process with predictive value during the developmental period. In the first two studies, predictors and correlates of putative dispositional optimism and pessimism in children and adolescents were examined. A significant age-related decline in optimism was found, but importantly a degree of functional independence between optimism and pessimism was also observed. The third study elicited more specific optimistic expectancies using a vignette methodology. This was seen to share some congruence with the earlier measures of dispositional optimism, but the study also elucidated some of the parameters and realism constraining children&#8217;s optimism. Again an age-related decline in optimism was demonstrated that was distinct from any associated changes in pessimism. The fourth and final study involved a pilot examination of the dimensionality of the optimism construct, confirming its functional independence from pessimism, and also demonstrating the fluidity and receptivity of children&#8217;s optimistic processes from an intervention perspective. From these various studies, it is concluded that optimistic and pessimistic processes in children and adolescents reflect functionally distinct pathways and drive different aspects of vulnerability and well-being. A reconfiguration of the extant theory in this area seems warranted. Based on this conceptual and methodological critique, a preliminary proposal is put forward towards a more substantive approach to the development of optimism and pessimism during childhood and adolescence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optimism; pessimism; children; child development; methods</field><field name="subject">Child development</field><field name="subject">Child psychology Philosophy.</field><field name="subject">Optimism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/46518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A grounded theory study of the issues and challenges that impact on transplant coordinators and their practice.</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Mary Johanna.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to identify and explore issues and challenges that impact on transplant coordinators and their practice. Such identification enhances understanding of their role, provides evidence for decision-makers to facilitate the positive aspects of the coordinators' practice, highlights their professional needs and contributions and provides baseline data for future research, education and policy development. The study used both qualitative and quantitative data. Data collection methods involved focus group interviews and Delphi surveys. Participants were coordinators who were employed on a full-time, part-time or relieving basis. Recruitment of participants was done by purposive and snowball sampling. There were 112 coordinators in the study and each was randomly assigned to the focus groups or Delphi survey phases of the research. The analysis of the focus group data together with the literature, informed the development of the first Delphi survey. The second Delphi survey was developed using the data from the focus groups, literature and the first survey. Four categories emerged from the data. The first involved 'knowledge and experience', which explored the education needs of coordinators and the issue of nursing qualification requirements. The work environment, demands and conditions, together with role attributes were discussed in the next category - 'the role'. Recipient, donor family and transplant coordinator outcomes were addressed in the 'outcomes&#8217; category. The basic social process &#8211; building relationships - explored the relationships that coordinators have with the health team and their client groups. Four types of relationships emerged which were supportive, non-supportive, aggressive and virtual relationships. The emergent theory of the challenges that transplant coordinators face relates to the building of relationships. The theory also discovers how knowledge and experience, the role and outcomes impact on the building of these relationships in an interdependent manner. This study also emphasises that the transplant coordinators' role is complex, demanding and distinctly unique in terms of the context within which coordinators practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transplant coordinator; donor coordinator; organ donor coordinator; recipient coordinator; solid organ donation; transplantation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/46912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring social practices in English classes: a qualitative investigation of classroom talk in a Korean secondary school.</field><field name="creator">Lim, Mi-ok</field><field name="description">This study examines English language teaching practices at a public secondary school in Korea. The study documents teaching practices and participation and interaction in class, within the context of the National Curriculum for English Education. Classroom practices, the Curriculum and the textbook used by the teacher are analysed from the perspective of language as a meaning-making resource and language learning as learning how to mean. An ethnographic research approach to data collection and analysis has been employed. Classes were video-recorded and transcribed in order to describe English language use. This took place in two stages. In the first stage the teacher&#8217;s normal English lessons based on a textbook were documented. In the second, intervention stage, the teacher and researcher planned and implemented text-based lessons with the same class. The analysis of the Curriculum, the textbook and English use in normal classes reveals a theory of language and language teaching based on learning traditional grammar and memorization of words and phrases. The intervention lessons offered alternative opportunities for students to share meanings in English. The evidence from this study has provided insights into the social practices and discourses in an English as a foreign language secondary school class. The analysis shows discourse changes depending on the type of texts used. The use of authentic texts offered students opportunities for making meanings in context. This has implications for teaching English in Korea, particularly given the National Curriculum&#8217;s aim to develop communication skills in English.

Both forms induce a combination of brown necrotic spots and extensive chlorosis in susceptible barley cultivars. Although a number of low molecular weight compounds (LMWCs) have been previously isolated from P. teres culture filtrates, they only induced certain components of symptoms. Fungal metabolites were extracted from culture filtrates of both forms of the pathogen and separated into low (&lt;3kDa) and high molecular weight compounds (HMWCs, &gt;10 kDa) with each fraction inducing a component of the net blotch symptoms in a barley leaf toxicity assay. Inactivation of both LMWCs (&lt;1kDa) and HMWCs resulted in loss of activity confirming their potential role in symptom development. Low molecular weight compounds induced chlorosis and water soaking but not the brown necrotic spots or lesions usually seen during the infection of barley by P. teres. The high molecular weight compounds (&gt;10 kDa) induced the brown necrotic spots or lesions with no chlorosis evident. Further characterisation of LMWCs showed that they are not host specific while HMWCs exhibited host specificity. LMWCs were purified and further analysed using high voltage paper electrophoresis, staining and mass spectrometry. Electrophoretic properties and staining of the LMWCs with ninhydrin indicated that both forms of P. teres produced similar LMWCs in the conditions grown. Each form produced eight ninhydrin-positive compounds with the samerelative mobilities. Each individual compound was shown to induce chlorosis in excised barley leaves. All compounds except the one isolated in this study appear to be derivatives of or are the previously described compounds; N-(2-amino-2carboxyethyl) aspartic acid (Toxin A), aspergillomarasmine A, anhydroaspergillomarasmine A and aspergillomarasmine B. The exception is a bioactive UV absorbing LMWC which appears to be a reductive conjugation of the &#945;-keto acid of phenylalanine with Toxin A. The HMWCs (&gt;10kDa) were proteinaceous since they were identifiable using Coomassie staining. Additionally, the loss of activity that occurred with incubation at 40, 60, and 80 &#176;C for 30 and 60 min followed a pattern fairly typical for protein denaturation. Further, treatment with protease decreased their phytotoxicity in proportion to the amount of enzyme used. Enzyme and heat treatment of proteins extracted from each form showed that proteins of P. teres f. teres are more resistant to heat and enzyme treatment compared with those of P. teres f. maculata. This suggests the protein(s) involved in symptom induction by P. teres f. teres and P. teres f. maculata are different which contributes to the difference in the symptom expression during the interaction between the pathogens and barley. Proteinaceous metabolites extracted from P. teres f. teres and P. teres f. maculata ranged from 10 to 100 kDa. Fractions purified using gel filtration had biological activity when they contained eight proteins when extracted from P. teres f. maculata (90, 80, 75, 55, 48, 35, 14 and 12 kDa) and six proteins when extracted from P. teres f. teres (90, 80, 55, 48, 14 and 12 kDa). Additionally, intercellular washing fluids (IWF) extracted from barley plants inoculated with both forms of P. teres, contained proteins of the same size as those in the biologically active fractions extracted from culture filtrates of P. teres f. maculata (80, 14 and 12 kDa) and P. teres f. teres (80, 48 and 14 kDa). Automated MS/MS sequencing of the biologically active proteins showed no resemblance to the sequences or conserved domain information available in public databases and as a consequence, these proteins were considered as novel proteins for P. teres. However, exact short matches with fragments resulting from the 80, 48 and 14 kDa proteins, showed considerable homology with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and their components, cellulases, serine proteinases as well as some hypothetical proteins isolated from different fungal species. Reaction of six plant species including one susceptible barley cultivar (Sloop) and one resistant line (CI9214) to P. teres showed that partially purified proteins induce the symptoms selectively in barley cultivars where the proteinaceous metabolites only induced brown necrotic spot/lesions in barley with a greater response seen on the susceptible cultivar Sloop when compared to the resistant line CI9214. No symptoms were seen on other plant species employed in this study suggesting that the proteinaceous metabolites isolated in this study are host specific phytotoxins. This research has allowed the first isolation of proteinaceous host-specific toxins from P. teres as well as the identification of a UV-sensitive LMWC phytotoxin not previously described. Proteinaceous toxins induced brown necrotic spots/lesions specific to the host while the LMWCs induced chlorosis in a number of different plant species. This contributes significantly to the body of knowledge defining how symptoms are caused during the pathogenicity process in the interaction between P. teres and barley.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pyrenophora teres; toxins; barley</field><field name="subject">Pyrenophora teres.</field><field name="subject">Barley net-spot blotch disease.</field><field name="subject">Barley -- Diseases and pests.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolic physiology of the southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) and mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus).</field><field name="creator">Fitzgibbon, Quinn Patrick</field><field name="description">The bluefin tuna have a variety of distinctive anatomical and physiological adaptations that enhance performance. However, our understanding of bluefin tuna physiology is limited by the logistical difficulties of studying these large pelagic fish. This thesis examines some aspects of the metabolic physiology of the southern bluefin tuna. It provides insight into the high-performance, high-energy demand physiology of bluefin. It also examines the metabolic physiology of the mulloway, another important aquaculture species for which physiological information is currently limited.  1. Routine metabolic rate (RMR) of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) (Thunnus maccoyii), the largest tuna specimens studied so far (body mass = 19.6 kg (&#177; 1.9 SE)) was measured in a large (250,000 l) flexible polypropylene respirometer &#8220;mesocosm respirometer&#8221;. Mean mass-specific RMR was 460 mg kg&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; (&#177; 34.9) at a mean water temperature of 19&#176;C. When total RMR is added to published values of other tuna species at equivalent swimming speeds, there is a strong allometeric relationship with body mass (654 &#8226; Mb &#8304;&#183;&#8313; &#8309;, R &#178; = 0.97). This demonstrates that interspecific RMR of tuna scale with respect to body mass similar to that of other teleosts, but is approximately 5-fold higher than the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of other active teleost species.  2. This study reports on the first measurements of the metabolic cost of food digestion and assimilation (specific dynamic action, SDA) of a tuna species. Oxygen consumption (MO&#8322;) and swimming velocity of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) (Thunnus maccoyii) were elevated for periods between 20-45 h (longest for the largest rations) post-ingestion of sardines (Sardinops sagax). It is suggested that the purpose of increased swimming velocity was to increase ventilation volume as a response to the enhanced metabolic demand associated with SDA. The magnitude of SDA as a proportion of gross energy ingested (SDA coefficient) averaged 35 &#177; 2.2 %. This demonstrates that the absolute energetic cost of SDA in SBT is approximately double that recorded in other teleost species.  3. This study examines the effects of sardines (Sardinops sagax) with high- (12.9%) or low- (1.8-4.0%) lipid level on specific dynamic action (SDA) and swimming velocity of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) (Thunnus maccoyii). Fish swam faster during the SDA period with the increase in velocity being greatest for the fish that ingested the high-lipid sardine. Magnitude of SDA was also greater for fish that ingested the high-lipid sardines. However, the energetic cost of SDA as a proportion of ingested energy was not significantly different between fish that ingested the high- (34.3 &#177; 2.4%) and low-lipid sardines (31.5 &#177; 2.9%). These results confirm that the high energetic cost of SDA is ecologically relevant.  4. In this study the metabolic and behavioural responses of both fasted and postprandial southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii, SBT) to low dissolved oxygen (DO) was examined. In moderate hypoxia (4.44 and 3.23 mg l&#8315;&#185;), swimming velocity (U) and routine metabolic rate (RMR) of fasted fish was mildly enhanced. At 2.49 mg l&#8315;&#185;, U increase to over double in the normoxic speed, possibly as an escape response. At 1.57 mg l&#8315;&#185;, both U and RMR were suppressed and SBT failed to survive the entire 20 h exposure period. This reveals that SBT are remarkably well adapted to low DO. Feeding did not greatly influence their hypoxia tolerance. In a subsequent experiment there were no significant differences in U, RMR and gastric evacuation rates of postprandial SBT in hypoxia (2.84 mg l&#8315;&#185;) compared to those in normoxia (7.55 mg l-&#185;).   5. In this study, 768 h of simultaneous recordings of metabolic rate (MR, = heat production) and visceral temperature were made in both fasted and postprandial southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii) of two sizes (~10 and 20 kg) and at two water temperatures (~19 and 16&#176;C). Duration and magnitude of specific dynamic action (SDA) were strongly related to duration and magnitude of postprandial visceral warming providing the first empirical evidence of a link between SDA and postprandial visceral warming. Visceral temperature of fasted SBT was also directly related to MR. In this case, source of heat is thought to be metabolic work performed within the red muscles which warmed the viscera through thermal conductance. Visceral excess temperatures were over 1&#176;C warmer in larger than smaller SBT. Better heat retention ability of the larger SBT is likely attributed to improved retia mirabilia development and greater thermal inertia. SBT at 16&#176;C maintained visceral excess temperatures significantly warmer than similarly sized fish at 19&#176;C. This demonstrates some ability of SBT to physiologically regulate visceral warming.  6. In this study, the effect of progressively severe hypoxia levels on the swimming performance and metabolic scope of juvenile mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) were investigated. In normoxic conditions (6.85 mg l&#8315;&#185;), standard metabolic rate (SMR) and cost of transport were typical for subcarangiform fish species. Mulloway had a moderate scope for aerobic metabolism (5 times the SMR). The critical dissolved oxygen level was 1.80 mg l&#8315;&#185; revealing that mulloway are well adapted to hypoxia. In all levels of hypoxia (5.23, 3.64, and 1.86 mg l&#8315;&#185;) the active metabolic rate was reduced however, the critical swimming velocity was reduced only at 3.64, and 1.86 mg l&#8315;&#185;. Mulloway metabolic scope was significantly reduced at all hypoxia levels, suggesting that even mild hypoxia may reduce growth productivity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tuna; metabolic rate; specific dynamic action; hypoxia; mulloway; oxygen consumption</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into insect chemical plume tracking using a mobile robot.</field><field name="creator">Harvey, David John.</field><field name="description">Insects are confronted with the problem of locating food, mates, prey and hosts for their young over long distances, which they often overcome using chemical plume tracking. Tracking a plume of chemical back to its source is made difficult due to the complexity of plume structure. Turbulence and shifts in the wind direction prevail over diffusion in the spreading of an airborne chemical from a point in most cases, producing intricate plumes consisting of filaments of high chemical concentration interspersed with regions of clean air. It has been proposed that insects achieve plume tracking in this environment through variations of anemotaxis, which involves travelling upwind when an attractive chemical is perceived. This study aimed to investigate anemotaxis through the use of a mobile robot to test the efficacy of algorithms which mimic the way insects achieve plume tracking and also to determine whether these algorithms are an effective means of plume tracking for a mobile robot under a range of conditions. To achieve the aims of this study, various plume-tracking algorithms were implemented on a mobile robot built to model a plume-tracking insect and their performance was compared under a range of wind conditions. The algorithms tested were based upon a range of plume-tracking hypotheses. The simplest algorithm was surge anemotaxis, where the robot surged upwind in the presence of an attractive chemical and performed crosswind casting (back and forth motion) in the absence of chemical. The other algorithms tested were the counterturner, where the robot zigzagged upwind, and two bounded search methods. To allow these algorithms to be appropriately implemented, a robot model was constructed that could move in two dimensions and sense the wind velocity and ion level at a point in space. An ion plume was used instead of a chemical plume in each test as it behaves in a similar manner to a chemical plume, but ion sensors have response and recovery times far more rapid than conventional chemical sensors, similar to insects. The plume-tracking robot was tested in three series of tests. Initially, the entire range of plume-tracking algorithms was tested in a wind tunnel with fixed wind direction for a range of wind speeds and release positions. The second series of tests compared the performance of the surge anemotaxis and bounded search algorithms, again in a wind tunnel, but with a wind shift of 20&#176; during some of the tests. The algorithms were tested with and without a direct crosswind surge response to detected wind shifts. The third set of tests examined the performance of the simple and wind shift response algorithms outdoors using natural wind to produce the plume. All algorithms tested achieved successful plume tracking in some conditions. The surge anemotaxis and triangular bounded search algorithms were particularly successful. The tests also showed that the paths obtained from tests undertaken in natural outdoor wind conditions varied greatly from those undertaken in a wind tunnel. This indicates the need to test plume-tracking algorithms in natural environments. This is vital both in the investigation of insect plume-tracking behaviour, as insects navigate in these environments, and in the process of producing plume-tracking robots that are capable of operating effectively in these conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile robots; plume tracking; biologically inspired systems</field><field name="subject">Robots Design and construction.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio of compositions [music] : Rothko's red (orchestral tone poem) ; The portrait : a musical tribute to Stella Bowen (music theatre work) / Becky Llewellyn</field><field name="creator">Llewellyn, Rebecca Ann</field><field name="description">The portfolio contains two of Becky Llewellyn&#8217;s music compositions: an orchestral tone poem and a chamber opera score and libretto created to explore the process of producing a major work of music theatre from conception to performance. In both works, Llewellyn&#8217;s research has concentrated on her interest in structure and form between ideas, music and visual art and their relationship to each other. Rothko&#8217;s Red The first composition in her submission is her orchestral tone poem, Rothko&#8217;s Red, a tribute to US artist Mark Rothko, whose painting techniques questioned traditional forms of narrative and structure. The topographical matrix of Rothko&#8217;s Red contains vertical aural space introduced in a &#8216;keyed up&#8217; range suggesting &#8216;redness&#8217;, gradually deepening until the bass predominates, retaining a widened spaciality at the peak moment. Horizontally, the piece is a long crescendo of extended phrases, at first lightweight, then filling out with each repetition, moving to a full expression of orchestral magnitude, then gradually subsiding. The tone poem passes limited melodies and harmonies around to and within the orchestral families, as if in one colour. Llewellyn&#8217;s use of individual dynamics for orchestral players is an experiment in aural equivalence of Rothko techniques, using &#8216;heard&#8217;, not &#8216;seen&#8217; tone colours. The Portrait: a musical tribute to Stella Bowen Llewellyn&#8217;s chamber opera is based on books, letters, diaries and family history research into the life of Adelaide-born writer and painter, Stella Bowen and three other writers. The opera&#8217;s libretto is structured as a series of songs reflecting Bowen&#8217;s paintings and life story. The chamber opera opens and closes in 1944, with Bowen as a WWII Australian war artist. The opera spans from 1917, when as a London art student, Bowen is introduced to editor/writer, Ford Madox Ford with whom she falls in love. The opera moves through to Paris and Ford&#8217;s subsequent love affair with writer Jean Rhys and his death in 1939. The Portrait is an exploration of how we know who we are and how, as artists, we choose to represent those insights. As the four main characters each wrote about themselves and each other, Llewellyn used their distinct content, style and aesthetic concerns to invent their musical and dramatic personae. The Portrait plays with ideas these four artists explored of extended metaphors, a shifting ambiguity in &#8216;artifice as a real story&#8217;, in an imagined dramatic musical work about real artists and writers; life as art and art as life. Among other themes in The Portrait; thanatos and eros, culture and morality, war and peace, fate and choice and opera as portraiture, is an underlying structural theme of time itself. Mythic time is explored as fairytale. Historical time ranges from 1920s chordal and dance motifs back to associations of medieval castles, where western-style Romantic love began. Personal, subjective experience of time is explored by most characters, as is the lack of artistic time given domestic commitments. Objective &#8216;time as limited&#8217; is explored with Ford&#8217;s death and the impending death of the Australian bomber crew. Llewellyn focuses on the timebased art-form of music, while incorporating words, Bowen&#8217;s paintings and archival photographs in a chamber opera that explores the potential each art-form carries for revelation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orchestral tone poem - Rothko's Red; music theatre work - The Portrait - a musical tribute to Stella Bowen</field><field name="subject">Bowen Stella Songs and music.</field><field name="subject">Symphonic poems</field><field name="subject">Operas</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying the risk of geotechnical site investigations</field><field name="creator">Goldsworthy, Jason Scott</field><field name="description">The site investigation phase plays a vital role in any foundation design where inadequate characterisation of the subsurface conditions may lead to either a significantly over designed foundation that is not cost-effective, or an under-designed foundation, which may result in foundation failure. As such, the scope of an investigation should be dependent on the conditions at the site and the importance of the structure. However, it is common for the expense dedicated to the site investigation to be a fraction of the total cost of the project, and is typically determined by budget and time constraints, and the experience and judgement of the geotechnical engineer. However, additional site investigation expenditure or sampling is expected to reduce the financial risk of the design by reducing the uncertainties in the geotechnical system and protecting against possible foundation failures. This research has quantified the relative benefits of undertaking site investigations of increased and differing scope. This has been achieved by simulating the design process to yield a foundation design based on the results of a site investigation. Such a design has been compared to an optimal design that utilises the complete knowledge of the soil, which has only been possible due to the use of simulated soils. Comparisons between these two design types indicate the performance of the site investigation to accurately or adequately characterise the site conditions. Furthermore, the design based on the results of the site investigation have been analysed using the complete knowledge of the soil. This yields a probability of failure and, therefore, has been included in a risk analysis where the costs associated with the site investigation have been measured against the financial risk of the design. As such, potential savings in financial risk for increased site investigation expenditure have been subsequently identified. A Monte Carlo analysis has been used in this research to incorporate the uncertainties in the foundation design process. Uncertainties have been included due to soil variability; sampling errors; measurement and transformation model errors; and errors related to the use of a simplified foundation response prediction method. The Monte Carlo analysis has also provided the means to obtain results in a probabilistic framework to enable reliability and risk analyses. Computer code has been specifically developed with an aim to: generate a simulated soil that conforms to the variability of soil properties; simulate a site investigation to estimate data for a foundation design; simulate the design of a foundation and conduct a reliability and risk analysis of such a design. Results indicate that there are significant benefits to be derived from increasing the scope of a site investigation in terms of the risk and reliability of the foundation design. However, it also appears that an optimal site investigation scope or expenditure exists where additional expenditure leads to a design with a higher financial risk due to the increased cost of the site investigation. The expected savings in terms of financial risk are significant when compared to the increased investigation cost.

However, there is no evidence to support the contention that existing and proposed undergraduate nursing curricula in Sri Lankan universities are based on a common philosophy or an acceptable needs assessment. Purpose The overall purpose of this study was to develop an evidence-based conceptual framework for undergraduate nursing curricula in Sri Lanka. Method This study has involved conducting critical reviews of literature, two systematic reviews, developing a draft conceptual framework, testing its appropriateness and feasibility with key stakeholders (nursing academics, administrators, clinicians) via focus group discussions in Sri Lanka, and formulating the final conceptual framework for nursing curricula in Sri Lanka. Findings The systematic reviews revealed that the evidence regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of undergraduate nursing curricula is notably weak and direct transfer of the curriculum model from one country to another is not appropriate without first assessing the cultural context of both countries. The conceptual framework, which was developed using the finding of systematic reviews and literature reviews, consists of widely recognised nursing concepts in international and local contexts. However, some concepts can not be directly applicable because of cultural and economic impediments. Discussion The cultural, social, political and economic contexts of a country have a direct impact on its health and education systems. This study identified several factors that shape the approach to nursing curricula in Sri Lanka. These factors include: Western influence; Sri Lanka&#8217;s cultural influence; the current healthcare system and demand for healthcare; nursing systems and regulation; medical dominance; financial support; and Sri Lanka&#8217;s education system. All of these factors influence the conceptualisation of nursing and educational strategies needed to effectively and appropriately prepare nurses in Sri Lanka. I propose seven recommendations to support the implementation of the study findings into practice in Sri Lanka.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conceptual framework; nursing curricula; undergraduate curricula - Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Nurses -- Training of -- Sri Lanka.</field><field name="subject">Nurses -- Study and teaching -- Sri Lanka.</field><field name="subject">Nursing -- Study and teaching -- Sri Lanka.</field><field name="subject">Curriculum change -- Sri Lanka.</field><field name="subject">Curriculum planning -- Sri Lanka.</field><field name="subject">Education, Higher -- Curricula -- Sri Lanka.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbiology and cell biology of the interaction between Listeria monocytogenes and Acanthamoeba spp.</field><field name="creator">Akya, Alisha</field><field name="description">L. monocytogenes is ubiquitous in environment and can grow and survive in a wide range of environmental conditions. It contaminates foods via raw materials or food processing environments. However, the current knowledge of its ecology and in particular, the mode of environmental survival and transmission of L. monocytogenes remains limited. One important aspect of environmental survival of L. monocytogenes may be contact with other microorganisms, including amoebae, which naturally feed on bacteria as a source of nutrients. In this context, research has shown that several intra-cellular pathogens are able to survive or replicate within free-living amoebae. In view of the potential for amoebae to act as environmental reservoirs for bacteria, the interaction of L. monocytogenes with freeliving Acanthamoeba spp. and the impact of plasmid-associated genes on their interaction were investigated. Several strains of environmental and clinical isolates of L. monocytogenes were used for co-culture with amoebae. Axenic amoebae were isolated from environmental sources (water, soil) by cultivation in PYG supplemented with antibiotics. L. monocytogenes strains were co-cultured with amoebae on plates, in trays (as monolayers of amoeba cells) and in flasks to provide qualitative and quantitative assessments of the survival of bacteria and amoebae. Bacteriological methods and microscopy (fluorescence, TEM and phase contrast) were used to track the fate of internalized bacteria. A vector that allowed GFP expression under control of the prfA promoter was used to assess the expression of Listeria virulence genes within amoeba cells. The role plasmid encoded genes in interactions of L. monocytogenes with amoebae was assessed using plasmid-cured versus wild type in the co-cultures. Finally the mechanisms of bacterial uptake and killing by A. polyphaga were assessed using chemical inhibitors that affected actin polymerization (Cytochalasin D, Wortmannin), phagosome-lysosome fusion (Suramin) and phagosomal acidification (ammonium chloride, Bafilomycin A and Monensin). Sequence analysis of a section of the large plasmid from strain DRDC8 revealed a high level of similarity of gene organization and DNA sequences with plasmid-borne genes found in other Listeria spp. and Gram-positive bacteria. While the majority of environmental isolates of L. monocytogenes contained a large plasmid, it was absent in clinical isolates. Further, plasmid of DRDC8 was lost during serial passage in HeLa cells. This data indicated that the plasmid may be readily lost during isolation procedures or during growth within host animals/cells and thus plasmid instability may explain the absence of plasmid in clinical isolates. Co-culture of L. monocytogenes with Acanthamoeba spp. showed these amoebae are able to actively phagocytose and kill bacteria within 2-5 h irrespective of temperature used. Amoebae killed both plasmid cured and LLO mutants with the same rate for the parental bacteria. Fluorescence microscopy and TEM of bacteria within trophozoites showed the bacteria become confined within tight vacuolar structures surrounded by lysosomes and mitochondria and degraded after 4 to 5 h post phagocytosis. This data indicated that although L. monocytogenes is an effective pathogen of mammalian cells, it could not escape from phagosomes and evade the killing mechanisms of amoeba trophozoites. Consequently, bacteria are killed within phagolysosome in trophozoites before they express their virulence genes to escape from phagosomes and get access to cytoplasm. This was confirmed by observing no GFP expression by bacteria carried prfA::gfp construct in co-culture with amoebae whereas it was observed during co-culture with HeLa cells. Using inhibitors, the mechanisms involved in phagocytosis, and killing of L. monocytogenes cells by A. polyphaga were assessed. The results showed that the uptake of bacterial cells is mediated by the trophozoites but not the bacteria and mannose binding protein is not involved in this process. Furthermore, pre-treatment of trophozoites with inhibitors indicated both phagosomal acidification and phagosome lysosome fusion are involved in killing of bacteria. These results suggest that compared to mammalian cells e.g. HeLa cells, amoeba trophozoites are better able to effectively inactivate and destroy internalized L. monocytogenes cells. In conclusion, Acanthamoeba spp. are able to uptake and kill L. monocytogenes cells in phagolysosome compartments. However, bacteria can saprophyticaly grow on materials released from amoeba trophozoites. Thus this group of amoebae is not able to harbour L. monocytogenes cells, or act as environmental reservoirs for this opportunistic pathogen under the laboratory conditions tested.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microbiology; cell biology; Listeria monocytogenes; Acanthamoeba; co-culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry into the lived experience of Muslim patients in Australian hospitals.</field><field name="creator">Mohammadi, Nooredin</field><field name="description">In the past few years, many people with an Islamic background have settled in Australia. Within the health care context, this means that health care providers must modify the care provided to ensure it meets the needs of this culturally diverse population. Little nursing research has focused on understanding the perceptions and experiences of Muslim people within health care systems, particularly in Australia. This study provided an opportunity to explore, and document the experience of the hospitalisation for Islamic people and thereby advance the available information upon which important nursing care decisions that relate to this group can be more informatively made. This study aims to explore and interpret the lived experience of thirteen Muslim patients who had been hospitalised in an Australian hospital. The hermeneutic phenomenology of Heidegger (1967/1996), the philosophical hermeneutics of Gadamer (1989), and the ideas of van Manen (1990/1996) underpin this study. The meaning and understanding of the everyday experience of Muslim patient in a non-Islamic hospital is achieved through interpretation of the participants&#8217; stories. Data were generated using unstructured audio-taped interviews from participants. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed, then interpreted using phenomenological methods. The two themes to emerge from the participants&#8217; experiences are: Being-thrown-into-an-un-everyday-world and living-Islam-in-the-un-everyday-world. The theme of Being-thrown-into-an-un-everyday-world arose from the sub-themes of the awareness of self and Being an outsider. The theme living-Islam-in-the-un-everyday-world was drawn from the three sub-themes of Being the same and different, hindrances to being Muslim, and adapting-to-the-un-everyday-world. The findings of this study provide an insight into the experience of Muslims being cared for in Australian hospitals. It is hoped that this interpretation will make a significant contribution to the care of Muslim patients by having health professionals consider how this group could be cared for in a culturally sensitive manner. It is not intended as a prescription for care but draws the reader to reflect on aspects of the Muslim faith and how this may impact on individuals experience when in hospital. The scope of this study and the dearth of available research in this area conclude that much more research needs to be undertaken.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">muslim; phenomenology; multiculturalism; hospitalisation - lived experiences</field><field name="subject">Muslims--Australia--Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Hospital care--Australia--Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respiratory adaptations of secondarily aquatic organisms: studies on diving insects and sacred lotus.</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Philip G.D.</field><field name="description">Compared with the free atmosphere, the aquatic environment is oxygen poor. As a result many secondarily aquatic organisms have adaptations that allow them to continue to use the atmosphere, directly or indirectly, to supply their oxygen requirements. This thesis examines how diving insects use bubbles of air collected at the surface of the water as oxygen reserves, gills and flotation devices, and how an aquatic angiosperm channels convective flows of air from its emergent leaves to its submerged organs. 1. Backswimmers (Anisops spp.) begin a dive positively buoyant, but rapidly enter a protracted period of near neutral buoyancy. A bubble of air held on the insect&#8217;s abdomen shrinks as respiration consumes its oxygen, while at the same time highly soluble carbon dioxide dissolves into the surrounding water. The reduced air volume confers neutral buoyancy. In response to low oxygen partial pressure (PO2) in the bubble, oxygen is released from large haemoglobin cells in the abdomen. The haemoglobin&#8217;s sensitivity to falling PO2 maintains the oxygen tension between 5.1 and 2.0 kPa. This stabilises the volume and buoyancy of the bubble. During a dive the haemoglobin and air-store supply 0.25 and 0.26 &#956;L of oxygen, respectively. 2. The oxygen affinity of backswimmer haemoglobin determines the stability of the neutrally buoyant phase as well as its ability to satisfy the insect&#8217;s respiration. An oxygen equilibrium curve (OEC) determined in vivo has a highly sigmoid shape and an oxygen affinity of 3.9 kPa. In comparison with OEC made in vitro, the in vivo measurements show increased cooperativity and oxygen affinity, consistent with the presence of cationic effectors. Models strongly support the accuracy of the in vivo OEC method. 3. It has long been assumed that a bubble of air held over the spiracles of an insect enables the uptake of oxygen from the surrounding water and thus acts as a &#8216;gas gill&#8217;. Oxygen diffuses into a bubble of air when its PO2 is lower than the surrounding water, but a coincident higher nitrogen partial pressure causes it to dissolve. Several models have been produced to describe the gas exchange process, but all are based on untested assumptions of gill parameters. Measurements of gas gill volume and PO2 made on water bugs (Agraptocorixa eurynome) demonstrate that both drop quickly at the beginning of a dive, but PO2 reaches a stable level while the gas gill continues to dissolve. The importance of ventilation in maintaining an acceptable rate of oxygen consumption is also shown. 4. Interconnected gas spaces within the leaves, stems and rhizomes are a common feature of many emergent aquatic plants. Pressurised air from the leaves and culms of these plants ventilate these lacunae, flowing back to the atmosphere through efflux points. Unlike most aquatic plants, which have simple interconnected pith spaces, sacred lotus, Nelumbo nucifera, possess discrete gas canals which only interconnect where a leaf grows from the rhizome. Silicone casts and pneumatic tests of the gas canals reveal a complex repeating pattern of interconnections which channel air from specific regions of the leaf blade to the rhizome and out through efflux points on adjacent leaves. 5. Lotus, Nelumbo nucifera, possess in the centre of their leaves a specialised efflux organ which connects the gas canals in the leaves and stems with the atmosphere through the apertures of large stomata. Measurements made on excised lotus leaves and in situ reveal that the large stomata act as exhaust valves, opening and closing in a diurnal pattern to regulate the flow of pressurised gas from the leaf lamina and gas canals. This behaviour is shown to regulate gas flow rate and direction. The aquatic environment offers similar respiratory challenges to both plants and insects. While the oxygen uptake and transport mechanisms evolved by these groups are markedly different, they all function according to the same physical laws. Diving insects are separated from the atmosphere while underwater, forcing them to rely on oxygen either carried with them from the surface or extracted from the surrounding water. Emergent aquatic plants have permanent access to atmospheric oxygen, but must transport it long distances from their aerial leaves and stems to their roots and rhizomes. This thesis examines the uptake and storage of oxygen by diving insects and the gas transport system of the sacred lotus.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">notonectidae; corixidae; gas gill; haemoglobin; buoyancy; Nelumbo nucifera; gas canal; stomata</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spatial representation of embodied energy of residential areas in the urban environment.</field><field name="creator">Pullen, Stephen Frederick</field><field name="description">The motivation for the research described in this thesis is the imperative to minimise energy consumption of buildings in the urban environment. A comprehensive approach to analysing energy usage involves the whole life cycle of buildings and infrastructure including embodied energy consumption. Embodied energy represents all of the energy consumed in the production of building materials and components, as well as the energy used to assemble them into the built form. This thesis describes the development and application of a model which spatially depicts embodied energy as a basis for undertaking more holistic analyses of urban energy consumption. The need for comprehensive analyses of energy consumption is initially explored. Such analyses would enable more favourable energy outcomes to be achieved when making decisions about urban planning and development. Research on the value of representing energy usage in a spatial format is reviewed and the case is made for modelling the embodied energy as a contribution to the broader understanding of urban energy consumption. This thesis concentrates on residential areas of the urban environment. The model for spatially representing the embodied energy consumption of residential areas has three components which are embodied energy theory, property register data and geographical information software. A methodology is described which commences with hybrid embodied energy coefficients, integrates these with property register data for a metropolitan area and displays the results using GIS techniques in the form of maps. The model is general but developed using information pertaining to the Adelaide metropolitan area and tested using data from both Adelaide and Sydney. To show that the model can usefully contribute to life cycle energy analyses in the urban environment, it is applied to three case studies involving current urban planning issues involving the densification of dwellings in cities and the redevelopment of older residential areas. These show that such analyses can represent embodied energy spatially and with sufficient accuracy to inform urban planning and development decisions aimed at reducing overall energy usage. In summary, the research has extended knowledge on the embodied energy of the built form by focusing on residential areas which include urban infrastructure rather than just individual buildings. It has provided new insights into the significance of embodied energy of the existing built form by considering it as a &#8216;sunk cost&#8217; which may be partially recovered and form part of the energy flows in the urban environment. The mapping of embodied energy of the existing built form also offers the potential for quantifying resources which can be re-used to modify total energy consumption of new developments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy consumption.</field><field name="subject">City planning.</field><field name="subject">Geographic information systems.</field><field name="subject">Buildings -- Energy conservation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of short-term energy restriction in overweight/obese females on reproductive outcomes.</field><field name="creator">Tsagareli, Victoria</field><field name="description">In the general population, one in five couples experiences difficulty in conceiving a child. The role of obesity on women&#8217;s fecundity has become a focus of attention in recent years. Successful treatment of infertility through Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is also compromised by the presence of obesity, which occurs in 30 % of women seeking treatment. A negative correlation exists between increased body mass index (BMI) and the number of collected oocytes and a lower birth rate after ART. Furthermore, a number of studies have established that weight loss improves natural conception rates in overweight women. Whether weight management can improve success rates in overweight / obese women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) has not been studied. The purpose of this project was to explore the role of short&#8211;term weight loss on potential pregnancy outcomes in overweight / obese women undergoing IVF programme. However, to establish this relationship, we proposed to carry out two studies to assess the following: (I) The feasibility of very low calorie diet (VLCD) during IVF treatment with respect to duration, level of restriction and tolerability of the diet during hormonal down regulation in women (Chapter 2). (II) How energy restriction may affect the quality of an early embryo in diet - induced obese mice with respect to various body weight and caloric intake (Chapter 3). In study (I), women preferred a shorter dietary intervention with greater energy restriction (456 kcal per day) to gradual energy restriction (1200 kcal / day for the first week, and afterward, 456 kcal / day) prior to oocyte transfer. Women were able to comply with the VLCD during IVF treatment and both dietary groups achieved a significant weight loss (mean 6.3 %). In study (II), by using obese mice, the effect of rapid weight loss (mean 12 %) was observed after 5 days of energy restriction. Ovulation rate was greater in the Obese group (HFD) (55.6%) and equal in both Control (CD) and Energy Restricted (HF / ER) (44.4 %) groups. The HF / ER group showed higher fertilisation rate (80 %) than HFD and CD (55% and 45.5%, correspondingly). The blastocyst stage was reached by half of the cultured embryos in both HF / ER and HFD groups and 33 % in the CD group. The quality of embryos that completed blastocyst formation did not differ between groups. However, postfertilisation development in females fed a high fat diet was slower compared to CD and HF / ER groups. In conclusion, this work illustrated a weight management prior conception and use of VLCD during IVF treatment in clinical study needs further investigation with regard to the dietary duration, level of energy restriction and how this combination will influence IVF treatment outcomes. Furthermore, as we were unable to determine the question of how the dietary intervention affects the quality of oocytes and the animal study illustrated a promising result, thus further studies are required.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reproduction; overweight; obese; female; diet; calorie restriction; mice; obstetrics; ART; embryo; zygote; blastocyst; BMI; nutrition; Optifast; VLCD</field><field name="subject">Low-calorie diet.</field><field name="subject">Reproductive technology.</field><field name="subject">Overweight women.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and metamorphism of the Pewsey Vale area North - East of Williamstown, S.A.</field><field name="creator">Offler, Robin</field><field name="description">The structure and petrology of Upper Precambrian and Cambrian rocks have been studied in detail, in an area 38 miles north - east of Adelaide, South Australia. The rocks occur within a broad zone of high grade metamorphism on the eastern side of the Mt. Lofty Ranges. The Upper Precambrian succession consists predominantly of pelitic and semi - pelitic schists, quartzites, calc - silicate rocks and calc - schists, and the Cambrian sequence of quartzo - feldspathic schists, migmatites, granite gneiss, calc - silicate rocks and minor pelitic schists and quartzites. The rocks have reached the sillimanite grade of metamorphism and the metamorphism is of the low pressure - intermediate type. Dolerites, pegmatites, minor granodiorites and granites intrude the meta - sediments. Mineralogical and structural relationships of the granite gneiss, indicate that it has been formed by recrystalliaation of the quartzo - feldspathic schists. Small scale metamorphic differentiation, appears to have accompanied the recrystallization. The migmatites are believed to have been formed by metamorphic differentiation rather than by anatexis. Three phases of deformation are recognised in the Upper Precambrian rocks and two in the Cambrian. The second deformation recorded in the Upper Precambrian rocks does not appear in the Cambrian rocks. Each deformation has been accompanied by the formation of foliation. In the Proterozoic rocks deformed by the second and third phases of folding, the foliation is a crenulation cleavage. The deformations in both the Upper Proterozoic and Cambrian sequences are considered to be related. Petrofabric studies of quartz, scapolite and biotite are related to the respective macroscopic structures. An analysis of the chronology of crystallisation and deformation of these rocks indicates that crystallisation continued during and after each phase of deformation. Faulting commenced either prior to or during meta - morphism. Intense metasomatic activity followed a later phase of faulting resulting in the widespread development of albitites and in some cases talc ore bodies. The albitites formed in the fault zone were subsequently brecciated by further movement and later healed by the introduction of more metasoinatic fluid.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology, rocks, petrology, paleontology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hum of concrete: a novel constellation.</field><field name="creator">Solding, Anna</field><field name="description">My major work, &#8216;The Hum of Concrete&#8217;, is a novel that takes the form of a series of stand-alone stories or meditations. It has five main characters, all women, and is set in Malm&#246;, Sweden. The city itself plays a part in the narrative. The characters include Nassrin, a Muslim cleaner; Rhyme, a troubled street kid; Bodil, a middle-aged doctor; Estella, a black postie and Susanna, a lesbian teacher for immigrants. Each main character is presented in three stories, initially as a young woman and later as a partner and then mother. Nassrin walks into the sea fully clothed with her new baby in her arms because she cannot cope with the fact that the child is of indeterminate sex. Rhyme spends the lead up to Christmas on a park bench and is offered ten dollars for a blow job. Bodil arranges her mother&#8217;s last birthday party while coming to terms with being pregnant with her first child in her forties. Estella tries in vain to write a sexy story stumbling into new realms of her own sexuality as she does her research. Susanna is thick-skinned and stands between the violent boys and a fight. The stories in &#8216;The Hum of Concrete&#8217; are stories of loss and lust, of grief, happiness, love and despair. They represent the diversity of life for women and mothers in the city today. The minor component of the thesis, an exegetical essay, is a reflection on writings about motherhood: my own as well as others. Motherhood is an aspect of life that most women (and many men) take very seriously. However, motherhood must be balanced against work and other family commitments, relationships outside the family and other fulfilling personal activities. The exegetical essay argues for the diversity and complexity of mothering by focusing on fictional mothers who struggle with some part of motherhood, whether it be pregnancy, labour, bonding with infants or coping with children as they grow older. To what extent is a mother defined by her motherhood? Is a mother only a mother? The essay discusses a selection of texts that have influenced my own novel in one way or another. My interest in working mothers includes mothers who are writers. I discuss the concept of maternal feminism and draw on my Swedish background to explore the complex relationship between childrearing and work, showing how this relationship can differ between cultures in the Western world, depending on the support structures available to mothers. The essay explores the process of writing as a mother as a specific case of the challenges that face working mothers. Finally, I suggest that love between mother and child as well as realistic expectations might be key components when successfully balancing mothering.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative writing; mother; mother guilt; motherhood; mother love; mothering; feminism; maternal feminism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of euthanasia.</field><field name="creator">Richardson, Robert G.</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the topic of active voluntary euthanasia (AVE) has been significantly neglected in existing political studies research, despite the fact that AVE reform raises fundamental questions about the scope and application of political authority. While this is predominantly a politics thesis in its focus, the thesis also draws when necessary on the broader scholarly literature on AVE, including literature fields such as ethics, as well as on broader public debate and the views of politicians. The thesis also examines, and engages with, the views of relevant traditional and contemporary political theorists including John Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Amitai Etzioni. Whilst it will be acknowledged that liberal and utilitarian principles have helped shape and inform the AVE reform debate, and have useful contributions to offer, it is maintained that neither of these approaches provide a suitably comprehensive guide to policy. The thesis argues that communitarianism&#8217;s emphasis upon the communal good provides an indispensable counterbalance to potential problems that can arise with some other approaches, including excessive individualism and the uncertainties of moral subjectivism. More particularly, it is suggested that without an ongoing commitment to the principles of self restraint and &#8216;other regarding&#8217; beneficence, legalised euthanasia could pose a serious threat to the welfare of vulnerable citizens. This is a point of view that is also expressed by many religious critics of AVE and it is argued that pro-choice advocates have relied unduly upon the separation of Church and State principle to deflect a legitimate criticism. Although it is conceded that a commitment to secular liberal&#8211;democratic principles is at odds with a legislative prohibition against the popularly endorsed option of last resort (beneficent) AVE it is, nevertheless, maintained that the concerns of these and other critics should not be ignored. Indeed, an examination of various case studies highlights the importance of ensuring a balance between individual autonomy and adequate legislative safeguards. Case studies examined include John Ashcroft&#8217;s controlled substances intervention in Oregon, US Congressional action to preserve the life of persistent vegetative state patient Terri Schiavo and Australian anti-suicide / active euthanasia legislation, particularly the Northern Territory&#8217;s Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. The conclusion of the thesis not only pulls together the key arguments regarding AVE but also highlights the insights which the AVE debate can provide for understanding broader issues in political theory and practice, particularly in regard to the rights of the individual and the responsibility of the state to legislate for the collective good.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">euthanasia; right to die; public policy; Rights of the Terminally Ill Act</field><field name="subject">Euthanasia Political aspects.</field><field name="subject">Euthanasia Moral and ethical aspects.</field><field name="subject">Euthanasia Law and legislation Northern Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and metamorphic relations between low, medium and high grade rocks, Mt. Franks - Mundi Mundi area, Broken Hill, N.S.W.</field><field name="creator">Glen, Richard Arthur</field><field name="description">Investigations in the northwestern part of the Willyama Complex centred on the Mt Franks - Mundi Mundi area have established a 4 km thick stratigraphic section of conformable metasediments containing thin horizons of basic volcanics in the lower two - thirds of the sequence. Establishment of this sequence was only possible once it was shown that the dominant lithological layering in metasediments is bedding, and that there has been no mesoscopic transposition during deformation. The metasediments represent a sequence of clay sands deposited in a distal shelf-slope or basin type of environment. A sequence of deformational and metamorphic events established in these rocks is regarded as an expression of the Middle Proterozoic Olarian Orogeny ( c.1695 - 1520 Ma. ) and except for some reactivation of shear zones, predate deposition and deformation of the unconformably overlying Adelaidean sediments. The important D&#8321; deformation is a complex, progressive event with pre-S&#8321; static mineral growth (biotite, andalusite, sillimanite, white mica) and early minor micro-folding recognized before syn-S&#8321; growth and F&#8321; folding. An even earlier period of pre-S&#8321; fabric formation mainly defined by white mica, biotite and ilmenite, is not related to any visible folding and may either represent an earlier discrete event or an early phase of the D&#8321; event, However, as now defined, minerals outlining this pre-S&#8321; fabric are related to the D&#8321; event. The low, medium and high grade metamorphic zones defined in the field by biotite, andalusite and sillimanite respectively are pre-S&#8321; in age and predate F&#8321; folding. The intensity of metamorphism increases with depth so that there is a broad depth control on metamorphism. Relations at the andalusite/sillimanite isograd conform to a Carmichael (1969) type model and reactions took place via an intermediate sericite phase. The main effect of F&#8321; folding is the formation of the variably plunging variably oriented Kantappa - Lakes Nob Syncline of regional extent. Only the western limb of this fold is now visible over much of its length. This fold deforms existing metamorphic zones and thus controls the relationship of low, medium and high grade rocks in this part of the Willyama Complex. The orientation of this syncline changes from vertical in the low grade rock to inclined at depth. The western limb becomes overturned at depth so that subsequent folds are downward facing. There is also a change in fold tightness with depth - from open-tight in the low grades to tight-isoclinal in the high grades, and this is accompanied by a change in S&#8320;/S&#8321;  relations (from core to limb area) from non parallel to parallel. These changes are coupled with a rotation of extension direction (mass transfer direction) from subvertical to inclined and may be explained by original formation and subsequent modification of upright F&#8321; folds. Later modifications are recorded by open folding and overturning of S&#8321; - this is ascribed to a final phase of the D&#8321; event. Mineral growth in D&#8321; time resulted in the formation of S&#8321; varying in grade from muscovite + quartz to sillimanite. S&#8321; varies from homogeneous to layered, and in the latter case, consists of M + QM layers,the spacing of which is controlled by F&#8321; microfolding. S&#8321; formation involved rotation, mass transfer, and volume decrease in M layers and (re) crystallisation. The D&#8322; event in this area was of only minor significance. The D&#8323;  event developed in response to NW-SE shortening and resulted in the formation of variably plunging, vertical northeast trending folds.

Nevertheless, conventional model-based applications of complex systems may be of limited utility when the problem is also data-poor and soft. In this case, a quantitative model may be at best meaning-less; at worst harmful. Systems approaches, such as soft systems methodologies, have been developed that provide some guidance in this domain. However, these alternatives do not utilise the exact techniques of complex systems, preferring to abandon mathematical representations altogether. It is the aim of this thesis to advance a &#8220;conceptual analysis" approach to complex systems design that exploits deep insights from the mathematics of complex systems, without building explicit models of the underlying system. It is argued that this approach can extend the domain of applicability of the discipline of complex systems into situations where quantitative data is unavailable, and human and social factors are significant. Conceptual analysis of complex systems is inherently multidisciplinary, because it is broader than the foundations of any single conventional discipline. This is reflected in the structure of this thesis, which spans the philosophy, theory and application of complex systems. Part I on systems philosophy develops an understanding of representation, which sheds light on the utility and limitations of models. The history of the systems movement is then surveyed, systemism is distinguished from both individualism and holism, and `system' is defined. Complex systems is contrasted with both early systems theory and contemporary systems approaches. Part II on complex systems theory firstly relates the major theoretical concepts within a rigourous information theoretical framework. They include complexity, edge of chaos, self-organisation, emergence, adaptation, evolution and self refer- entiality. The central systems concept - emergence - is then examined in depth beyond its information theoretic interpretation, leading to a concise definition of emergent properties and emergence. A new framework for understanding emergence in terms of scope, resolution and state yields substantial novel insights. It is shown that emergence is coupled to scope, in contrast to the conventional explanation that relates levels of description. Part III applies the preceding philosophical and theoretical framework to real-world problems in the defence and security arena. In the first example, the theory of multi-scale complexity reveals structural impediments to success for conventional force structures in asymmetric warfare, such as Operation Iraqi Freedom. The second example analyses the capability development process, which is responsible for transforming the security needs of Government into equipment purchasing decisions. The analysis produces practical recommendations for improvements that address the underlying complexity of the problem. Reflections in the conclusion of this thesis focus on the interrelations between philosophy, theory and application. As the individual contributions of this thesis are woven into a single tapestry, they demonstrate the utility of a multidisciplinary approach to complex systems design.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics; Mathematical models; Complexes (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reframing the dynamics: a case study of the interaction between architectural computing and relationship-based procurement at the National Museum of Australia.</field><field name="creator">Swift, John Paul</field><field name="description">The National Museum of Australia (NMA) (1997- 2001) by architects Ashton Raggatt McDougall (ARM) in association with Robert Peck von Hartel Trethowan was commissioned by the Australian Commonwealth Government for the Centenary of Federation in 2001. It was conceived as a gift to the people of Australia and now stands on Acton Peninsula in Canberra, the nation's Capital. It is a visually complex manifestation of the design architects' (ARM) dialogue with the ambiguities of Australian history and national identity. The architectural realisation of these complexities was facilitated through advances in computer technologies and a complementary non-traditional procurement method, both at the leading edge of Australian architectural practice of the time. Completed three years earlier was probably the most debated work of architecture of the 1990s, the Guggenheim Museum (GMB) (1991-98) in Bilbao, Spain, by Frank O. Gehry and Associates (FOG&amp;A). This satellite museum of the Guggenheim Foundation of New York was heralded as the quintessential example of a kind of architecture only possible because of advances in computer technologies. Both visually complex museums were conceived as flagship projects and consequently share many political, functional, and cultural expectations. Both were procured outside the usual adversarial designer/builder paradigm of western architecture and featured the innovative use of three-dimensional (CAD) software for design, documentation and analysis. The NMA project used a government instigated procurement method which was embraced by a group of design and construction companies who formed a joint venture known as the Acton Peninsula Alliance. This non-traditional or relationship-based procurement method required ARM to reassess their approach to generate and disseminate design data and their traditional relationship with other design and construction professionals. As part of this process, ARM were required to devolve some of their design authority to a project delivery team via a Design Integrity Panel and an Independent Quality Panel; both innovations integral to the Acton Peninsula Alliance. The NMA project reframed many of the enduring professional relationships of Australian architecture and in so doing extended the skill set and expectations of the architects and others to include a more substantial engagement with 3D CAD and a procurement system which was less subject to many of the common impediments inherent in the more traditional processes. Through a series of interviews with the architects and other stakeholders, a qualitative methodology was used to investigate the NMA as a case study which uses the GMB as an internationally recognised comparison. This thesis examines how these two projects have been successfully completed within time and budgetary constraints in an environment where flagship projects have had a history of highly publicised difficulties. It reveals that the successful realisation of the NMA was due to the relationships built or reframed as a result of this cooperative approach in conjunction with high levels of engagement with computer technologies. This is in contrast to the seamless flow of data and high levels of prefabrication integral to the success of the GMB.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">architecture, public architecture, computer-aided design, construction industry, industrial procurement, National Museum of Australia</field><field name="subject">National Museum of Australia Planning.</field><field name="subject">Architecture Australia Designs and plans.</field><field name="subject">Computer-aided design Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Museums Australian Capital Territory Canberra Planning.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ant colony optimisation for power plant maintenance scheduling.</field><field name="creator">Foong, Wai Kuan</field><field name="description">Maintenance of power plants is aimed at extending the life and reducing the risk of sudden breakdown of power generating units. Traditionally, power generating units have been scheduled for maintenance in periods to ensure that the demand of the system is fully met and the reliability of the system is maximized. However, in a deregulated power industry, the pressure of maintaining generating units is also driven by the potential revenue received by participating in the electricity market. Ideally, hydropower generating units are required to operate during periods when electricity prices are high and to be able to be taken offline for maintenance when the price is low. Therefore, determination of the optimum time periods for maintenance of generating units in a power system has become an important task from both a system reliability and an economic point of view. Due to the extremely large number of potential maintenance schedules, a systematic approach is required to ensure that optimal or near-optimal maintenance schedules are obtained within an acceptable timeframe. Metaheustics are high-level algorithmic frameworks that aim to solve combinatorial optimisation problems with a large search space in a reasonable computational run time. Inspired by the foraging behavior of ant colonies, Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) is a relatively new metaheuristic for combinatorial optimisation. The application of ACO to a number of different applications has provided encouraging results when applied to scheduling, including the job-shop, flow-shop, machine tardiness and resource-constrained project scheduling problems. In this thesis, a formulation is developed that enables ACO to be applied to the generalized power plant maintenance scheduling optimisation (PPMSO) problem. The formulation caters for all constraints generally encountered as part of real-world PPMSO problems, including system demands and reliability levels, precedence rules between maintenance tasks, public holidays and minimum outage durations in the case of shortening of maintenance tasks. As part of the formulation, a new heuristic and a new local search strategy have been developed. The new ACO-PPMSO formulation has been tested extensively on two benchmark PPMSO problems from the literature, including a 21-unit and a 22-unit problem. It was found that the ACOPPMSO formulation resulted in significant improvements in performance for both case studies compared with the results obtained in previous studies. In addition, the new heuristic formulation was found to be useful in finding maintenance schedules that result in more evenly spread reserve capacity and resource allocations. When tested using a modified version of the 21-unit and the 22-unit problems, the new local search strategy specifically designed for duration shortening was found to be effective in searching locally for maintenance schedules that require minimal shortening of outage duration. The ACO-PPMSO formulation was also successfully able to cater for all constraints as specified in both original and the modified versions of the two benchmark case studies. In order to further test the ACO-PPMSO formulation developed, it was first applied to a scaled-down version of the Hydro Tasmania hydropower system (five power stations) and then to the full system (55 generating units). As part of the studies, the ACO-PPMSO formulation was linked with the simulation model used by Hydro Tasmania to assess the impact of various maintenance schedules on the total energy in storage of the system at the end of the planning horizon, the total thermal generation, the total number of days where the reliability level is not met, as well as the total unserved energy throughout the planning horizon. A number of constraints were considered, including the anticipated system demands, a 30% capacity reliability level, the minimum and maximum durations between related maintenance tasks, the precedence constraints and the minimum outage duration of each task in the case of shortening of maintenance tasks. The maintenance schedule was optimised for the maximum end-of-horizon total energy in storage, the minimum thermal generation and the minimum total outage durations shortened and deferred, under 77 different inflow conditions. The optimal maintenance schedule obtained compared favourably with that obtained by Hydro Tasmania over many years based on experience. Specifically, the ACO-PPMSO schedule results in higher end-of-horizon total energy in storage and satisfies both hard and soft constraints, which overall equates to over $0.5 million dollars of savings when compared to the schedule obtained using the practitioners&#8217; experience and engineering judgment. The ACO-PPMSO algorithm was also shown to be a useful decision-making tool for scheduling maintenance under different circumstances when tested with four scenarios commonly encountered in practical maintenance scheduling problems. In conclusion, the ACO-PPMSO formulation developed, tested and applied as part of this thesis research provides a powerful and flexible means of obtaining optimal or near-optimal maintenance schedules for power plants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">power plants; fossil fuel power plants; generators; hydroelectric power plants; hydroelectric generators</field><field name="subject">Ants Behavior Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Mathematical optimization.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the function and subcellular localization of FAT/CD36 in hepatocytes and transfected cell lines of hepatic and non-hepatic origin.</field><field name="creator">Eyre, Nicholas Stratford</field><field name="description">The class B scavenger receptor CD36, or fatty acid translocase (FAT), is an 88 kDa plasma membrane glycoprotein that is the founding member of the class B scavenger receptor family. It has a number of natural ligands and has different functions at various locations in the body. It contributes to adhesion of platelets via its binding to thrombospondin-1. In monocytes and macrophages, it contributes to recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and it mediates the binding and uptake of oxidatively damaged low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL). In adipose and muscle tissues, FAT/CD36 mediates high-affinity binding and uptake of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and is therefore a key regulator of lipid storage (particularly in adipocytes) and mitochondrial beta oxidation (particularly in muscle). Interestingly FAT/CD36 also binds native lipoproteins (including high-density lipoproteins [HDL]) with high affinity in vitro, although the physiological significance of this is unclear at present. Expression of FAT/CD36 by hepatocytes has not been recognised until recently, mainly because it is gender-regulated in both humans, and rats. However, the primary function of FAT/CD36 in the liver is unknown. The work described in this thesis has used various transfected cell lines to examine the possibility that FAT/CD36 contributes to hepatic LCFA uptake and/or the uptake of cholesteryl esters (and other lipids) from HDL. The subcellular localization of FAT/CD36 has been explored in rat liver and in cell lines of hepatic and non-hepatic origin, especially with respect to its association with specialized plasma membrane lipid raft microdomains known as caveolae. Furthermore, the importance of the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminus of FAT/CD36 in both subcellular localization of the molecule and its activity as a LCFA transporter has been examined using truncated mutants and chimeric variants of FAT/CD36. The results indicate that FAT/CD36 contributes to LCFA uptake by hepatocyte-derived cell lines. In these cells it resides in both non-raft and lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane that may not always include caveolae. The studies also indicate that the cytoplasmic C-terminus of FAT/CD36 contributes to the attachment of FAT/CD36 to membranes, including raft-derived detergent-resistant membranes. This domain is necessary also for correct targeting of the receptor to the plasma membrane and for its activity as a LCFA transporter. Finally, DNA constructs have been prepared and tested, with the objective of producing transgenic mice in which expression of FAT/CD36 can be induced and over-expressed specifically in the liver. This model could be used to confirm whether FAT/CD36 has a role as a LCFA transporter in the liver and to explore whether it has additional significance as a hepatic transporter of HDL-derived cholesteryl esters or as a scavenger of oxidised LDL.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fatty acids.</field><field name="subject">Glycoproteins.</field><field name="subject">Biochemistry.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal spatially fixed and moving virtual sensing algorithms for local active noise control.</field><field name="creator">Petersen, Cornelis D.</field><field name="description">Local active noise control systems aim to create zones of quiet at specific locations within a sound field. The created zones of quiet generally tend to be small, especially for higher frequencies, and are usually centred at the error sensors. For an observer to experience significant reductions in the noise, the error sensors therefore have to be placed relatively close to an observer&#8217;s ears, which is not always feasible or convenient. Virtual sensing methods have been proposed to overcome these problems that have limited the scope of successful local active noise control applications. These methods require non-intrusive sensors that are placed remotely from the desired locations of maximum attenuation. These non-intrusive sensors are used to provide an estimate of the sound pressures at these locations, which can then be minimised by a local active noise control system. This effectively moves the zones of quiet away from the physical locations of the transducers to the desired locations of maximum attenuation, such as a person&#8217;s ears. A number of virtual sensing algorithms have been proposed previously. The difference between these algorithms is the structure that is assumed to compute an estimate of the virtual error signals. The question now arises as to whether there is an optimal structure that can be used to solve the virtual sensing problem, which amounts to a linear estimation problem. It is well-known that the Kalman filter provides an optimal structure for solving such problems. An optimal solution to the virtual sensing problem is therefore derived in this thesis using Kalman filtering theory. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an acoustic duct arrangement to demonstrate its effectiveness. The presented experimental results indicate that the zone of quiet was effectively moved away from the physical sensor towards the desired location of maximum attenuation. The previously proposed virtual sensing algorithms have been developed with the aim to create zones of quiet at virtual locations that are assumed spatially fixed within the sound field. Because an observer is very likely to move their head, the desiredlocations of the zones of quiet are generally moving through the sound field rather than being spatially fixed. For effective control, a local active noise control system incorporating a virtual sensing method thus has to be able to create moving zones of quiet that track the observer&#8217;s ears. A moving virtual sensing method is therefore developed in this thesis that can be used to estimate the error signals at virtual locations that are moving through the sound field. It is shown that an optimal solution to the moving virtual sensing problem can be derived using Kalman filtering theory. A practical implementation of the developed algorithm is combined with an adaptive feedforward control algorithm and implemented on an acoustic duct arrangement. The presented experimental results illustrate that a narrowband moving zone of quiet that tracks the desired location of maximum attenuation has successfully been created.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noise control.</field><field name="subject">Kalman filtering.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zebrafish as a model of genetic disease.</field><field name="creator">Tucker, Ben</field><field name="description">The zebrafish is rapidly becoming a vital tool in studies of genetic disease. Use of the zebrafish embryo as an experimental model combines the efficiency of techniques specific to invertebrates with the human applicability of vertebrate studies, along with a number of other advantages such as optical transparency and high spawn number. Sequencing maps and mutant screen data are available, and gene ontology annotation is progressing. Furthermore, a number of highly important projects are underway to expand the utility of the zebrafish still further (eg. Mutant screens and TILLING projects; see (Lieschke and Currie, 2007) for review). As such the zebrafish has become a vital model organism for study of a variety of genetic defects, toxicology and pharmacological screens etc. These papers trace the development of zebrafish embryos as a model organism for both genetic disease and, as part of this, the development of a relatively high throughput approach to analysing relative levels of apoptosis. The first paper describes the fmr1 gene family in zebrafish (fmr1, and its orthologs fxr1 and fxr2). This paper includes a phylogenetic analysis of the gene family that demonstrates the high conservation between human and zebrafish, in the context of Drosophila. We then describe expression of the genes in the embryo (using in situ hybridisation) and adult (using real time pcr). The conclusions are that the zebrafish is an appropriate model in which to study Fragile X Mental Retardation genetic disease. The second paper builds upon this conclusion and further establishes the appropriateness of the model by recapitulating elements of the disease that had already been modelled in other model organisms. The research is validated using a number of controls. We describe a number of original findings that extended the body of knowledge regarding pharmacological rescue of the FMRP loss phenotypes. A craniofacial phenotype is identified, the first such discovery in a model of Fragile X syndrome. These findings are a vital step toward understanding the pathway from gene, to molecular phenotype, to cellular morphology, to gross morphology. As part of these studies, we found it necessary to analyse apoptosis. The technique developed to facilitate this analysis is described in our third paper. Given the highly stochastic nature of the apoptotic patterns we developed a method to take full advantage of the characteristics of zebrafish embryos, primarily their transparency and availability in large numbers. As the zebrafish becomes more widely accepted as a model for a diverse range of scientific questions, the development of such a technique is doubly important given the necessity of a cheap, reliable and simple generalizable method of analysing processes affecting cell viability in fish. This has clear importance for pharmacological studies, but is also a long overdue addition to the battery of controls available for highly invasive techniques such as microinjection, in which apoptosis is regularly found among its non specific effects.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic disorders</field><field name="subject">Zebra danio -- Genetic engineering.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An in vivo model to study mucin-bacterial interactions during early post-hatch development of broiler chickens.</field><field name="creator">Forder, Rebecca Edith Anne</field><field name="description">Mucins, synthesised and secreted by goblet cells, possess potential binding sites for both commensal and pathogenic organisms, and may perform a defensive role during establishment of the intestinal barrier in newly hatched chickens. Increasing interest has been directed toward bacterial interactions within the mucus layer, and the mechanisms by which bacterial colonisation can influence mucus composition during early development. This is important, firstly, as a means to understand initiation of infection and secondly, to optimise the gut microflora for enhanced animal production. Currently, information on mucosal-bacterial interactions in poultry is limited. In order to observe the effects of bacterial exposure on intestinal goblet cell mucin production during early development, differences in the small intestine of conventionally-raised (CV) and low bacterial load (LBL) broiler chicks were examined during the first 7 days post-hatch. The initial aim of the study was to construct a small-scale, economical isolator system to hatch and raise chicks in a bacterial-free environment as a means to observe bacterial interactions with the intestinal mucosa in chickens exposed to normal environmental conditions. The design and construction of flexible plastic isolators for incubation and brooding are described, along with methodologies for preparation of eggs for entry into the isolators, incubation and hatching. Two trials were conducted, the first in August 2005 and the second in March 2006. It was found that the isolator system was successful in producing low bacterial load chicks for comparative studies with conventionally raised chicks, without compromising body weight. A histological study was then conducted whereby ileal and jejunal goblet cells were stained with either periodic acid-Schiff or high iron diamine/alcian blue pH 2.5 to discriminate between neutral, sulphated and sialyated acidic mucins. Total goblet cell numbers and goblet cell and villous/crypt morphology were also examined. Bacterial colonisation of CV animals induced an increase in sialic acid moieties in both ileal and jejunal goblet cell such that initiation of these changes occurred at day 3-4 post-hatch. Differences in intestinal morphology were also consistent with other germ-free animal studies. In order to further understand the extent to which bacteria affected mucin composition, purified, isolated oligosaccharide fractions from ileal mucin at d 4 and 7 post-hatch were collected and analysed using mass spectrometry techniques to determine any structural differences in chain length or chain number between LBL and CV animals. No differences in chain length or number were observed between CV and LBL animals at either d 4 or 7 post-hatch with both groups equally displaying chain lengths of both low and high molecular weights. Although structural differences in mucin oligosaccharides were not observed between LBL and CV animals, bacterial binding assays utilising whole ileal sections were employed to determine whether or not the differences in mucin composition between LBL and CV animals during early development may have deterred or enhanced binding of certain bacterial species. Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus salivarius were selected for the experiment. Binding of L. salivarius to ileal sections was very low whereas E. coli binding was greater, and more pronounced in LBL animals, especially at d 7 post-hatch. No statistically significant differences were observed in binding of E. coli to purified ileal mucin from LBL and CV animals at either d 4 or d 7 post-hatch. Correlations between E. coli and L. salivarius adherence to ileal tissue and mucin samples, and goblet cell parameters, were not statistically significant when fitted as co-variates. It was concluded that the changes in mucin composition played a minor role in bacterial adhesion of L. salivarius and this E. coli serotype. In summary, this thesis explores the physiological changes in goblet cell mucin production in response to bacterial exposure post-hatch. The thesis outlines the complexity of mucosal-bacterial interactions which would benefit from the employment of specialised techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and microarray technologies to examine a greater range of mucin structures and gene expression. This thesis provides support for future investigations into the influence of intestinal microflora on mucosal and mucin dynamics of poultry and the potential development of prebiotics for use in animal production.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mucin; goblet cells; chick; development; low bacterial load</field><field name="subject">Chickens -- Development.</field><field name="subject">Mucins.</field><field name="subject">Exfoliative cytology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">And the Word was Song: a novel.</field><field name="creator">Taylor Johnson, Heather.</field><field name="description">v. 1 [Novel]: And the Word was Song [Embargoed] -- v. 2 [Exegesis]: The return to mother: exegesis accompanying the novel: And the Word was Song</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian literature - 21st century - History and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of &#946;c subunit phosphorylation in the functioning of the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptors.</field><field name="creator">Winnall, Wendy</field><field name="description">The cytokines GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 are central regulators of haemopoietic cell functions and are pivotal in the regulation of haemopoiesis and inflammatory responses of myeloid cells. In particular, these cytokines have been shown to perform essential functions in host defence against foreign pathogens through their ability to regulate innate immune responses in myeloid cells. As key regulators of such important processes, these cytokines play an important role in human inflammatory pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis as well as a number of leukemias such as JML and CMML. GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 signal through receptors containing &#945; subunits specific to each cytokine and a common &#946; subunit (&#946;c). Cytokine stimulation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the &#946;c and promotes specific responses such as proliferation, survival and activation of haemopoietic cells. Mouse knockout studies identified a key function of these cytokines in the activation of effector functions of myeloid cells, including production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phagocytosis. These earlier studies provide a link between cytokine signalling and inflammation, but the molecular mechanisms by which &#946;c activation regulates effector cell functions, and the receptor motifs involved, are unknown. The aim of this thesis was to address two broad questions with regard to &#946;c signalling: (1) Does &#946;c regulate specific cellular responses by phosphotyrosine-independent mechanisms? (2) What are the molecular mechanisms by which &#946;c initiates signalling to promote specific biological responses such as activation of effector cell functions? To address the first question, we have focussed on Serine 585, a potential 14-3-3 binding site which lies in the cytoplasmic potion of hu&#946;c. Out results show that the mutation hu&#946;c S585G disrupted the interaction of 14-3-3&#950; with &#946;c, whilst not affecting receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Both mouse and human &#946;c were shown to interact with 14-3-3 proteins, indicating that this interaction is conserved between these species. Significantly, a hu&#946;c S585G mutant was unable to promote haemopoietic cell survival in response to IL-3. These results identify a new mechanism by which cytokine receptors are able to couple to downstream signalling pathways that regulate cell survival. An approach was developed and optimised to analyse specific GM-CSF-mediated responses in monocytes/macrophages expressing wildtype or mutant hu&#946;c, (including hu&#946;c S585G that was defective in regulating survival). Bone marrow-derived mu&#946;c -/-;mu&#946;IL-3 -/- monocytes/macrophages were retrovirally transduced with constructs expressing wildtype or mutant hu&#946;c, along with huGMR&#945;, then purified by FACS. Two assays were established to measure effector functions in the transduced monocyte/macrophages; (1) a flow cytometry assay for ROS production, and (2) an assay for phagocytosis. The capacity for GM-CSF to prime (i.e. enhance effector functions) ROS production and phagocytosis was investigated in huGMR&#945;-transduced monocytes/macrophages. Our results have identified two key residues in the cytoplasmic domain of &#946;c subunit: Tyrosine 577 (required for hu&#946;c interaction with the adaptor protein Shc) and serine 585 (required for 14-3-3 association), that are essential for the ability of GM-CSF to regulate key effector functions in monocytes/macrophages. These novel findings are significant in that they establish a molecular link between the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor and the regulation of both haemopoietic cell survival and inflammatory responses, and therefore have important implications in our understanding of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cytokine; granulocyte; macrophage; GM-CSF; IL-3; IL-S; receptor; serive phospharylation</field><field name="subject">Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

In this study, the presence of leukaemiaassociated phenotypes (LAPs) was first studied retrospectively using our standard diagnostic protocol with 3-colour flow cytometry. LAPs were present in 54 (64%) of 84 AML patients analysed between 2002 to 2004. The presence of LAPs was correlated with failure to respond to induction chemotherapy (p &lt;0.05) in univariate analysis. Presence of LAPs was shown to be an independent predictor for failure to respond to induction chemotherapy with a relative risk ratio of 1.6 (p &lt; 0.05, 95% CI, 1.0-2.6) in multivariate analysis. Subsequently, in a prospective study, we used 5-colour multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) for detection of LAPs to determine if LAPs could be detected in a greater proportion of leukaemic patients and minimal residual disease (MRD) detection could therefore be applied in more patients. In 54 consecutive, newly diagnosed AML patients from 2005 to 2007, LAPs were identified in 51 (94%). Thus, MRD studies were potentially applicable to virtually all patients. The sensitivity and specificity of MFC technique was improved by analysing 10 normal and 5 regenerating bone marrows (BM) for the presence of these LAPs and by determining maximum log difference (LD). CD7, CD19, CD2, CD11b and CD56 were the most sensitive and reliable markers for MRD studies. LAPs were rarely detected in either normal or regenerating BMs. Through dilutional experiments from 50% LAPs to 0.001%, it was determined that 1 leukaemic in 104 and 105 normal cells could be detected using the improved techniques. Of the 54 patients, 31 received chemotherapy, with 27 achieving complete remission (CR). Two were LAP negative and thus 25 were evaluable for MRD post induction and 22-post consolidation chemotherapy. Detection of MRD &gt;0.15% was able to distinguish between two groups of patients according to relapse status. Although, the number of patients was small, detection of MRD post induction &gt; 0.15% was shown to be an independent predictor of adverse prognosis for both relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in a multivariate analysis [p = 0.037 and 0.026, 95% CI (1.1-20.5 and 1.2-22.2), hazard ratio 4.7 and 5.2 respectively]. Post consolidation, there was a trend for patients with higher MRD values to show shorter RFS (p = 0.06). MFC using 5-colour allows us to detect LAPs in virtually all AML patients and our preliminary results suggest the technique is a suitable approach for MRD analysis. However, 5-colour MFC is technically challenging, resource intensive, and may not be feasible in a routine diagnostic laboratory. This led us to assess whether we could identify other potential markers for LAPs. Interleukin-3 alpha receptor- chain IL-3_ (CD123) has been suggested to be a marker of leukaemic stem cells (LSC). These cells are thought to be responsible for initiating and maintaining leukaemic cell growth post chemotherapy and hence to give rise to relapse of the disease. Therefore, we analysed 34 AML patients for expression of CD123 in the blast population and defined a population containing leukaemic stem cells using the immunophenotypic markers CD123+/CD34+/CD38-. Thirty-two (94%) of AML patients expressed CD123. We then used a molecular marker to determine whether CD123 expression was confined to the LSC. Thirtynine patients were screened for the presence of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 - internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) as the most common molecular abnormality in AML patients. Of those, 12 (31%) were FLT3/ITD positive. In seven of them, CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ and CD34+/CD38-/CD123- populations were sorted to homogeneity by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (BD FACSAriaTM Cell Sorter) and tested for FLT3/ITD. In six of seven patients with FLT3/ITD positive AML, we could not detect the mutation in the CD34+/CD38-/CD123- fraction, but the mutation was detected in the CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ fraction in all seven patients. This novel finding demonstrates that, the oncogenic event occurs in CD123 positive cells, thus supporting the concept that CD123 is a marker of the LSC in CD123 positive AML. This observation suggests novel treatment approaches employing surface marker CD123-targeting antibodies may be of use in the treatment of AML. In conclusion, we demonstrate that using five-colour MFC improves LAP detection in AML and enables MRD studies using immunophenotyping to be applied to virtually all AML patients. Additionally, it increases the sensitivity of the technique for detecting LAP populations. Moreover, evaluation of MRD post induction chemotherapy is the most sensitive time point for detection of MRD, with MRD levels &gt;0.15% predicting relapse and worse prognosis. As an alternative to using individualised LAPs specific to each patient, CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ cells may in the future serve as a better marker for MRD studies. This marker identifies the putative LSC, which is responsible for regrowth of leukaemia and relapse of the disease. Thus, instead of looking at whole &#8220;blast&#8221; population which results in huge data analysis and interpretation for the different LAPs which may have different underlying biology, it may be more informative to look at the frequency of LSC after achieving CR using CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ as the single LAP for MRD studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acute myeloid leukaemia; flow cytometry; immunophenotyping; minimal residual disease</field><field name="subject">Acute myeloid leukemia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and function of the elastic fibre network of the human lumbar anulus fibrosus.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Lachlan James</field><field name="description">Degeneration of the lumbar intervertebral disc, a condition widely implicated in the cause of low back pain among adult humans, is typically characterised by progressive biochemical and structural changes to the extracellular matrix. Comprehensive descriptions of the structural and functional inter-relationships within the extracellular matrix are therefore critical to understanding the degenerative process and developing effective treatments. In the anulus fibrosus, this matrix has a complex, hierarchical architecture comprised of collagens, proteoglycans, and elastic fibres. Elastic fibres are critical constituents of dynamic biological structures that functionally require elasticity and resilience. Studies to date of elastic fibre network structure in the anulus fibrosus have been qualitative and limited in scope. Additionally, there is poor understanding of the structural and functional associations between elastic fibres and other matrix constituents such as collagen, and, critically, there have been no studies directly examining the nature and magnitude of the contribution made by elastic fibres to anulus fibrosus mechanical behaviour. In this thesis, multiple experimental studies are described that specifically examine each of these areas. Novel imaging techniques were developed and combined with histochemistry and light microscopy to facilitate the visualisation of elastic fibres at a level of detail not previously achieved. Examination of elastic fibre network structure revealed architectural differences between the intralamellar and interlamellar regions, suggesting that elastic fibres perform functional roles at distinct levels of the anulus fibrosus structural hierarchy. The density of elastic fibres within lamellae was found to be significantly higher in the lamellae of the posterolateral region of the anulus than the anterolateral, and significantly higher in the outer regions than the inner, suggesting it may be commensurate with the magnitude of the tensile strains experienced by each region of the disc in bending and torsion. The nature of the structure-function associations between elastic fibres and collagen was then examined with respect to the reported structural mechanisms of collagen matrix tensile deformation. Histological assessment of collagen crimp morphology in specimens from which elastic fibres had been enzymatically removed revealed no observable differences when compared with controls, suggesting that any contribution made by elastic fibres to maintaining crimp is minimal. Elastic fibres in anulus fibrosus specimens subjected to radial tensile deformations exhibited complex patterns of re-arrangement, suggesting that they maintain cross-collagen fibre connectivity. Elastic fibres were also observed to maintain physical connections between consecutive lamellae undergoing relative separation. Finally, the nature and magnitude of the contribution made by elastic fibres to anulus fibrosus mechanical properties at the tissue level was investigated using a combination of biochemically verified enzymatic treatments and biomechanical tests. Targeted degradation of elastic fibres resulted in a significant reduction in both the initial modulus and the ultimate modulus, and a significant increase in the extensibility, of radially oriented anulus fibrosus specimens. Separate treatments and mechanical tests were used to account for any changes attributable to non-specific degradation of glycosaminoglycans. These results suggest that elastic fibres enhance the mechanical integrity of the anulus fibrosus extracellular matrix in the direction perpendicular to the plane containing the collagen fibres. In summary, the results of the studies presented in this thesis provide important new insights into the structure and function of the anulus fibrosus elastic fibre network, and highlight its potential importance as a contributing or ameliorating factor in the progression of the structural and mechanical changes associated with intervertebral disc degeneration. Additionally, these results establish an improved framework for the development of more accurate analytical and finite element models to describe disc behaviour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intervertebral disc; anulus fibrosus; elastic fibres; elastin; structure-function</field><field name="subject">Lumbar vertebrae</field><field name="subject">Intervertebral disk--Diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-objective portfolio optimisation of upstream petroleum projects.</field><field name="creator">Aristeguieta Alfonzo, Otto D.</field><field name="description">The shareholders of E&amp;P companies evaluate the future performance of these companies in terms of multiple performance attributes. Hence, E&amp;P decision makers have the task of allocating limited resources to available project proposals to deliver the best performance on these various attributes. Additionally, the performance of these proposals on these attributes is uncertain and the attributes of the various proposals are usually correlated. As a result of the above, the E&amp;P portfolio optimisation decision setting is characterised by multiple attributes with uncertain future performance. Most recent contributions in the E&amp;P portfolio optimisation arena seek to adapt modern financial portfolio theory concepts to the E&amp;P project portfolio selection problem. These contributions generally focus on understanding the tradeoffs between risk and return for the attribute NPV while acknowledging the presence of correlation among the assets of the portfolio. The result is usually an efficient frontier where one objective is set over the expected value of the NPV and the other is set over a risk metric calculated from the same attribute where, typically, the risk metric has a closed form solution (e.g., variance, standard deviation, semi-standard deviation). However, this methodology fails to acknowledge the presence of multiple attributes in the E&amp;P decision setting. To fill this gap, this thesis proposes a decision support model to optimise risk and return objectives extracted from the NPV attribute and from other financial and/or operational attributes simultaneously. The result of this approach is an approximate Pareto front that explicitly shows the tradeoffs among these objectives whilst honouring intra-project and inter-project correlations. Intra-project correlations are incorporated into the optimisation by integrating the single project models to the portfolio model to be optimised. Inter-project correlation is included by modelling of the oil price a global variable. Additionally, the model uses a multi-objective simulation-optimisation approach and hence it overcomes the need of using risk metrics with closed form solutions. The model is applied to a set of realistic hypothetical offshore E&amp;P projects. The results show the presence of complex relationships among the objectives in the approximate Pareto set. The ability of the method to unveil these relationships hopes to bring more insight to the decision makers and hence promote better investment decisions in the E&amp;P industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">portfolio optimisation; multi-objective; optimisation; upstream petroleum; project evaluation</field><field name="subject">Petroleum Prospecting Mathematical models.

Increasingly the restoration of these ecosystems and the river water quality has become a high priority for federal and state governments and associated departments and agencies. Public concern is adding to the pressures on these departments and agencies to restore these ecosystems and to sustainably maintain the river water quality. The long term monitoring of floodplain wetlands has been limited, compounding the difficulties faced by managers and decision makers on assessing the potential outcome of restoration options. The role of this project in the broad scheme of restoration/rehabilitation is to contribute to the construction of a model capable of increasing managers and decision makers understanding, and build consensus of potential outcomes of management option. This model was to use available data. The developed model, based on WETMOD developed by Cetin (2001), simulates wetland internal nutrient processes, phytoplankton, zooplankton and macrophyte biomass as well as the interaction (nutrient and phytoplankton exchange) between wetlands and the river. The model further simulates the potential impact management options have on the wetlands, and their nutrient retention capacity, and therefore their impact on the river nutrient load. Due to the limitation of data, wetlands were considered in categories for which data was available. Of these two had sufficient data to develop, calibrate and validate the model. Management scenarios for these two wetlands were developed. These scenarios included, the impact of returning a degraded wetland in a turbid state to a rehabilitated clear state, and the impact the removal of nutrient from irrigation drainage inflows has on wetland nutrient retention, and consequent input to the river. Scenarios of the cumulative impact of the management of multiple wetlands were developed based on using these two wetlands, for which adequate data was available, as &#8220;exemplar&#8221; wetlands, i.e. data from these wetlands were substituted for other similar wetlands (those identified as belonging to the same category). The model scenarios of these multiple wetlands provide some insight into the potential response management may have on individual wetlands, the cumulative impact on river nutrient load and how wetland morphology may relate to management considerations. The model is restricted by data availability and consequently the outputs. Further, some limitations identified during the development of the model need to be addressed before it can be applied for management purposes. However, the model and methods provide a guide by which monitoring efforts can assist in developing future modelling assessments and gain a greater insight not only at the monitoring site but also on a landscape scale.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">River Murray; wetland modelling; wetland management; wetland nutrient retention</field><field name="subject">Wetlands South Australia Murray River Region (S.

The primary motivation of the research presented is the incorporation of uncertainty into ANNs used for water resources modelling, with emphasis placed on obtaining accurate results, while maintaining simplicity of implementation, which is considered to be of utmost importance for adoption of the framework by practitioners in this field. By applying the Bayesian framework to a number of synthetic and real-world case studies and by comparison with a state-of-the-art ANN development approach, it is shown throughout this thesis how the Bayesian approach can be used to address the three most significant issues facing the wider acceptance of ANNs in this field; namely generalisability, interpretability and uncertainty. The state-of-the-art approach is devised through reviewing and, where necessary, improving current best practice deterministic ANN development methods, leading to the recommended use of the global SCE-UA optimisation algorithm, which has not been used before for ANN training, and the development of a modified connection weight approach for extracting knowledge from trained ANNs. The real-world case studies used in this research, which involve salinity forecasting in the River Murray at Murray Bridge, South Australia, and the forecasting of cyanobacteria (Anabaena spp.) in the River Murray at Morgan, South Australia, are used to demonstrate the practical value of the Bayesian framework, particularly when extrapolation is required and when the available data are of poor quality. These issues lead to poor model performance when deterministic ANN development methods are applied, yet as the generated predictions are deterministic, there is no direct way of assessing their quality. Application of the proposed Bayesian framework leads to better average performance of the ANN models developed, since a minimal ANN structure is selected and a more generalised input-output mapping is obtained. More importantly, prediction limits are provided which quantify the uncertainty in the predictions and enable management and design decisions to be made based on a known level of confidence.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Murray River (N.S.W.-S.

There is international speculation that parasite transmission from farmed to wild fish leads to increased incidence of parasitism in wild fish. Conversely, transfer of parasites from wild fish to farmed fish can negatively impact upon the health of farmed fish. Baseline information on the parasite assemblage of wild S. lalandi in Australia will: 1) allow informed judgments to be made in order to responsibly monitor, and perhaps remedy, potentially negative impacts and; 2) enable identification of parasite species of potential harm to the Australian S. lalandi aquaculture industry. I collected wild Seriola spp. (Carangidae) throughout southern Australia and examined them for metazoan parasites. Fifty-six metazoan parasite species are identified, including one new species. A taxonomic listing is provided for the metazoan parasites found. Taxonomic descriptions are made for the blood fluke Paradeontacylix godfreyi n. sp. (Digenea: Sanguinicolidae) and a redescription is provided for the parasitic copepod Naricolax chrysophryenus (Cyclopoida: Bomolochidae). A qualitative risk assessment was devised for the metazoan parasite taxa identified for the sea-cage aquaculture of S. lalandi in South Australia. Risk was interpreted considering the likelihood and consequence of parasite establishment and proliferation. The monogeneans Benedenia seriolae and Zeuxapta seriolae were considered extremely likely to establish and proliferate. Benedenia seriolae also poses high potential negative consequences for cost-effective S. lalandi sea-cage farming. However, the absence of potential mitigation methods and parasite management for Paradeontacylix spp. (Digenea), Kudoa sp. and Unicapsula seriolae (Myxozoa) indicates that these species may also present high negative consequences for S. lalandi aquaculture in Australia. The nature of wild Seriola migrations is critical for an understanding of the potential impact of disease and parasite interactions between wild and farmed fish. A small-scale tagging programme of wild-caught S. lalandi and S. hippos in South Australia provided insight into the movements of these species. Recapture results indicate that large S. lalandi remain in, or return to, northern Spencer Gulf. S. lalandi also move past sea-cage farms in Fitzgerald Bay, northern Spencer Gulf, which is an important consideration in view of potential expansion of the S. lalandi sea-cage industry in Spencer Gulf. There is surprisingly little experimental assessment on parasite transmission from farmed fish to wild fish. Studies assessing parasite interactions between wild and cultured fish employ models to quantify parasite population levels of cultured, wild and escaped fish, while others carry out comparative surveys of parasite prevalence and intensity over time, in areas close to and distant from farming activity. I provide preliminary data on ectoparasite prevalence and intensity on wild S. lalandi in areas close to, distant from and where there is no sea-cage farming in southern Australia. I review methods employed in the northern hemisphere to assess sea-louse transfer between wild and farmed salmon and propose methods for assessing monogenean parasite transmission from farmed to wild S. lalandi in Australia. In summary, this thesis provides insight into the potential for parasite interactions between wild and farmed S. lalandi. I document the parasite assemblage of wild and farmed S. lalandi and wild S. hippos and provide baseline data on &#8216;natural&#8217; parasite prevalence and intensity. I provide a taxonomic description of a new species of blood fluke. I indicate the likelihood of parasite transfer from wild fish to farmed S. lalandi, and identify parasite taxa with potentially negative consequences for sea-cage aquaculture. I provide the first firm data that wild S. lalandi move past one area where kingfish are farmed in sea-cages in South Australia. Finally, I propose procedures to better understand the potential for monogenean parasite transmission from farmed S. lalandi to wild fish. This thesis reports new information that is important when considering and managing expansion of the S. lalandi sea-cage aquaculture industry throughout Australia. It also provides baseline data on natural parasite levels to enable ongoing monitoring of the potential impacts of the industry on wild fish populations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parasites; aquaculture; taxonomy; risk assessment; Seriola; aquatic animal health</field><field name="subject">Yellowtail Parasites South Australia.

In the literature about hospital efficiency measurement, there is an absence of a well-defined framework to select the most appropriate set of input and output variables. Variables used in hospital efficiency studies predominantly reflect a narrow view of hospital functions with a little attention to quality variables. This implies that the hospital goal and its full range of functions in efficiency measurement are poorly understood. While numerous studies have been undertaken in developed countries, there have been only a few attempts at measuring hospital efficiency in developing countries. However, there has so far been no systematic attempt, using frontier-based techniques, to measure the efficiency of Iranian hospitals, and to identify factors affecting efficiency and remedial actions to improve efficiency. By focusing on the above two issues, this thesis makes three arguments. First, by undertaking an in-depth investigation regarding the multi-product nature of hospitals, considering a fuller range of hospital functions, and the values of various stakeholders including patient, staff, and community, this study has proposed a health-oriented framework with a focus on the Iranian hospitals to select the most appropriate variables for measuring hospital efficiency. I argue that both variables (existing in the literature, and discussed for addition) should be taken into account in order to enhance the validity of hospital efficiency studies. Second, two types of techniques (simple ratio analysis and data envelopment analysis) were used for measuring the technical efficiency of hospitals owned by the Iranian Social Security Organization (SSO). The benefits and shortcomings of each method were discussed. For example, considering major surgery rates, which implicitly provide information about the case-mix, has revealed that all high-turnover, high-occupancy outlying hospitals as well as the majority of hospitals falling in the relatively well-performing quadrant in the Lasso diagram had a low major surgery rate. This suggests that simple ratio analysis can only measure the performance of hospitals over a single dimension ignoring their multi-input and multi-output nature of hospitals. Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), I measured technical efficiency, scale efficiency, and types of returns to scale for the SSO hospitals. In addition to studying their overall and relative efficiency, I analysed the magnitude of the inefficiency for each individual hospital. The results revealed that 22 of the 53 hospitals were deemed to be efficient. Inefficient hospitals had an average score of 78%, implying a potential reduction in all inputs on average by about 22% with no impact on output levels. The comparison of DEA results and simple ratio analysis has revealed that hospitals with an exceptional performance on individual variable even though less valuable compared with other variables can gain a full efficiency score. This critical analysis of the study strongly suggests that the findings obtained from unconstrained DEA should be interpreted with caution. Finally, in addition to simply measuring efficiency, it was felt that a better understanding of the factors affecting hospital efficiency and remedial actions to improve efficiency is needed. Using qualitative methods, a complex mix of organisational factors such as hospital financing, political influences such as political pressures in determining hospital location, and the training and experience of the managers were argued to be influential factors in hospital efficiency. The interviews also provided a great insight into remedial actions such as reforms in the regulatory framework and corporatization.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hospital; effieiency; DEA; Iran</field><field name="subject">Efficiency.</field><field name="subject">Hospitals Administration Iran.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting the potential impacts of new pasture and amenity legumes on temperate natural ecosystems.</field><field name="creator">Emms, Jason</field><field name="description">There is a desire to source novel legume species to combat the threat of dryland salinity to agriculture and the environment. There are already many legume weeds in temperate Australia and the potential negative impact of new species has created a justifiable impasse. Weed risk assessment presents a potential solution, but deficiencies in the current Australian system have hampered progress thus far. A greater emphasis on the impact of the weed species may be a means of solving this conflict. Therefore, this project attempted to predict the level of impact that a legume species would have upon temperate natural ecosystems. The weed impact of exotic legume species in natural ecosystems was determined by distributing a questionnaire to experts. Respondents reported that woody perennial legumes were more important than herbaceous legumes. Field measurements demonstrated that the abundance of legumes was correlated with their perceived impact in natural ecosystems. Thus, two test species lists were compiled, one of woody species and the other herbs. The woody species comprised three impact levels: major, moderate and no impact. The herbaceous species also comprised three lower impact levels: consequential, inconsequential and no impact. The identification of legume species with differing levels of impact subsequently allowed them to be compared with respect to a number of biological traits, with the aim of distinguishing impact groups based on these traits. Seedling growth was examined in the glasshouse under both high and low soil moisture. With high soil moisture, major and moderate impact legumes were distinguished by having a higher specific root length than no impact legumes. Consequential impact herbaceous legumes had lower specific leaf area than the lower impact groups. Moisture stress did not alter the comparisons between impact groups. Five reproductive traits were explored through a mixture of experimental, field sampling and literature research. Major and moderate impact legumes had a shorter juvenile period, higher seed dormancy, a smaller seed mass and higher seed production than no impact legumes. Major and moderate impact legumes could be differentiated by their seed mass and seed production. Consequential and inconsequential impact herbaceous species had higher seed production and seed dormancy than no impact species. To allow for important interactions with the environment, the ability of the test legumes to establish in temperate natural ecosystems with and without physical disturbance was studied. This provided some test of the conclusions reached from individual trait studies. The highest impact legumes were the most successful at establishing in the natural ecosystems studied. Disturbance had a positive effect on establishment, except for the major impact group where disturbance was not important. This study was able to highlight that for a legume to successfully naturalise in temperate Australia it must possess certain biological traits. Less success was achieved in distinguishing naturalised legumes of differing impact. However, growth form is important and seed mass appears a significant trait in regard to woody species. Both are easily measured traits and could be incorporated in weed risk assessment of legumes in the future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">legumes; pastures; pastures-management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of increased butyrate delivered as butyrylated starch on large bowel physiology in the rat.</field><field name="creator">Bajka, Balazs Hendrik</field><field name="description">Introduction: Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are produced by large bowel fermentation of dietary carbohydrates including resistant starch (RS) and non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). SCFA (particularly butyrate) play a major role in maintaining large bowel function and may reduce the incidence of colonic disease. Butyrate is the preferred metabolic substrate of colonocytes and is believed to play a key role in modulating epithelial cell cycle, mucosal immune response and gut motility. Increasing large bowel butyrate supply requires intakes of NSP or (RS) much higher than those currently consumed in western diets. Recent studies have shown large bowel butyrate is increased by the ingestion of butyrylated starch but the characteristics and physiological effects of its ingestion in animal models of colonic disease have not yet been investigated. Aims and Methods: The experiments in in vitro and in rats described in this thesis examined: the effects of production techniques and cooking on the capacity of butyrylated starch to deliver butyrate to the large bowel. They investigated the effects of increased butyrate levels on large bowel function in: (i) normal rats, (ii) the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) rat model of ulcerative colitis (UC) and (iii) the high dietary protein rat model of colonocyte genetic damage. Results: Starch type, pre-treatment and the degree of butyrylation influenced the in vitro digestion and fermentation characteristics of butyrylated starch before and after cooking. Butyrylated starch was less susceptible to small intestinal digestion RS as than high amylose maize starch (HAMS) in vitro. Feeding diets containing 10% cooked butyrylated starch delivered significantly greater amounts of butyrate to the large bowel of rats than 10% raw or cooked HAMS. Butyrate did not influence colonocyte proliferation throughout the large bowel of the rat but increased distal colonic IL-18 concentrations and decreased longitudinal smooth muscle contractility. Feeding HAMS or butyrylated HAMS (HAMSB) to rats during DSS induced UC and during 7 days of recovery resulted in increased mucosal damage compared to low amylose maize starch (LAMS) fed rats. When rats were fed HAMS or HAMSB during the 7 days of recovery only, there was no significant difference in mucosal damage. Genetic damage, as measured by the comet assay, was 2 fold higher in rats fed high protein diet compared with those fed a low protein diet. Concurrent feeding of high protein and either HAMS or HAMSB resulted in significantly less genetic damage. Genetic damage in rats fed 20% HAMSB was half the levels of the 20% HAMS group, and was the same as the low protein diet. Conclusions: Butyrylated starch delivered butyrate to the large bowel in rats effectively, was less susceptible to small intestinal digestion and had greater stability following cooking than the unmodified base starch. Increased digesta butyrate did not affect large bowel function or colonocyte proliferation in the normal rat; the effects on mucosal damage in the DSS rat model of ulcerative colitis were inconclusive. Increased luminal butyrate prevented high-protein induced colonocyte genetic damage. Butyrylated starches have potential to assist with the maintenance of bowel health and to contribute to reduced risk of colonic disease in the community.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">butyrate; acylated starch; colon</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of core temperature corrections on exercise-induced hypoxemia.</field><field name="creator">Shipp, Nicholas Jon</field><field name="description">The primary purpose of this doctoral dissertation was to investigate the effect of body temperature responses at physiologically relevant sites during an incremental exercise test on the phenomenon of exercise-induced hypoxemia (EIH). This phenomenon has been considered as an important limitation to physical performance with a prevalence of ~50 % in trained male athletes, but described in both sexes, across the range of both age and physical fitness in more recent literature. Previously this phenomenon has been described as a decrement in both arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO&#8322;) and oxy-haemoglobin saturation (SaO&#8322;or SpO&#8322;) with, particularly important for PaO&#8322;, a lack of or inappropriate correction made for the change in body temperature during intense exercise. The initial study of this thesis determined the thermal response within the body at physiologically relevant sites measured simultaneously during an incremental exercise test. The results demonstrated the inadequacy of rectal temperature as an indicator of the acute temperature changes occurring during an incremental exercise test due to its slow response rate and relative thermal inertia. Radial arterial blood and oesophageal temperatures were shown to behave almost identically during the exercise test, albeit with an offset of approximately 1.3&#186;C, and were considered much more appropriate and relevant indicators of thermal changes during exercise. As an extension of the initial work active muscle temperature (vastus lateralis) was measured during the exercise test, demonstrating a significantly lower resting temperature than the oft-reported &#8220;core&#8221; temperatures (rectal and oesophageal) as well as a significantly greater increase in temperature in comparison to all other measurement sites. Overall, the results of this first study indicated that the physiologically relevant temperatures measured at the oesophageal and muscle sites differed markedly to the outdated rectal temperature measurement site and should be used as measures of thermal response when evaluating oxygen loading (oesophageal) or unloading (active muscle). Utilising the definition of EIH as a decrease in PaO&#8322; of &#8805; 10 mmHg, the effect of temperature correcting PaO&#8322; was evaluated in the second study. Arterial blood gases measured simultaneously to the temperature measurements during the incremental exercise test were adjusted for the temperature changes at each site (every 1&#186;C increase in temperature will increase a PaO&#8322; value by ~5 mmHg). Whilst uncorrected PaO&#8322; values indicated an almost 100% prevalence of EIH in this group, oesophageal temperature corrected PaO&#8322; values decreased this prevalence to ~50% while muscle temperature corrections resolved all cases of EIH and demonstrated an HYPEROXAEMIA (i.e. the reverse of the well-established phenomenon) in the majority of subjects. Further investigation of arterial oxygen content during the exercise test indicates that there is no disruption in the delivery of oxygen to the active muscles and therefore any performance decrement should be attributed to another mechanism. Whilst the phenomenon of EIH is determined by the definition applied and the use of temperature corrections in the case of PaO&#8322;, its reproducibility in a test-retest situation had not previously been determined. Utilising a subset of previously tested subjects, the reproducibility of both temperature and PaO&#8322; were determined with results indicating that the blood gas response was highly reproducible, especially the minimum PaO&#8322; value noted during each exercise test. However, comparing a more statistically relevant definition of a change in PaO&#8322; of &#177; 2 standard deviations from the mean resting PaO&#8322; to the previous delimiter of 10 mmHg indicated a lesser reproducibility of the prevalence of EIH. In summary, this thesis exposes the inadequacies of previous research into EIH with regard to the expected reproducibility of the phenomenon and the need to correctly adjust PaO&#8322; values for exercise-induce hyperthermia as well as demonstrating the difference in thermal responses to acute exercise in physiologically significant areas of the body. Furthermore, previously described correlations between the change in PaO&#8322; and VO&#8322; max were not evident in the subjects tested within this thesis, nor was there any indication of a diffusion limitation based on reduced pulmonary capillary transit time (by association with VO&#8322; max) or pulmonary oedema (rebuked by a rapid return of PaO&#8322; to above resting levels following exercise cessation).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">exercise-induced hypoxemia; temperature correction; reproducibility; oxygen content</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Anoxemia -- Physiological effect.</field><field name="subject">Temperature -- Physiological effect.</field><field name="subject">Body temperature -- Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Body temperature -- Regulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of key arthropods for the management of Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Coonawarra vineyards, South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Paull, Cate</field><field name="description">There is currently little knowledge about the dynamics of invertebrates in Australian viticultural ecosystems. This study was conducted in Coonawarra vineyards over three seasons (years) and has focused on identifying natural enemies, their seasonal phenology, multiple species interactions, and potential for the suppression of the pest lepidopteran Epiphyas postvittana (Tortricidae). The work presented in this thesis shows that endemic natural enemies have far greater potential to control E. postvittana than has been realised. An initial survey identified a diverse and abundant range of potential natural enemies. Of these, the species most likely to attack E. postvittana include a predatory mite Anystis baccarum and a number of hymenopteran parasitoids. The most abundant parasitoid in the vineyards was a braconid, Dolichogenidea tasmanica. Understanding the characteristic behaviour of parasitoids in response to host density can help to gauge their potential for pest suppression. The results of large-scale field experiments showed that the response of D. tasmanica to the density of E. postvittana was inversely density-dependent, and that parasitism was consistently higher in Cabernet Sauvignon compared with Chardonnay varieties. Despite the fact that interactions among multiple species of natural enemies can increase or decrease pest suppression, particularly when they share a common prey/host, few multispecies interactions have been investigated. Laboratory studies identified a novel interaction between the predatory mite A. baccarum an abundant predator in the vine canopy, the parasitoid D. tasmanica and host E. postvittana larvae. Although A. baccarum readily ate E. postvittana eggs and free roaming larvae, they could not access larva in their silk leaf rolls. However, the addition of D. tasmanica significantly increased predation of E. postvittana larvae, by altering the behaviour of host larvae and increasing their vulnerability to the mite. Experiments conducted at a landscape level in the Coonawarra showed that D. tasmanica was also present in habitat other than vineyards including native vegetation. However, it was not present in highly disturbed habitats. Although the exact mechanism for this remains unknown, results indicate that viticultural practices and resources in the surrounding landscape can influence the presence of parasitoids. Together, the findings presented in this thesis make a significant contribution towards developing sustainable pest management in Australian viticulture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">invertebrate ecology; conservation biological control; parasitoids; Epiphyas postvittana; Tortricidae</field><field name="subject">Grapes Diseases and pests Control Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An anisotropic Matern spatial covariance model: REML estimation and properties.</field><field name="creator">Haskard, Kathryn Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the development, estimation and investigation of a general anisotropic spatial correlation function, within model-based geostatistics, expressed as a Gaussian linear mixed model, and estimated using residual maximum likelihood (REML). The Matern correlation function is attractive because of its parameter which controls smoothness of the spatial process, and which can be estimated from the data. This function is combined with geometric anisotropy, with an extension permitting different distance metrics, forming a flexible spatial covariance model which incorporates as special cases many infinite- range spatial covariance functions in common use. Derivatives of the residual log-likelihood with respect to the four correlation-model parameters are derived, and the REML algorithm coded in Splus for testing and refinement as a precursor to its implementation into the software ASReml, with additional generality of linear mixed models. Suggestions are given regarding initial values for the estimation. A residual likelihood ratio test for anisotropy is also developed and investigated. Application to three soil-based examples reveals that anisotropy does occur in practice, and that this technique is able to fit covariance models previously unavailable or inaccessible. Simulations of isotropic and anisotropic data with and without a nugget effect reveal the following principal points. Inclusion of some closely-spaced locations greatly improves estimation, particularly of the Matern smoothness parameter, and of the nugget variance when present. The presence of geometric anisotropy does not adversely affect parameter estimation. Presence of a nugget effect introduces greater uncertainty into the parameter estimates, most dramatically for the smoothness parameter, and also increases the chance of non-convergence and decreases the power of the test for anisotropy. Estimation is more difficult with very &#8220;unsmooth" processes (Matern smoothness parameter 0.1 or 0.25) | non- convergence is more likely and estimates are less precise and/or more biased. However it is still often possible to fit the full model including both anisotropy and nugget effect using REML with as few as 100 observations. Additional simulations involving model misspecification reveal that ignoring anisotropy when it is present can substantially increase the mean squared error of prediction, but overfitting by attempting to model anisotropy when it is absent is less damaging. Further, plug-in estimates of prediction error variance are reasonable estimates of the actual mean squared error of prediction, regardless of the model fitted, weakening the argument requiring Bayesian approaches to properly allow for uncertainty in the parameter estimates when estimating prediction error variance. The most valuable outcome of this research is the implementation of an anisotropic Matern correlation function in ASReml, including the full generality of Gaussian linear mixed models which permits additional fixed and random effects, making publicly available the facility to fit, via REML estimation, a much wider range of variance models than has previously been readily accessible. This greatly increases the probability and ease with which a well-fitting covariance model can be found for a spatial data set, thus contributing to improved geostatistical spatial analysis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Matern correlation; geometric anisotropy; model-based geostatistics; residual maximum likehood; REML; Matern covariance</field><field name="subject">Geology -- Statistical methods.</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Analysis -- Statistical methods.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surf: an abstract model of distributed garbage collection.</field><field name="creator">Brodie-Tyrrell, William</field><field name="description">Garbage collectors (GCs) automate the problem of deciding when objects are no longer reachable and therefore should be reclaimed, however, there currently exists no automated process for the design of a correct garbage collector. Formal models exist that prove the correctness of individual GCs; more general models describe a wider range of GCs but do not prove their correctness or provide a concrete instantiation process. The lack of a formal model means that GCs have been designed in an ad-hoc manner, published without proof of correctness and with bugs; it also means that it is difficult to apply experience gained from one implementation to the design of another. This thesis presents Surf, an abstract model of distributed garbage collection that bridges the gap between expressibility and specificity: it can describe a wide range of GCs and contains a proof of correctness that defines a list of requirements that must be fulfilled. Surf&#8217;s design space and its requirements for correctness provide a process that may be followed to analyse an existing collector or create a new GC. Surf predicts the abstract behaviour of GCs; this thesis evaluates those predictions in light of the understood behaviour of published GCs to confirm the accuracy of the model. A distributed persistent implementation of the Train Algorithm is created as an instantiation of Surf and the model is used to analyse progress in the GC and drive the design of a partition selection policy that provides a lower bound on progress and therefore reduces the GC&#8217;s complexity to completeness. Tests with mesh data structures from finite element analysis confirm the progress predictions from Surf. Published GCs cluster mostly in one corner of the Surf design space so this thesis explores the design of a GC at an unoccupied design point: the Tram Algorithm. Analysis via Surf leads to the prediction that Trams are capable of discovering topology in the live object graph that approximately identifies the strongly connected components, permitting O(1) timeliness that is unique to the Tram Algorithm.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">memory; objects; garbage collection; distributed termination defection; GC; DTD; Surf; distributed; wave</field><field name="subject">Refuse collection</field><field name="subject">Refuse collectors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building the evidence base for disinvestment from ineffective health care practices: a case study in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.</field><field name="creator">Elshaug, Adam Grant</field><field name="description">In the early 1990s claims were made that in all areas of health care, &#8220;30-40% of patients do not receive treatments of proven effectiveness&#8221;, and, &#8220;20-25% of patients have treatments that are unnecessary or potentially harmful&#8221;. Many such practices were diffused prior to the acceptance of modern evidence-based standards of clinical- and cost-effectiveness. I define disinvestment in the context of health care as the processes of withdrawing (partially or completely) resources from any existing health care practices, procedures, technologies or pharmaceuticals that are deemed to deliver little or no health gain relative to their cost, and thus are not efficient health resource allocations. Arguably disinvestment has been central to Evidence-Based Medicine(EBM) for well over a decade yet despite general advances in EBM, this topic remains relatively unexplored. This thesis examines the ongoing challenges that exist within the Australian context relating to effective disinvestment. Upper airway surgical procedures for the treatment of adult Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSA) are used as a case study to contextualise these challenges. This thesis has six sections: 1. A review of the literature outlines developments in EBM broadly and provides a detailed background to OSA, including the numerous treatment options for the condition. This review examines evidence that highlights the importance of &#8216;highly effective treatment&#8217; over &#8216;subtherapeutic treatment&#8217; as a necessity to confer improved health outcomes in OSA. It is argued that claims of surgical success inherent in most published results of surgery effectiveness fail to assimilate contemporary evidence for clinically significant indicators of success. 2. Section two comprises the first reported meta-analysis in this area. It presents the pooled success rates of surgery according to various definitions. Specifically, when the traditional &#8216;surgical&#8217; definition of success is applied the pooled success rate for Phase I (i.e. soft palate) surgical procedures is 55% (that is 45% fail). However, using a more stringent definition (endorsed by the peak international sleep medicine body), success is reduced to 13% (that is 87% fail). Similarly for Phase II (i.e. hard palate) procedures success rates decrease from 86% to 43% respectively when moving from a surgical to a medical definition of success. That various medical specialties differentially define treatment success, I argue, creates uncertainty for observers and non-clinical participants in this debate (eg policy stakeholders and patients). This represents a barrier to disinvestment decisions. 3. Results are presented from a clinical audit of surgical cases conducted as a component of this thesis. Both clinical effectiveness and procedural variability of surgery are reported. A unique methodology was utilised to capture data from multiple centres. It is the first time such a methodology has been reported to measure procedural variability alongside clinical effectiveness (inclusive of a comparative treatment arm). The observed cohort (n=94) received 41 varying combinations of surgery in an attempt to treat OSA. Results on effectiveness demonstrate an overall physiological success rate of 13% (according to the most stringent definition; phases I and II combined). This demonstration of procedural variability combined with limited effectiveness highlights clinical uncertainty in the application of surgical procedures. 4. Section four outlines how a qualitative phase of enquiry, directed at exploring the perspectives and experiences of surgery recipients, was approved by three independent research ethics review boards but was not supported by a small group of surgeons, resulting in the project being canceled. Potential consequences of this for impeding health services research (HSR) are discussed. 5. Two sets of results are reported from a qualitative phase of enquiry (semi-structured interviews) involving senior Australian health policy stakeholders. The first results are of policy stakeholders&#8217; perspectives on the surgical meta-analysis and clinical audit studies in 2 and 3 above. The second results are from an extended series of questions relating to challenges and direction for effecting disinvestment mechanisms in Australia. Stakeholder responses highlight that Australia currently has limited formal systems in place to support disinvestment. Themes include how defining and proving inferiority of health care practices is not only conceptually difficult but also is limited by data availability and interpretation. Also, as with any policy endeavour there is the ever-present need to balance multiple interests. Stakeholders pointed to a need, and a role, for health services and policy research to build methodological capacity and decision support tools to underpin disinvestment. 6. A final discussion piece is presented that builds on all previous sections and summarises the specific challenges that exist for disinvestment, including those methodological in nature. The thesis concludes with potential solutions to address these challenges within the Australian and international context. Systematic policy approaches to disinvestment represent one measure to further improve equity, efficiency, quality of care, as well as sustainability of resource allocation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disinvestment; health policy; obstructive sleep apnoea, apnea; surgery; evidence based medicine; obsolescence; cost-effectiveness; health technology assessment</field><field name="subject">Evidence-based medicine</field><field name="subject">Sleep apnea syndromes Treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of a J=1 to J=1 system in samarium with resonant laser radiation at 686 nm.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Shu-Yen</field><field name="description">An J=1&#8594;J=1 atomic system in Samarium with incident laser resonant radiation has been investigated. A linearly polarized laser at 686nm excites atoms from the level 4&#402;[superscript]66s[superscript]2 [superscript]7F[subscript]1 to a excited level 4&#402;[superscript]66s6p [superscript]9F[subscript]1 via the process of optical pumping. When an external magnetic field is applied to the atom-laser interaction and the decay fluorescence collected, a level-crossing profile appears. Theoretical predictions of the level-crossing profile can be made using spherically irreducible tensors to describe the density matrix which take advantage of the symmetry of the atomic system. By comparing theory with experimental data, a discussion is made of the various parameters and external factors that can affect this system, which show that Doppler broadening is the major influence. An additional investigation is made into the evolution of the J=1&#8594;J=1 atomic system with increasing laser exposure. Comparisons of the experimental data with theoretical predictions are made by analyzing the FWHM of the overall level-crossing profile, the FWHM of the dip about B = 0 and the relative depth of the dip. By charting the progress of these parameters with increasing laser exposure, it can be seen that the theory and experimental data agree qualitatively.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samarium; coherent population trapping</field><field name="subject">Samarium.

Spatial control. Particular cell-types must respond specifically to salt stress to minimise the amount of Na&#8314; delivered to the shoot; and, 2. Temporal control. Transgenes are typically expressed in plants at similar levels through time, irrespective of the stress encountered by the plant, which may exacerbate pleiotropic effects and means that, particularly in low-stress conditions, costly and/or detrimental metabolic processes may be active, thus reducing yield. To address these issues, Gateway&#174; destination vector constructs were developed combining the GAL4 UAS (upstream activating sequence) with the ethanol-inducible gene expression system to drive inducible cell-specific expression of Na&#8314; transporter transgenes (or to silence salt transporter transgenes inducibly and cell-specifically). Rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) GAL4-GFP enhancer trap lines (Johnson et al., 2005: Plant J. 41, 779-789) that express GAL4 and GFP specifically in either the root epidermis or xylem parenchyma (and therefore &#8216;trap&#8217; cell-type specific enhancer elements) were transformed with this GAL4 UAS &#8211; ethanol switch construct, thereby allowing both spatial and temporal control of transgenes. In preliminary experiments, the expression system successfully limited the expression of RFP to specific cell-types after induction with ethanol. Other genes expressed using this system include PpENA1, a Na&#8314;-extruding ATPase from the moss, Physcomitrella patens, and AtHKT1;1, a Na &#8314; transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana. The two enhancer trap rice lines were also transformed with the GAL4 UAS driving stable expression of AtHKT1;1 and PpENA1 specifically in root epidermal or xylem parenchyma cells. Expression of AtHKT1;1 in root epidermal cells reduced Na&#8314; accumulation in the shoots, while expression in the root xylem parenchyma appeared to have little effect on shoot Na&#8314; accumulation. Using cryo-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) X-ray microanalysis, the outer cells of the roots of the line expressing AtHKT1;1 in the epidermal cells were found to accumulate higher levels of Na&#8314; than the parental enhancer trap line. Additionally, this line had decreased unidirectional &#178;&#178;Na&#8314; influx.

In preliminary experiments, the characteristics of flow over single plates with rectangular cross-section and faired leading edges and over tandem arrays of an upstream plate with rectangular cross-section and faired leading edges and a downstream plate of rectangular cross-section were investigated, together with the sound radiation produced. However, the main investigation has been concentrated on single plates of rectangular cross-section with various chord-to-thickness ratios C and on arrays of two plates of rectangular cross-section in tandem having various chord-to-thickness ratios C&#8321; and C&#8322; and a range of gaps (with gap-to-thickness ratios G) between them. The range of Reynolds number based on plate thickness t and free-stream velocity U, Re[subscript]t = Ut/&#957; (where &#957; is the kinematic viscosity of fluid) covered in the measurements is 3.2 x 10[superscript]3 &#8804; Re[subscript]t 53 x 10[superscript]3. Spectra of velocity fluctuations in the flow and radiated sound have been measured and their characteristic frequencies related. An attempt has been made to measure force fluctuations on surfaces of the plates in order to relate them to flow characteristics and radiated sound power. Mean and fluctuating pressures associated with the force fluctuations on the plates have also been obtained. The lengths of separation bubbles on long rectangular plates have also been determined. In most cases, the measurements have been complemented by flow-visualisation in a water tunnel to provide additional detailed insight into the flow patterns. Three flow regimes have been identified for single plates of rectangular cross-section. In the first regime (1 &#8804; C &#8804; 3.13), shear layers separated from the leading edges form a vortex street downstream of the plate without reattachment to it. Associated force fluctuations on the plate are the main source of acoustic radiation. In the second regime (3.05 &#8804; C &#8804; 9.65), the separated shear layers reattach intermittently to the streamwise plate surfaces. Vortex formation in the shear layer is the dominant cause of sound radiation but the effect becomes weaker as C increases. In the third regime (6.52 &#8804; C &#8804; 68), the separated shear layers form closed leading-edge separation bubbles. Weak vortex shedding, with only a small contribution to the sound radiation, occurs only at the trailing edges of the plate. Bistable behaviour of the flow over a plate, with random switching between the regimes, occurs for C &#8776; 3 and 6.52 &#8804; C &#8804; 9.65. A proposed classification of possible flow regimes for the flow around two plates of rectangular cross-section in tandem has been confirmed experimentally. For small G, the flow in the gap between the plates is isolated from the external flow. When the gap G between the plates is increased to or beyond a critical value (between 2 and 3.5), the shear layers separated from the upstream plate form a von Karman vortex street in the gap before interacting with the downstream plate. Flow and acoustic measurements indicate that this transition is associated with dramatic changes in the flow character.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bluff bodies; Vortex shedding; Acoustic Radiation; Aeroacoustics; plates in Tandem</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exchange rate and monetary policy: selected comparative experiences during the pre- and post 1997 Asian financial crisis.</field><field name="creator">Goo, Si Wei</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine empirically the relationship between the exchange rate, the instruments of monetary policy and the measures of economic performance for Indonesia, Korea and Thailand during the pre- and post 1997 Asian financial crisis. The first core chapter (Chapter 2) assesses the possible linkages between the increase in domestic inflation and the exchange rate targeting policy adopted in these countries. Using the cointegration technique and a simple monetarist inflation model, Chapter 2 finds strong evidence that the exchange rate policy that generates a predominant domestic currency undervaluation has caused an increase in the domestic inflation rate for Indonesia and Korea. However, the exchange rate targeting policy that brings about a predominant baht overvaluation especially during the pre-crisis period has lowered Thailand&#8217;s inflation. Soon after the outbreak of 1997-crisis, instead of using the exchange rate as the nominal anchor, all three countries have implement their monetary policy around an inflation target following an inflation targeting framework. Owing to this significant structural break, the second core chapter (Chapter 3) uses a Markov-switching VAR framework to determine if the effects of monetary policy shocks have changed across different monetary policy regimes in these economies. Chapter 3 finds that regime switches occur in mid-1997 to 2000 for Indonesia, which coincides with the period after the onset of 1997-crisis and the economic recovery period; and in 1999 for Korea and Thailand, which coincides with the period when the inflation-targeting framework is adopted. From the regime-dependent impulse response functions, the responses of macroeconomic variables to monetary policy shocks have changed significantly across different regimes only for the case of Korea and Thailand. From the above discussions, Chapter 2 found that exchange rate targeting policy caused higher domestic inflation in Indonesia and Korea especially during the pre-crisis period; while Chapter 3 found that inflation targeting policy seemed to cause structural changes in Korea and Thailand. Therefore using a structural VAR framework, the third core chapter (Chapter 4) explores further the role of the exchange rate and inflation targeting policy on the economic performances of these economies during the pre- and post crisis periods. Chapter 4 finds that in the case of Indonesia and Korea, the foreign exchange market does create most of its own shocks during the pre-crisis period but not during the post crisis period. For Indonesia and Thailand, the soft US dollar peg policy during the pre-crisis period has caused additional distortions in the domestic economy. Moreover the role of the exchange rate as a shock absorber has increased during the post crisis period only for the case of Indonesia and Thailand. For all three economies, following the introduction of the inflation targeting policy, domestic short-term interest rates have been adjusted systematically to offset inflationary pressure following the real and nominal shocks. Moreover, in the case of Indonesia and Thailand, the unsystematic part of monetary policy plays a smaller role in explaining the variations in domestic economy during the post crisis period.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asian financial crisis; exchange rates; monetary policy; NATREX; BEER; Markov-switching VAR</field><field name="subject">Foreign exchange rates Asia.

Despite the recognition that the proximal stomach has a major role in gastric emptying of liquids, only the motor activity of the antro-pyloro-duodenal region has been evaluated in detail. In addition, many of the proposed risk factors for the gastric dysmotility, particularly a prior history of diabetes mellitus, have not been evaluated formally but have been extrapolated from data from non-critically ill patients. The currently available prokinetic drugs, erythromycin and metoclopramide, are considered to be the first line treatment for feed intolerance. However, neither data comparing the effectiveness of these agents nor the data on the effects of combination of therapy in the treatment of feed intolerance are available. The aims of this thesis were, therefore, to examine: (i) proximal gastric motor activity and the association between proximal and distal motility; (ii) the relationship between entero-gastric humoral responses to nutrients, gastric emptying and feed intolerance; (iii) the impact of admission diagnoses, choice of sedations, timing of initiation of feeding, and pre-existing history of diabetes mellitus on gastric emptying and feed intolerance; and (iv) the efficacy of erythromycin, metoclopramide and combination of these drugs in treatment of feed intolerance in critically ill patients. The current thesis indicates that motor activity is impaired in multiple regions of the stomach in the critically ill. When compared to healthy humans, proximal gastric relaxation was prolonged and fundic wave activity was educed during small intestinal nutrient infusion in critically ill patients. In addition, simultaneous assessment of proximal and distal gastric motility demonstrated a possible disruption of the motor integration between the proximal and distal stomach. In light of the recent data that suggested a significantly greater proportion of meal distributed proximally in critically ill patients with delayed gastric emptying (Nguyen, et al. 2006), the disruption of the gastric motor integration and the prolonged gastric relaxation in response to duodenal nutrients may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of slow gastric emptying during critical illness, especially as liquid formulae. The entero-gastric hormonal feedback responses were also disturbed during critical illness. Both fasting and duodenal nutrient-stimulated plasma CCK and PYY concentrations were significantly higher in critically ill patients, particularly those who did not tolerated gastric feeds. The rate of gastric emptying of a liquid meal was inversely related to both fasting and postprandial plasma CCK and PYY concentrations, supporting the potential role of plasma CCK and PYY in the pathogenesis of gastric dysmotility in critically ill patients. Admission diagnosis, choice of sedative drug and blood glucose control but not the timing of enteral feeds were important factors for delayed gastric emptying and feed intolerance in these patients. In particular, delaying enteral feeding by 4 days had no impact on the rate of gastric emptying, intra-gastric meal distribution, or plasma CCK and PYY concentrations. Contrary to traditional belief, critically ill patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of type 2 DM have only a minor disturbance to the proximal stomach, a relatively normal gastric emptying and are at no higher risk of feed intolerance than those without DM, suggesting the presence of pre-existing DM 2 in critically ill patients should not influence the standard practice of gastric feeding. Therapeutically, short-term treatment with low dose erythromycin was more effective than metoclopramide, but the effectiveness decreased rapidly overtime at similar rate as observed with metoclopramide. In patients who failed to response to either agent, treatment with both agents was highly effective in re-establishing feeding success. The use of combination therapy as the initial treatment for feed intolerance was also more effective than erythromycin alone and had less tachyphylaxis. Treatment with erythromycin and metoclopramide, either as a single agent or in combination did not associated with major cardiovascular adverse side effects. Although diarrhoea was a common side effect and was highest with combination therapy, it was not associated with Clostridium difficile infection and settled quickly after the cessation of the prokinetic therapy. In summary, the work performed in the current thesis has provided substantial insights into the understanding of the nature, risk factors, pathogenesis and treatment of disturbed gastric motor function in critically ill patients. Not only do these findings stimulate further research into the mechanisms responsible for gastric dysmotility in critical illness, they also lead to the development of new strategies for optimizing the management of feed intolerance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical illness; gastric motor function; enteral nutrition</field><field name="subject">Enteral feeding</field><field name="subject">Stomach--Motility.</field><field name="subject">Critically ill.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47985</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The differentiation of psychosis and spiritual emergency.</field><field name="creator">Goretzki, Monika</field><field name="description">Psychosis has long been recognised as a severe mental disorder characterised by derangement of personality, disorganised thought, and a loss of contact with reality. Certain mystical and alternate states, which have been practiced throughout history by various cultures, have also been deemed as pathological through the lens of western psychiatry even though many of these states provide beneficial contributions to the individual and their community. A number of similar states have been found in modern society and have been termed "Spiritual Emergencies". The aim of this research was to determine whether "spiritual emergency". (SE) is a valid concept and to outline the differences between SE and psychosis. One-hundred-and-nine participants from the general public completed a questionnaire developed for this research, comprised of measures of psychosis and ten spiritual emergency subscales. Results indicated that participants who were prescribed medication or previously experienced a psychotic episode scored higher on the SE subscales. One strong factor was found to underlie all the SE subscales and a significant relationship was found between this factor and the measure of psychotic experience. It is open to interpretation as to whether psychosis is nothing more than SE or whether SE is nothing more than psychosis.

Carbon supplies are inherently more variable for aquatic plants than for those in terrestrial environments, and variations are intensified for plants in semi-arid regions, where water may be limiting. In changeable environments the most successful species are likely to be those with flexible carbon-uptake mechanisms, able to accommodate variations in the supply of resources. Studies were made of plants associated with wetland habitats of the Murray, including Crassula helmsii, Potamogeton tricarinatus, P. crispus and Vallisneria americana. The aim was to elucidate the mechanisms of carbon uptake and assimilation employed, and to determine how flexibility in carbon uptake and/or assimilation physiology affect survival and distribution. Stable carbon isotopes were used to explore the dynamics of carbon uptake and assimilation, and fluorescence was used to identify pathways and photosynthetic capacity. The studies suggest that physiological flexibility is adaptive survival in changeable environments, but probably does not enhance the spread or dominance of these species. V. americana is a known bicarbonate-user, and it is shown here that it uses the Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathway under specific conditions (high light intensity near the leaf tips) concurrently with HCO[subscript]3 - uptake, while leaves deeper in the water continue to use the C[subscript]3 pathway, with CO&#8322; as the main carbon source. However, V. americana does not use CAM when under stress, such as exposure to high light and temperature. The diversity of carbon uptake and assimilation mechanisms in this species may explain its competitive ability in habitats associated with the Murray. In this way it is able to maximise use of light throughout the water column. In shallow, warm water, where leaves are parallel to the surface, CAM ability is likely to be induced along the length of the leaf, allowing maximal use of carbon and light. The amphibious C. helmsii is shown to use CAM on submergence, even where water levels fluctuate within 24 hours. This allows continued photosynthesis in habitats where level fluctuations prevent access to atmospheric CO&#8322;. It appears that stable conditions are most favourable for growth and dispersal, and that the spread of C. helmsii is mainly by the aerial form. Carbon uptake by P. tricarinatus under field conditions is compared with that of P. crispus to demonstrate differences in productivity associated with aqueous bicarbonate and atmospheric CO&#8322; use. P. tricarinatus uses HCO[subscript]3 - uptake to promote growth toward the surface, so that CO&#8322; can be accessed by floating leaves. Atmospheric contact provides access to light and removes the limitation of aqueous diffusive resistance to CO&#8322;, thereby increasing photosynthetic capacity above that provided by submerged leaves.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aquatic photosynthesis; crassulacean acid metabolism; bicarbonate uptake; vallisneria; crassula</field><field name="subject">Crassulaceae.</field><field name="subject">Crassulacean acid metabolism.</field><field name="subject">Photosynthesis.</field><field name="subject">Aquatic plants.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47987</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of rare sugars and novel sugar derivatives from 1,2-dioxines.</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Antony Vincent</field><field name="description">1,2-Dioxines are a specific class of cyclic peroxide that are both prevalent in nature and important synthetic building blocks. To date, much of the chemistry involving 1,2-dioxines is concerned with cleavage of the weak peroxide bond, providing a convenient method for the incorporation of 1,4-oxygen functionality into molecules. Comparatively little attention has been directed towards transformations of the alkene unit contained within 1,2-dioxines, which is the focus of this thesis. The synthesis of a broad range of diversely functionalised 1,2-dioxines from commonly available starting materials is presented. Subsequently, the osmium catalysed dihydroxylation of 3,6-disubstituted 1,2-dioxines was investigated, furnishing novel peroxy diols in high yield and with excellent diastereoselectivity. The peroxy diols were then reduced, affording stereospecific tetraols and higher polyols, including the rare sugar allitol. In addition, homolytic ring-opening of the 1,2-dioxanes was examined, providing a new route to polyhydroxylated furanoses, highlighted by the synthesis of the natural keto-sugar psicose. Several 4-substituted 1,2-dioxines were also dihydroxylated, followed by reduction of the peroxide bond, providing a convenient route to branched erythritol derivatives, including the important plant sugar 2-C-methyl-erythritol. The cobalt catalysed ring-opening of the peroxy diols produced novel erythrose derivatives in high yield. In addition, the triphenylphosphine induced ring contraction of the peroxy diols is presented, which allowed for the synthesis of novel dihydroxylated tetrahydrofurans in excellent yield. Asymmetric dihydroxylation of the achiral 4-substituted 1,2-dioxines was explored, furnishing optically enriched peroxy diols with varying enantioselectivity depending on the substrate. The synthesis of novel alkyl and aryl branched erythrono-&#947;-lactones via oxidation of lactols derived from the acetonide protected peroxy diols is also documented. The utility of this sequence is illustrated by the preparation of potassium 2,3,4-trihydroxy-2-methylbutanoate, a leaf-closing substance of Leucaena leucocephalam. Additionally, &#947;-lactones were prepared from epoxy hydroxy ketones derived from epoxy-1,2-dioxanes, facilitated by a Baeyer-Villiger lactonisation protocol. The requirements and limitations of this procedure are discussed. The proposed and attempted synthesis of other lactones from 1,2-dioxines was also examined. Finally, several other general alkene transformations were investigated on 1,2- dioxines including: halo-hydrin formation, phenylselenyl chloride addition, aminohydroxylation, cyclopropanation, and aziridination, allowing for the preparation of several new classes of functionalised 1,2-dioxines. In summary, the work presented in this thesis establishes clear and efficient methodology towards several interesting and useful sugar-type core structures from modified 1,2-dioxines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organic chemistry; 1,2-dioxines; endoperoxides; asymmetric synthesis; carbohydrates</field><field name="subject">Sugars.

The IEEE802.11 family, which occupies a bandwidth in the multi-mega hertz region with the highest data rate of 54 Mbps, now has become the most widely deployed wireless LAN standards. The rapid adoption of IEEE802.11 for computer wireless networks and their growing popularity in mobile applications highlight the need for a low cost, low power consumption, and monolithic solution. To meet this challenge, traditional RF techniques, which revolved around the superheterodyne architecture can no longer be used. On the contrary, new receiver frontend architectures need to be developed to satisfy the demand of system level integration. Direct downconversion receivers directly translate the RF spectrum to the baseband by setting the LO frequency equal to the RF. Due to the single frequency translation, expensive and bulky off-chip filters and 50 ohm I/O matching networks at IF are no longer required. Also, the single-stage quadrature mixers further simplify the receiver design and reduce the power dissipation. Subsequent baseband components and ADCs are also possible to be integrated with the RF frontend to achieve a monolithic receiver chip. Despite the previously mentioned advantages, the implementation of a direct downconversion receiver has its own set of performance challenges. In particular, the performance is plagued by DC offset, flicker noise, linearity and mismatches etc. The main objective of this project is to investigate the feasibility of using direct downconversion architecture for the IEEE802.11a standard, and implement the design in a 0.18 &#181;m CMOS technology. By approaching the design issue at a theoretic point of view, extensive modeling and simulations based on a SIMULINK IEEE802.11a physical layer theme have been carried out to evaluate the receiver performance. SER results of the receiver demonstrate that the impairments associated with zero IF can be minimised to an acceptable level. Under the guidance of the system level analysis, the circuit level design of a monolithic direct downconversion receiver has been implemented in a 0.18 &#181;m RF CMOS process, including the building blocks of an LNA, mixer, baseband amplifier and a channel-selection filter. Particularly, a novel LNA design methodology with an improved noise figure and less power consumption has been developed. The mixer conversion gain and phase noise have been analysed by a novel approach. The combination topology of the highpass DC offset removal filter and the baseband amplifier provids the best linearity with a negligible noise figure degradation. Circuit simulations are performed using the foundry provided RF design kit with enhanced noise models to capture the extra noise of passive and deep submicron devices. Circuit level simulations show a qualified receiver frontend for the IEEE802.11a standard. As data converters are important building blocks in wireless receivers, research on high performance Sigma-Delta modulators is also included. MATLAB based programs have been developed for both the discrete and continuous time transfer function synthesis. A BPSDM chip with variable centre frequencies has been developed to verify the SDM transfer function algorithm and the design methodology. The design of an ultra fast continuous time SDM is particularly focused on for a broadband data conversion. To alleviate the challenge of the comparator speed limit, a novel noise transfer function with a unit clock delay has been synthesised. With such a delayed transfer function, a three-stage comparator can be acheieved that solves the comparator gain and speed tradeoff. The full chip simulation shows an acceptable performance for the IEEE802.11a standard.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radio frequency integrated circuits -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Wireless LANs.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drying/rewetting cycles in southern Australian agricultural soils: effects on turnover of soil phosphorus, carbon and the microbial biomass.</field><field name="creator">Butterly, Clayton Robert</field><field name="description">Phosphorus (P) limitations to agricultural productivity commonly occur in Australian soils and have largely been overcome by the use of inorganic fertilisers. However, studies have shown that most of the P taken up by plants is from native P pools. The turnover of P and native soil organic matter may be strongly affected by drying and rewetting (DRW). Rewetting dry soil results in a pulse of respiration activity and available nutrients. In Mediterranean-type climates surface soils naturally undergo recurrent DRW cycles. In southern Australia, soils experience DRW due to erratic rainfall within the growing season, and short, high intensity thunderstorms also during summer periods. The principal objective of this thesis was to determine the significance of dry-rewet events, for altering P availability and cycling in agricultural soils in Australia. Soils representing a wide range of soil types and climatic zones of southern Australia, showed large flushes in carbon (C) mineralisation after a single DRW event. For some soils these were comparable with reported values, however large variability in flush size between soils was observed. Soils that commonly experience DRW did not appear to be more resilient to DRW than soils from areas with fewer DRW events. Even when soils had relatively small respiration flushes, as a result of low soil organic matter, a high proportion of the soil C was mineralised after rewetting. Soil physiochemical properties (total C, total N, organic C, humus, microbial biomass P, organic P, sand and silt) were correlated to the size of the flush, hence nutrient availability and soil texture appear to primarily determine flush size. Therefore, the influence of climate on DRW may relate to determining the quantity of organic matter and microbial biomass that is available for turnover. Different size and composition of the microbial biomass within the same soil matrix were achieved by adding three different C substrates (glucose, starch and cellulose at 2.5 g kg-&#185;) at 5 times over 25 weeks. The treatments showed disparate responses to DRW, due to greater biomass (larger flushes) and effects of community composition, highlighting the central role of the soil microbes in DRW processes. When subjected to multiple DRW events these soils showed smaller rewetting respiration flushes with subsequent rewetting events. In contrast, the amount of P released after rewetting was the same. This study showed that increases in P after rewetting were transient and rapid immobilisation of P by microbes occurred, which may limit the availability to plants. The composition of the microbial community was changed by DRW with a reduction in fungi and gram negative bacteria, showing that certain species are more susceptible to DRW than others. Closer investigation at 2 hourly intervals after rewetting confirmed the transient nature of P flushes. The response in microbial respiration after rewetting was immediate, with the highest activity occurring within the first 2 h. Phosphorus availability was increased by DRW but remained stable over the following 48 h incubation period. The study highlights the rapid nature of changes in available nutrients after rewetting. Furthermore, while potentially only a small component of the P flush that occurred, the DRW soil had higher levels of P than most incubated soil at 48 h, this would be potentially available for plant uptake or movement with the soil solution. Long-term water regimes (continuously moist or air-dry, or DRW occurring at different times during incubation) that were imposed on two soils from different climatic regions over a 14 wk period, did not alter available nutrient (P and C) pools or the size of the microbial biomass. However, these long-term water regimes determined the respiration response of the soils to experimental DRW. The largest flushes occurred in the treatment with the longest dry period, and confirm findings of reported studies that the response of a soil at rewetting is determined by the length of the period that it is dried. Microbial biomass was little affected by experimental DRW, but showed large changes in C:P ratio. Thus, changes in physiological state or community composition may be more affected by DRW than the size of the microbial biomass. Microbial communities were altered by DRW irrespective of climatic history (warm wet summer and temperate Mediterranean), however these changes were not related to specific groups of organisms. In addition, the disparate respiration responses and inhibition of phosphatase by DRW, indicate that functional changes may be induced by DRW but can not be sufficiently explained by quantifying available nutrient pools or the microbial biomass. The use of wheat seedlings bio-indicators of P availability after the long-term water regimes, confirmed that plant available P was altered by DRW, indicated by differences in growth, although the large variability in seedling growth made it difficult to quantify these differences. However, the distribution of labile P, available at planting, in soil and plant pools at harvest, showed that long-term water regimes increased P allocation in plant tissue in one soil and decreased it in another. Furthermore, only a small fraction of the labile P present at planting was taken up by plants, which confirms the superior ability of soil microbes to immobilise P that is released by DRW. Nevertheless, since the long-term water regimes increased P availability, this may be transported via surface water or leaching. DRW is important for C and P turnover in soils of southern Australia. However, P flushes occur rapidly after rewetting and are transient. Therefore, DRW appears to have only minor consequences for P availability to plants.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drying; rewetting</field><field name="subject">Soil dynamics.</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus in agriculture.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Mesh: a universally integrated design approach for device control.</field><field name="creator">Strange, Martin Lumisden</field><field name="description">The Internet is a vastly under-utilised resource, only used for half of the IT story. Describe the Internet in two words and many might say &#8216;sharing knowledge&#8217;. But sharing information is more accurate. It&#8217;s just that all the principle ways we use the Internet &#8212; the Web, email and media streaming &#8212; happen to be examples where information is in the form of knowledge. But IT &#8212; Information Technology &#8212; has another side: the realm of software programming where information means the dynamic control of how things work. The Internet is the driving force in the IT industry, so why isn&#8217;t it also known for sharing control? True, there are examples of specialised, one-off software applications interfacing with each other via the Internet, but there has yet to be any systematic and universal attempt to exploit the potential of the Internet for control-IT in the way we have seen it for knowledge-IT. Taking the strengths of the Web model as a starting point, this thesis proposes a parallel, dynamic world to the Web called The Mesh. In the same way that the Web seamlessly connects databases of the world to provide a global font of knowledge, the Mesh would connect software of the world to provide a global means of control. The Mesh would embody all the successful, empowering features of the Web. Everyone would have a say in how things work, mirroring Web 2.0&#8217;s user-generated content but for software instead of media. In being a universally integrated design approach for device control, the Mesh would encompass a number of research areas working on the control issue at the big picture level. It would address the problems of universal usability and ubiquitous computing. It would also provide solutions in agent-based systems and grid computing. But many features of the Mesh would simply be unique. They would change the way we go about software design, leading to new opportunities for users, programmers and manufacturers alike. The key to everything is design simplicity. A concept demonstrator has been developed as an integral part of this research project. It shows that the Mesh is both feasible and practical. Examples of programs run in the concept demonstrator are discussed, showing exactly how the Mesh would be built and how it would work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet applications; markup languages; ubiquitous computing; universal design; universal usability; user interface description languages; user-generated software</field><field name="subject">Computer software</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vascular endothelial and smooth muscle function in children at risk of cardiovascular disease and the effect of folic acid supplementation.</field><field name="creator">Pe&#241;a Vargas, Alexia Sophie</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease secondary to atherosclerosis is the most common cause of human morbidity and mortality. An early and fundamental event in the development of atherosclerosis is abnormal vascular endothelial and smooth muscle function. This can be measured by flow mediated dilatation and glyceryl trinitrate mediated dilatation in children at risk of atherosclerosis. Folic acid improves endothelial function (flow mediated dilatation) in adults with coronary artery disease. No studies have previously investigated the effects of folic acid on vascular function in at risk children with diabetes or obesity. In a cross sectional study an evaluation of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle function and their determinants was performed in 159 children with type 1 diabetes, 58 children with obesity, and 53 healthy children. Children with type 1 diabetes and children with mild to moderate obesity had comparable and severe vascular dysfunction but different determinants. Vascular function in healthy and obese children related to both body mass index and weight (adjusted for age and sex), and blood glucose. Children with obesity had lower folate levels and higher homocysteine levels than children with type 1 diabetes, an abnormal lipid profile and raised inflammatory markers. A randomised double blind placebo controlled cross over trial of 8 weeks of folic acid supplementation was performed in 38 children with type 1 diabetes. In these children, folic acid improved endothelial function with a sustained increase in folate levels but independent of homocysteine levels. Folic acid did not improve smooth muscle function. A randomised double blind placebo controlled parallel trial of 8 weeks folic acid supplementation was performed including 53 obese children. Folic acid did not improve vascular function in obese children in spite of sustained increase in folate levels, and a decrease in homocysteine levels. It was concluded that children with type 1 diabetes and obesity have comparable and severe endothelial and smooth muscle function. Determinants of vascular function in children, including weight and glucose, represent a continuum effect. Folic acid supplementation improved endothelial function in children with type 1 diabetes but not in children with obesity, whose metabolic changes causing endothelial dysfunction differ from children with diabetes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endothelial function; smooth muscle function; type 1 diabetes; obesity, folic acid; children</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases.</field><field name="subject">Children -- Health and hygiene.</field><field name="subject">Overweight children.</field><field name="subject">Folic acid.</field><field name="subject">Vascular smooth muscle.</field><field name="subject">Vascular endothelium.</field><field name="subject">Diabetes -- Complications.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lessons to be learnt: evaluating aspects of patient safety culture and quality improvement within an intensive care unit.</field><field name="creator">Panozzo, Stacey J.</field><field name="description">Patient safety is of particular importance within intensive care units (ICUs), where critically ill, vulnerable patients receive complex multidisciplinary care. Prior research has indicated that improving patient safety and reducing errors within healthcare requires a focus on systems and organisational culture issues. This thesis was concerned with three studies. One focused on assessing the patient safety culture and two on quality improvement initiatives within an intensive care unit (ICU) of a large teaching hospital. The first study involved a survey of ICU consultant, registrar and nursing staff regarding aspects of safety culture. This was conducted using an existing Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. Of the twelve patient safety culture composites assessed, eight had scores lower than 50%, highlighting these as areas for improvement. Overall, while the survey results revealed that teamwork within the ICU was considered a strength, event reporting and patient care handovers and transitions were both considered areas with potential for improvement. The second study focused on the evaluation of a change initiative designed to improve the handover of patient clinical information in the ICU. This study involved a survey and interviews with consultant, registrar and nursing staff before and after the introduction of a Patient Management, Plan and Progress (PMPP) document. Examination of the survey responses involved both quantitative and qualitative analysis; respondent interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. The results of this study revealed resistance to, and criticisms of, the introduction of the PMPP document; the initiative failed and use of the document was discontinued. The second initiative concerned an evaluation of the impact of a hospital-wide document on improving documentation of withdrawal of patient treatment within the ICU. This involved both quantitative and qualitative analysis, with a patient medical record audit of decisions to withdraw patient treatment within the ICU before and after the introduction of an Advance Care Plan (ACP) document. ICU consultant, registrar and nursing staff were interviewed regarding the process of withdrawal of patient treatment within the ICU. Interview transcripts were analysed using a modified grounded theory approach. Results revealed that the attempt to improve the documentation of withdrawal of treatment within the ICU failed, with the ACP document remaining unused in 89% of cases and incomplete in the remaining 11%. Also, documentation of decision-making and of the process within the medical records did not improve. Before-introduction findings revealed that only 26% of medical records met the pre-existing requirements for treatment withdrawal in the ICU, and after-introduction findings revealed that only 19% of medical records audited met the requirements of the ACP document. After-audit findings also revealed significant and inappropriate increases in the involvement of an ICU registrar both as primary and secondary decision-makers. In spite of an increased awareness of ICU staff concerning the importance of improving documentation, the medical record audit revealed less compliance with the standards required for documentation. Possible reasons for the document remaining essentially unused, as revealed from interviews with staff, included: previous criticisms by the coroner when they failed to complete a similar formalised document properly; perceived logistical issues associated with obtaining required staff signatures; disagreement concerning who should be involved in documenting the withdrawal of treatment process; and the existence of an ICU subculture of practice that, in one particular aspect of documentation, was not consistent with established hospital and ICU protocol and documentation requirements. The final chapter of this thesis considered implications of the results of the studies for the planning, development, implementation and evaluation of improvement programs within the ICU setting. The results were considered within the context of organisational change management theory and research, including factors that have been found to be critical in the success or failure of change programs, such as resistance to change, the involvement of key stakeholders in the change process, leadership, communication and organisational culture. It is suggested that management consultants with organisational change expertise in the planning, development, implementation and evaluation of such programs should be involved in future quality improvement initiatives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patient safety; quality improvement; organisational change; intensive care unit; safety culture; barriers; resistance to change</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine Evaluation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indian foreign policy and the ambivalence of postcolonial modernity.</field><field name="creator">Chacko, Priya</field><field name="description">India&#8217;s foreign policy behaviour often challenges conventional theories of international relations (IR). Why for instance, did India wait 24 years after its first nuclear test to conduct another test? In the wake of its nuclear tests, why did the political leadership highlight the scientific achievements more than the military implications and why did it characterise India&#8217;s nuclear program as being unique in terms of its restraint and its commitment to total disarmament? Why did India engage in a discourse of friendship with China rather than adopt the anti-communist stance of other democratic states? These are just some of the questions that cannot be adequately explained by the positivist and ahistorical traditions of IR that down-play the connection between state identity and foreign policy or analyse foreign policy as the product of pre-existing realities, subjectivities and interpretive dispositions. An approach that takes into account the historical and cultural context of the construction of state identity however, offers a fuller understanding of India&#8217;s foreign policy behaviour. Using genealogy and the idea of identity performativity, this thesis analyses India&#8217;s foreign policy discourse as a representational practice which, through various codings of sex, gender and race, enacts India&#8217;s postcolonial identity. The thesis uses the findings of five case studies &#8211; India&#8217;s relationship with China, its nuclear politics, its relations with its South Asian neighbours and its interventions in Pakistan and Sri Lanka &#8211; to suggest that a deep ambivalence toward Western modernity lies at the heart of India&#8217;s postcolonial identity and, therefore, the foreign policy discourse that enacts it. This ambivalence arises because, on the one hand, Indian nationalists accepted colonial narratives in which the backwardness of &#8216;Indian civilisation&#8217; led to its degeneration, but on the other hand, they recognised the need to advance a critique of Western modernity and its deep imbrication with colonialism. The result is a striving for a postcolonial modernity that is not only imitative but strives to be distinctly different and superior to Western modernity by being culturally and morally grounded. Thus, India is fashioned as a postcolonial civilisational-state that brings to international affairs a tradition of morality and ethical conduct which it derives from its civilisational heritage. This thesis argues that in order to comprehend the apparently inexplicable aspects of Indian foreign policy it is crucial to understand this self-fashioning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">India; foreign policy; identity; postcolonialism</field><field name="subject">Postcolonialism India.</field><field name="subject">India Foreign relations 1984-</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48196</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of social networks on the health of older Australians.</field><field name="creator">Giles, Lynne Catherine</field><field name="description">Background Over the past three decades, social relationships have been shown to have important effects upon health. However, many different definitions and aspects of social relationships have been considered in the various studies, making comparison of findings difficult. Furthermore, the effects of social relationships upon different health outcomes have rarely been investigated within the same cohort of older people. In addition, there is a paucity of information concerning the effects of social relationships upon health of older Australians. Aim This thesis aims to investigate the effects of the structural aspects of social relationships &#8211; that is, social networks &#8211; on health among older Australians. The three specific health outcomes considered in this thesis were disability, residential care use and death. The specific aims of the thesis were to: 1. Develop a measurement model of social networks. 2. Examine the effects of total and specific social networks upon disability. 3. Determine the effects of total and specific social networks upon use of residential care. 4. Investigate the effects of total and specific social networks upon survival. An additional aim was to determine if there were threshold effects of social networks on the three specific health outcomes. Methods The study drew on six waves of data from 1477 participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing. A range of statistical techniques, including binary and multinomial logistic regression and survival analysis, were used in the analysis of the data. Propensity score adjustment was used to control for the effects of a broad range of covariates that encompassed sociodemographic, health, psychological and lifestyle characteristics of participants. Results A measurement model with social networks for children, relatives, friends and confidants was validated using confirmatory factor analysis. A variable that measured total social networks was also derived. Better social networks with relatives were protective against developing mobility disability over the nine year follow-up period (odds ratio (OR) 0.77; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 0.62 &#8211; 0.96). A similar result was found for Nagi disability (OR 0.76; 95%CI 0.62 &#8211; 0.93). Other specific social networks did not have significant effects on either measure of disability. There were no significant effects of social networks on use of low-level residential care overall. There was a significant effect of social networks with confidants and total social networks, such that participants in the upper category of social networks with confidants appeared to be protected against use of high-level residential care (OR 0.53; 95%CI 0.35 &#8211; 0.81) compared to participants in the lower category of confidants social networks. Similarly, participants in the upper category for total social networks appeared to be protected against use of high-level residential care (OR 0.68; 95%CI 0.46 &#8211; 0.99). In terms of mortality, better social networks with confidants and with friends appeared to be protective against death during the decade following the Wave 1 interview. The hazard ratio (HR) for participants in the upper category for confidants was 0.74 (95%CI 0.63-0.88) compared to participants in the lower category. For friends networks, the analogous HR was 0.75 (95%CI 0.63-0.89). Better total social networks also appeared to be protective against death over the 10 years of follow-up (HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.70- 0.99). There were few significant effects of social networks with children on the three health outcomes considered. There was little evidence of threshold effects of the specific social networks on the health outcomes. Discussion There are important and differing effects of specific social networks on the three health outcomes of disability, residential care and mortality that were considered in this thesis. Policymakers may need to reconsider whether specific kinds of social relationships, beyond spouses and children, have been given adequate weight in current policy frameworks that address the health of older people.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">applied statistics; social networks; ageing; longitudinal studies</field><field name="subject">Older people Australia Social networks.</field><field name="subject">Older people Australia Longitudinal studies.</field><field name="subject">Social networks Australia.</field><field name="subject">Social networks Health aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Six studies pointing to the need for a biopsychosocial approach to treating common gastrointestinal and hepatologic disorders.</field><field name="creator">Mikocka-Walus, Antonina</field><field name="description">Background and aims: This interdisciplinary thesis was designed to deepen understanding of the co-morbidity of anxiety and depression with chronic diseases of the digestive tract, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in particular. The first part of the thesis aimed to explore the prevalence of psychological problems in IBD compared to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic hepatitis C (HCV) groups. It also explored the relationship between the number of co-morbid functional gastrointestinal disorders and the severity of psychological problems in IBD and IBS. It also aimed to determine whether there is a relationship between psychological problems and the response to standard medical treatment/physical outcomes in patients with IBD, IBS and HCV. Furthermore, it aimed to explore whether disclosure of the psychological status of depressed and/or anxious IBD patients to their gastroenterologists influences doctors&#8217; behaviour and affects patients&#8217; responses to treatment/physical outcomes. The second part of the thesis aimed to investigate the potential role of antidepressants in IBD and to determine the feasibility of future randomised controlled trials on the role of antidepressants in IBD. Methods: Overall, a cohort of 139 outpatients (64 IBD, 41 HCV, and 34 IBS) and 18 gastroenterologists participated in the six studies comprising this thesis. A mixed methods design was applied. Two cross-sectional studies, an observational cohort prospective management study, a randomised controlled trial, a systematic review and an exploratory interview study were conducted. Differences between the groups for continuous variables were assesed with one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent samples ttests. Differences in categorical variables were assessed with contingency tables with the Chi-Square test and the Fisher&#8217;s Exact Test. Propsective analyses were conducted with repeated measures ANOVA, logistic regression and Poisson regression. Qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. Results: Overall, 42% of participants were anxious and 19% were depressed. Participants with HCV had higher levels of psychological impairment compared with the IBS, the IBD group and the general population (p&lt;0.05). Those IBD participants with fewer co-morbid functional disorders had better physical quality of life than participants with a greater number of these disorders (p=0.025). Moreover, depression/anxiety at baseline did not explain medical outcomes after 12 months in this cohort of patients with chronic diseases of the digestive tract. Doctors&#8217; knowledge of patients&#8217; psychological status was found to have no impact on IBD patients&#8217; outcomes after 12 months. However, interestingly, the level of anxiety in IBD participants significantly dropped between the baseline and nine months indicating a possible benefit from participating in the study. In the literature review, insufficient evidence was found to conclude that antidepressants are efficacious for treatment of psychological co-morbidities or somatic complaints in IBD. However, the qualitative interview study indicated a potential positive impact of treatment with antidepressants on coping with disease symptoms and general wellbeing in patients with IBD. Conclusion: The thesis confirms that there is a significant burden of psychological co-morbidity in patients with chronic gastroenterological diseases. Interdisciplinary approaches to the management of these diseases are therefore warranted in Australian gastroenterology clinics. Anxiety targeted interventions and research in this setting are urgently needed, especially with respect to patients with HCV. Larger studies exploring the gastroenterologists&#8217; role in treatment of co-morbid psychological problems in their patients are recommended. Longer prospective studies on homogenous samples of patients are also needed to clarify the nature of the relationship between psychological problems and relapse of somatic symptoms. Finally, randomised controlled trials exploring the efficacy of antidepressants in IBD are warranted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biopsychosocial; inflammation; bowel disease; depression; anxiety; quality of life; antidepressants; irritable bowel syndrome; chronic hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">Gastroenterology.</field><field name="subject">Gastroenterology Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cross cultural study of entrepreneurial competencies and entrepreneurial success in SMEs in Australia and Malaysia.</field><field name="creator">Ahmad, Noor Hazlina</field><field name="description">The present study examined the relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and business success in the context of SMEs in Australia and Malaysia. A &#8220;mixed-method&#8221; approach was adopted whereby two studies were conducted in a sequential fashion (Study 1 and Study 2). In Study 1, a qualitative method was adopted in which individual interviews were conducted with 20 entrepreneurs &#8211; 10 from Australia and 10 from Malaysia &#8211; who operated SMEs in the manufacturing and service sectors. The aim was to elicit behaviours that delineate competencies, and thus enable the identification of entrepreneurial competencies that are context-specific and of relevance in the current business environment. A content analysis of the interview data identified 12 competency domains: Strategic; Commitment; Conceptual; Opportunity; Organising and Leading; Relationship; Learning; Personal; Technical; Ethical; Social Responsibility; and Familism. Importantly, nine of these categories were well represented in existing models of entrepreneurial competencies, thereby providing evidence that these models offer a reasonable degree of cross-cultural generalisability. However, three new categories emerged, namely, Ethical, Social Responsibility, and Familism (broadly concerned with the role of &#8220;family&#8221; in building business success). There was evidence for Ethical and Social Responsibility competencies in both the Australian and Malaysian data, whereas Familism was specific to the Malaysian data and may well reflect the collectivist orientation of Malaysian culture. The identification of these additional categories of entrepreneurial competencies suggests that the existing models may need to be revised to further enhance their applicability to the measurement of entrepreneurial competencies in different cultural contexts. Study 2 Part 1 proceeded with validating the model of entrepreneurial competencies. This involved determining the psychometric rigour of the model and establishing the psychometric properties of all dependent variables (measures of business success) and covariates (i.e., business environment and entrepreneurs&#8217; cultural orientations) using a sample of 391 SME entrepreneurs (179 Australians and 212 Malaysians). The two best fit models of entrepreneurial competencies &#8211; the &#8220;Comprehensive&#8221; model and the &#8220;Parsimonious&#8221; model &#8211; are fully described. The Comprehensive model revealed that all twelve competency areas were perceived as relevant to SME outcomes by entrepreneurs in Australia and Malaysia, even though the behaviours that defined the Organising and Leading competency domain, as well as the Familism competency domain (later renamed &#8220;Supporting and Cooperating&#8221; for Australia due to the omission of items related to &#8220;family&#8221;) were somewhat different. The other 10 competency areas identified in the Comprehensive model appeared to be invariant across countries. On the other hand, the Parsimonious model of entrepreneurial competencies showed that, although some competency areas were universal in nature (i.e., Conceptual, Opportunity, Learning, and Ethical), others were country specific (i.e., Relationship, Social Responsibility, and Familism). It was argued that the differences could be traced to cultural variations between the countries, in particular the extent of Individualism versus Collectivism. Study 2 Part 2 tested the causal pathway between entrepreneurial competencies and business success and the possible influence of covariates using a structural equation modeling (SEM) procedure. The results showed that entrepreneurial competencies were strong predictors of business success in SMEs for both Australia and Malaysia. It was also found that both Benign and Stable business environments were significantly related to business success in Australia whereas only a Stable environment was significantly linked with success in Malaysia. Moreover, environmental variables showed a less strong path to success than competencies. When the Parsimonious model of entrepreneurial competencies was used in the model estimation, the association between entrepreneurial competencies and business success was more strongly evident in Hostile and Dynamic environments than in more Benign and Stable environments (for both Australia and Malaysia). The results also showed that cultural orientations (both Collectivism and Tolerance for Ambiguity) have positive effects on entrepreneurial competencies in Malaysia but not in Australia (i.e., Individualism and Tolerance for Ambiguity). The effect of education on entrepreneurial competencies was mixed; significant for only the Comprehensive model for Australia but significant for both Comprehensive and Parsimonious models for Malaysia. The effects of training before and after start up, as well as previous work experience on entrepreneurial competencies appeared to be nonsignificant in both contexts. On the basis of the results of the thesis, it was concluded that self-reported entrepreneurial competencies are predictive of self-reports of success in both Malaysian and Australian SMEs. The models that describe success in both countries are consistent with existing models of entrepreneurial competency although differences in the behaviours that define a domain are evidenced between countries as are the domains that successfully define a parsimonious model in each country. These results are interpreted as supporting a training agenda that identifies entrepreneurial skills as a critical pre-requisite to business success for SMEs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">entrepeneurial competencies; entrepreneurial success; cross cultural study; Australia; Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship Australia.

About a billion people live in extreme poverty and more than 800 million do not get adequate nutrition. Third World Debt looms large on the horizons of most underdeveloped nations and development continues to benefit the Third World elites, the developed nations, and their multinational corporations. The North-South divide continues to widen with very little &#8220;tricking down&#8221; to the poor majority in many nations. It is strongly believed that one-third of the world&#8217;s poor are getting poorer. The conventional approach to development theory and practice, focusing on economic growth, investment, trade and free markets continues to benefit developed nations. Even in nations where free trade and markets have spurred growth, the net results of globalization have not reached the majority. Globalization defined as the &#8220;economic, social, political and environmental integration of nations&#8221; creates some major imbalances in a world system increasingly based on liberal market economies. Ultimately, the IMF-WTO corporate globalization model has failed to deliver for developing countries, severely punishing those least capable of protecting themselves &#8211; the billions living on $ 400 million annually. Market access is only useful to countries at a stage of development that allows for their engagement in world markets, in a manner that promotes improved standards of living for their populations. The promise of market access is a distraction that has served to create a myth of prosperity. This research seeks to raise issues regarding the impact of globalization on North-South imbalances highlighting the crucial gaps in the globalization process. Initially, the research outlines the parameters and theories surrounding the globalization process and then progresses on to demonstrate the imbalances of the global system, highlighting the key areas of impact that adversely affect the development of Southern nations. Using India&#8217;s economic liberalization as a case in point, this thesis attempts to unveil the growing myth of prosperity that is being propagated in relation to the issues of globalization and the South. Finally, the thesis attempts to draw pertinent theoretical lessons that would contribute towards a better understanding of the effects of globalization on the South.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">globalization; global South; North-South imbalance; myth of prosperity</field><field name="subject">Globalization Economic aspects Developing countries.</field><field name="subject">Developing countries Economic conditions.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NATO&#8217;s eastward expansion and peace-enforcement role in the violent dissolution of Yugoslavia: 1994-2004.</field><field name="creator">Tsoundarou, Paul</field><field name="description">Since the end of the Cold War, political and geographical realities have changed considerably. One such reality was the balance of power between East and West, which was especially visible in Europe. The contest between rivals, the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), was over. Ultimately, NATO found itself the pre-eminent security organisation in Europe. The new post-cold war environment forced questions about the appropriate role for NATO. However, that changed with both the process of NATO expansion into former Warsaw pact countries and the ethnic conflicts throughout the former Yugoslavia. NATO found a new purpose during the violent dissolution of Yugoslavia as &#8216;peace-enforcer&#8217; in the Balkan region. The focus of this thesis is NATO&#8217;s role in peace-enforcement in the former Yugoslavia. It examines how NATO dealt with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. Specifically, how NATO managed to re-establish its relevance as a security organisation. NATO&#8217;s military intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo were crucial in securing the end of hostilities in both those regions. NATO&#8217;s Implementation Force (IFOR), Stabilisation Force (SFOR) and Kosovo Force (KFOR) all played significant roles in subsequent peace-enforcement and peace-building roles in the region by suppressing violence through power projection and institution building. In 2001, NATO undertook a third operation in the Balkans, that time of a more limited nature, disarming ethnic Albanians in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. NATO&#8217;s presence there also encouraged stability. This thesis argues that, ultimately, NATO maintained its relevance by the establishing a new role for itself after the Cold War through Eastward expansion and in suppressing ethnic conflict in the Balkans. Both these roles have been successful. The decisive interventions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and FYROM forced the belligerents to stop fighting. NATO&#8217;s subsequent enforcement of the peace has stopped each conflict from flaring up again. With NATO membership now including most of Europe, it remains the only viable security organisation on the continent. NATO&#8217;s effectiveness as a security organisation was demonstrated with its ability to end the conflict in the Balkans and providing a stable environment for the people of the region. This intervention was crucial to the definition of a new role for NATO in the post-Cold War world.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NATO; Yugoslavia; Balkans; peace enforcement; North Atlantic Treaty Organisation; Kosovo; Bosnia; FYROM; ethnic conflict</field><field name="subject">North Atlantic Treaty Organization Armed Forces Yugoslavia.</field><field name="subject">Peacekeeping forces Yugoslavia.</field><field name="subject">Yugoslavia History 1992-2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential expression of Streptococcus Pneumoniae genes during pathogenesis.</field><field name="creator">Le Messurier, K. S.</field><field name="description">Streptococcus pneumoniae is a nasopharyngeal commensal in most healthy individuals. However, it can translocate from this niche to deeper tissues, causing diseases such as otitis media, meningitis, sepsis and pneumonia, which are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. At the commencement of this work, inherent difficulties in harvesting sufficient bacterial numbers from experimental animals restricted the examination of pneumococcal gene expression during pathogenesis, and thus virulence gene transcription patterns were largely unknown outside of an in vitro environment. This thesis aimed to investigate such transcriptional patterns in vivo, and to hence gain a better understanding of pneumococcal behaviour during colonisation and disease. This work describes refinement of an intranasal S. pneumoniae infection model in CD-1 mice that enables pneumococci to be harvested from multiple niches with low contamination by nasopharyngeal microflora or host tissue, and minimal crosscontamination with circulating pneumococci in the vascular system. The challenge route simulates the acquisition of S. pneumoniae in the human population, and progression to IPD occurs naturally. RNA extraction, enrichment and linear amplification procedures were optimised so that RNA could be obtained from in vivo site in sufficient quantities and with sufficient integrity to be used in semi-quantitative assays. Linear amplification allowed the examination of gene expression in niches where low bacterial numbers had previously prevented such analyses. Real-time RT-PCR and microarray analyses were used to examine bacterial RNA samples recovered from the nasopharynx, lungs, blood and brains of CD-1 mice, providing the first comparative transcriptional data for pneumococci during carriage and disease, within the same animal model. Two pneumococcal serotypes were examined; a type 2 (D39) and a type 6A (WCH16) strain. CbpA, Ply, and SpxB were shown to be important for carriage in both strains, with pneumococci up-regulating the expression of the genes encoding these virulence proteins in the nasopharynx. This provides in vivo evidence supporting the ascribed roles of these proteins in reducing the level of competing microflora and promoting nasopharyngeal adherence. Similarly, D39 nanA and pspA transcription levels were up-regulated in the nasopharynx. The level of pspA mRNA was also higher in the blood than the lungs, suggesting an increased requirement in the bloodstream, where PspA is involved in reducing complement-mediated opsonisation. Despite the antiphagocytic role of the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule in the bloodstream, D39 cpsA mRNA was present in similar quantities in the nasopharynx, lungs and blood, which may support previous studies indicating post-transcriptional regulation of capsule expression. However, cpsA expression was up-regulated in the blood for WCH16. These results may indicate the existence of strain-specific differences in virulence gene regulation. Microarray analysis of in vivo-harvested S. pneumoniae D39 found that mRNAs encoding components of phosphotransferase systems, CbpA, a putative neuraminidase, and v-type sodium ATP synthase subunits were significantly higher in bacteria involved in carriage than bacteraemia. Conversely, the expression of genes involved in competence, and dinF (present on a competence-induced operon), were up-regulated in the blood compared to the nasopharynx, providing evidence that competence is induced during bacteraemia. Pneumococci also showed increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, pgdA, lytB and cbpG in the blood compared to the nasopharynx. This study used a single pneumococcal strain and infection model and, therefore, overcomes inherent issues of serotype/strain- and animal model- specific gene expression that may have complicated interpretation of data in previous studies. This thesis reports some of the first in vivo pneumococcal gene expression data gained using a single animal model and pneumococcal strain. The data reinforce the putative roles of several virulence factors, and provides novel transcription data for pneumococci during carriage. Results suggest the existence of core genes that are essential for infection in multiple pneumococcal serotypes, whereas other genes appear to have strain-specific roles.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pneumococcus; gene expression; in vivo; pathogen</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetostatic modelling of compliant micro-motion stages with circular flexure hinges.</field><field name="creator">Yong, Yuen Kuan</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a) a scheme for selecting the most suitable flexure hinge compliance equations, and b) a simple methodology of deriving kinetostatic models of micro-motion stages by incorporating the scheme mentioned above. There were various flexure hinge equations previously derived using different methods to predict the compliances of circular flexure hinges. However, some of the analytical/empirical compliance equations provide better accuracies than others depending on the t/R ratios of circular flexure hinges. Flexure hinge compliance equations derived previously using any particular method may not be accurate for a large range of t/R ratios. There was no proper scheme developed on how to select the most suitable and accurate hinge equation from the previously derived formulations. Therefore, the accuracies and limitations of the previously derived compliance equations of circular flexure hinges were investigated, and a scheme to guide designers for selecting the most suitable hinge equation based on the t/R ratios of circular flexure hinges is presented in this thesis. This thesis also presents the derivation of kinetostatic models of planar micromotion stages. Kinetostatic models allow the fulfillment of both the kinematics and the statics design criteria of micro-motion stages. A precise kinetostatic model of compliant micro-motion stages will benefit researchers in at least the design and optimisation phases where a good estimation of kinematics, workspace or stiffness of micro-motion stages could be realised. The kinetostatic model is also an alternative method to the finite-element approach which uses commercially available software. The modelling and meshing procedures using finite-element software could be time consuming. The kinetostatic model of micro-motion stages wasdeveloped based on the theory of the connection of serial and parallel springs. developed based on the theory of the connection of serial and parallel springs. The derivation of the kinetostatic model is simple and the model is expressed in closed-form equations. Material properties and link parameters are variables in this model. Compliances of flexure hinges are also one of the variables in the model. Therefore the most suitable flexure hinge equation can be selected based on the scheme aforementioned in order to calculate the kinetostatics of micro-motion stages accurately. Planar micro-motion stages with topologies of a four-bar linkage and a 3-RRR (revolute-revolute-revolute) structure were studied in this thesis. These micromotion stages are monolithic compliant mechanisms which consist of circular flexure hinges. Circular flexure hinges are used in most of the micro-motion stages which require high positioning accuracies. This is because circular flexure hinges provide predominantly rotational motions about one axis and they have small parasitic motions about the other axes. The 3-RRR micro-motion stage studied in this thesis has three-degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The 3-RRR stage consists of three RRR linkages and each RRR linkage has three circular flexure hinges. A Pseudo-Rigid-Body-Model (PRBM), a kinetostatic model and a two-dimensional finite-elementanalysis (FEA) model generated using ANSYS of micro-motion stages are presented and the results of these models were compared. Advantages of the kinetostatic model was highlighted through this comparison. Finally, experiments are presented to verify the accuracy of the kinetostatic model of the 3-RRR micromotion stage.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">compliant mechanism; flexure hinge; finite element analysis; kinetostatic model</field><field name="subject">Micromachining</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The modelling and optimal design of a three degree-of-freedom XY&#952;z micro-motion stage.</field><field name="creator">Handley, Daniel Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigation of the modelling and optimal design of a particular 3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) XY&#952;z micro-motion stage. This stage provides micron-scale motion in X and Y directions and a rotation about the Z-axis. Such a stage can be used for applications where positioning of components with micrometre, or even nanometre positioning accuracy is required. Some applications are; the positioning of samples in a scanning-electron-microscope; the positioning of masks in lithography; aligning fibre-optics and lasers; and manipulation of micro-scale objects in micro-biology or micro-systems assembly. The XY&#952;z micro-motion stage investigated in this study uses a particular topology of monolithic compliant mechanism and three stack piezoelectric actuators. The compliant mechanism used is a 3RRR (three revolute-revolute-revolute) parallel compliant mechanism using flexure hinges. This parallel mechanism uses three RRR linkages. Each of the three RRR linkages uses three circular profile flexure hinges. Each flexure hinge provides predominantly rotational motion about one axis. This topology of mechanism has a symmetrical structure and provides numerous advantages that make it appropriate for use in a micro-motion stage. However, as yet this topology of compliant mechanism has only been investigated by a handful of researchers and it has not been used in any commercially developed systems. The design methodology of a stage using the 3RRR compliant mechanism has not been investigated in detail. In this thesis a study is presented that investigates different approaches to model the 3RRR compliant mechanism and also considers the piezo-actuator modelling, to give the complete XY&#952;z micro-motion stage. Three models are presented and compared; the Pseudo-Rigid-Body Model (PRBM); a two-dimensional Finite-Element-Model (2-D FEM); and a third model is developed that is similar to the PRBM, but uses analytical equations to model the multiple degree-of-freedom compliance of the flexure hinges. The models developed are then used in parametric study so that the relationship between design parameters and output behaviour can be understood. An optimal design approach is then presented to develop an XY&#952;z micro-motion stage for a particular application in a Scanning-Electron-Microscope (SEM). Finally experimental validation of the models is presented. The results of this study indicate which modelling approaches are accurate enough to prove useful for design, while also considering which models are computationally simple enough to be efficient and easy to use. The kinematic and dynamic behaviour of the 3RRR compliant mechanism and XY&#952;z micro-motion stage is discussed in detail. This includes; a comprehensive description of the stage workspace, defining reachable and constant-rotation workspace areas; a discussion of actuator coupling; and in depth investigation of the modes of vibration. The results of the parametric study provide useful insight to aid the design of the XYz micro-motion stage and help simplify optimal design. The parametric study also highlights the difference in trends predicted by different modelling methods, which demonstrates the importance of using an appropriate model in design. The experimental validation demonstrates the accuracy of some modelling approaches while highlighting the limited accuracy of others.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine design; manipulators (mechanism); mechanical movements; hinges; finite element method; micro-motion stage; XY&#952;z stage; compliant mechanism; 3RRR compliant mechanism; flexure hinge modelling; pseudo-rigid-body model</field><field name="subject">Manipulators (Mechanism).</field><field name="subject">Hinges -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Finite element method -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Machine design.</field><field name="subject">Mechanical movements.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny and evolution of Lerista (Lygosominae, Scincidae, Squamata).</field><field name="creator">Skinner, Adam</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I investigate the phylogeny and evolution of Lerista, a clade of more than 75 species of scincid lizards, distributed in arid, semi-arid, and seasonally dry habitats throughout Australia. Among extant tetrapods, Lerista is exceptional in comprising a large number of closely-related species displaying prodigious variability of body form; several species possessing well-developed, pentadactyl limbs resemble typical non-fossorial scincids in body proportions, while many other species exhibit varying degrees of limb reduction and body elongation, including two that are highly elongate and entirely limbless. The extensive variation in limb morphology observed among species, incorporating at least 20 distinct phalangeal configurations, has prompted some authors to identify Lerista as the best available model for studying limb reduction in squamates. Nonetheless, lack of a well-resolved phylogeny has impeded investigation of the pattern and mode of limb reduction and loss within the clade. The primary goal of my research was to furnish a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for Lerista, enabling more sophisticated study of the evolution of limb morphology and body form in this clade than has previously been possible. A recent phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences for a series of Australian Sphenomorphus group scincids (including two species of Lerista) recovered several well-supported, major clades, although these were generally separated by relatively short branches associated with low support values. Applying a recently described methodology for inferring lineage-level polytomies, I use ATP synthetase-&#946; subunit intron sequences and the existing mitochondrial DNA data set (with sequences for additional taxa) to assess the hypothesis that the poorly resolved basal relationships within the Australian Sphenomorphus group are a consequence of the major clades having originated essentially simultaneously. Phylogenetic analyses of the separate mitochondrial DNA and intron sequence data reveal a number of congruent clades, however, the relationships among these clades indicated by the two data sets are generally incongruent. Although this may be partly ascribed in to error in estimating phylogenetic relationships due to insufficient data, some incongruence is evident when uncertainty in inferred relationships is allowed for. Moreover, the congruent clades are typically separated by very short branches, several having a length insignificantly different from zero. These results suggest that initial diversification of Australian Sphenomorphus group scincids was rapid relative to the substitution rates of the mitochondrial DNA and intron fragments considered, if not essentially simultaneous. The pattern and rate of limb reduction in Lerista are investigated, employing a nearly complete phylogeny inferred from nucleotide sequences for a nuclear intron and six mitochondrial genes. Ancestral digit configurations reconstructed assuming this phylogeny indicate at least ten independent reductions in the number of digits from a pentadactyl condition, including four independent losses of all digits, three from pentadactyl or tetradactyl conditions. At the highest rate, complete loss of digits from a pentadactyl condition is estimated to have occurred within no more than 3.6 million years. Patterns of digit loss for the manus and pes are consistent with selection for preserving hindlimb utility as the limbs are reduced, and suggest that intermediate digit configurations exhibited by extant species do not represent transitory stages in a continuing process of limb reduction. An increase in the relative length of the body is demonstrated to precede digit loss in lineages experiencing substantial reduction of the limbs, supporting the hypothesis that limb reduction and loss is a consequence of the adoption of lateral undulation as a significant locomotory mode. However, less extensive limb reduction may proceed in the absence of body elongation, perhaps due to a decrease in absolute body size. The exceptionally high frequency and rate of limb reduction in Lerista emphasise the potential for rapid and dramatic evolutionary transformation of body form in squamates. The substantial divergence of relative limb and body length evident within Lerista is more readily explained by the correlated progression model of phenotypic transformation than the independent blocks model. At each step in the attainment of a limb-reduced, elongate body form, alterations to the relative length of the limbs are accompanied by changes in relative snout-vent length (or vice versa) enabling the maintenance of locomotory ability. Nonetheless, some dissociation of hindlimb reduction and body elongation is possible, emphasising the potentially variable intensity of functional constraints and, accordingly, that the independent blocks model and correlated progression are extremes of a continuum of models (each invoking a different degree of functional integration) and do not describe discrete categories of phenotypic change. An increase in the extent of seasonally dry and arid habitats coincident with the origination of Lerista would have facilitated limb reduction and body elongation by furnishing an environment conducive to the adoption of fossorial habits, however, trends toward a limbless, highly elongate body form may be attributed primarily to the very low probability of re-elaborating reduced limbs. Such asymmetry in the probabilities of possible phenotypic changes may be a significant cause of evolutionary trends resulting in the emergence of higher taxa.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phylogeny; evolution; Lerista; skink; lizard</field><field name="subject">Skinks -- Classification.</field><field name="subject">Skinks -- Phylogeny.</field><field name="subject">Lizards -- Classification.</field><field name="subject">Lizards -- Phylogeny.</field><field name="subject">Lygosoma -- Classification.</field><field name="subject">Lygosoma -- Phylogeny.</field><field name="subject">Squamata -- Classification.</field><field name="subject">Squamata -- Phylogeny.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rainfall regime and optimal root distribution in the Australian perennial grass, Austrodanthonia caespitosa (Gaudich.)</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Grant James</field><field name="description">This study aimed to determine whether rainfall regime has driven differentiation in the Australian perennial grass, Austrodanthonia caespitosa, resulting in local ecotypes possessing characters, such as deep rootedness or summer activity, that may be particularly useful in reducing deep drainage for salinity mitigation, or whether the species shows a plastic response in root growth to soil water distribution. Rainfall regime varies within a given annual rainfall because size and ditribution of rainfall event vary. This can have an important effect on soil water distribution, both spatially and temporally. This study investigates the relationship between rainfall regime and the structure of root systems in local populations of Austrodanthonia caespitosa (Gaudich.), Firstly, it examined a number of indices useful in quantifying variation in small-scale rainfall regime, including seasonal bias, event size, event frequency, and the clustering of events, as well as how rainfall event size may be changing over time across Australia. The variation in soil water distribution that results from different rainfall regimes is expected to interact with root distribution in plants, either acting as a selective force and driving genotypic differentiation in response to soil water availability, or through plasticity in root placement. The relationship between rainfall regime and root depth distribution was examined in Austrodanthonia caespitosa (Gaudich.), or white-top wallaby grass, a perennial grass common across southern Australia. Growth and reproductive traits of plants grown from seeds collected from across the range of this species under a single rainfall regime were compared and correlated with the rainfall indices and soil type in order to establish possible abiotic explanations for trait variability. Phenological characters were found to be particularly variable between ecotypes, but high local variation between ecotypes suggested factors operating on a spatial scale smaller than the rainfall gradients are responsible for population differentiation. In order to investigate the interaction between rainfall event size and root depth, an experiment was conducted to investigate plant response to watering pulse size and frequency, with plants grown under a range of controlled watering regimes, and root depth distribution compared. The primary response in root growth was plastic, with shallow roots being developed under small, frequent events, and deep roots developed under large, infrequent waterings. Differences between ecotypes were less important, and there was no interaction between ecotype and watering treatment, indicating the same degree of plasticity in all ecotypes. Plants from a range of populations were grown under a controlled climate, first under winter conditions, then under summer conditions, with summer water withheld from half the plants, in order to determine the response to summer watering and summer drought. Plants that were watered over summer showed a strong growth response, increasing shoot biomass significantly. This effect was particularly strong in South Australian populations, which was unexpected as they originate from a region with low, unpredictable summer rainfall. Root depth was not strongly influenced by summer watering treatment. Finally, an evolutionary algorithm model was constructed in order to examine optimal plant traits under a variety of rainfall regimes. The model highlighted the importance of the interaction between rainfall regime and soil type in determining optimal root placement. Variable root cost with depth was also found to be an important trade-off to be considered, with high root loss in the surface soil layers, due to high temperatures, making a shallow rooted strategy less efficient than if root costs were equal throughout the root system. Overall, no ecotypes of A.caespitosa could be identified that had characters particularly suited to deep drainage reduction, as the drought tolerant nature of the species, and the dormancy during times of drought, may lead to low overall water use. However, it may be a useful native component in pasture systems, due to its strong growth response to summer rainfall, a characteristic found to be particularly strong in a number of South Australian ecotypes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia; climate; weather; rain; precipitation; grass; wallaby grass; evolutionary algorithm modelling</field><field name="subject">Grasses Australia.</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall Australia.</field><field name="subject">Plant ecology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patient falls in acute care inpatient hospitals : a portfolio of research related to strategies in reducing falls.</field><field name="creator">Ang, Neo Kim Emily</field><field name="description">Despite a myriad of studies on fall prevention, patient falls continue to be a longterm problem experienced by health care organisations world-wide. Falls impose a heavy burden in terms of social, medical, and financial outcomes, and continue to pose a threat to patient safety. Because the potential for a fall is a constant clinical safety issue in every health care organisation, protecting the patient from falls and subsequent injuries, and ensuring that the patient care environment facilitates, are fundamental aspects in providing quality care. Moreover, the current international focus on creating a culture of quality care and patient safety requires the implementation of fall prevention programs that decrease the risk of falls. As with other international health care organisations, the National University Hospital (where the principal investigator is working), has been challenged with the issue of how to prioritise and implement quality initiatives across all disciplines. Faced with persistent patient falls that affect care outcomes, fall prevention has been a priority initiative at the hospital since 2003. In response, a nursing task force was established in an attempt to resolve this problem. A root cause analysis undertaken by this task force revealed that the hospital protocol on fall prevention was outdated and not evidence-based. Furthermore, many nurses did not understand the importance of fall prevention, while the administration of the fall prevention program was instituted on an ad hoc basis rather than as a standard of care for all patients. The challenge for this task force, as with other health care professionals, was not only in finding an intervention that was effective, but also identifying who would benefit from its implementation. Although the need to apply current best practices to reduce patient falls is clear from the task force results, evidence of the effectiveness of fall prevention interventions in acute care hospitals is lacking in literature. In addition, there are no published studies on fall prevention in Singapore to support changes in nursing practices. Thus, it becomes apparent that research on fall prevention is greatly needed in Singapore so that an evidence-based fall prevention program can be developed. This topic coincides with the Doctor of Nursing course, which requires the student to gain knowledge through scholarly research on contemporary issues in nursing by undertaking two separate projects related to a single area of interest. Undertaking the two research projects on fall prevention in an acute care inpatient hospital as part of the doctoral studies provided an opportunity to address this deficit in a way that could raise awareness of the importance of fall prevention in Singapore hospitals. This research also provides a platform for the first body of research into fall prevention to be conducted within the Singapore health care environment, which is essential, as international studies are not always necessarily applicable to the Singapore context due to differences in educational preparation, skills-mix, organisational culture and nursing practices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patient falls; acute care; inpatient hospitals</field><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents ) Singapore Prevention.

This is done by advancing the current mathematical characterisation of the solution to the Daley-Kendall model of the simple S-I-R rumour to a physical solution of the sub-population distribution over time of the generalised simple stochastic spreading process in social situations. After discussing stochastic spreading processes in social situations such as the simple epidemic, the simple rumour, the spread of innovations and ad hoc communications networks, it uses the three sub-population simple rumour to develop the theory for the identification of the exact sub-population distribution over time. This is done by identifying the generalised form of the Laplace Transform Characterisation of the solution to the three sub-population single rumour process and the inverse Laplace Transform of this characterisation. In this discussion the concept of the Inter-Changeability Principle is introduced. The general theory is validated for the three population Daley-Kendall Rumour Model and results for the three, five and seven population Daley-Kendall Rumour Models are pre- sented and discussed. The &#945; - p model results for pseudo-Maki-Thompson Models are presented and discussed. In subsequent discussion it presents for the first time a statement of the Threshold Problem for Stochastic Spreading Processes in Social settings as well as stating the associated Threshold Theorem. It also investigates limiting conditions. Aspects of future research resulting from the extension of the three subpopulation model to more than three subpopulations are discussed at the end of the thesis. The computational demands of applying the theory to more than three subpopulations are restrictive; the size of the total population that can be considered at one time is considerably reduced. To retain the ability to compute a large population size, with an increase in the number of possible subpopulations, a possible method of repeated application of the three population solution is identified. This is done through the medium of two competing mutually exclusive rumours. The final discussion occurs on future investigation into the existence of limit values, zero states, cyclic states and absorbing states for the M subpopulation case. The generalisation and inversion of the Laplace Transform as well as the consequential statement of the threshold theorem, derivation of the transition probabilities and discussion of the limiting conditions are significant advances in the theory of rumours and similar social phenomena.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rumours; rumors; contagion; spread of rumors; spread of rumours; emotional contagion; innovation diffusion; epidemics; ad hoc networks</field><field name="subject">Rumor.

As a result of an increasing interest in natural/herbal medicines, more effort is now needed to produce herbal products of better quality, i.e. higher and standardised phytochemical concentrations. Thus, it was hypothesised that the naturally occurring AM fungi (AMF) could play an important role in improving the growth and phytochemical concentrations in medicinal herbs such as basil, as organic methods of cultivation are increasingly sought after to grow such plants. Despite a reasonable amount of information available in the literature on the changes of phytochemical concentrations in the roots of host plants following AM colonisation, very little is known about such processes in the aerial part of such plants. Furthermore, basil has hardly been studied as a host plant in AM research, and very little is known of its responsiveness to AM colonisation. As AMF are well known to improve phosphorus (P) uptake in their host plant, the first objective of this work was to obtain AM and non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants matched for tissue P concentrations and growth rates. Only under such conditions would it then be possible to separate benefits derived from improved plant P uptake from non-nutritional benefits. It was found that basil is highly responsive to P, and that under low or little P supply it is quite dependent on the AM symbiosis in order to grow. However, growth depressions were observed when growing basil in winter with Glomus intraradices, suggesting that the fungal symbiont can act as a strong sink of carbon (C) under such conditions. Thus, in order to obtain AM and NM plants with matched growth rates and tissue P concentrations, it was found that basil needed to be cultivated in summer in a soil/sand mixture with a ratio of 1:3 (w/w), along with 0.2 g/kg CaHPO4 and 25% of AM inoculum (AM plants). Under these conditions, AM plants grew as well as NM plants and G. caledonium and G. mosseae were shown to increase the concentrations of RA and CA in the shoots of basil, but not in roots. Such results were not an indirect effect of improved P uptake. In order to understand the mechanisms by which AMF increased RA and CA concentrations in basil, further experiments were set up to investigate the effect of 1) AM developmental stages, 2) nitrogen (N) supply and 3) phytohormone changes on the production of RA and CA in the shoots. None of these factors was found to contribute to increases in antioxidants in basil under AM symbiosis. Therefore, the mechanisms by which AMF affect RA and CA concentrations in basil still remain unknown. A final experiment was carried out to investigate the potential of an AM fungus to improve the growth of basil when challenged with a specific pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. basilici (Fob), which causes significant production losses. The results showed that inoculation of basil with G. mosseae not only improved plant growth compared to NM plants, but also conferred a protective effect against Fob. However, shoot antioxidant concentrations (RA, CA, total phenolics and essential oils) were not increased in AM plants compared to NM plants, and the mechanism of protection against Fob could not be elucidated. Due to the high variability of RA and CA concentrations obtained in AM plants in different experiments, it cannot be concluded that AMF confer an absolute advantage over uninoculated plants if the main concern is to obtain standardised concentrations of phytochemical in basil. On the other hand, the key results presented in this thesis do indicate that inoculating basil with AMF can be beneficial to improve its growth as well as antioxidant concentrations, compared to NM plants grown under similar conditions. Such results could be of potential interest to basil growers who wish to cultivate this medicinal herb organically (i.e. low P supply and no chemical fertilisers added).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arbuscular mycorrhizas; basil; phytochemicals; plant physiology</field><field name="subject">Mycorrhizas.</field><field name="subject">Basil.</field><field name="subject">Phytochemicals.</field><field name="subject">Botanical chemistry.</field><field name="subject">Plant physiology.</field><field name="subject">Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alimentary tract mucositis: NF-kB and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tissues and serum following chemotherapy.</field><field name="creator">Logan, Richard M.</field><field name="description">Mucositis refers to the widespread damage of mucosal surfaces throughout the length of the alimentary tract (AT) that can occur during cancer treatment. Its development is an important clinical problem that complicates and limits treatment options as well as adversely affecting the quality of life and treatment outcomes for patients. Recent studies directed at determining the pathobiology of mucositis have indicated increasing evidence for the role of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B), and certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1&#946; (IL-1&#946;) and interleukin- 6 (IL-6), in its development. This thesis developed from an initial clinical investigation in which the expression of NF-&#954;B and COX-2 in oral mucosa was investigated in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Increased levels of NF-&#954;B were demonstrated in the buccal mucosa following chemotherapy. It is well established that mucositis occurs in different sites of the AT. The aims of this research, therefore, were to compare and contrast the changes that do occur at different sites of the AT following chemotherapy in an established animal model (Dark Agouti (DA) rat). Furthermore, the studies were conducted to determine whether changes in tissue and serum levels of NF-&#954;B and pro-inflammatory cytokines occurred following chemotherapy and, with respect to tissue levels, identify whether there were differences in expression at different sites throughout the AT. The final aim was to examine whether the histological changes and changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines were affected by the type of chemotherapy drug used. The effects of three chemotherapy drugs with different mechanisms of action (irinotecan, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) were investigated, all of which can cause mucositis in the clinical setting. The thesis is divided into a Literature Review (Chapter 1) followed by 4 research papers: Chapter 2 &#8211; &#8220;Nuclear factor- &#954;B (NF- &#954;B) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the oral mucosa following cancer chemotherapy&#8221; Chapter 3 -&#8220;Characterisation of mucosal changes in the alimentary tract following administration of irinotecan: Implications for the pathobiology of mucositis&#8221; Chapter 4 &#8211; &#8220;Is the pathobiology of chemotherapy-induced alimentary tract mucositis influenced by the type of mucotoxic drug administered?&#8221;, Chapter 5 &#8211; &#8220;Serum levels of NF-&#954;B and pro-inflammatory cytokines following administration of mucotoxic drugs&#8221;. Chapter 6 provides an overall summary and discussion of the results. Previous research has indicated that following administration of chemotherapeutic agents there may be subclinical changes occurring in the mucosa prior to obvious clinical manifestations. The results presented in this thesis also demonstrate this in both humans and animals following administration of chemotherapy. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue taken from the oral cavity, jejunum and colon from the DA rats following chemotherapy demonstrated that changes in NF-&#954;B and the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF, IL-1&#946; and IL- 6, occurred at all sites over a 72 hour time period. This was evident before severe histological evidence of mucositis were observed such as epithelial atrophy in the oral mucosa, atrophy, blunting and fusion of the villi in the jejunum and crypt ablation in the jejunum and colon. Furthermore, each of the three drugs caused different patterns of NF-&#954;B and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the tissues; in spite of this, however, histological features of damage were similar. With respect to serum levels of NF-&#954;B and pro-inflammatory cytokines, differences were observed between the serum and tissue levels. Generally, serum changes followed initial histological changes in the tissues, or occurred simultaneously with histological changes. The mechanisms behind this are unclear; however it may be that elevated cytokines in the tissues &#8220;overflow&#8221; into the serum as tissue damage increases. Furthermore, the use of serum cytokine level measurement to predict mucosal damage is limited because of the differences in timing and short time intervals between changes in the serum and tissues. This thesis has provided additional important information on mucositis pathobiology and highlights its complexity. In particular, it has provided new evidence supporting the notion that mucositis is not restricted to the oral cavity and that other sites of the AT are also affected. Furthermore, these results confirm previous data indicating that subclinical changes occur in the mucosa prior to the development of obvious histological damage or clinical manifestations of mucositis. Contrary to previous reports, these studies have indicated that, although the clinical and histological changes may be similar, the alterations in NF-&#954;B and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tissues are affected by the type of drug used. This has important implications in the management and prevention of mucositis in the clinical setting particularly when multi-drug or chemotherapy-radiotherapy regimens are used. A common pathway that leads to mucosal damage is yet to be determined. The fact that serum levels appear to reflect the &#8220;global&#8221; nature of the effects of chemotherapy, highlights the fact that ongoing research needs to be directed, not necessarily at specific side effects, but rather how side effects of chemotherapy are interrelated so that better patient management can be achieved and ultimately provide optimum treatment and better survival for patients with cancer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mucositis; pro-inflammatory cytokines; chemotherapy, NF-KB</field><field name="subject">Alimentary canal Cancer</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="subject">Chemotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of markers associated with systemic inflammation in children with Chronic Kidney Disease.</field><field name="creator">Nairn, Judith</field><field name="description">Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition that in the majority of cases leads to End Stage Renal Failure (ESRD) and the need for dialysis, with the only cure being renal transplant. CKD affects both adults and children; however the underlying causes of the disease are different. CKD in adults is most commonly secondary to diabetes and/or hypertension while CKD in children is usually caused by congenital structural abnormalities that result directly in renal dysfunction. There have been numerous reports of inflammatory and immunological disturbances in adult CKD that involve both the cellular and humoral immune systems. Consequences of these include an increased rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD), decreased response to vaccinations, as well as increased rates of infection, anaemia and malnutrition. Children with CKD display many of the clinical complications seen in adult kidney disease that are associated with inflammatory and immunological changes. In adults however, many of the primary conditions associated with CKD are inherently pro-inflammatory; therefore it is not clear whether the inflammatory changes observed in adults with CKD are due to pre-existing inflammatory conditions, renal disease per se or a combination of both. The majority of CKD in children is caused by conditions that are not inflammatory in nature. This presents a unique opportunity to study the inflammatory consequences of CKD alone, without the added complication of underlying inflammatory disorders. Despite this, there has been little investigation of the inflammatory and immunological status of children with CKD. Some very recent studies have shown that children with CKD have an increased systemic inflammatory state[1-3], however the nature of these immunological and inflammatory changes remains poorly defined. Identification of the specific inflammatory processes that occur in CKD may provide new treatment targets and the opportunity to develop urgently needed new therapies. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the presence of immunological changes associated with inflammation in children with CKD. This is the first study to include children with very mild disease, and the significant changes that are present in the early stages of the disease are of particular note. I have shown that CKD in children is an intrinsically inflammatory condition, with increased accumulation of markers of oxidative stress and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The inflammatory markers identified in this study may be applied as a foundation for more sensitive diagnostic markers of disease progression as well as provide a basis for novel treatment strategies in this group of patients. Early identification of increased inflammation is a prerequisite for the application of preventive strategies. In addition, a better understanding of the level and mechanisms of systemic inflammation in children with CKD may enable a more accurate assessment of their risk of other inflammatory conditions such as CVD, anaemia, muscle wasting, and malnutrition. Future research that specifically focuses on the reasons and mechanisms for different rates of disease progression may emerge as a result of this study. Importantly, the findings of this study may have implications in the long term treatment of disease and may allow identification of new treatment strategies to achieve better patient outcomes. The outcomes of the study are: &#8226; Better definition of inflammatory profiles in paediatric CKD and correlation with disease severity and progression, which should contribute to improved management strategies. &#8226; Identification of new treatment targets to reduce the damage caused by chronic systemic inflammation. &#8226; Mechanistic understanding of the relationship of the inflammatory profile in regard to source leucocytes or other contributing cell types.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children; chronic kidney disease; inflammation; cytokines; T cells</field><field name="subject">Kidney disease.</field><field name="subject">Pediatric nephrology.</field><field name="subject">Cytokines.</field><field name="subject">T cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The future of radiofrequency ablation is looking BETA : short and long term studies of bimodal electric tissue ablation (BETA) in a porcine model.</field><field name="creator">Dobbins, Christopher</field><field name="description">Introduction: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a popular method of treating unresectable liver tumours by the use of a high frequency, alternating electrical current that heats and destroys tumour cells. The size of the ablation is limited by localised charring of adjacent tissue that prevents further conduction of the radiofrequency current. In the clinical setting, this results in increased rates of local recurrence in tumours that are greater than 3 cm in diameter as multiple, overlapping ablations need to be performed to treat the one tumour. To overcome this problem, a modified form of RFA called Bimodal Electric Tissue Ablation (BETA) has been created. BETA adds a direct electrical current to the alternating radiofrequency current, thus establishing its bimodal character. When direct currents are used in biological tissues, water is transferred from anode to cathode by a process called electro-osmosis. By attaching the cathode to the radiofrequency electrode, water is attracted to the area thus preventing tissue desiccation and charring. The BETA circuit has been constructed and tested using a porcine model. The aims of the studies are to confirm that larger ablations can be produced with the BETA system and that it is safe to use in an animal model. Three studies have been performed to test these aims in porcine liver. Methods: The first study was designed to compare sizes of the ablation produced between standard RFA and the BETA circuit. This was followed by a long-term study to assess associated changes to liver function and pathological changes within the liver as well as identifying any other treatment related morbidity. The third study assessed the difference in ablation size and safety aspects when the positive electrode of the direct current circuitry was moved from small surface area under the skin to a large surface area on the skin. Results: Ablations with significantly larger diameters are created with the BETA circuit using a multi-tine needle (49.55 mm versus 27.78 mm, p&lt;0.001). This finding was confirmed in the third experiment using a straight needle (25 mm versus 15.33 mm, p&lt;0.001). Ablations produced by the BETA circuit induce coagulative necrosis within the treated liver and the injury heals by fibrosis in a manner similar to other thermal therapies. Significant rises in some serum liver enzymes are seen within 24 hours of treatment but these return to normal within 4 days. An electrolytic type injury can be produced at the site of the positive electrode. By increasing the surface area of this electrode, the risk of tissue damage is decreased but ablations are significantly smaller (18 mm versus 25 mm, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: The BETA circuit consistently produces significantly larger ablations than RFA. The treatment appears safe but positioning of the positive electrode of the direct current requires careful consideration. Injuries produced behave like other thermal therapies with coagulative necrosis followed by fibrotic healing. As larger ablations are consistently produced, it is hypothesised that with further refinements, tumours greater than 3 cm in diameter could be treated with lower rates of recurrence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiofrequency ablation; RFA; liver tumours; liver treatment; bimodal electric tissue ablation</field><field name="subject">Catheter ablation</field><field name="subject">Liver--Tumors--Treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reframing futoko (school non-attendance) in Japan: a social movement perspective.</field><field name="creator">Wong, So Fei</field><field name="description">This thesis examines fut&#333;k&#333; (school non-attendance) in Japan from the perspective that fut&#333;k&#333; is a social movement. It analyses citizens&#8217; activism in support of fut&#333;k&#333; students over the twenty year period from 1984. Drawing upon social movement approaches the thesis examines how fut&#333;k&#333; citizens successfully grasped political opportunities, established a network of organizations, launched a new interpretive frame for fut&#333;k&#333;, and challenged the dominant representation of fut&#333;k&#333; in society &#8211;that 'fut&#333;k&#333; is an illness&#8217;. To explore in detail the ideological aspect of the fut&#333;k&#333; movement&#8217;s framing, a content analysis of 140 editorials in the movement newspaper &#8211; the Fut&#333;k&#333; Shimbun (School Non-attendance Newspaper) was conducted. Commencing with a critique of schooling practices that create fut&#333;k&#333;, over the survey period Fut&#333;k&#333; Shimbun expands its analysis to develop a critical appraisal of Japanese society that has broad implications for many different aspects of the everyday life of its citizens. Adopting the typology of movement outcomes, this thesis assesses the outcomes of fut&#333;k&#333; movement framing through two sets of factors: first, changes in government policies and attitudes and second, cultural and ideational changes as experienced by the movement organizations, fut&#333;k&#333; activists and children, and as represented in shifts in media representation of fut&#333;k&#333;. Government policies in the handling of fut&#333;k&#333; students have become more flexible although not always positive, while government interactions with the movement are suggestive of recognition that fut&#333;k&#333; citizens are valid spokespersons with a legitimate set of interests in relation to fut&#333;k&#333; children. Fut&#333;k&#333; movement activists have been successful in framing their movement in terms of: expanding and increasingly sophisticated networks of fut&#333;k&#333; movement organizations; the professional development of activists; and a more positive media discourse. The thesis concludes that the fut&#333;k&#333; movement has influenced government policies, the media and wider social commentary about the phenomenon of and responses to fut&#333;k&#333;. The thesis contends that the social movement perspective enables us to understand the issue of fut&#333;k&#333; beyond the educational context, in its wider social, cultural and political contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social movement; framing; civil society; Japanese education; fut&#333;k&#333;; school non-attendance</field><field name="subject">School phobia Japan.</field><field name="subject">Social phobia Japan.</field><field name="subject">School psychology Japan.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the Fergusonina fly and Fergusobia nematode gall association in South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Head, Elise</field><field name="description">Attempts were made to grow Fergusobia nematodes in a dual aseptic culture with Eucalyptus camaldulensis. Callus tissue was grown from E. camaldulensis stem pieces in aseptic conditions. Calli were prone to deterioration after 14 days unless transferred to fresh growth medium. Lower levels of solutes (25% Murashige and Skoog salts, 25% plant vitamins and 0.5% sucrose) were more successful than published concentrations. Fergusobia J2 nematodes were surface sterilised with either Hibitane or washed with water to prepare them for inoculation of callus (Hay, 1994). Fergusobia subsequently recovered from plates of callus were all dead, which raised questions of how the nematodes are suited to Murashige and Skoog salt solutions. The survival of Fergusobia in aqueous solutions was then observed. It has been assumed that Fergusobia live about 2 days after dissection. Amphimictic nematodes from E. camaldulensis axial bud galls were used for a survival study. Nematodes lived for as long as 12 days in fresh tap water and 11 days in 1% M.S. solution. They were more active in tap water than in 1% M.S. solution. Nematodes in a dish together with dissected gall material died within 2 days. Nematodes in a separate dish with fresh tap water and clean gall fibres were observed to gather around the fibres. Observations of Fergusobia could be made within fresh solutions providing deteriorating gall tissues were removed from the dish. Gall production was attempted on E. camaldulensis grown in the glasshouse. These tree saplings were pruned to encourage new growth and periodically treated for infestations of scale insects leading to growth of sooty mould. Two forms of cage construction were used: (1) 1 m &#179; screened cages and (2) acetate sleeves as used by Goolsby et al., 2000. Within the 1 m &#179; cages containing flies, the growing points on saplings were blackened, possibly due to over-exploitation by ovipositing flies. One growing point caged in an acetate sleeve showed oviposition scars but did not produce a mature gall. Production of galls in the glasshouse was hindered by a lack in coincidence of flies emerging from mature galls and the flush of new growth following pruning. The production of galls within the glasshouse was not achieved. The phenology of E. camaldulensis, a host for the Fergusonina/Fergusobia mutualism, and gall ecology were observed in a two-year, non-destructive, field study in the Urrbrae Wetlands, Adelaide, South Australia. Tree growth and gall development was observed in the lower regions (0 &#8211; 2 m) of young trees. Three bud forms, terminal leaf bud, axial leaf bud and flower bud galls were monitored on the trees. The densities of galls were highly seasonal. Greatest density of growing points, axial leaf bud and flower bud galls occurred mostly during mid-winter to spring, whereas that of terminal leaf bud galls occurred during mid-spring to summer. Galling of flower buds did not appear to influence flowering and more flower buds and flowers occurred in the second year of the study as the trees matured. Trees mostly had medium (30-70%) levels of leaf damage, but there were seasonal trends in damage levels. Low scores for leaf damage were associated with increases in flower bud and flower production. Leaf damage, including sooty mould, appeared to increase during the cooler winter months. There were no significant seasonal relationships between levels of leaf damage and either growing point density or the occurrence of galls. When trees were compared with each other, those with lower leaf damage were more likely to have more growing points. The appearance of the canopy and the likelihood of a tree to have galls varied greatly between the trees. One tree was particularly susceptible to leaf attack, rarely had new leaves and produced no mature galls during the study. The colouring of leaves varied between trees, which indicates possible genetic variations causing some trees to be more likely hosts for Fergusonina/Fergusobia. Both new vegetative growth and terminal leaf bud galls were concentrated on the northern and eastern quadrants. Axial leaf bud and flower bud galls occurred more on the western or southern quadrants where they were possibly more protected from sun exposure on the northern or eastern quadrants. Axial galls on the northern side of one tree became reddened while those in the southern and western quadrants remained green. Reddening of axial galls may increase their likelihood of parasitism and predation by birds. Each of the three gall forms occurred within certain positions in the canopy. The tree host resource is partitioned effectively, with the three gall forms occurring on three different host structures. Additionally, the two vegetative forms terminal leaf bud and axial leaf bud galls occur on different shoot regions and in different seasons. The numbers of the galls is probably also affected by biotic and climatic influences. Parasitism, plant canopy shading, nutrient levels and host genetics are possible influences. Assuming an interval of 4 weeks between oviposition and first observation within the current study, terminal leaf bud galls had an average longevity of 11 weeks and axial leaf bud galls an average longevity of 14 weeks. Flower bud galls had longevities of 14 to 27 weeks from oviposition to senescence, assuming an interval of 6 weeks between oviposition and first observation within the current study. Flowers and flower buds occur irregularly within the eucalypts so it would be advantageous for flies and nematodes developing within flower bud galls to have extended or variable longevities to allow fly emergences to coincide with new flower buds. Not all of the galls recorded matured to produce adult flies. Nearly half of the terminal leaf bud galls initiated were aborted, recorded as absent, parasitised or eaten (45% of initiated galls). Of the three gall forms, they were the most prone to obvious parasitism and as many as 12 hymenopteran species have been reared from terminal leaf bud galls on E. camaldulensis (Taylor et al., 1996). These galls obviously provide a resource for many species within multiple trophic levels. Fourteen percent of axial leaf bud galls were absent or eaten and birds were seen breaking off and feeding on the galls. More than half (55%) of the initiated flower bud galls disappeared during the period of observation, possibly due to the foraging of birds. Destructive sampling and rearing out of parasitoids from both axial leaf bud and flower bud gall forms is needed to establish what species exist within them. Terminal leaf bud galls ranged from 7.5 to 30.1 mm in diameter and 10.0 to 43.6 mm in length. Flower bud gall size varied, with the largest being 15.0 mm by 22.3 mm. Axial leaf bud galls, ranged from 2.6 to 13.0 mm in diameter and length ranged from 2.3 to 10.5 mm. The larger axial leaf bud galls were nodular and appeared to have multiple locules. Destructive sampling and rearing out of flies is needed to establish the relationship between size and numbers of flies emerging. Terminal leaf bud galls increased in size, including many locules and exit holes per gall. Axial leaf bud galls were much smaller than the terminal leaf bud galls and 99% had only one to three exit holes. The rounded shape and presence of few locules within the axial leaf bud galls indicate that this form is limited to a shape and size producing few flies. The observation of greater size of terminal leaf bud galls suggests that these galls may have multiple foundresses. Twelve of the 13 flower bud galls with exit holes had either one or two holes. In flower bud galls on E. camaldulensis. the operculum remains sealed and the characteristic Fergusonina &#8220;window&#8221; appears at the side of the flower bud before fly emergence through a single hole. Destructive sampling is also necessary to determine parasitism of each of the gall forms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nematode; fly; gall; ecology</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus camaldulensis--Diseases and pests--South Australia</field><field name="subject">Nematoda.</field><field name="subject">Galls (Botany)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Containment and engagement: U.S. China policy in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.</field><field name="creator">Turner, Sean Matthew</field><field name="description">This study argues that despite the basic inertia in U.S. China policy during the Kennedy and Johnson years, the period nonetheless witnessed a fundamental evolution in the strategic presumptions underlying Washington&#8217;s approach to the China &#8220;problem.&#8221; By increments, U.S. policymakers began to seriously question the wisdom of a policy predicated on the idea that the containment of the People&#8217;s Republic of China necessitated its political and economic isolation. Inversely, a basic consensus emerged in interested corners of the U.S. foreign policy bureaucracy that considered attempts to engage the Chinese&#8212;on levels bilateral and multilateral, official and unofficial&#8212;could serve to socialise China&#8217;s revolutionaries, thereby facilitating a reduction in Sino-American tensions and paving the way to a bilateral rapprochement. Critically, in this analysis &#8220;engagement&#8221; was seen as a means of enhancing, rather than simply supplanting, the larger effort to contain China. The dynamics involved in the emergence of this consensus are manifold and complex, and cannot be properly understood without close reference to changes in both the international strategic environment and the domestic political context through the 1960s. At the heart of this process, however, were advocates of policy moderation within the U.S. bureaucracy, mediating external pressures for policy movement, and championing the case for a more conciliatory approach to Sino-American relations. The growing acceptance of what was sometimes articulated as &#8220;containment without isolation&#8221;&#8212;shorthand for a policy framework that implicitly rejects the either/or choice between containment and engagement&#8212;found expression in, and was in turn fostered by, basic adjustments in Washington&#8217;s posture toward Mao&#8217;s China. By the end of 1968 senior U.S. officials had repeatedly signalled that Washington was reconciled to the reality of a Communist-controlled mainland China, and would in fact welcome expanded efforts toward bilateral accommodation and even cooperation. These postural shifts may not have been matched by concrete policy changes, yet they remain significant. In the most immediate sense, the less provocative posture toward China enhanced Washington&#8217;s capacity to communicate U.S. intent to China&#8217;s leadership, thereby helping avert a direct Sino-American conflict in the 1960s, even as the two sides pursued antithetical objectives in the Asian region. In a longer-term frame of reference, the more flexible posture adopted in the 1960s played an important role in challenging the domestic politicisation of China policy, while establishing a rhetorical framework and conceptual foundation for more substantive policy movement. In the course of tracing these developments, this study also provides new interpretative insights on a number of specific issues pertaining to U.S. China policy in the Kennedy and Johnson years, including the policy preferences, relationships, and roles of key U.S. officials in shaping the policy process; the impact of domestic politics, alliance politics, and various Cold War strategic concerns on policy outcomes; the question of how to deal with China&#8217;s nuclear development; and the manner in which major China-related events and developments in the 1960s&#8212;such as the failure of Mao&#8217;s Great Leap Forward, the 1962 Taiwan Strait crisis, the Sino-Indian border war, China&#8217;s involvement in Vietnam, and the Cultural Revolution&#8212; were interpreted by U.S. officials, and, in turn, shaped understandings of and responses to the China problem.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United States; China; foreign relations</field><field name="subject">Kennedy, John F.

The hypothesis of this thesis was that dietary fish oil and/or fibre influence the contractility of isolated intact sections of gut smooth muscle tissue from small animal models. Methodology was established to measure in vitro contractility of intact pieces of guinea pig ileum with the serosal side isolated from the lumen. It was demonstrated that four amino acid peptides from &#954;-casein (casoxins) applied to the lumen overcame morphine-induced inhibition of contraction. Using this established technology, the guinea pig was used to investigate the effects of dietary fibre and fish oil supplementation on gut in vitro contractility. In separate experiments, changes in sensitivity to electrically-driven and 8-iso-prostanglandin (PG)E&#8322;-induced contractility were demonstrated for dietary fibre and fish oil. A modified, isolated gut super-perfusion system was then established for the rat to validate these findings. It was subsequently shown that LC n-3 PUFA from dietary fish oil significantly increased maximal contraction in response to the G-protein coupled receptor modulators, acetylcholine and the eicosanoids PGE&#8322;, PGF&#8322;&#945;, 8-iso-PGE&#8322; and U-46619 in ileum but not colon, without changes in sensitivity (EC&#8325;&#8320;), when n-3 PUFA as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had been incorporated to a similar degree into the gut total phospholipid membrane pool. It was further established that the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) had a depressed prostanoid (PGE&#8322;and PGF&#8322;&#945;) response in the gut that could be restored by dietary fish oil supplementation (5% w/w of total diet) in the ileum but not the colon. Importantly, the muscarinic response in the colon of the SHR was increased by fish oil supplementation with DHA likely to be the active agent. Dietary fish oil dose experiments deduced differential increases in response occurred at fish oil concentrations of 1% for muscarinic and 2.5% (w/w) for prostanoid stimulators of the ileum with no difference in receptor-independent KCl-induced depolarization-driven contractility. Studies combining high amylose resistant starch (HAMS, 10% w/w) and fish oil (10% w/w) fed to young rats demonstrated a low prostanoid response that was enhanced by dietary fish oil but not resistant starch. There was however, an interactive effect of the HAMS and fish oil noted for the muscarinic-mimetic, carbachol. Generally, resistant starch increased the large bowel short chain fatty acid pool with a subsequent lower pH. Binding studies determined that while the total muscarinic receptor binding properties of an isolated ileal membrane fraction were not affected in mature rats by dietary fish oil, young rats had a different order of muscarinic receptor subtype response with a rank order potency of M&#8323; &gt; M&#8321; &gt; M&#8322; compared to mature animals of M&#8323; &gt; M&#8322; &gt; M&#8321; with fish oil altering the sensitivity of the M&#8321; receptor subtype in isolated carbachol-precontracted ileal tissue. In conclusion, experiments using the guinea pig and rat gut models demonstrated that dietary fish oil supplementation, and to a lesser degree fibre, increased receptor-driven contractility in normal and compromised SHR ileum and colon. Further, changes in responsiveness were demonstrated in the developing rat gut prostanoid and muscarinic receptor populations that could be altered by dietary fish oil. Preliminary evidence suggested that fish oil as DHA may alter receptor-driven gut contractility by mechanisms involving smooth muscle calcium modulation. Defining the role that dietary fibre and fish oil, and other nutrients, play in normal and diseased states of bowel health such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where contractility is compromised, are among the ongoing challenges.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dietary; fish oil; fibre; gut; smooth muscle; contractility</field><field name="subject">Fish oils Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Fiber in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">Smooth muscle</field><field name="subject">Muscle contraction Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure function studies of muscle-type CIC chloride channels.</field><field name="creator">Bennetts, Brett</field><field name="description">ClC proteins are chloride channels and transporters that are found in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell-types. The mammalian chloride channel ClC-1 is an important modulator of the electrical excitability of skeletal muscle. The Torpedo electric-organ chloride channel, ClC-0 is structurally and functionally similar to ClC- 1. These proteins are referred to as the muscle-type ClC channels. The present work identifies several functional differences between the muscle type channels, and explores the structural basis of these and other previously reported differences. First the temperature dependence of ClC-1 channels was quantified. These calculations revealed distinct contrasts to previously published measurements of ClC-0 temperature sensitivity, indicating differences between the channels in the structural rearrangements associated with channel gating. Next the effect of extracellular ion substitution on ClC-0 function was examined. These measurements suggested that occupancy of an anion binding-site on the extracellular side of the selectivity-filter stabilises the open state of the channel, and that the diameter of the channel pore increases during channel opening. Three-dimensional models of the muscle-type channels were constructed based on the atomic coordinates of prokaryotic homologues. Differences in selectivity between ClC-0 and ClC-1 could be rationalised, in part, by differences in the chemistry of the narrow constriction of the channel pore. The major structural divergence between the muscle-type channels occurs in the expansive intracellular carboxy terminus. Replacing this region of ClC-1 with the corresponding region from ClC-0 resulted in distinct changes in common gating of the channel. These experiments rigorously characterise the dependence of ClC-1 function on temperature and the effect of foreign anionic-substrates on ClC-0 function. The results identify important residues involved in ionic selectivity of the channels, and validate the use of high-resolution prokaryotic channel structures as a predictive tool for studying the muscle-type channels. They also demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal of the channels is an important determinant of common gating.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">physiology, ion-channel, neuroscience, biophysics</field><field name="subject">Chloride channels</field><field name="subject">Ion channels</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Substrate specificity of factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1).</field><field name="creator">Linke, Sarah</field><field name="description">To detect and respond to the detrimental situation of hypoxia, metazoan cells employ O&#8322;- sensing prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases which directly utilise O&#8322; to hydroxylate and regulate the Hypoxia Inducible transcription Factor-&#945; (HIF-&#945;). This thesis focuses upon the asparaginyl hydroxylase, &#8216;Factor Inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1), which represses HIF-&#945; in normoxia by asparaginyl hydroxylation of its C-terminal trans-Activation Domain (CAD). During hypoxia FIH-1 is inhibited, allowing non-hydroxylated HIF-&#945; to drive expression of over 70 target genes, leading to tissue and cellular changes that increase O&#8322; supply and reduce its consumption. This response is central to normal physiology and to the pathophysiology of diseases, including stroke and cancer. The pivotal role of FIH-1 in regulating these processes invites its characterisation, as a key cellular O&#8322;-sensor and therapeutic target. This thesis contributes important information by elucidating a novel FIH-1 substrate and by defining numerous FIH-1 substrate recognition determinants. The first aim was to investigate the cell-fate regulator Notch1 as a potential FIH-1 substrate, due to myriad reports of Notch/hypoxic crosstalk and the discovery by collaborators that FIH- 1 represses Notch1 activity. Mutagenesis, hydroxylation assays, affinity-purification and mass spectrometry techniques enabled definition of two asparaginyl hydroxylations of mouse Notch 1 ankyrin repeat domain (N1945 and N2012), performed by FIH-1 in vitro. These residues were likewise detected to be hydroxylated in mNotch1 expressed in mammalian cells. FIH-1 kinetic assays comparing mNotch1 ankyrin domain with the unstructured hHIF- 1&#945; CAD uncovered major distinctions between substrates; mNotch1 facilitated a 7-fold lower rate of cosubstrate turnover by FIH-1, but affinity was robust (&gt;10-fold higher). Interrogation of the structure/affinity correlate implies FIH-1 binds unstable ankyrins preferentially. Functionally, a non-catalytic mechanism of Notch1 repression by FIH-1 is supported. The second aim derived from literature analyses implicating threonine and RLL motifs in HIF-&#945; as critical hydroxylation determinants. T796 (hHIF-1&#945;) contacts FIH-1 and is a likely phospho-acceptor, thus a mimetic T796D mutant was generated and its hydroxylation kinetics compared with wildtype hHIF-1&#945; CAD. In vitro, the mutant exhibited a 6-fold greater apparent Km, explaining its constitutive activity in cell-based reporter assays, whereas wildtype hHIF-1&#945; CAD is hydroxylated and thus repressed in normoxia by FIH-1. This indicates that phosphorylation reduces hydroxylation by FIH-1 in vitro and in vivo. The RLL motif does not contact FIH-1 in vitro however RLL-AAA mutant HIF-&#945; proteins are constitutively active in normoxia, suggesting resilience to hydroxylation within cells. To reconcile these data I predicted that a cellular Factor X functionalises the RLL motif as an FIH-1 binding site. Reporter assays, in vitro kinetic assays and interaction assays +/- lysate confirmed this hypothesis and additionally showed the motif to increase HIF-&#945; protein turnover 8-fold. Numerous mechanisms for Factor X including nuclear export, posttranslational modifications of FIH-1 or HIF-&#945;, and involvement of small molecules, were experimentally examined, but deemed unlikely. Rather, the data imply Factor X to be a proteinaceous facilitator of a HIF-&#945;/FIH-1 complex, thus proteomic capture screens are underway. This research provides novel insight into FIH-1; its role in Notch/hypoxic crosstalk, its substrate recognition requirements, and its potential functions in cellular O&#8322;-sensing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydroxylase; hypoxia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of nutrition on postharvest quality and grey mould development in strawberries.</field><field name="creator">Naradisorn, Matchima</field><field name="description">Strawberries are an extremely perishable fruit mainly due to their soft texture and sensitivity to fungal infection. The fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea is responsible for grey mould on strawberries and is the main causal agent of postharvest decay and subsequent economic loss. As an alternative to fungicides, manipulation of plant nutrition, such as calcium and boron, has been suggested as a means of disease management. This project investigated the effects of calcium and boron application on fruit quality and grey mould development in strawberry. The effect of calcium on fruit quality, grey mould development and leaf blight in strawberry cultivars &#8216;Aromas&#8217; and &#8216;Selva&#8217; was investigated through preharvest and postharvest applications. To determine the effect of preharvest application, calcium sulphate in 0.25X strength Hoagland&#8217;s solution was applied at 0, 100, 300 and 500 ppm Ca through fertigation. Fully-ripened fruit were harvested and evaluated for postharvest quality at harvest and then after storage at 10&#8304;C, 90&#177;5% RH for 2 to 10 days. Although fruit firmness of both cultivars declined slightly during storage, this was not affected by preharvest calcium application. Similarly, preharvest calcium treatment had no effect on the external appearance, pH, soluble solids content (SSC) or titratable acidity (TA). No grey mould development was observed on fruit at harvest when flowers were inoculated with a conidia suspension of B. cinerea (10&#8308; conidia per mL). However, fruit harvested from plants that received calcium at any concentration had less incidence of grey mould during storage at 10&#8304;C, 90&#177;5% RH for 14 days than fruit harvested from plants that received no calcium for both cultivars. For &#8216;Aromas&#8217;, 79% and 51% of fruit, and for &#8216;Selva&#8217;, 69% and 43% of fruit, showed rot when treated with 0 and 500 ppm Ca, respectively. The shelf life of &#8216;Aromas&#8217; and &#8216;Selva&#8217; increased by about 8% when plants received 500 ppm Ca in comparison with plants that received 0 ppm Ca. After 7 days of incubation at 22 to 24&#8304;C, there was no difference between blight lesions on wound-inoculated detached leaves from different calcium treatments for either cultivar. However, the lesions on &#8216;Selva&#8217; were smaller than on &#8216;Aromas&#8217;. The calcium levels in leaves from plants that received calcium at any concentration were adequate for strawberry growing and significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than in leaves from plants that received 0 ppm Ca. However, calcium treatment did not ensure transfer of calcium to fruit tissues. Calcium lactate and calcium chloride were used as postharvest calcium treatments at 1500, 3000 and 4500 ppm Ca. Fruit of &#8216;Selva&#8217; were dipped in calcium solution for 5 min and wound-inoculated with B. cinerea (10&#8310; conidia per mL). Calcium lactate and calcium chloride at 3000 and 4500 ppm Ca, respectively, were most effective in delaying Botrytis rot development on &#8216;Selva&#8217; after 7 days of storage at 10&#8304;C, 90&#177;5% RH. Storage for least 24 h after calcium dips prior to inoculation was required to delay the development of fruit rot. Fruit harvested early in the season seemed to be less susceptible to grey mould than those harvested later. However, calcium treatment tended to be more effective when applied to late-season fruit. Preharvest boron treatment, applied as for calcium but at 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 ppm B, had no effect on fruit firmness of either cultivar. However, firmness of &#8216;Aromas&#8217; fruit was slightly greater than &#8216;Selva&#8217; fruit for all treatments. The amount of boron applied had no effect on the external appearance, pH, SSC or TA for either cultivar after storage of fruit for up to 10 days. Application of boron had no effect on fruit grey mould development in either cultivar. Furthermore, boron had minimal effect on the incidence of blight on woundinoculated detached leaves of &#8216;Aromas&#8217; 7 days after inoculation. However, blight lesion diameters on &#8216;Selva&#8217; leaves in the 1.0 ppm B treatment (8.0 mm) were significantly smaller (P &lt; 0.001) than in the 0 ppm B treatment (13.0 mm). Phytotoxicity was observed in boron treatments even at the level considered optimum for strawberry growing. Severity increased with increasing boron concentration but no consistent effect on flower death or flower abortion was observed. In conclusion, strawberry is sensitive to boron toxicity. Calcium may enhance fruit firmness and, consequently, delay grey mould development if calcium penetrates the fruit. Postharvest calcium treatment tended to be more effective in delaying development of grey mould when applied to late-season fruit. Calcium lactate is a potential alternative to calcium chloride for reducing decay caused by B. cinerea in strawberry without providing undesirable bitterness. This finding may provide a basis for application in industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">calcium; boron; Botrytis; postharvest; strawberry; grey mould</field><field name="subject">Strawberries Diseases and pests.

The establishment of these colonies in the 19th century, and all of the major events and decisions relating to them up to 1914, were based on solely commercial motivations. This thesis examines the circumstances leading to the founding of GNG and BNG. It analyses the impact of government decisions and the growth of capitalist enterprises in East New Guinea during its first 30 years (1884&#8211;1914). This thesis argues that both the German and British governments were reluctant to become involved in colonisation. In the context of the political pressures prevailing in Berlin and London respectively, both governments succumbed but insisted that the cost of administering and developing the colonies was to be borne by others. The establishment costs of GNG were accepted by the Neu Guinea Compagnie (NGC) until 1899. It was a haphazard and experimental undertaking which was expensive financially and in human life. When the German government assumed administrative and financial control in 1899 the development of GNG had generally progressed in line with Chancellor Bismarck&#8217;s view that Germany&#8217;s colonies should be treated as economic enterprises. This was despite the bureaucratic form of government NGC had established. In contrast, there were claims that BNG was to be established on defence strategic requirements and to protect the indigenous Papuan population from non-British influences. This was fallacious posturing by the Australian colonies in order to attain control over the entire eastern sector of New Guinea and adjacent islands. The objective of the Queensland sugar planters was to procure cheap labour and for Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria to prevent the setting up of competitive agricultural industries. After Britain acquired southeast New Guinea, and the recruitment of Papuan and Melanesian labour into Australia had been outlawed, BNG was left to the gold prospectors, with no sustainable plantation industry taking place until Australia assumed administrative control over the Territory in 1907. Neither colony had any military significance. Both colonies shared a common European morality in administration. By 1914 GNG had become a commercially viable enterprise; BNG, now Papua, had failed to take advantage of the 1902&#8211;1912 boom in tropical produce. Given their similar size and geography, the economic performance of the two colonies should also have been similar. That this did not occur is beyond dispute.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea Colonial influence.</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea Economic conditions.</field><field name="subject">Great Britain Colonies Administration.</field><field name="subject">Germany Colonies Administration.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gonadal steroids and cognitive functioning in middle-to-older aged males.</field><field name="creator">Martin, Donel McQuarrie</field><field name="description">The basis for sex differences in cognitive ability remains poorly defined and controversial both scientifically and politically. One of the biological hypotheses on sex differences, of particular relevance to this thesis, concerns the role of gonadal steroids, specifically testosterone (T) and oestrogen, and their relationship to individual differences in the performance of specific cognitive tasks. In addition, the role that age-related changes in these hormones play in relation to generalised and pathological cognitive ageing in males is studied. It is important to determine whether decreases in T levels that occur with ageing in males are associated with age-related decreases in cognitive performance because T levels can potentially be modified. Males have consistently been found to outperform females on measures of visuo-spatial function; performance on the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotation Test (MRT) shows the largest and most robust of sex differences. Gonadal steroids have both organisational and activational effects which contribute to both withinsex variability and between-sex differences in visuo-spatial cognition. As males age, endogenous plasma T levels decline gradually yet variably between individuals. Studies in older males show improvement in visuo-spatial cognition following T supplementation; however, it remains to be resolved whether decreases in endogenous T levels with ageing are associated with poorer MRT performance. Some recent studies in older males have reported positive correlations between measures of plasma T levels and cognitive functioning, including processing speed and executive function measures. These data are inconsistent, however, and important questions remain concerning, for example: the age at which the effect is strongest; whether there are different effects at different ages; whether there is an optimal level at which T levels affect particular abilities; and which abilities show the strongest association with endogenous plasma T levels. Increased intra-individual variability in performance on Choice Reaction Time (RT) tasks has recently been shown to be a strong predictor of cognitive functioning in university students. Methodological advances in the analyses of RT distributions has allowed for the calculation of robust estimates of intra-individual RT variability. The association between these estimates and cognitive performance in middle and older aged males, however, remains to be determined. Further, the association between endogenous plasma T levels and intra-individual RT variability in aged males is unknown. The thesis addresses these issues; firstly, through cross-sectional analyses of the associations between different measures of plasma T levels, learning and memory, processing speed, and executive function performance in a large population based sample of 1046 men aged between 35 and 81 years. Secondly, further cross-sectional analyses are reported from a subsequent study in a healthy sub-sample of 96 of these men on the associations between endogenous plasma T levels, MRT performance, constituent abilities related to MRT performance, and performance on composite measures of both processing speed and executive function. In a third study, these data are re-analysed in relation to intra-individual variability in RT performance. In light of the results of these studies, the role that age-related declines in plasma T levels play in relation to generalised age-related cognitive decline in males is discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Testosterone.

M.</field><field name="description">While it is generally accepted that residential submarkets exist, this is not the case for either their definition or delineation. This study has developed and assessed a methodology for deriving the geospatial dimensions of residential real estate submarkets based on the behaviour of the marketplace with respect to the underlying dimensions of the residential real estate living structure (RLS). Importantly, the methodology makes no prior assumptions about where the spatial boundaries might be. They were empirically derived from the data alone. It is achieved by building on previous work in the field and seeking to identify the fundamental issues in residential real estate market behaviour. The first basic premise of the thesis is that when a dwelling is sold, the commodity traded is a piece of real estate geography comprising a complex bundle of both spatial and structural attributes. The second basic premise is the recognition in the methodology of the importance of &#8216;location&#8217;. The price of the real estate geography varies across geographical space in a continuous fashion and it is this price variability that is defined, in this study, to be the geospatial submarket identifier. The study adopts a two-stage methodology reflecting these two basic premises. Firstly, a complex bundle of attributes is collected for every property in the study area and distilled into its underlying dimensions using principal component analysis. The resulting factors are used in the second stage as independent variables in a hedonic geographically weighted regression model to determine the price variability across geographical space of the underlying residential real estate structure. User-defined breaks in the continuous price surface delineate the geospatial submarket boundaries. The study represents a new approach to the delineation of geospatial submarket boundaries and is yet to be fully assessed by the two major identified users (the planning profession and the valuation profession). However, initial feedback indicates that the ability of the methodology to describe the geospatial submarket boundaries in terms of &#8216;how&#8217; and &#8216;where&#8217; location affects the market price of the underlying real estate geography, gives the land professional a better understanding of the submarket structure in which they are working.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Residential real estate South Australia Adelaide.

Low birth usually weight reflects a reduction in fetal growth, which largely depends on an adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen. Variations in supply modify the metabolic and neuroendocrine characteristics of the fetus, which in turn modulate the pattern of functional development as well as growth (3). An adverse fetal environment, evident as low birth weight, is therefore proposed to alter functional development with long term effects for the function and risk of disease in the individual later in life (4, 5). Increased HPAA impairs metabolic homeostasis and could therefore mediate effect of prenatal challenge on later metabolic control (6). It was therefore hypothesised that restriction of fetal growth, increases circulating cortisol and/or alters sensitivity to cortisol, which increases fasting blood glucose, and impairs glucose tolerance in the young adult. Large litter size in the guinea pig is characterised by reduced placental and fetal growth, reduced size at birth and insulin resistance in offspring in later life, providing a suitable model to test this hypothesis. Spontaneous restriction of fetal growth in the guinea pig, evident as small size at birth, was associated with increased salivary cortisol, in both sexes but at different stages of postnatal life. In males, salivary cortisol was increased with small size at birth in early and adult life, but reduced later with ageing. In females however, salivary cortisol was increased in juveniles and in aged adults, possibly reflecting the impact of the oestrus cycle on cortisol production in mature cycling females. Altered activity of the HPGA, which can influence that of the HPAA, has also been reported to be programmed by prenatal restriction. In the guinea pig, salivary testosterone in males increased with age and small size at birth in juveniles, young and aged adults. In females, salivary progesterone increased with age up to 300 days, and decreased with size at birth in the young guinea pig. Although testosterone inhibits HPAA activity, in males, mean salivary cortisol correlated positively with mean salivary testosterone at 100 and 300 days of age. In contrast, progesterone may enhance HPAA activity, and consistent with this, in females, mean salivary progesterone correlated with mean salivary cortisol at 400 days of age. Therefore, salivary testosterone in the male and salivary progesterone in the female guinea pig changes with maturation and has previously reported in this or other species, but small size at birth increases salivary testosterone in males with modest effects in early life in females. This together with the unexpected positive associations of salivary cortisol with testosterone in males, suggests that programming of the HPAA makes little contribution to that of the HPAA as indicated by salivary cortisol. Here we show that low birth weight is associated with increased fasting blood glucose and impaired glucose tolerance in both male and female young adult guinea pigs aged 100 days. Fasting and mean (during IVGTT) plasma cortisol was reduced in low birth weight female adult guinea pigs, and is not vary with size at birth at this age in males. This suggests that circulating cortisol does not contribute to the impaired glycaemia associated with small size at birth in the guinea pig. Glucose tolerance was increasingly impaired in males but not females, as mean plasma cortisol increased. This is consistent with cortisol impairing glycaemia in the guinea pig as in other species, in males at least. To assess the role of cortisol in prentally programmed impairment of glycaemia directly, metyrapone or vehicle containing 24% ethanol was administered to young adult guinea pigs for 3 days. Treatment with the latter impaired fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance in females and the latter in males compared to a previous IVGTT and this was exacerbated in low birth weight females. Metyrapone prevented this impairment of fasting glycaemia and glucose tolerance in the low birth weight adult female guinea pig and in the male guinea pig regardless of birth weight class. Neither vehicle or metyrapone altered plasma cortisol, before or during a second IVGTT. Limited numbers of animals, particularly females, limited this study however and additional investigation is required. Nevertheless this shows for the first time that inhibition of glucocorticoid synthesis in the guinea pig improves glucose control. Furthermore this suggests that the low birth weight guinea pig may be more sensitive to cortisol, have increased cortisol synthesis or reduced inactivation of cortisol in peripheral tissues, leading to increased local cortisol action. In conclusion, alterations in peripheral HPAA activity in the guinea pig due to restricted fetal growth may contribute to their prenatally programmed development of impaired glucose tolerance as young adults, but the extent of that contribution may vary with age and gender.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Birth weight, Low.

Disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with multiple health complications, including reduction of fertility. The bmal1 mouse provides an animal model for central and peripheral loss of rhythmicity. Herein the reproductive function and postnatal development in the bmal1 knockout mouse has been evaluated. The reproductive capability of the heterozygous breeding colony was investigated, with around 50% of the female breeder mice becoming pregnant within one estrus cycle. The offspring of the colony had a higher than expected level of perinatal mortality while the knockout and heterozygous genotype was under represented among the offspring surviving to weaning, suggesting high knockout embryo or perinatal losses. The circadian phenotype of this mouse model was confirmed, identifying the severe disruption of circadian behavioural rhythms. Further, the growth of the bmal1 knockout mice was retarded compared with their heterozygous and wild type littermates from weaning to 9 months of age. The reproductive function of the homozygous male bmal1 knockout mouse was evaluated. They showed poor fertility, poorly developed secondary sexual organs, reduced sperm count and reduced sperm motility. Female bmal1 knockout mice had delayed vaginal opening, delayed onset of first estrus, disrupted estrus cyclicity as well as impaired reproductive and mammary tissue development. Steroid hormone synthesis was compromised in both males (testosterone) and females (progesterone) and ovarian morphology revealed reduced corpora lutea formation and structural abnormalities. Female bmal1 knockout mice also evidenced profound infertility, which was caused by a continuum of reproductive insufficiencies including reduced ovulation of oocytes, poorer progression of the preimplantation embryo and failure to successfully implant in the uterus. While the ovaries of bmal1 knockout females were able to respond to exogenous stimulation, the number of ovulated oocytes was reduced, the fertilised oocytes were of reduced quality, progressed poorly to mature blastocyst and once again failed to implant. A bioinformatical evaluation of a panel of genes closely involved in reproduction and ovarian function was analysed for the presence of circadian enhancer regions (E-box sequences) or RORA response elements (RRE) in their promoter regions. It was revealed that many of the genes investigated contained one or more circadian E-box and RRE sequence, providing a mechanism for the disruption of circadian gene expression within the ovary to cause detrimental changes in gene expression. Further to this, the gene expression profile of these functional genes and clock genes were evaluated in ovarian tissues from wild type and knockout mice across the estrus cycles and across 24 hours. It was shown that the murine ovary rhythmically expressed the genes involved with the molecular clock across 24 hours, as well as several other genes previously associated with rhythmicity in peripheral tissues. Further, the loss of functional bmal1 gene expression resulted in up or down regulation of over 75% of the functional genes investigated, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (the rate limiting enzyme for progesterone synthesis). In conclusion, the bmal1 knockout mouse shows a significant multi-factorial loss in fertility in both males and females. This loss occurs across a range of tissues and results in heavily reduced fertility in the male and complete infertility in the female. Further research could identify in greater detail the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning of this disruption.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Circadian rhythms.

The aim of these MT surveys is to provide constraints on the geological interpretation of emplacement scenarios and the tectonic evolution of the geological domain. The thesis concentrates on the methodological aspects of the MT technique, e.g. the data analysis and modelling of electromagnetic fields. The phase tensor approach by Caldwell et al. (2004) is applied to the data and provides insights into the dimensionality of the MT data in even complex and electrically distorted terranes. Modelling and inversion of the MT data is performed with various 2-D and 3-D codes to show how the interpretation of the data can benefit from multiple modelling approaches. Data collected in a 2-D survey across the Oman ophiolite mountains show complex behaviour and 2-D inversion and 3-D forward modelling resolve ambiguities in the emplacement scenario of the Oman ophiolite. It is believed that initial underthrusting of the Jurassic-Cretaceous oceanic lithosphere was followed by exhumation. Further oceanic thrusting subsequently led to rising of lower-plate eclogites and eventually gravitational collapse of the ophiolite onto the margin (Gray et al., 2000). The 3-D inversion code by (Siripunvaraporn et al., 2005a) was expanded to incorporate static shift corrections and inversion model misfits have therefore improved significantly compared to inversion models without static shift correction. 2-D and 3-D surveys across the South Australian Gawler Craton reveal deep crustal conductors which are connected to near surface mineralisation systems of the IOCG Olympic Dam deposit in the north-eastern part of the craton and the Au-dominated central Gawler Craton provinces.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">magnetotellurics; modelling and inversion; lithosphere; Oman ophiolite; Gawler Craton</field><field name="subject">Magnetotelluric prospecting.</field><field name="subject">Geological modeling.</field><field name="subject">Ophiolites--Oman.</field><field name="subject">Cratons--South Australia--Gawler Ranges.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental fate of imidazolinone herbicides and their enantiomers in soil and water.</field><field name="creator">Ramezani, Mohammadkazem</field><field name="description">Imidazolinones represent a new class of herbicides with low mammalian toxicity that can be used at low application rates, either pre- or post-emergence for the control of a wide range of weeds in broadleaf and cereal crops, and non-crop situations. All imidazolinone herbicides are chiral, containing two enantiomers that derive from the chiral centre of the imidazolinone ring. The inhibitory activity of the R(+) enantiomer is nearly eight times greater than that of the S(-) enantiomer. The use of imidazolinone herbicides has increased in recent years in Australia owing to increased popularity of pulses and the introduction of imidazolinone-tolerant canola and wheat. Concerns have been raised about the potential carry over damage to the subsequent crops grown in rotation with legumes and herbicide tolerant crops. Furthermore, the presence of alkaline soils in some regions of Australia may lead to the repellence of imidazolinone herbicides, which are chiefly present in anionic form at high pH values. Thus leaching and potential contamination of ground water may occurr when these herbicides are applied on alkaline soils in certain agroclimatic zones. There is some information in the literature on the degradation, sorption and leaching behaviour of these herbicides in the environment. However, there is little information about the behaviour of these herbicides in alkaline soils found in some areas of Australia. Until now there has been no investigation of enantioselectivity in the degradation of imidazolinone herbicides in soils. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine the behaviour of three imidazolinone herbicides in solution and Australian soils including enantioselectivity in the degradation of these herbicides in Australian soils. Analytical method for these herbicides needed to be developed/improved to cater for specific experimental conditions for this study, namely the matrices containing higher levels of organic carbon and to analyse the two enantiomers of these herbicides. The extraction of imazapyr, imazethapyr and imazaquin was investigated using solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure. The evaluation of different aqueous solutions (0.1 KCl, 0.5 M NaOH, 0.01M NaOH and 0.5M MeOH:NaOH, (80:20)) showed that the recovery of all three herbicides was greater than 70%. However, the highest level of herbicide recovery was obtained with 0.5M NaOH as the extraction solution. Evaluation of different solid phase extraction cartridges showed that PPL cartridge is most appropriate for the isolation and subsequent quantification of these herbicides in water and humic-amended solutions when used at pH 2. When used with soil extracts, SPE cartridges C[subscript]18 + SCX allowed removal of co-extracting substances, resulting in high levels of herbicide recovery and accurate quantification with HPLC. These improved protocols were used in subsequent studies. The abiotic degradation of the imidazolinone herbicides imazapyr, imazethapyr and imazaquin was investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Hydrolysis, where it occurred, and photodegradation both followed first order kinetics for all herbicides. There was no hydrolysis of any of the herbicides in buffer solutions at pH 3 or pH 7; however, slow hydrolysis occurred at pH 9. Degradation of the herbicides in the light was considerably more rapid than in the dark with half lives for the three herbicides of 1.8, 9.8 and 9.1 days for imazaquin, imazethapyr and imazapyr, respectively. The presence of humic acids in the solution reduced the rate of photodegradation for all three herbicides, with higher concentrations of humic acids generally having greater effect. The enantioselectivity of photodegradation was investigated using imazaquin, with photodegradation occurring at the same rate for both enantiomers. Abiotic degradation of imidazolinone herbicides on the soil surface only occurred in the presence of light. The rate of degradation for all three herbicides on the soil surface was slower than in solution, with half-lives of 15.3, 24.6 and 30.9 days for imazaquin, imazethapyr and imazapyr, respectively. Sterilizing the soil significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased the degradation rate of both enantiomers of imidazolinone herbicides, with 81.5 to 89.5% of each enantiomer of the two herbicides remaining unchanged. However, in non-sterilized soils, the degradation of imazapyr and imazethapyr showed enantioselectivity with faster degradation of R(+) enantiomer compared with S(-) enantiomer. There were also some differences in enantioselectivity between different soils, which could be related to variation in microbial populations and enzymes present in different soils. Soil pH had a significant effect on enantioselectivity, which could be due to the effect of this soil property on herbicide sorption and ease of its availability for microbial degradation. This aspect however needs further investigations. Results from studies on soils receiving organic amendment (lupin residue) showed that degradation of the S(-) and R(+) enantiomers of imazethapyr and imazaquin followed firstorder reaction with half-life values of 45.9 to 105 days in non-sterilized soils for S(-) and R(+) enantiomers, respectively. Irrespective of the organic amendment, the degradation rate of the S(-) and R(+) enantiomers of the two herbicides was greater in the Roseworthy (pH 8.2) soil compared with the Clare soil (pH 5.2). Addition of lupin residue as organic amendment (2% w/w) increased degradation rates of both the S(-) and R(+) enantiomers of imazethapyr and imazaquin and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased their half-lives in the Clare soil. However, this amendment produced no significant change in degradation of enantiomers of either of the two herbicides in Roseworthy soil. The enantiomer fraction (EF) values of both herbicides increased over time, which suggested selective degradation of one enantiomer in preference to the other depending on the type of soil and amendment treatment. In the Clare soil, organic amendment increased the EF value at the end of incubation period from 0.61 to 0.76 for imazethapyr and from 0.56 to 0.66 for imazaquin, indicating enantioselective degradation of these herbicides. There was no significant increase in EF values for both herbicides in Roseworthy soil as the result of organic amendment. In conclusion, photodegradation of imidazolinone herbicides was found to have a major impact on the behaviour of these herbicides in aqueous and soil matrices. The degradation of imidazolinone herbicides in the soil was enantioselective, however, the enantioselectivity tended to be compound-specific and was related to soil types. The findings of this study are expected to be useful for the manufacturers to decrease the amount of chemical load in the environment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Imidazolinones.</field><field name="subject">Herbicides.</field><field name="subject">Enantiomers.</field><field name="subject">Soil science.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient availability and wheat growth as affected by plant residues and inorganic fertilizers in saline soils.</field><field name="creator">Elgharably, Ahmed Galal</field><field name="description">Over 10% of the world&#8217;s land is salt affected. Salt accumulation is a major soil constraint for agricultural sustainability in arable or newly cultivated soils. As a result of salinity, soil chemical, physical and biological properties deteriorate, plant uptake of water and nutrients, particularly P, decreases and plant growth declines. Application of plant residues can enhance the activity of soil microorganisms, the availability of nutrients, including P and the plant uptake of P and growth. Such a practice can also be economically viable as it can reduce the use of P from inorganic sources, maintaining the world&#8217;s reserve of P rocks and reducing the price of fertilizers and the environmental pollution often associated with the excessive application of inorganic N and P fertilizers. Little is known about how P, with N in proper form, added from inorganic and/or residue sources can affect wheat growth in the salt affected soils with no confounding pH or sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). Increasing microbial activity, N and P availability and wheat uptake of P by application of N and P from organic and inorganic sources may improve wheat growth and hence productivity under saline conditions. The overall aim of this study was to determine ways for enhancing the activity of microorganisms and increasing the availability of N and P, the uptake of nutrients, particularly P and the growth of wheat by management of fertilization from inorganic and organic sources in saline soils. This study therefore was conducted with the following aims: 1) to investigate the relationship between salinity and P availability; 2) to assess wheat response to combined application of N and P fertilizers under saline conditions; 3) to evaluate the effect of plant residue addition on N and P availability and microbial activity in salt affected soils; 4) to determine microbial response to addition of inorganic N rate and form, and how this will affect N and P availability in a saline soil, and 5) to determine the effect of P added from inorganic fertilizer and plant residue, compared to inorganic P fertilization, on microbial biomass and wheat nutrient composition and growth in a saline soil. In saline soils, P availability can be affected by the salt type and concentration and soil texture. Three experiments were conducted to study the relationship between P availability, soil texture and salinity. The results of the first experiment in which soil was shaken with different concentrations of NaCl or CaCl2 or Na2SO4, indicated that P solubility decreased with increasing concentration of Ca2+, but was not affected by Na+ salts. In the second experiment, P availability (after 24h shaking) decreased with increasing salt concentration up to EC1:5 3.1 dS m-1, increased with increasing P addition (0, 100, 200, 400, 600, 1200, 2500 and 5000 &#181;g P g-1 soil), and was generally higher in sandy soil than in sandy loam soil. In the third experiment (15 days incubation), it was found that P availability significantly decreased one day after P addition which was followed by a further decrease to day 5, but then remained unchanged until day 15. It can be concluded that P availability is reduced in presence of clay, and decreases with increasing concentration of salts, particularly Ca2+, and that the availability of P stabilizes in sandy and sandy loam soils within 2 weeks after addition of P from inorganic source. Increasing N or P fertilization enhanced wheat growth in salt affected soils. Therefore combined application of N and P may enhance wheat growth in saline-non sodic soils with neutral pH. Three glasshouse experiments were carried out with the aim to determine the salinity range to be used in the subsequent experiments and to test the hypothesis that combined addition of N and P fertilizers can enhance wheat growth in a sandy loam soil with low SAR and neutral pH. The first two experiments were conducted in a sandy loam salinized to EC1:5 of 0.18, 1.36, 2.00 and 2.67 dS m-1 using NaCl and CaCl2. The wheat varieties Janz and Krichauff died in all soils to which salt was added showing that these EC levels were too high. The third experiment was conducted with Krichauff in the sandy loam soil with EC1:5 0.19, 0.32, 0.49, 0.67 and 0.86 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 2.2, 4.4, 6.7, 9.2 and 11.8 dS m-1, respectively, and with 0, 30 and 60 mg P kg-1 soil and 50, 100 and 200 mg N kg-1 soil. Salinity reduced plant dry matter at all N and P application rates. Increasing N application rates decreased growth at low and high salinity, whereas increasing P addition improved growth at all salinity levels. The highest shoot and root dry weights were obtained with 50 mg N and 60 mg P kg-1 soil. Nitrogen and P fertilization did not increase wheat growth in soil with greater than EC1:5 0.67 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 9.2 dS m-1. Plants are known to respond differently to N form. A glasshouse experiment was carried out to assess the effect of N form (NH4 +, NO3 - or NH4NO3) added at 50, 100 and 200 mg kg-1 soil, in addition to the control (no N), on nutrient composition and growth of Krichauff in a sandy loam soil with EC1:5 0.21, 0.48 and 0.86 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 2.8, 6.6 and 11.8 dS m-1. Increasing soil salinity decreased shoot and root dry weights and shoot macro- and micronutrient concentrations with all forms of N. At every N addition rate and with increasing N addition from N50 to N200, compared to NH4 +, the salinity of soil solution was far higher with NO3 - and lowest with NH4NO3. Shoot and root dry weights were highest with addition of 50 mg NO3-N or 100 mg NH4-N or as NH4NO3 at all salinity treatments. Concentrations of shoot P, Fe, Mn and Zn concentrations were greater with NH4 + and NH4NO3 compared to NO3 -, but concentrations of shoot K and Ca were higher with NO3 - than with NH4 + nutrition at all salinity treatments. At a given N rate, shoot and root dry weights were greatest with NH4NO3 in the saline sandy loam soil with up to EC1:5 0.67 dS m-1. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of plant residue addition on microbial activity and biomass, and N and P availability in salt affected soils. Although the same amounts of Na+ and Ca2+ salts, EC1:5 differed between tested soils due to differences between soils in clay content and water holding capacity. The first experiment aimed to assess the salinity range for microbial activity over 2 weeks in saline soils with different texture amended with glucose/nitrate (C/N ratio 16:1). The EC1:5 were 0.2, 1.26, 1.83, 2.28 and 2.99 dS m-1 in the silty loam, 0.16, 1.10, 1.98, 2.33 and 3.18 dS m-1 in the sand and 0.19, 0.82, 1.75, 2.03 and 2.79 dS m-1 in the sandy loam. Soil respiration significantly decreased with increasing salinity in the glucose/nitrate amended soils, but was not completely inhibited even at highest salinity treatment. Cumulative CO2-C increased over 2 weeks and was highest in the silty loam soil and decreased in the following order: silty loam soil &lt; sandy loam soil &lt; sandy soil. The second experiment was conducted to determine the effect of three different plant residues added at 2% (w/w) on microbial biomass and N and P availability over time (70 days) in saline sandy and sandy loam soils with low SAR and neutral pH. The EC1:5 was 0.21, 1.08, 1.90, 2.63 and 2.89 dS m-1 in the sand and 0.19, 0.87, 1.63, 2.32 and 2.49 dS m-1 in the sandy loam. Microbial biomass C, N and P decreased with increasing soil salinity and were highest on day 10. With residue addition, microbial biomass C and P were significantly higher in the sandy than in the sandy loam soil, whereas no significant differences were found between soils for microbial biomass P at all salinity treatments. Under all salinity treatments, compared to other residues, highest biomass N was found in canola-amended sandy loam and in lupin-amended sandy soils. With increasing soil salinity, highest microbial P was found in the sandy soil amended with lupin residue. Nitrogen availability was generally higher in the sandy soil than in the sandy loam soil, whereas the opposite was found for P availability. Compared to canola and lucerne, N and P availability were highest in lupin amended sandy and sandy loam soil. Two experiments were conducted to assess whether N addition (rate and form) can affect the microbial activity in presence of residues in a saline sandy loam soil. The first experiment aimed to evaluate the effect of N rate (0, 25, 50 and 100 mg N kg-1 soil) added as NO3 - on soil respiration over 2 weeks under non-saline conditions in presence of 2% lupin residues. The second was to determine the effect of N added at 50 mg N kg-1 soil as NH4 + or NO3 - and lupin residue added at 2 and 4% (w/w) on microbial activity and biomass and N and P availability over 45 days in a sandy loam soil with EC1:5 0.21, 0.51 and 0.85 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 2.8, 7.0 and 11.7 dS m-1. Soil respiration and cumulative respiration were not significantly affected by N application rate over 2-week-incubation under non-saline conditions. Microbial biomass and N and P availability decreased with increasing salinity and were highest at 4% lupin residue. Soil respiration rate and cumulative CO2-C and microbial biomass C, N and P were greater with addition of 50 mg N kg-1 soil as NO3-N compared to NH4-N at every addition rate of lupin residues under saline conditions. Soil microbial biomass C, N and P were highest on day 15 and decreased over time, whereas N and P availability were lowest on day 15 and increased over time. Since addition of inorganic N and P fertilizers improved the growth of wheat (cv Krichauff) in the saline sandy loam soil at SAR 1 and neutral pH, two glasshouse experiments were conducted to determine the effects of plant residue addition on the nutrition of wheat. The first experiment was conducted under non-saline condition to determine the effect of lupin residue rate (2% and 4% w/w) on wheat growth. The second experiment was conducted under saline conditions to determine the effect of P added as lupin residue (2%) and/or KH2PO4 (0, 20 and 40 mg P kg-1 soil) with and without 50 mg N kg-1 soil added as (NH4)2.SO4 on microbial biomass, N and P availability, plant growth and nutrient composition in the saline sandy loam soil. The EC1:5 were 0.23, 0.35 and 0.51 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 3.1, 4.8 and 7.0 dS m-1, respectively. In the first experiment under non-saline conditions, shoot dry weight was lower with addition of 4% than with 2% lupin residue with and without inorganic N. In the second experiment under saline conditions, microbial biomass C and N increased with increasing application of inorganic P, but was not as much as in presence of lupin residues. In presence of lupin residue, wheat growth increased with increasing addition of inorganic P under saline conditions. Compared to the soil with P from inorganic fertilizer and residues, inorganic P increased shoot and root dry weights and shoot P, K, Mn and Zn concentrations, but not N concentration. Addition of 50 mg inorganic N in presence of lupin residues significantly increased N and P availability and microbial biomass, but had no significant effect on wheat growth in a saline sandy loam soil. The results showed that optimal application of N and P organic and inorganic fertilizers can improve N and P availability, microbial activity and wheat growth in salt affected soils. Highest wheat dry weight was achieved by application of 60 mg P kg-1 soil in a sandy loam soil with EC1:5 0.67 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 9.2 dS m-1. Wheat growth was also improved with application of N-NH4 + or as NH4NO3 at 100 mg N kg-1 soil. These N and P fertilization rates can potentially enhance wheat growth in the sandy loam soil with up to EC1:5 0.67 dS m-1, but with SAR 1 at neutral pH. Plant residues increased microbial activity and N and P availability in the saline soils. In the soils used here, with residue addition wheat growth was P limited due to competition with microorganisms for available P. Therefore application of residues with inorganic P is necessary to satisfy wheat requirements of N and P in the saline sandy loam soil. In the saline sandy loam soil at SAR 1 and neutral pH, application of 2% lupin residues and 40 mg KH2PO4-P kg-1 soil achieved highest microbial biomass, nutrient availability and wheat growth. However, wheat growth with these rates is not as high as with inorganic P at similar rate due to micronutrient deficiency in the saline soil with lupin residues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wheat Growth.

Drag kinging is the predominantly lesbian and queer female sub-cultural practice of female-to-male cross dressing, with most drag king performances promoting &#8216;the woman behind the man&#8217;. This emphasis on &#8216;femaleness&#8217;, even as it is ostensibly disguised in male drag, remains crucial to the many dynamics that arise through performing as a drag king and within drag king culture. This thesis promotes that emphasis by exploring and arguing for drag kinging as a performance of female identifications, erotic or otherwise, with masculinity within an exclusively queer female economy of desire. I employ various and varying theories on subjectivity, gender, desire, and fantasy to explore this, and further expand my analysis of female masculinity by focusing on the embodied and corporeal effects of performing as a drag king. This investigation reveals the refusal of drag kings to differentiate between traditional notions of mind/body, material/immaterial, and other adversarial boundaries in order to revel in new-found and provocative forms of embodiment and corporeality. Further, I develop the term &#8216;drag king embodiment&#8217; to explain and expand on this, and to promote drag king embodiment as the corporeal &#8216;outcome&#8217; of embodying desires for and fantasies of masculinity. This analysis extends to theoretically challenging accepted heteronormative models of gender, female desire, sexuality and subjectivity. However, such challenges reveal their dependency on these models, in so far as any perversion or subversion of them relies on acknowledging them as constraints &#8211; literally and figuratively. The &#8216;struggle&#8217; against such models is not theorised as an inherently futile affair, but rather is viewed as a defining narrative that informs much of the erotic, sexual, and other dynamics of drag kinging and drag king culture. Exploration and analysis of female masculinity, in all its guises, calls into question the &#8216;natural&#8217; socio-cultural position of women and their desires. By producing certain configurations of female identity, subjectivity, gender, sexuality and desire outside notions of &#8216;proper&#8217; feminine identifications is to produce those identities fully inside. Effectively, drag king performances work this &#8216;weakness&#8217; in the laws that govern &#8216;femaleness&#8217; in order to promote, eroticise, and celebrate female masculinity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transvestism.

Simulation software was developed to predict the signal strength at a certain distance from a reader antenna in a dense reader environment. This simulation software was also utilised to publish insights and research results in four major areas, which are: (i) Investigation on the sources of error in RFID simulation, to provide sensible and meaningful simulation results before actual deployment of RFID readers. (ii) The development of the idea of reader synchronisation, mainly to address the strict regulations imposed on the deployment of RFID readers in Europe. (iii) The determination of the threshold value for second carrier sensing in RFID, to enable the proper enforcement of second carrier sensing to avoid tag confusion in dense reader environments. (iv) The examination of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) to ensure human safety in a dense RFID reader environment. The second part of this thesis addresses the RFID tag performance problem in hostile environments. The focus is on the development of HF and UHF tags, from the initial tag antenna design, tag antenna simulation, tag antenna prototyping and measurement, to the manufacturing of fully functional RFID tags at laboratory standards by combining RFID chips on to tag antennas. Though there are existing commercial grade HF and UHF RFID tags, they are mostly aimed at pallet level applications and are not suitable for deployment in hostile environments. The study cases presented in this thesis are mostly industrially driven, where there is a need to design specialty HF and UHF tag antennas. With a strong foundation in the development of HF and UHF RFID tags for various industrially driven applications, the research then concentrates on the development of a novel dual-frequency RFID antenna, which operates in both the HF and UHF regions. This dual-frequency RFID tag antenna embraces the benefits of both the HF and UHF tag antenna, which enable it to have a good read range while operating in environments that pose difficulties for RFID technology, for example applications in which ionised liquid is present, such as in cases of wine or bottled drinks. Several methodologies were used to develop a dual-frequency antenna, including the merging of HF and UHF antennas, and having a UHF resonance point on a typical HF antenna. With the successful development of an original dual-frequency antenna, the research was then expanded to miniaturise this dual-frequency antenna. The benefits of RFID deployment in supply chains are undoubtedly massive, though there are still issues and challenges to be resolved before a world-wide adoption is possible. This thesis contributes in recommending various reader antenna positioning and deployment techniques, and also contributes in developing HF tag antennas and UHF tag antennas for hostile environments, and a novel dual-frequency tag antenna to progress towards the aim of ubiquitous object identification.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radio frequency identification systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstructing 3D geometry from multiple images via inverse rendering.</field><field name="creator">Bastian, John William</field><field name="description">An image is a two-dimensional representation of the three-dimensional world. Recovering the information which is lost in the process of image formation is one of the fundamental problems in Computer Vision. One approach to this problem involves generating and evaluating a succession of surface hypotheses, with the best hypothesis selected as the final estimate. The fitness of each hypothesis can be evaluated by comparing the reference images against synthetic images of the hypothesised surface rendered with the reference cameras. An infinite number of surfaces can recreate any set of reference images, so many approaches to the reconstruction problem recover the largest from this set of surfaces. In contrast, the approach we present here accommodates prior structural information about the scene, thereby reducing ambiguity and finding a reconstruction which reflects the requirements of the user. The user describes structural information by defining a set of primitives and relating them by parameterised transformations. The reconstruction problem then becomes one of estimating the parameter values that transform the primitives such that the hypothesised surface best recreates the reference images. Two appearance-based likelihoods which measure the hypothesised surface against the reference images are described. The first likelihood compares each reference image against an image synthesised from the same viewpoint by rendering a projection of a second image onto the surface. The second likelihood finds the &#8216;optimal&#8217; surface texture given the hypothesised scene configuration. Not only does this process maximise photo-consistency with respect to all reference images, but it prohibits incorrect reconstructions by allowing the use of prior information about occlusion. The second likelihood is able to reconstruct scenes in cases where the first is biased.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image reconstruction.

One difficulty which arises from serious attempts to define language semantics is that the resulting definition is generally suitable for a single limited kind of reader. For example, the more formal kind of definition may suit a compiler writer or a language designer, but will be less convenient for other potential classes of reader, such as programmers. The latter frequently make use of some completely separate description (e.g., an introductory text book on the language); not surprisingly, inconsistencies between these separate descriptions and the language definition are commonplace. This thesis develops a technique for the definition of programming language semantics which is suitable for a wide range of potential readers. This technique employs an operational semantic model which is based on the algebraic specifiication of abstract data types; the semantic model manipulates multi-layer descriptions of language semantics and supports multiple passes in these descriptions. The semantic technique described in this thesis lends itself to the semi-automatic generation of an interpreter from the language definition, a fact which acts as an incentive to language designers to produce a formal definition of any new programming language, since the prototype implementation allows experimentation with new language features and their semantics. The system which generates an interpretive implementation from a language definition is called ATLANTIS, A Tool for LANguage definiTion and Interpreter Synthesis, and is also described in this thesis.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tree succession planning: modelling tree longevity in Tuttangga/Park 17, the Adelaide park lands.</field><field name="creator">Peter, Darren</field><field name="description">Trees represent important living components in many urban parkland spaces. As living landscape entities, they have the capacity for potentially long life spans. As a result of these longevities, issues concerning tree death or senescence are not often engaged until the end of tree life spans have been reached, or are fast approaching. As organisms with finite life spans, tree senescence must be expected at some future point in time, and due consideration of this inevitable change is imperative within an urban parkland context. An understanding of tree longevity in urban parkland spaces must therefore be considered advantageous to subsequent design, management, and planning decisions enacted upon these landscapes. For appropriate decision-making to take place with regard to urban tree populations, figures reflecting expected tree longevity could purvey estimations of future tree senescence, and assist in providing practical information for all stakeholders of urban landscapes. In addition to this, developed models of parkland spaces supplying visual and spatial analysis of future tree senescence patterns could indicate potential landscape scenarios, and highlight tree populations most at risk of senescence within the near future. The development of models predicting possible future tree senescence patterns required a review of various fields of research in order to establish appropriate models for use, and to assign confidence levels based upon the knowledge of tree growth, longevity, and senescence in predicted landscapes. This thesis examined the subjects of tree longevity and senescence, with a particular focus upon the Adelaide Park Lands region in Adelaide, South Australia. Various tree growth parameters were collected from the field and combined with assigned tree ages to create matrix models that represented expected tree growth trends. Through the incorporation of curves fitted to these matrix models, tree ages could be assigned to tree specimens of unknown age, to determine dates of establishment based upon key growth parameters. Tree longevity figures for each taxon were sourced from a peer reference group survey conducted specifically for this purpose. Through the combination of calculated tree age and predicted tree longevity, senescence patterns for a region of the Adelaide Park Lands were modelled. Interactive structured query-based GIS software was incorporated to display these senescence patterns visually, and to provide interpretations of future landscape scenarios. Results obtained from the peer reference group survey provided a range of valuable figures representing expected tree longevities for 131 taxa from within the Adelaide Park Lands environment. These longevity figures, combined with matrix models and GIS simulations, revealed that considerable populations of established trees within Tuttangga/Park 17 in the Adelaide Park Lands are at a high risk of reaching senescence within the near future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tree longevity; succession planning; Adelaide park lands; geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">Trees Growth Mathematical models.

This material, locally known as coastal bitumen, was used by the early maritime visitors and settlers to caulk their vessels and is the first recorded commercial use of crude oil in Australia. Historical records indicate that the greatest amount of coastal bitumen strands along the coasts of South Australia and western Victoria. The Otway Basin, which straddles part of this shoreline, is one of a series of basins located along the southern passive margin of the Australian continent. These basins formed during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous in response to the rifting and final breakup of eastern Gondwanaland 95 million years ago. The circumstantial evidence of coastal bitumen, and the more recent discovery of offshore gas seeps, have been used to promote petroleum exploration in the Otway Basin. As a result, several small but commercial gas fields and numerous oil shows have been discovered. The moderate success of exploration in the Otway Basin may not be a true indication of its ultimate reserves, given that Australia&#8217;s most prolific petroleum province, the Gippsland Basin, lies immediately to the east. The aims of this study were twofold: to appraise the hydrocarbon potential of the western Otway Basin, and to identify the origin(s) of the coastal bitumen. Source rocks were identified using an interdisciplinary approach which included wireline log interpretation, lithological descriptions, organic petrology (viz. maceral analysis, vitrinite reflectance) and organic geochemical analyses (viz. TOC and Rock-Eval pyrolysis). Oil-source rock and oil-oil correlations were attempted using carbon isotope mass spectrometry, gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In the western Otway Basin the most important hydrocarbon plays occur within the Early Cretaceous Otway Group (Crayfish Subgroup and Eumeralla Formation). Terrigenous source rocks with potential to generate both oil and gas were identified in the lower Eumeralla Formation. The waxy paraffinic-naphthenic crude oils recovered from Windermere-1 and 2, Lindon-1 and Port Campbell-4 have biomarker signatures that are indicative of a terrestrial source to which conifer resins made a significant contribution. These oils have been correlated with coaly facies of the lower Eumeralla Formation. In the Crayfish Subgroup, lacustrine mudstones in the Pretty Hill Sandstone contain kerogen derived from a mixture of algal and biodegraded plant remains which appears to have generated significant volumes of gas (Katnook-Ladbroke Grove Gas Field; Troas-1) and minor quantities of oil (Sawpit-1). Reservoir bitumens occur in the Pretty Hill Sandstone at Crayfish-A1 and Zema-1. These bitumens are unlike any other oil found within the Otway Basin. Their distinctive biomarker assemblage indicates that they were derived from algal and bacterial remains preserved in carbonate-evaporite sediments. Although no such source rocks have yet been penetrated by any exploration well, it is believed that they may be located within either the lower Crayfish Subgroup or the Casterton beds. These inferred source rocks are likely to be overmature in most areas of the western Otway Basin, precluding any significant future hydrocarbon generation. However, their required presence indicates that hydrocarbons were generated very early in the history of the basin. A bimonthly survey documenting the stranding of coastal bitumen between Kangaroo Island, South Australia and Cape Otway, Victoria was carried out from September 1990 to September 1991. The physical characteristics of the coastal bitumens collected during this period enabled three categories of beached petroleum to be identified: waxy bitumen, asphaltite and oil slicks. Elemental, isotopic and biomarker analyses of representative samples confirmed that these three categories of petroleum are not geochemically related. Of extreme significance is the fact that they bear no resemblance to oil discoveries in the Otway Basin. Waxy bitumens are the most common type of coastal bitumen, accounting for 90% of the total beached petroleum. They represent the weathered remains of paraffinic-naphthenic crude oils which have low to moderate sulphur (0.1-2.6%) contents. Their medium to low density (10-40&#176;API) ensures that they float in sea water. These waxy bitumens contain a unique association of source-specific biomarkers, notably botryococcane, oleanane, isomeric bicadinanes and 4-methyl steranes, which is not found in any indigenous Australian oils. The biological precursor of botryococcane is synthesized only by the freshwater green alga Botryococcus sp. and 4-methyl sterols are abundant in dinoflagellates. Oleanane originates from angiosperms which first appeared in the Late Cretaceous. High concentrations of bicadinane are derived from the resins (dammars) of the fossil angiosperm family Dipterocarpaceae. In terms of their biogeographic range, both extant and fossil dipterocarps are confined to the tropics of Southeast Asia, although their dammars have been found on South Australian beaches. Together, these biomarkers imply that the waxy bitumens were derived from Tertiary lacustrine source beds which were deposited at low palaeolatitudes. When the effects of extensive weathering and biodegradation are taken into account, the waxy bitumens are similar to bitumens stranded on the coasts of the Northern Territory and Western Australia, and to Tertiary crude oils produced from Sumatra. Hence, it has been deduced that the waxy bitumens originate from oil seeps within the Indonesian Archipelago. These crude oils are transported into southern Australian waters as flotsam by a complex system of surface ocean currents which include the South Equatorial Current, Leeuwin Current and West Wind Drift. Asphaltite is the least common variety of coastal bitumen. These jet black bitumens are heavy (~8&#176;API) and characteristically exhibit deep desiccation cracks on their upper surface. The oldest asphaltite analysed in this study was collected before the year 1900 on Kangaroo Island, and the stranding of comparable samples continues to the present day. The asphaltites have a uniform aromatic-asphaltic composition and are rich in sulphur (S=3-6%). Their unimodal n-alkane distribution centred about C&#185;&#8309;, the predominance of cholestane among their C &#8322;&#8327;-C &#8322;&#8329; desmethyl steranes and the presence of dinosterane (a marine dinoflagellate biomarker) as the major C&#8323;&#8320;4-methyl sterane, highlight the marine source affinity of the asphaltites. The presence of rearranged steranes and hopanes indicates that their parent crude oils were generated from clay-rich sediments. The asphaltite samples are isotopically light (&#948;&#185;&#179;Csat~-30.0&#8240;; &#948;&#185;&#179;Carom~-29.5&#8240;) relative to the waxy bitumens. These depleted &#948;&#185;&#179;C values, combined with the presence of dinosterane and C&#8322;&#8328; /C&#8322;&#8329; sterane ratios ranging from 0.7 to 1.2, suggests that their source rocks are of Mesozoic age. The South Australian and Victorian asphaltites are almost identical to asphaltic bitumen which strands on the west and south coasts of Tasmania. The biomarker geochemistry of the asphaltite was compared with those of many other Australian and non-Australian marine sediments and oils. However, no matching signatures were found and so the source of the asphaltite could not be identified. Nevertheless, the long stranding history of the asphaltite suggests that it is a natural phenomenon. A third group of &#8216;coastal bitumens&#8217; represents stranded oil slicks. These films and sheets of liquid oil are of sporadic occurrence and have been linked to local maritime operations. The bitumens assigned to this category have variable geochemical signatures depending on the type of oil discharged; both refined and unrefined crude oils were among the samples collected. The majority of these crude oils originated from either Southeast Asia or the Middle East, the two main provinces from which oil is imported into Australia. The stranding of coastal bitumen along the southern margin of Australia can be attributed to both natural and anthropogenic causes but not, as first suspected, to oil seepage from the offshore sector of the Otway Basin.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Androgens and androgen receptor signalling in men.</field><field name="creator">Need, Eleanor Frances</field><field name="description">Androgens are critical for the development and maintenance of adult male characteristics such as muscle mass and sexual function. Consequently, the established decline with age of serum testosterone (T) in males has major health implications. While the androgen receptor (AR) is the major mediator of genomic androgen action and is required for the development of the male phenotype, reproductive organs and the maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics, it is the entrance of androgens into the cell that mediates the activation of the AR and the subsequent modulation of expression of androgen regulated genes. Testosterone, biologically the most important androgen in male serum, circulates either free, loosely bound to albumin or tightly bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Each of these forms of serum T have different abilities to enter cells, and which proportion of serum T is capable of entering cells and initiating the androgen signalling cascade, thereby leading to the activation of the AR has not been precisely defined. The AR amino terminal domain (NTD) is responsible for the majority of the ability of the AR to activate genes but the relative roles of the two activation functions in the AR NTD (activation functions 1 and 5; AF1 and 5) have not been precisely defined while the role of the AF2 surface which forms in the ligand binding domain upon agonist binding is responsible for interactions with key coregulators and also with the NTD in the amino-carboxyl (N/C) interaction. Our laboratory has recently identified a region within AF5 between amino acids 500-535 to which somatic mutations in castrate resistant prostate tumour samples collocate. Due to the lack of functional information on the AF5 region and the NTD in general, the function of this region and the functional consequences of the mutations remain to be defined. The objectives of this thesis were to develop a specific mammalian cell based bioassay capable of reliable measuring T in serum and to determine the ability of this bioassay to measure a physiologically relevant fraction of T in serum. Additionally, this thesis aimed to determine the relative contributions and roles of the activation functions of the AR to overall AR transcriptional activity along with the functional consequences for AR signalling of prostate cancer mutations which have previously been identified in the AF5 region of the AR NTD. The mammalian-cell based bioassay developed in this thesis is capable of sensitively and reliably measuring serum T. However, evaluation of this bioassay utilising approximately 1000 serum samples from the Florey Adelaide Male Aging Study reveals that this bioassay measures a fraction of T in serum that most closely relates to serum T. Furthermore, this measure does not correlate more strongly with grip strength, sexual function or waist circumference than the existing immunoassay-based measures of serum T, highlighting the limitations of utilising a static mammalian cell-based androgen bioassay to measure physiological levels of serum T in males. The investigation of the roles of the activation functions in the AR in this thesis have revealed that while the AF1 domain is responsible for the majority of the transactivation activity of the AR, AF5 and AF2 govern the sensitivity and cellular response of the AR to androgens by providing protein and interdomain interaction interfaces. Furthermore, the evidence in this thesis demonstrates that the AR requires interdomain communication for sensitive AR signalling. Finally, the findings in this thesis demonstrate that the AF5 surface is required for the N/C interaction and coregulator interactions while advanced prostate cancer mutations identified within this region confer increased transactivation activity of the AR in the presence of high cellular levels of coregulators. Collectively, the findings in this thesis provide several novel insights into the mechanism of action of serum androgens and challenges several long held assumptions of androgenic action in males. These findings also delineate a mechanism of treatment failure in advanced prostate cancer, provide a novel model for the events leading to sensitive AR transactivation and contribute to the understanding of physiologically relevant levels of serum T.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">androgen receptor; N/C interaction; prostate cancer; missense mutations; androgen bioassay; testosterone</field><field name="subject">Androgens</field><field name="subject">Testosterone</field><field name="subject">Androgens -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Prostate -- Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communication performance measurement and analysis on commodity clusters.</field><field name="creator">Abdul Hamid, Nor Asilah Wati</field><field name="description">Cluster computers have become the dominant architecture in high-performance computing. Parallel programs on these computers are mostly written using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, so the communication performance of the MPI library for a cluster is very important. This thesis investigates several different aspects of performance analysis for MPI libraries, on both distributed memory clusters and shared memory parallel computers. The performance evaluation was done using MPIBench, a new MPI benchmark program that provides some useful new functionality compared to existing MPI benchmarks. Since there has been only limited previous use of MPIBench, some initial work was done on comparing MPIBench with other MPI benchmarks, and improving its functionality, reliability, portability and ease of use. This work included a detailed comparison of results from the Pallas MPI Benchmark (PMB), SKaMPI, Mpptest, MPBench and MPIBench on both distributed memory and shared memory parallel computers, which has not previously been done. This comparison showed that the results for some MPI routines were significantly different between the different benchmarks, particularly for the shared memory machine. A comparison was done between Myrinet and Ethernet network performance on the same machine, an IBM Linux cluster with 128 dual processor nodes, using the MPICH MPI library. The analysis focused mainly on the scalability and variability of communication times for the different networks, making use of the capability of MPIBench to generate distributions of MPI communication times. The analysis provided an improved understanding of the effects of TCP retransmission timeouts on Ethernet networks. This analysis showed anomalous results for some MPI routines. Further investigation showed that this is because MPICH uses different algorithms for small and large message sizes for some collective communication routines, and the message size where this changeover occurs is fixed, based on measurements using a cluster with a single processor per node. Experiments were done to measure the performance of the different algorithms, which demonstrated that for some MPI routines the optimal changeover points were very different between Myrinet and Ethernet networks and for 1 and 2 processors per node. Significant performance improvements can be made by allowing the changeover points to be tuned rather than fixed, particularly for commodity Ethernet networks and for clusters with more than 1 process per node. MPIBench was also used to analyse the MPI performance and scalability of a large ccNUMA shared memory machine, an SGI Altix 3000 with 160 processors. The results were compared with a high-end cluster, an AlphaServer SC with Quadrics QsNet interconnect. For most MPI routines the Altix showed significantly better performance, particularly when non-buffered copy was used. MPIBench proved to be a very capable tool for analyzing MPI performance in a variety of different situations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High performance computing</field><field name="subject">Electronic data processing -- Distributed processing</field><field name="subject">Computer science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A contribution towards real-time forecasting of algal blooms in drinking water reservoirs by means of artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.</field><field name="creator">Welk, Amber Lee</field><field name="description">Historical water quality databases from two South Australian drinking water reservoirs were used, in conjunction with various computational modelling methods for the ordination, clustering and forecasting of complex ecological data. Techniques used throughout the study were: Kohonen artificial neural networks (KANN) for data categorisation and the discovery of patterns and relationships, recurrent supervised artificial neural networks (RANN) for knowledge discovery and forecasting of algal dynamics and hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA) for rule-set discovery and optimisation for forecasting algal dynamics. These methods were combined to provide an integrated approach to the analysis of algal populations including interactions within the algal community and with other water quality factors, which results in improved understanding and forecasting of algal dynamics. The project initially focussed on KANN for the patternising and classification of the historical data to reveal links between the physical, chemical and biological components of the reservoirs. This offered some understanding of the system and relationships being considered for the construction of the forecasting models. Specific investigations were performed to examine past conditions and the impacts of different management regimes, as well as to discover sets of conditions that correspond with specific algal functional groups. RANN was then used to build models for forecasting both Chl-a and the main nuisance species, Anabaena, up to 7 days in advance. This method also provided sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the relationship between input and output variables by plotting the reaction of the output to variations in the inputs. Initially one year from the data set was selected for the testing of a model, as per the split-sample technique. To further test the models, it was later decided to select several years for testing to ensure the models were useful under changed conditions, and that test results were not misleading regarding the models true capabilities. RANN were firstly used to create reservoir specific or ad-hoc models. Later, the models were trained with the merged data sets of both reservoirs to create one model that could be applied to either reservoir. Another method of forecasting was trialled and compared to RANN. HEA was found to be equal or superior to RANN in predictive power, also allowed sensitivity analysis and provided an explicit, portable rule set. The HEA rule sets were initially tested on selected years of data, however to fully demonstrate the models potential, a process for k-fold cross-validation was developed to test the rule-set on all years of data. To further extend the applicability of the HEA rule-set; the idea of rule-based agents for specific lake ecosystem categories was examined. The generality of a rule-based agent means that, after successful validation on several lakes from one category, the agent could then be applied to other water bodies from within that category that had not been involved in the training process. The ultimate test of the rule-based agent for the warm monomictic and eutrophic lake ecosystem category was to be applied to a real-time monitoring and forecasting situation. The agent was fed with online, real-time data from a reservoir that belonged to the same ecosystem category but was not used in the training process. These preliminary experiments showed promising results. It can be concluded that the concept of rulebased agents will facilitate real-time forecasting of algal blooms in drinking water reservoirs provided on-line monitoring of relevant variables has been implemented. Contributions of this research include: (1) to offer insight into the capabilities of 3 kinds of computational modelling techniques applied to complex water quality data, (2) novel applications of KANN including the division of data into separate management periods for comparison of management efficiency, (3) to both qualitatively and quantitatively elucidate relationships between water quality parameters, (4) research toward the development of a forecasting tool for algal abundance 7 days in advance that could be generic for a particular lake ecosystem category and implemented in real-time, and (5) to suggest a thorough testing method for such models (k-fold cross validation).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cyanobacteria; evolutionary algorithms; artificial neural networks; reservoir management; algal blooms; modelling</field><field name="subject">Algal blooms</field><field name="subject">Drinking water -- microbiology</field><field name="subject">Water quality</field><field name="subject">Water quality management -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Water quality -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mediterranean influences on horticultural and garden developments in South Australia between 1836 and 1938.</field><field name="creator">Nottle, Trevor</field><field name="description">To define the extent of this research, this thesis reviews the first settlement of South Australia in 1836 and concludes with the Depression of 1938 having regard to its landscape development. This enables the documentation of Mediterranean influences from the earliest moments of European settlement in South Australia until the great financial crash that virtually suspended significant landscape commissions until after World War 2 when refugee migration from the Mediterranean region introduced a direct influence on society and culture here. Braudel&#8217;s view of history as wave-like is a used as an aid to understand the nature of the Mediterranean influence as transposed in South Australia. Extending his simile the waves have perhaps been less influence than the thin line of foam left in their wake. While individual and official enthusiasms for things Mediterranean waxed and waned over that century, the threads of the idea remained and appear now to be drawing together in a developing consciousness woven from past associations and developing events that seem almost inescapable. It is timely to consider the impact of Mediterranean influences on the development of ideas in South Australia as it clearly influenced this cultural and physical landscape and the body of ideas that determined these patterns, and may in future find a richer expression.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration or exclusion? : the resettlement experiences of refugees in Australia.</field><field name="creator">Hinsliff, Julia</field><field name="description">Recent policy changes have created a new era of refugee resettlement in Australia. As a result of the introduction of the onshore refugee program, a two-tier resettlement assistance system has developed. This system differentiates between refugees who have been issued protection visas offshore and onshore, and provides considerably less resettlement assistance to onshore-visaed refugees with Temporary Protection Visa (TPVs). The exclusion of TPV holders from resettlement assistance programs and the temporary nature of the visa has prompted this comparative study of the resettlement experiences of two groups of recently arrived refugees. This thesis considers the experiences of recently arrived refugees within the economic, social, cultural and political spheres of resettlement, in order to develop a deeper understanding of the inter-related nature of the resettlement process and the impact of visa category on the integration of refugees in contemporary Australia. Kuhlman&#8217;s (1991) model of refugee resettlement, and definition of integration form the basis of the theoretical framework of the thesis. A multiple method approach has been applied to the study and data from the second cohort of the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA) was analysed to present a macro level understanding of the resettlement experiences of recent arrivals in Australia. In Adelaide, interviews with key informants and service providers were undertaken in conjunction with a series of in-depth interviews with 10 Sudanese offshore-visaed Humanitarian entrants and 9 Iraqi onshore-visaed refugees, to provide detailed descriptions of the resettlement experience. While the resettlement process is found to be difficult for all refugees, the TPV policy acts to compound the problems and disadvantages refugees face in resettlement. Under these circumstances it is found that TPV holders experience social exclusion during their early resettlement in Australia. The importance of host-related factors on the resettlement experience are therefore found to be extremely relevant in contemporary Australian refugee resettlement. Policies regarding visa conditions, and refugees&#8217; eligibility for resettlement assistance have a significant impact in all spheres of the resettlement process. These findings suggest that the influence of host society policies must be accorded more weight in theories of resettlement, given their ability to extensively influence the resettlement process. Further this thesis presents substantial evidence against the TPV policy and recommends that temporary protection in Australia be reviewed, in order to ensure the social inclusion and successful integration of future refugee arrivals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">refugees; asylum seekers; resettlement; integration; social exclusion; migration</field><field name="subject">Refugees--Australia</field><field name="subject">Refugees--Government policy--Australia.</field><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration--Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multimodality imaging in cardiovascular disease.</field><field name="creator">Teo, Karen S.L.</field><field name="description">The non-invasive cardiovascular imaging modalities, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and multi-detector computer tomography (MDCT) are playing an increasing role in both clinical and research settings. CMR is a unique imaging modality due to unsurpassed contrast between soft tissue structures that is non-invasive, does not use ionising radiation and is able to provide high-resolution information about cardiac anatomy, function, flow, perfusion, viability and metabolism. It has provided the gold standard in imaging in congenital heart disease. Recent advances in this technology have led to images of high spatial and temporal resolution that has made the characterisation of atheroma possible. While currently spatial resolution still limits its ability to characterise atheroma in native human coronary arteries in living patients, CMR imaging of the coronary arteries has future potential with further technological and sequence advances. MDCT has been used in clinical settings to measure of the amount of calcification in the coronary arteries with &#8220;coronary artery calcium scoring&#8221; of the coronary tree a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis. MDCT has also become the gold standard for angiographic imaging in most arterial beds such as the carotid and peripheral vascular systems. In the coronary arteries in particular, there have been major advances in the accuracy of coronary MDCT angiography, particularly with regards to its negative predictive value, although excessive calcification and blooming artefacts still limit the diagnostic accuracy of the technique for assessing stenotic severity. In this thesis, our aims were to address some specific novel areas advancing the utility of these imaging modalities in two major areas of interest, namely congenital heart disease and atheroma imaging. Our first step was to validate the accuracy and reproducibility of CMR, the main imaging modality we utilised. To achieve this, we assessed MR imaging of cardiac volumes and function in a normal adult Australian population with a specific focus on the reproducibility of the technique. In confirming that this technique in our hands is both accurate and reproducible, we would then be in a position to be able to confidently use this technique in our future chapters. However, more than this, we sought to establish some normal ranges for left and right atrial and ventricular parameters in our local population. This would be crucial background information for us to be able to make comparisons with future studies in patients with congenital heart disease. Having established our technique and reference ranges, we would then explore the two specific issues in the ensuing two chapters using CMR in one area of congenital heart disease, atrial septal defect. Atrial septal defect is the most common congenital heart defect first diagnosed in adults. The traditional method of assessment of these patients and for suitability for ASD closure involves semiinvasive investigation with transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) for measurement of the defect size and atrial septal margins. MRI assessment of patients prior to percutaneous device closure compared to TOE assessment would provide information on the accuracy of TOE assessment and provide information of the utility of cardiac MRI as an alternative to TOE for the work-up of these patients prior to ASD closure. In our third original research chapter, we utilised CMR to understand the effects of percutaneous ASD closure on cardiac chamber volumes. We achieved this by assessing with cardiac MRI pre-closure and post-closure atrial and ventricular cardiac volumes. Longstanding right heart dilatation in the setting of an ASD may lead to complications including right heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and arrhythmia. Closure of the ASD should reduce right heart volumes by removing left-to-right shunting and lead to normalisation of ventricular volumes. The assessment of atrial volume changes with ASD closure may be important in furthering our understanding in its contribution to arrhythmia. Having assessed the ability of CMR to assess both the ASD dimensions, and therefore suitability for percutaneous closure, as well as the effects of ASD closure on cardiac chamber size, we look in the final two original research chapters to move to another area of research development with these highresolution imaging technologies, atherosclerosis imaging. Two particular areas we wished to focus on included the potential of high-resolution MR imaging to monitor effects of HDL infusion on atherosclerosis, and secondly to explore mechanisms behind limitations in MDCT imaging of atherosclerosis, specifically calcification and blooming artifacts. For assessing the effects of HDL infusion on atherosclerosis, we utilised a cholesterol-fed rabbit model of atherosclerosis. The abdominal aorta of the rabbit is comparable in size to the human coronary artery. Previous work with the rabbit model of atherosclerosis and magnetic resonance imaging of the aortic wall has shown that it can provide information about atherosclerotic composition as well as provide serial data of the arterial wall. While high intensity lipid-lowering with statins remains the first line management of at risk individuals, modest manipulations of serum HDL levels are associated with a significant impact on cardiovascular risk. Thus, we assessed the effect of HDL infusion and atorvastatin in a rabbit model of using MRI aortic atherosclerosis as the endpoint. In our fifth and final original research chapter, we assessed the accuracy of quantification of atherosclerotic calcification with MDCT in the carotid arteries of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, and sought to identify algorithms or techniques that may improve quantification of calcification. This would potentially lead to an improvement in the ability of MDCT techniques to quantify stenotic severity in coronary arteries that were calcified. To achieve these we utilised MDCT in vivo and in comparison with carotid endarterectomy specimen micro-CT. Importantly, as part of this study, we undertook a thorough assessment of reproducibility of these techniques. Thus, in summary, we have been able to confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of CMR and MDCT in the areas of a specific congenital defect (ASD) and atherosclerosis imaging, and utilised these techniques to advance our understanding of these disease states. This thesis identifies strengths and weaknesses of these techniques that will allow us to more appropriately use them for future purposes in cardiovascular disease. Future work directly stemming from this thesis has already begun, and now looks to address issues of whether CMR and MDCT may provide complimentary information about atherosclerotic lesions that may benefit outcomes in certain conditions. Specifically the work in this thesis has led to studies commencing in carotid atherosclerosis and saphenous vein graft atherosclerosis and using these imaging techniques to potentially predict adverse future outcomes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cardiovascular imaging; magnetic resonance imaging; computed tomography; atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis -- Imaging.</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Imaging.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Magnetic resonance imaging.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring aspects of parental control over feeding: influences on children&#8217;s eating behaviour and weight.</field><field name="creator">Corsini, Nadia</field><field name="description">The current research was developed from a review of the literature on the influence of parental control on children's eating and weight, and in particular the research examining parental restriction and poor self-regulation of energy. The impetus for the research was the confusion in the literature about the positive and negative aspects of control and the need to explore the influence of parental control at earlier periods of child development in socio economically diverse samples. The aim of the first study was to investigate the factor structure and psychometric properties of the Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ) in an Australian sample of preschool children. Consistent with previous research, the factor structure was problematic with respect to the Restriction subscale. The two items that ask about the use of rewards showed poor cohesion with other items on the Restriction subscale, raising concerns about the conceptualisation of restriction as measured by the CFQ. The second study sought to determine whether currently available measures of restriction were appropriate for assessing parent behaviours with toddlers, and to explore the strategies that mothers use to control their toddlers' intake of energy-dense snack foods. A qualitative methodology was employed and interviews were conducted with 22 mothers who had toddlers aged between 18 and 24 months. A key finding was a lack of variability in responses to the CFQ Restriction subscale in contrast to the range of individual differences in parents' reported use of control. A thematic analysis provided the basis for the development of a questionnaire to quantify the key concepts that were identified. Exploratory factor analysis was then used to refine these concepts resulting in a five factor structure that has been named the Toddler Feeding Questionnaire (TFQ). The TFQ incorporates a broad range of measures of parental control over feeding, including how much parents allow access to energy-dense foods (Allow Access), the rules associated with managing intake of these foods (Rules), and flexibility in the way rules are applied (Flexibility). It also includes a measure of parental self-efficacy beliefs (Self-efficacy), which may influence the use of feeding practices, and a measure of toddlers' attraction to energy-dense foods (Child's Attraction), a characteristic of the child that may influence both parent feeding practices and energy intake. The factor structure was examined in a sample of mothers of toddlers, and replicated in a second sample of mothers of preschool children, who responded retrospectively about their feeding practices. Subsequent analyses were conducted to examine the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant and concurrent validity of the TFQ factors to provide a preliminary validation of the instrument. To further examine the validity of the TFQ, feeding practices of normal weight, overweight and obese parents were compared. The relationship between the TFQ factors (based on retrospective reports) and BMI z scores in preschool children were also examined. In the preschool sample only, normal weight parents had significantly more rules compared to obese parents and were less flexible compared to overweight parents, and obese parents allowed their children more access to snack foods compared with overweight and normal weight parents. The TFQ factors were not associated with BMI z scores in preschool children. The final study investigated the association between feeding practices, including the TFQ factors and CFQ Restriction, and self-regulation of energy intake in toddlers. The main aim was to determine if the TFQ factor Allow Access would moderate the relationship between CFQ Restriction and ad libitum intake of snack foods, using an age appropriate adaptation of the Free Access Procedure developed by Fisher and Birch (1999a). The findings confirmed a moderating influence of Allow Access. Restriction was a significant predictor of intake only when Allow Access was high. The implications of this finding for the development of parental feeding advice and the conceptualisation of parental control are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parental feeding practices; toddlers; eating behaviour; restriction</field><field name="subject">Parent and child</field><field name="subject">Parenting</field><field name="subject">Children Nutrition Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The White Distance: a novel.</field><field name="creator">Errington, Susan</field><field name="description">The White Distance&#8217; is a work of fiction set in Australia and Antarctica at the time of World War I. The story focuses on two lovers, Dora and Daniel, who are part of Australia&#8217;s vigorous anti-war movement. Each of the lovers comes to the movement for different reasons. Dora&#8217;s beloved brother has been killed in France; Daniel is a printer interested in the new left-wing ideas emerging in Europe, especially Russia. Wanting to escape public pressure to join up and fight, Daniel takes a position with an Antarctic expedition and travels there with a small team from the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology to collect weather data. This was a time of major Antarctic exploration, with the Australian expedition led by Douglas Mawson taking place in 1913. In Antarctica, in the novel, the leader of Daniel&#8217;s expedition suffers a nervous breakdown and becomes dangerously violent, believing his men are German spies. Daniel and his colleagues have to consider the possibility that the only way to stop their leader might be to kill him. After Daniel leaves, Dora joins a more radical anti-war group led by the charismatic Malachy Mara. She is forced to reconsider what she believes when the group decides to place a pipe bomb in a railway station, which will kill many civilians. Worse for her, she is likely to be the one selected to put the bomb into position. &#8216;The White Distance&#8217; is also a love story about two lovers who, after being very close, are separated by a great and unfathomable distance. Dora and Daniel struggle to keep their love alive by writing letters to one another, even though they cannot be posted, and keeping journals that will not be read until Daniel returns. Each confronts a deep personal crisis without the other there for support. They use their words to one another to draw the strength to hold on. Although set in the past, the novel raises issues which are relevant to current international and national concerns such as the clash of ideals and personal morality, terrorism, public violence, war and pacifism, love and separation. Exegesis The accompanying exegesis, &#8216;Reframing the Past for the Present: Writing &#8216;The White Distance&#8217;&#8217;, examines the research material and creative influences behind the development of the novel, &#8216;The White Distance&#8217;. It considers the issues which I confronted in writing an historical work of fiction, and concludes by placing the novel in the wider context of current debates about Australian historical fiction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antarctica; World War I; fiction; history; creative writing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Safety and efficacy of high dose docosahexaenoic acid for the preterm infant.</field><field name="creator">Smithers, Lisa Gaye</field><field name="description">There has been substantial research demonstrating improvements in visual and cognitive performance of preterm infants after feeding formulas containing n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA). The amount of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) estimated to be accrued by the fetus in the last trimester of gestation is greater than that supplied in current preterm formulas and breast milk of average DHA content (~0.3% of total fat in Western women). Yet many trials have compared infants fed formula containing concentrations near 0.3% DHA with infants fed formula containing no LCPUFA. No research has addressed whether the average breast milk DHA milk results in optimal development of preterm infants. The focus of this thesis was to compare the efficacy and safety of supplementing preterm infants with milk containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at concentrations that meet the estimated in utero accretion rate (~1%) compared with current clinical practices (~0.3%). In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial (RCT), infants born &lt;33 weeks gestation were assigned to receive milk containing one of two doses of DHA. Treatment group infants received milk containing high dose DHA (1%) and infants in the control group infants received milk containing standard levels DHA (0.2 - 0.35%). Lactating mothers consumed capsules containing either tuna oil (900mg DHA) or soy oil (no DHA) that resulted in breast milk with either a high or typical concentration of DHA. Standard preterm formula milk with a corresponding DHA composition was fed to infants if formula feeds were required. The intervention period was from five days of commencing enteral feeds through to the infants estimated due date (EDD). Primary efficacy assessment was sweep visual evoked potential (VEP) acuity at 4 months corrected age (CA). Secondary efficacy outcomes included VEP acuity at 2 months CA and VEP latency at 2 and 4 months CA. Infant anthropometry was assessed regularly throughout the trial and the primary safety outcome was weight at 4 months CA. Other clinical safety data including incidence and severity of diseases commonly associated with prematurity were also assessed. The success of the intervention was demonstrated with infants in the treatment group having a significantly higher level of erythrocyte membrane DHA at EDD compared with the control group (% total erythrocyte phospholipids (mean &#177; SD), treatment group 6.8 &#177;1.2, control group 5.2 &#177; 0.7, p&lt;0.0005). The primary efficacy outcome of acuity at 4 months CA was significantly higher in the treatment compared with the control group infants (mean &#177; SD acuity (in cpd) treatment group 9.6 &#177; 3.7, control group 8.2 &#177; 1.8, p = 0.025). No significant differences were found in acuity at 2 months CA or latency at 2 or 4 months CA between infants in the control and treatment groups. No significant differences in weight, length or head circumference were found between treatment compared with control infants at EDD or at 4 months CA. Nor were any differences found in other clinical outcomes commonly associated with prematurity including, tolerance, necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or intraventricular haemorrhage. Increasing milk DHA to 1% of total fat suggests that the DHA requirement of preterm infants may be higher than the level available in preterm formula or breast milk of Australian women. Addressing both breast and formula milks demonstrates wide generalisability of these findings to common feeding practices in neonatal nurseries. Further studies are needed to determine whether this feeding strategy and dose of DHA is capable of improving other aspects of infant development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subject to change: nine constructions of the crossover between Western art and popular musics (1995-2005)</field><field name="creator">Millington, Aliese</field><field name="description">Exchange between musical cultures has always occurred, but in the age of the global music industry, marketing categories have multiplied and often created boundaries between musics. Today the term &#8220;crossover&#8221; is attached to many of the musical exchanges that occur across these boundaries. One such exchange is represented by the intersection between Western art music string instruments and popular musics. A well-known commercial niche, this particular crossover is often discussed in popular media, but has been examined by relatively few music scholars. By way of addressing this gap, this study considers the crossover between Western art music string instruments and popular musics in the context of extra-musical promotion and critical reception. It examines four artists in the period 1995 to 2005. These four examples are: U.K./Australian string group bond; Australian string group FourPlay; U.K. violinist Nigel Kennedy; and U.K. violinist Vanessa-Mae. It also draws on other relevant cases to illuminate the discussion. The primary aim of the study is to discover and analyse the complex ways that parties engage, consciously or unconsciously, with the term &#8220;crossover&#8221;. The inherent complexity of the term is not commonly captured by scholarly musical writing since crossover is often regarded simply as a marketing term. The study begins by establishing the scholarly and popular context of the crossover between the Western art music string tradition and popular forms. Nine constructions or layers of meaning evoked by the term &#8220;crossover&#8221; are then identified. In the context of each of these nine constructions, the work continues by exploring how the term &#8220;crossover&#8221; is used in the promotion and critical reception of the examples. It is argued that crossover is constructed as a marketing category, to mark individuality, to provide media shortcuts and signposts, to evoke associations of prestige and of credibility, to increase accessibility, to encourage confrontation and to take part in larger musical debates. This research thus identifies multiple layers of meaning evoked by the term that are &#8220;subject to change&#8221; and that, in turn, illuminate deeper social and cultural implications of &#8220;crossingover&#8221;, ones which no doubt themselves continue to change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crossover; western art music; popular music; classical vs pop; Vanessa-Mae; bond; FourPlay; Nigel Kennedy</field><field name="subject">Popular music and art music</field><field name="subject">Music Social aspects 20th century.</field><field name="subject">Music Social aspects 21st century.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of complement in immunity to Nippostrongylus brasiliensis.</field><field name="creator">Giacomin, Paul R.</field><field name="description">Approximately two billion people are infected with helminths worldwide. In order to develop a vaccine against these pathogens, more needs to be known about the immune response to helminths. Eosinophils are important for resistance to some helminth species and their recruitment to infected tissues, attachment to parasites and degranulation may all be critical processes for immunity. Complement may contribute to these processes via generation of chemotactic factors (C3a and C5a) or opsonisation of the parasite with C3b/iC3b. The importance of complement during helminth infection is unclear, though complement does promote leukocyte-mediated killing of several helminth species in vitro. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of complement in immunity of mice to Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, with a focus on whether complement facilitates eosinophildependent resistance to this parasite. A new fluorescence-based method for quantifying in vitro complement deposition and leukocyte adherence on N. brasiliensis was developed. C3 from human serum was deposited on infective-stage L3 via the classical or lectin complement pathways. In contrast, the alternative complement pathway mediated binding of mouse C3 and eosinophil-rich mouse peritoneal leukocytes to L3. Interestingly, the ability of complement and leukocytes to bind to the parasite changed as it matured. Larvae recovered from the skin 30 min post-injection (p.i.) were coated with C3, however those harvested 150 min p.i. exhibited reduced C3 binding capacity. Binding of C3 and eosinophils to larvae recovered from the lungs 24-48 h p.i. (L4) was also diminished compared to that seen on L3. Adult intestinal worms bound C3 and leukocytes only when treated ex vivo with serum and cells. Mice lacking in classical (C1q-deficient), alternative (factor B-deficient) or all complement pathways (C3-deficient) were then employed to determine if complement was important for resistance of mice to N. brasiliensis. IL-5 Tg mice deficient in individual complement genes were generated to assess whether complement contributed to eosinophildependent resistance to the parasite. Factor B deficient mice exhibited impaired C3 deposition on larvae, eosinophil recruitment, eosinophil degranulation and larval aggregation in the skin 30 min p.i. Eosinophil recruitment was similarly abolished by treatment of mice with the C5aR inhibitor PMX53. However at 150 min p.i., larval aggregation, eosinophil and neutrophil recruitment, leukocyte adherence and eosinophil degranulation were largely complement-independent. Ablation of factor B or C3 caused minor but significant increases in lung-larval burden during primary, but not in secondary, infections. Critically, a lack of C3 or factor B in IL-5 Tg mice failed to greatly impair the strong innate anti-parasite resistance typical of these animals, suggesting that eosinophils can provide immunity to N. brasiliensis infection in the absence of complement. This was unexpected, given the evidence from this and previous studies which suggested that in vitro, complement is important for promoting eosinophil-dependent killing of N. brasiliensis and other helminth species. The mechanism(s) by which eosinophils kill N. brasiliensis remain unknown, but may involve the coordination of the complement system with complement-independent factors that act in the early stages of infection. Critically, the influence of complement is limited, because soon after entry into the host, the parasite develops the ability to resist complement activation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complement; helminth; eosinophil; Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</field><field name="subject">Complement (Immunology) Helminthiasis.

A ubiquitination pathway was shown to be one of the key mechanisms which regulate carbon source utilization, when creB was found to encode a deubiquitinating enzyme. Strains containing mutations in creB show loss of repression for some metabolic pathways in carbon catabolite repressing conditions, and also grow very poorly on several sole carbon sources such as quinate and proline, suggesting CreB plays multiple roles in the cell. This work describes the analysis of the interaction of CreB with CreA, and with PrnB and QutD. Various epitope-tagged versions of CreA were expressed in A. nidulans, and an internally located HA-epitope tag was found to allow detection of CreA using Western analysis. A diploid strain was constructed between strains containing HA-tagged CreA and FLAG-tagged CreB. When CreB was immunoprecipitated, HA-tagged CreA was also precipitated in the diploid, indicating that CreA and CreB are present in a complex in vivo. To determine whether CreA is a ubiquitinated protein, a version of CreA that was tagged with both an HA epitope and a His-tag was expressed in A. nidulans, and protein extracts were precipitated with an UbiQapture&#8482;-Q matrix. Western analysis was used to show that CreA was present in the precipitate. These findings suggest that CreA is a ubiquitinated protein, and a target of the CreB deubiquitination enzyme. To determine whether the proline permease (PrnB) is a direct substrate of CreB, plasmids to express epitope-tagged versions of PrnB were constructed and introduced into the prnB mutant strain. No tagged protein could be detected by Western analysis, even when these constructs were over-expressed from the gpdA promoter. However, a construct to express an HA epitope tagged version of quinate permease (QutD) fully complemented the qutD mutant strain, and HA-tagged QutD could be easily detected in Western analysis when probed with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. A diploid strain was made between a complementing transformant and a strain expressing a FLAG-tagged CreB construct. When QutDHA was immunoprecipitated, CreBFLAG was detected in the immunoprecipitate of the diploid. A proportion of QutDHA was also co-precipitated in the diploid when CreBFLAG was immunoprecipitated. Thus, CreB is present in a complex with QutD in vivo. Further results showed that the concentration of QutD in the cell is lower in a creB null mutant background than in the wild-type background, indicating that deubiquitination is required to prevent protein turnover. Northern analysis of mRNA showed that the failure of creB mutant strains to grow on quinate medium was not due to a failure of transcriptional induction of qutD, as the amount of mRNA was not lower in a creB1937 mutant background compared to the wild-type. Furthermore, experiments were undertaken that showed that QutD is a ubiquitinated protein. These findings suggest that quinate permease is regulated through deubiquitination involving the CreB deubiquitination protein in A. nidulans. In addition to the candidate protein approach asking whether CreA is a substrate of CreB, a proteomics approach was also used to identify proteins that interact with CreA. However, no clear interacting proteins were identified using this approach.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ubiquitination; CreA; CreB; CreC; carbon catabolite repression; permease; PrnB; QutD</field><field name="subject">Aspergillus Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Aspergillus nidulans Molecular genetics.</field><field name="subject">Fungi Genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating existence: asylum seekers in East Anglia, UK.</field><field name="creator">Corfield, Sophia</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study of asylum seekers in East Anglia, UK, poses the following questions: how do asylum seekers adapt, cope and adjust to life in the UK when their future is so uncertain? To what extent do people seeking asylum relate to an asylum seeker identity? How do asylum seekers negotiate interactions with others as they await an outcome to their application for asylum? This study explores these questions in an effort to gain insight into the role of identity reconstruction during the process of asylum seeking. This thesis is based on twelve months of fieldwork in the towns of Norwich and Great Yarmouth, and to a lesser extent in Peterborough and London, where asylum seekers had been dispersed by either the London Boroughs or the Home Office&#8217;s NASS (National Asylum Support Service). During 2002 and 2003, I conducted fieldwork amongst asylum seekers, as well as amongst support workers working for various NGOs that offered a number of support services for asylum seekers. The focus on asylum seekers&#8217; speech-acts is a method to observe the primary form of social action by which asylum seekers articulate a shared place, liminal immigration system and interaction with others. These elements shape asylum seekers&#8217; identity in the UK. Consequently, asylum seekers&#8217; predicament can be understood as a movement through the immigration system, but also an existential movement as each person tries to negotiate their existence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asylum seekers; speech-acts; identity; United Kingdom; non-government organisations; immigration; place and space</field><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration Social aspects.</field><field name="subject">Refugees Legal status, laws, etc. Great Britain.</field><field name="subject">Identity (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FG Fantin: the life &amp; times of an Italo-Australian anarchist 1901-42.</field><field name="creator">Faber, David</field><field name="description">This thesis is inspired by the historical principles of RG Collingwood, an historiographer whose precepts are recurrently cited herein. It is the life and times style biography of Francesco Giovanni Fantin, born San Vito de Leguzzano in the Schio district of the Province of Vicenza in the Veneto region of Italy 20 January 1901, died Loveday Internment Camp Compound 14A, South Australia 16 November 1942. SA police at the time found that Fantin was assassinated by fascist conspirators who contrived to intimidate witnesses and interfere with material evidence, (findings here confirmed) frustrating the laying of a charge of murder and leading in March 1943 to the sentencing of Giovanni Casotti to two years hard labour for manslaughter in the Supreme Court of South Australia. (Casotti was subsequently deported.) This thesis begins with the reconstruction of Fantin&#8217;s origins in one of the rural crucibles of Italian capitalism and industrialism. The presence of anarchist traditions in the Province and in Fantin&#8217;s immediate circle in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is documented. The history of the Great War, the Red Biennium and the Rise of Fascism in the Schio district is then reconstructed in connection with Fantin&#8217;s formative years, with particular reference to the role of the textile strike of 1921 as the precursor to the political and mass emigration from the district to Australia of which Fantin was a humble protagonist. Fantin&#8217;s years as an antifascist activist in exile in Australia are then rehearsed as an essential prerequisite for understanding why he was selected for assassination. The thesis closes with a detailed reconstruction of how his death was encompassed and its political implications managed by Dr HV Evatt.

Although a single motor module fault tolerant drive may be sufficient in some applications, this motor drive only offers limited redundancy. This thesis investigated the dual motor module fault tolerant drive system in which two motor modules were connected electrically in phase and on a common shaft provide redundancy and to increase the reliability of the entire drive system. A general phase current mathematical model to produce the desired output torque was developed to minimize copper loss and torque ripple in the motor drive, which is applicable to both sinusoidal and trapezoidal brushless permanent magnet motor types. A detailed fault effect investigation was performed in this thesis and it is concluded that switch short-circuit fault is the most serious fault since it reduces the electromagnetic torque output significantly and generates larger torque ripple in the motor drive due to the presence of large drag torque. Three fault remedial strategies were proposed to compensate the torque loss and to reduce the torque ripple under different faulty conditions. It is concluded from the analytical results that fault remedial strategy 3 is the tradeoff algorithm in which the zero torque ripple factor can be achieved with only a modest increase in copper loss comparing with the minimum possible value. Two practical dual motor module fault tolerant brushless permanent magnet drive test arrangements with different motor structures were developed in this thesis. The computer simulation studies using the MATLAB Simulink were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault remedial strategies. The efficiency of the motor drive was predicted based on torque loss measurements and the results were verified in the simulation study. The effect of faults on the drive efficiency was investigated as well. The entire fault tolerant motor drive control system was also developed to verify the analytical and simulation results. A fault detection and identification method to detect switch open-circuit faults, switch short-circuit faults, and the winding short-circuit faults was also proposed. Its advantages are the simplicity of the implementation and reduction of the cost of the drive system.

Therefore, identification of these sideband frequencies can be used as a convenient and reliable approach to broken rotor bar fault diagnosis. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a conventional spectral analysis method used in this application. However, the use of DFT has several limitations. The most important one among them is the restriction of frequency resolution by window length. Due to this limitation, the accuracy of broken rotor bar detection can be highly affected in cases such as light machine load and limited data records. However, Prony's method for spectral analysis has the ability of overcoming the restriction of data window length on the frequency resolution, from which the DFT suffers. Such feature makes Prony's method a promising choice for broken rotor bar diagnosis when the machine is operating under light or varying load, or when only restricted data is available. In this thesis, I have demonstrated the implementation of this technique in the induction motor broken rotor bar detection, revealed its better performance than DFT in terms of maintaining high resolution in frequency domain whilst using a much shorter window, and analyzed the influential factors to the method of Prony Analysis (PA). In this thesis, an induction machine model that includes broken rotor bars is developed using Matlab/Simulink and verified by comparing the experimental and the simulated results. The Prony Analysis method for broken bar diagnosis is implemented and tested using both simulated and measured stator current data. Comparisons between PA and DFT results are presented, clearly indicating improvements of broken bar diagnostics using PA.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric machinery, Induction.</field><field name="subject">Fourier transformations.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quadrals and their associated subspaces.</field><field name="creator">Butler, David Keith</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns sets of points in the finite projective space PG(n,q) that are combinatorially identical to quadrics. A quadric is the set of points of PG(n,q) whose coordinates satisfy a quadradic equation, and the term quadral is used in this thesis to mean a set of points with all the combinatorial properties of a quadric. Most of the thesis concerns the characterisation of certain sets of subspaces associated with quadrals. Characterisations are proved for the external lines of an oval cone in PG(3,q), of a non-singular quadric in PG(4,q), q even, and of a large class of cones in PG(n,q), q even. Characterisations are also proved for the planes meeting the non-singular quadric of PG(4,q) in a non-singular conic, and for the tangents and generator lines of this quadric for q odd. The second part of the thesis is concerned with the intersection of ovoids of PG(3,q). A new bound is proved on the number of points two ovoids can share, and configurations of secants and external lines that two ovoids can share are determined. The structure of ovoidal fibrations is discussed, and this is used to prove new results on the intersection of two ovoids sharing all of their tangents.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geometry, projective.</field><field name="subject">Quadrics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functions of Walkman music.</field><field name="creator">Williams, Andrew Paul</field><field name="description">Since its release in 1979, the Walkman has engendered new modes of musical experience for millions of listeners. Its portability and the apparent isolation offered by its headphones enable Walkman users to listen to music in situations where it would otherwise be impossible. They can also use Walkman Music to achieve outcomes for which other forms of music may not be suited. Eleven functions of Walkman Music, ten adapted from Michael Bull's (2000) strategies of Walkman use and one derived from this study's fieldwork results, are examined here. Following Timothy Rice's (1987) model for ethnomusicological study, the functions' origins in historical musical practice are investigated, as well as their maintenance in social interaction and listeners' individual experience of them. This study demonstrates Walkman listeners are focussed entirely on their Walkman Music in only two functions, either enjoying it or trying to learn it. Four functions involve Walkman listeners' interactions with their surroundings &#8211; namely, listeners use Walkman Music to control their environments' soundscapes, to ease their negotiation of places they consider unpleasant, to control personal interactions and, in combination with their surroundings, Walkman Music gives listeners the impression they are viewing or acting in a film for which their music is the soundtrack. Listeners use Walkman Music for its effects on themselves in five functions. They choose rhythmic music for motivation during exercise or music which will influence their mood. Listeners also use Walkman Music to simulate the presence of a companion or because they consider it a more enjoyable or productive use of time they would otherwise consider wasted. Finally, Walkman Music can prompt listeners' memories of past events. While similar observations have been made in previous studies and particularly by Bull, music's role has not been appropriately acknowledged. This study's examination of Walkman Music in terms of the functions it fulfils for listeners corrects this imbalance. Observations in the literature relating to Walkman use are tested for their resonance with Walkman listeners in ethnographic interviews conducted in Adelaide, Australia. Conclusions are drawn regarding the degree of isolation listeners actually achieve from their surroundings and also regarding the relative novelty or otherwise of the uses to which listeners put their Walkman Music.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical investigations of the performance and effectiveness of thermoacoustic couples.</field><field name="creator">Zoontjens, Luke</field><field name="description">Thermoacoustics is a field of study which includes devices purpose-built to exploit the phenomenal interaction between heat and sound. Thermoacoustics has been demonstrated as an effective technology which can potentially serve a variety of purposes such as cryogenics, cost-effective domestic refrigeration or electricity generation, without adverse environmental impact or commercial drawbacks such as expensive construction or maintenance costs or high part counts. The mechanisms by which thermoacoustic devices operate at low amplitudes have been identified and effective design tools and methods are available, but the precise heat and mass transfer which occurs deep inside the core of thermoacoustic devices at high amplitudes cannot at present be precisely determined experimentally, and to date have been estimated using only relatively simple or one-dimensional computational domains. It is expected that thermoacoustic devices will need to operate at relatively high pressure amplitudes for commercial and practical applications, to achieve power densities similar to competing technologies. Clearly, advancement of these models and the methods used to investigate them will enable a better understanding of the precise heat and mass transfer that occurs within such devices. Previous numerical studies have modelled a &#8216;thermoacoustic couple&#8217; which consists of a single or several plates (often modelled with zero thickness) and channels within an oscillatory pressure field. In this thesis several improvements to the &#8216;thermoacoustic couple&#8217; modelspace are introduced and modelled, and compared with published results. Using the commercial CFD software Fluent, a two-dimensional, segregated and second-order implicit numerical model was developed which solves equations for continuity of mass, momentum and energy. These equations were computed using second-order and double-precision discretisation of time, flow variables and energy. A computational domain is presented which is capable of modelling plates of zero or non-zero thickness, is &#8216;self-resonant&#8217; and able to capture the entrance and exit effects at the stack plate edges. Studies are presented in which the acoustic pressure amplitude, the thickness of the plate (&#8216;blockage ratio&#8217;) and the shape of the plate are varied to determine their influence upon the rate of effective heat transfer, flow structure and overall efficiency. The modelling of thermoacoustic couples with finite thickness presented in this thesis demonstrates that the finite thickness produces new results which show significant disturbances to the flow field and changes to the expected rate and distribution of heat flux along the stack plate. Results indicate that the thickness of the plate, t[subscript]s, strongly controls the generation of vortices outside the stack region and perturbs the flow structure and heat flux distribution at the extremities of the plate. Increases in t[subscript]s are also shown to improve the integral of the total heat transfer rate but at the expense of increased entropy generation. Another contribution of this thesis is the study of the effect that leading and trailing edge shapes of stack plates have on the performance of a thermoacoustic couple. In practice, typical parallel or rectangular section stack plates do not have perfectly square edges. The existing literature considers only rectangular or zero-thickness (1-D) plates. Hence a study was performed to evaluate the potential for gains in performance from the use of non-rectangular cross sections, such as rounded, aerofoil or bulbous shaped edges. Consideration of various types of stack plate edges show that performance improvements can be made from certain treatments to the stack plate tips or if possible, stack plate profiles. This thesis also considers the influence of thermophysical properties and phenomena associated with practical thermoacoustic devices to investigate the applicability of the numerical model to experimental outcomes. Comparisons made between results obtained using the numerical model, linear numerical formulations and experimental results suggest that the numerical model allows comparative study of various thermoacoustic systems for design purposes but is not yet of sufficient scope to fully characterise a realistic system and predict absolute levels of performance. However, the presented method of modelling thermoacoustic couples yields increased insight and detail of flow regimes and heat transportation over previous studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermoacoustics; heat; sound; thermoacoustic couples; heat exchangers; acoustic streaming; sustainable; climate change</field><field name="subject">Heat.</field><field name="subject">Sound.</field><field name="subject">Heat exchangers.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analysis of the deubiquitylating enzyme fat facets in mouse in protein trafficking.</field><field name="creator">Prodoehl, Mark</field><field name="description">Fat facets in Mouse (FAM) or mUSP9x is a deubiquitylating enzyme of the USP class. Knockdown of FAM protein levels in mouse pre-implantation embryos by antisense oligonucleotides is known to prevent embryos from progressing to the blastocyst stage indicating an important role for FAM in early mammalian development. In mammals, the Fam gene is located on the X-chromosome. In mice, the Y homologue, Dffry or usp9y, is expressed exclusively in the testes and maps to the Sxrb deletion (Brown et al., 1998). Sxrb is associated with an early post-natal blockage of spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation leading to absence of germ cells (Bishop et al., 1988; Mardon et al., 1989). The human Y homologue of Fam is closely associated with oligozoospermia (Sargent et al., 1999; Sun et al., 1999) and the human X homologue has been linked to the failure of oocytes to pass through the first meitoc prophase in Turner syndrome (Cockwell et al., 1991; Speed, 1986) Despite these associations, the substrates and precise role of Fam and its homologues in these processes have not yet been defined. Due to the complex nature of Fam expression and the lack of data tying FAM to specific cellular functions, much attention has been paid in identifying interacting partners and cellular targets of FAM activity to aid in the definition of its role in the cell and development. Three common molecular biology techniques were applied here in an attempt to further characterise known interactions of FAM, including interactions with the cell adhesion molecule &#946;-catenin and the protein trafficking pathway proteins epsin-1 and itch. The aim of these investigations was to generate FAM mutants that could abolish individual interactions, enabling investigation of individual interactions in cellular function and development. These experiments failed to identify the amino acids of FAM that were critical for its interactions with &#946;-catenin, epsin-1, or itch. Experiments aimed at characterising a novel ubiquitin-like domain located in the N-terminal half of the FAM protein, did however identify novel interactions of FAM with the three Golgi associated adaptor proteins GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3. Further investigations prompted by this interaction, examined the role of FAM in the trafficking of proteins from the Golgi apparatus. Cellular FAM protein levels were altered either by exogenous expression of FAM protein or knockdown of endogenous FAM using FAM specific shRNA triggers. The cellular protein levels and extent of post-translational modification of eleven lysosomal proteins were monitored in each case. It was found that increased FAM protein levels resulted in decreased cellular protein levels of five of the eleven lysosomal proteins studied. In contrast, a reduction in FAM protein levels was found to result in an increase in the cellular protein levels of eight of the eleven lysosomal proteins. This study provides the first evidence of a deubiquitylating enzyme that is able to interact with the GGA proteins. It is also the first to describe a deubiquitylating enzyme that can affect the biosynthesis of lysosomal proteins and provides valuable new insight into the cellular function of FAM/USP9X.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deubiquitylation; protein trafficking; lysomal hydrolase</field><field name="subject">Lysosomes.</field><field name="subject">Proteins.</field><field name="subject">Enzymes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The roles of seed banks and soil moisture in recruitment of semi-arid floodplain plants: the River Murray, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Jensen, Anne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The decline of floodplain vegetation along the Lower River Murray, South Australia, has evoked recommendations for &#8216;environmental flows&#8217; to restore and maintain the health of the ecosystem. To assist managers to maximize benefits from environmental flows, this thesis considers the significance of water for germination and recruitment in key floodplain plant species. Three dominant species are considered, including two trees, river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and black box (E. largiflorens), and an understorey shrub, tangled lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta). The soil seed bank was dominated by terrestrial annual native plants. Among 1400 seedlings, a single river red gum was found, and no black box or lignum, suggesting that these species do not contribute to the persistent soil seed bank and rely instead on aerial seed banks (serotiny). Sampling of the soil seed bank was continued to determine when seed fall might coincide with appropriate soil moisture conditions. Responses of the soil seed bank to varied water regimes were compared to determine requirements for seedling survival. The results indicated that species richness, rapidity of response and survival time were all promoted by sustained soil moisture. Stands of eucalypts in various states of health (from very stressed to very healthy) were monitored to identify seasonal patterns in bud crops, flowering, fresh leaves and volumes of seed released from the aerial seed bank. Distinct seasonal phenological patterns were apparent, and suggested alternating flowering among individual trees (biennial for red gum, bi-annual for black box), producing an annual peak in summer. Peak seed rain occurred in summer (December&#8211;March) in healthy trees for both red gum and black box, with light seed rain continuing throughout the year. Seed fall from stressed trees was much reduced. Stressed trees responded after a second watering event, with much more varied and extended annual seed fall patterns. Lignum showed a spring peak in flowering and seed production. There was a prolific response of flowering and seeding to rainfall, but few seedlings survived. Vigorous vegetative growth occurred in existing plants in response to rainfall and watering but no new cloned plants were found during the study. An investigation of chromosomes as a potential tool to appraise the balance between sexual and asexual reproduction in lignum proved inconclusive, although a previous report of octoploidy in lignum was confirmed. Seeds from all three species and lignum cuttings were tested for their responses to varied watering regimes, based on combinations of simulated rain and flood conditions. The optimal soil moisture for continued growth and survival in all seeds and cuttings was 10 25%, with moisture values &lt;10% causing wilting and death. The results also suggested that red gum and black box seeds which germinate in water under flooded conditions need to be stranded onto moist soil at the water&#8217;s edge within 10 days, for the seedling to continue to grow. It was also concluded that germination on rain-moistened soil is a key supplementary mechanism for recruitment, particularly between irregular flood events. For greatest benefit, the timing of environmental flows should complement any seasonal rainfall and irregular flooding that may occur. Extension of suitable soil moisture conditions (10-25%) for as long as possible after &gt;5 mm rainfall, or after over-bank flows, would increase chances for survival of seedlings. December is the most likely month for maximal benefit from watering in the Lower Murray Valley, for germination and recruitment, based on regional rainfall and flooding patterns.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eucalypt; floodplain; environmental flows; lignum; soil moisture; seed banks; hydrochory; serotiny; Murray-Darling Basin; water regime; reparian; recruitment</field><field name="subject">Soil seed banks South Australia Murray River Region</field><field name="subject">Floodplain plants South Australia Murray River Region</field><field name="subject">Soil moisture South Australia Murray River Region</field><field name="subject">Soils South Australia Murray River Region</field><field name="subject">Murray River Watershed (N.S.W.-S.

The novel begins with a bus crash on a city freeway, and the narrator, who we later learn is Bel, unfolds the story that leads up to the crash. There are many plotlines that run through the novel, narrated in a variety of voices by Bel. She tells the story of her step-sister, who witnessed the September 11 attack from a distance (in Queens). She reveals her sister's story in the weeks following the attack. Diane is inspired by the image of one of the victims of the attack, a woman named Sena. She sees her photo in one of the desperate fliers that popped up around the city after the attack, and recognises a bracelet the woman is wearing as similar to one owned by her mother. Diane acts on an impulsive idea to somehow bring redemption to the family of this woman by creating a false photograph of the bracelet at Ground Zero, but she is detained by the National Guard. This is an incident that leads to her mother's decision to return to Australia to live. Back in Australia, Diane makes contact with her father, who is distant and dishonest with her. Diane asks to see her younger step-sister, Bel, but she is met with strong resistance. It is obvious that she is being kept from her sister. Bel also learns that her step-sister is back, but her attempts to make contact are blocked by her parents. Eventually the two sisters get together, and the younger forms a fascination and powerful admiration for her older sister, who is now a photographer. She takes images of men she has never met and posts them on her website with emotive labels such as 'victim' or 'terrorist'. Bel's fascination with her older sister leads her to want to emulate her. She sets out to take a photograph of a stranger, and stalks a young man for two days, working up the courage to approach him and interact with him. The fact that she wants to interact with her subject creates tension with her sister, who never speaks with her subjects. They argue about Bel's safety and Diane's courage. Bel eventually approaches the young man, Robert, and forms a connection with him. The coming together of these three characters sets in motion an idea, impulsive and provocative, driven by Bel, to create an artificial moment of terror on a bus as a means to shock the passengers and shake them from a 'dream'. This story is told through counter-voices that offer harmony and dissonance, and at times perspective, to the unfolding plotline. There is Shahrazade, an evocation of Bel's imagination, who is the ultimate in the courageous storyteller. Shahrazade uses narrative to divert her audience away from murderous revenge and into empathic connection. There are the short passages depicting the moments in the bus from the points of view of several passengers. There are the chapters where Bel is interrogated by two police officers, who slowly slide from being realistic characters to figments of Bel's overactive imagination. At the beginning of the novel, Bel tells the reader, 'You are witness to a tragedy, but you don&#8217;t call it that.' (Bone 2008) By the end, the verdict is left open. Are the three guilty of creating terror on the bus? Was it a tragedy? Is there redemption in the act of telling a story? The exegetical component of this thesis explores the social, literary and political context of the writing of 'Snap Shot'. It is in three parts, predicated on my research enquiry about the nature of the world we now live in post-September 11, a day that was supposed to have changed history. I explore whether there is a consistent and unified narrative that, as members of the public, we are engaging with. I look at the use of fear by the terrorists, and explore how this fear has manifested itself post-September 11. I ask whether there is an ongoing narrative of fear, and if so, what is its nature? How is it perpetuated? How does the public engage with this narrative? And what implications does this have for the writing of 'Snap Shot'? I explore literary and artistic responses to September 11, and explore the role of the artist as provocateur. What are the taboos and sore points that provocative art can touch on when looking at the subject of the world that has emerged post-September 11? The exegesis also explores how fear and terror are communicated, with a particular reference to symbolism and frames. What imaginings emerged from the subterranean consciousness prior to September 11, and what imaginings are at play today? Significantly, I explore what implications this imagination has for communicating an anti-terrorism message within the context of writing 'Snap Shot'.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative writing; fiction; young adult; terrorism; September 11; World Trade Centre attack; photography; fear; post-9-11 politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The poetics of Libretti: reading the opera works of Gwen Harwood and Larry Sitsky.</field><field name="creator">Wood, Alison J.E.</field><field name="description">Gwen Harwood is one of Australia&#8217;s most celebrated poets. Her longstanding collaboration with composer Larry Sitsky produced six substantial operas between 1963 and 1982; Fall of the House of Usher (1965); Lenz (1970); Fiery Tales (1975, based on Chaucer&#8217;s Canterbury Tales and excerpts from Boccaccio&#8217;s Decameron); Voices in Limbo (1977); The Golem (1980, first performed in 1993); and De Profundis (1982, a setting of Oscar Wilde&#8217;s letters). Both Harwood and her critics acknowledge the libretti as some of her best writing (Harwood cites her libretto for Lenz as her &#8216;selected poem&#8217;); to date, there has been no major study of these works. This thesis engages with Harwood&#8217;s opera texts, arguing for readings that are neither atomist nor reductive but jointly focused on both the effect of the text and the mechanics of its production. It begins by outlining the theoretical terrain of words and music studies and establishes an approach to Harwood and Sitsky&#8217;s operas based on the idea that opera&#8217;s textual exaggeration is a function of its multiple critical components; that is, the intersection of words and music, collaborative authorship, and dramatic language. The thesis then offers focused studies of each of these aspects in Harwood and Sitsky&#8217;s works, constructing a literary picture of the opera texts. Primary sources include the scores of the operas (usually copies of the composer&#8217;s autograph), selected correspondence between Sitsky and Harwood, drafts and typescripts of the libretti (held in the National Library, Canberra, and the Fryer Library, University of Queensland), and selected essays by Harwood on her words for music.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gwen Harwood; Larry Sitsky; words and music; Australian opera; Libretti; Australian poetry</field><field name="subject">Harwood, Gwen, 1920-1995 Musical settings History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Sitsky, Larry, 1934-</field><field name="subject">Operas Librettos.</field><field name="subject">Libretto.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) on oesophageal cancer.</field><field name="creator">Liu, Jun-Feng</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to investigate COX-2 expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus (SCC), and the potential of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit the action of the enzyme, for chemoprevention of this cancer. The epidemiology of SCC and the outcome from surgery for this disease in Hebei Province, China, were reviewed. The rate of postoperative complications and deaths following oesophagectomy fell steadily over the last five decades, but the long-term survival remained disappointing. Improved survival is likely to be dependent on earlier diagnosis and better adjunctive therapies. Tissue was obtained from patients who had an oesophagectomy for SCC over 20 years earlier. The expression of COX-2 was elevated and correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastases. Survival was longer in those patients whose tumours expressed lower levels of COX-2. The mechanism of action of aspirin, a non-selective COX inhibitor, and NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, was investigated in vitro. Both drugs inhibited the proliferation of and induced apoptosis in the SCC cell line TE-13. These changes correlated with a reduction in COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, prostaglandin synthesis, inhibition of NF-KappaB nuclear translocation and an increase in cytoplasmic IKappaB. Similar changes were seen in tumour tissue resected from patients given the selective COX-2 inhibitor Mobic daily for 14 days before surgery. These results suggested that aspirin and similar drugs might have value in cancer therapy. A clinical trial was established to determine if treatment with aspirin post-operatively would improve survival of patients who had had an oesophagectomy for SCC. Preliminary results suggested that treatment had no effect on survival in patients operated on for SCC.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Esophagus Diseases.</field><field name="subject">Cancer Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Chemotherapy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monogeneans of the Southern Fiddler Ray, Trygonorrhina Fasciata (Rhinobatidae) in South Australia: an exceptional model to compare parasite life history traits, invasion strategies and host specificity.</field><field name="creator">Glennon, Vanessa</field><field name="description">Trygonorrhina fasciata (Rhinobatidae) specimens naturally infected by three monogenean species were captured and maintained in marine aquaria to promote a continuous parasite load. Monogenean eggs recovered from aquaria provided larvae for descriptions and life history experiments. I describe the adult, larva and post-larval development of a new species of hexabothriid, Branchotenthes octohamatus, from the gills. This is the first monogenean larva described with only eight hooklets. This character may be useful to help resolve problematic relationships within the Hexabothriidae and offers insight into more general hypotheses about relationships within the Monogenea. I also redescribe the adult of Calicotyle australis (Monocotylidae) from the cloaca and describe the larva. The number and arrangement of larval ciliated epidermal cells and sensilla was revealed using silver nitrate. I redescribe Pseudoleptobothrium aptychotremae (Microbothriidae) adults from the skin of T. fasciata, representing a new host and locality record. Larval anatomy and post-larval development are also documented. The presence of six needle-like spicules in the larval haptor is confirmed, supporting an earlier theory that spicules are ancestral vestiges. My studies revealed three different egg hatching, host finding strategies and larval &#8216;types&#8217;. Branchotenthes octohamatus has a &#8216;sit-and-wait&#8217; strategy, entirely dependent on mechanical disturbance to stimulate eggs to hatch. Larvae are unciliated, cannot swim, lack pigmented eyespots and show no photo-response but may survive for more than two days after hatching at 22&#186;C. In contrast, eggs of C. australis hatch spontaneously with a strong diurnal rhythm in the first few hours of daylight when exposed to a LD12:12 illumination regime. Larvae are ciliated and can swim, have pigmented eyespots, are photo-positive and can remain active and survive for up to 24 h after hatching at 22&#186;C. Eggs of P. aptychotremae may have a &#8216;bet-hedging&#8217; strategy. Some eggs hatch spontaneously and rhythmically in an LD12:12 regime during the last few hours of daylight but their low hatching success rate suggests that other eggs may require a different cue provided by the host. Larvae are ciliated, can swim, lack pigmented eyespots, show no photo-response and remain active for only a few hours at 22&#186;C. Experiments using the fluorescent dye, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE) revealed B. octohamatus on gills of T. fasciata within 30 min of exposure to the host. This provides strong evidence that larvae invade the gills directly via the host&#8217;s inhalant respiratory current and do not migrate after initial attachment elsewhere. Five rhinobatid species (Aptychotrema vincentiana, T. fasciata, Trygonorrhina sp. A, A. rostrata and Rhinobatos typus), with overlapping distributions spanning west, south and east Australian coastal waters were surveyed for monogeneans at four locations between Fremantle, Western Australia and Stradbroke Island, Queensland. Genetic homogeneity, using the mitochrondrial gene Cytochrome b (cytb) and the nuclear marker, Elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1a), was observed for all Branchotenthes and Calicotyle specimens irrespective of collection locality or rhinobatid species. Genetic homogeneity was observed for Pseudoleptobothrium specimens collected in western and southern Australia. However, local genetic heterogeneity was apparent among Pseudoleptobothrium specimens collected from two sympatric host species in New South Wales. Analyses revealed a highly divergent clade, indicating a morphologically cryptic, ancestral species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monogenea; Rhinobatidae; Trygonorrhina fasciata; marine; ectoparasite; hexabothriid; monocotylid; microbothriid; life histories; host specificity; hatching strategies; infection biology</field><field name="subject">Rays (Fishes) -- Parasites.</field><field name="subject">Rays (Fishes) -- Parasites -- Identification.</field><field name="subject">Rays (Fishes) -- Parasites -- Life cycles.</field><field name="subject">Ectoparasitic infestations.</field><field name="subject">Infection.</field><field name="subject">Host-parasite relationships.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life cycle assessment comparison between Pepfactant&#174; and chemical surfactant production.</field><field name="creator">Huang, Huai</field><field name="description">Recently designed Pepfactants&#174; are an innovative type of nano-technological products, which could potentially replace conventional surfactants in broad-ranging applications.

To find the environmental shortcomings of the proposed manufacturing process for Pepfactant&#174; AM1, the LCA outcomes were compared with published life cycle information of traditional chemical surfactant Lineal Alkylbenzene Sulphonate (LAS) production. Following LCA methodology, a life cycle inventory was compiled based on the simulated AM1 manufacture, which determined the environmental impact assessment for both AM1 and LAS production. In the LCA boundaries disregarding the usage of both surfactants, the quantitative LCA comparison results indicated that raw material and energy requirements of AM1 manufacture were much higher than LAS production, estimated to be 3,186 t/t AM1 against 31.1t/t LAS and 1,564,000MJ/t AM1 against 69,870MJ/t LAS respectively. Additionally, compared with LAS production, enormous water consumption (2,651 t/t AM1) and CO2 emission (522 t/t AM1) were also shown to be severe environmental problems for AM1 manufacture. Furthermore, the AM1 manufacture presents apparent problems with environmental impacts of nutrification, human toxicity, photochemical oxidant formation and acidification in comparison with LAS production. Other than providing the optimisation point in the view of environmental impacts for Pepfactant&#174; AM1 manufacture, the results of experimental work in this project showed that as the surfactant concentration increases a greater foam height of Pepfactant&#174; AM1 was achieved than when (from 7mm to 52mm between 15&#956;M and 100&#956;M) compared with LAS (from 8mm to 53mm between 31.3&#956;M and 2,000&#956;M) in the same aeration duration. This result demonstrated the great potential of AM1 to replace LAS based on the LCA functional unit &#8211; 1 tonne of products. The experiments results implied that 1 tonne of AM1 is able to have the same foaming ability as approximate 25 tonnes of LAS. Consequently, the environmental impacts from Pepfactant&#174; AM1 manufacture are reduced by 25 times in the extended LCA boundaries linked to the quantitative usage comparison of these two surfactants.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LCA; Pepfactant; production; surfactant</field><field name="subject">Surface active agents Environmental aspects.

However, current understanding regarding the determinants of variability in the levels of distress among women undergoing infertility treatment is limited; and the evidence of the significance of distress as a risk factor for assisted conception following IVF/ICSI is inconsistent. The thesis addressed both these issues. Overall the thesis is informed by the biopsychosocial model of health and illness. Four studies were conducted. The data was collected in three IVF clinics in India. A consecutive sample of 85 infertile women about to commence IVF/ICSI cycle was recruited in the project at cycle baseline and followed through one treatment cycle. The first two studies examined this sample of women at baseline to identify the biopsychosocial factors associated with infertility related distress. The first study examined the degree of cognitive&#8211;behavioural adjustment to infertility, its treatment and treatment related eventualities, while the second study focused on the factors associated with affective aspects of infertility related distress such as increase in negativity and decrease in positivity. The third study examined the pattern of change in stress operationalized in terms of changes in Affect and State Anxiety in a sample of 74 infertile women during an IVF/ICSI cycle. The final study developed a prognostic model for evaluating the unique contribution of baseline distress as well as treatment related stress in estimating the odds of pregnancy following IVF based on a consecutive sample of 73 women. Collectively, the first two studies indicate that at the outset of the IVF/ICSI cycle, some women are more prone to distress than others, and that this variability is associated with their intrapersonal, interpersonal and sociodemographic attributes. These two studies have identified a set of protective and vulnerability factors related to cognitive-behavioural and affective aspects of distress. The last two studies clearly indicate that the level of distress tends to rise during the treatment among the majority of infertile women. The rising trend continued to be significant even after controlling for variables known to somewhat influence infertility related distress such as age, education, occupation, employment, financial burden and etiological factors. Further, a prognostic model is developed that proposes that both baseline level of stress and treatment stress make a unique contribution in defining the odds of pregnancy outcome for the patients. In short the thesis clearly brings out the case for integrating psychosocial care with the routine medical interventions for infertility.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stress; infertility; treatment stress; biopsychosocial psychological; India</field><field name="subject">Infertility Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Human reproductive technology Psychological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transcripted response of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to boron toxicity.</field><field name="creator">Hassan, Mahmood</field><field name="description">The occurrence of Boron (B) toxicity in Australian soils is recognised as a limiting factor for cereal productivity. A number of loci conferring tolerance to B toxicity have been identified in barley and chromosomally mapped. However, a lack of knowledge relating to the physiological and molecular events that occur under B toxicity and the molecular basis for B stress tolerance has been a bottleneck in harnessing available genetic diversity in barley and wheat. The recent advances in functional genomics provided an opportunity to examine B stress in barley in more detail. The aim of this project was to analyse genes differentially expressed under B stress in tolerant and intolerant barley to identify candidate genes involved in B toxicity tolerance. Two experimental approaches, Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) and microarray were adopted. Firstly, SSH was performed to examine gene expression in roots of selected tolerant and intolerant doubled haploid lines from a Clipper (B intolerant) X Sahara 3771 (B tolerant) mapping population, grown under moderate B stress. The SSH experiment aimed to investigate the early transcriptional response of B tolerant barley lines to B stress in order to identify the basis for B toxicity tolerance in roots. Differential screening of the subtracted library generated from B treated plants identified a total of 111 non-redundant clones up-regulated in bulked tolerant lines. On the other hand 94 clones were differentially expressed under non-treated conditions. Among the clones identified from subtracted library generated from B treated plants, metabolism was the largest functional category, representing 21% of the clones. The largest functional category in the subtracted library generated from non treated plants was cellular transport, representing 19% of the clones. Based on sequence similarity, about 170 transcripts identified in this experiment were assigned to chromosomal segments (bins) on the three homoeologous genomes of bread wheat. In total, 36 clones from the subtracted library generated from B treated plants were analysed as candidates. Nine were genetically mapped within the region of B tolerance QTL on three chromosomes (2H, 4H and 6H). The genes mapped to 4H and 6H QTL have the highest association with these loci in the Clipper X Sahara 3771 doubled haploid mapping population. A 4H B tolerance QTL candidate gene was identified as a B transporter gene with similarity to the Arabidopsis BOR1 gene. Genes identified to be differentially expressed in the tolerant lines from SSH suggest activation of a diverse defence response in the roots of barley plants under B stress. Data from SSH experiment indicate that cell wall-plasma membrane cytoskeleton continuum constitute the first action site against B toxicity and the influence of toxic B on K+ uptake could be the key initiating factor. In the second approach, the Affymetrix 22K Barley1 GeneChip(TM) was used to investigate B stress adaptation processes in barley. Gene expression was profiled in leaves of Sahara 3771 and Clipper plants grown under various B concentrations. The results show that the two genotypes respond differently to B toxicity. The B intolerance of Clipper is expressed through the induction of a high number of probe sets (2310) even at a low B concentration of 100 &#181;M. In contrast, Sahara 3771 responded to a high B concentration (2000 &#181;M) through the induction of only a few hundred (266) probe sets. In Sahara 3771 no change in the expression level of any probe sets was observed at 100 &#181;M B. Altogether 286 probe sets showed differential expression in Sahara 3771 under three levels of B treatment (500, 1000 and 2000 &#181;M). About 30% of these were down-regulated and about 70% were up-regulated in Sahara 3771 in response to B treatment. Most of the probe sets (59%) up-regulated in Sahara 3771 did not respond to B treatment in Clipper. These genes are either salt stress responsive or related to plant defense and thus could play a key role in protecting barley plants from the toxic effects of B. Two differentially expressed probe sets annotated as B transporters were identified between Sahara 3771 and Clipper under control condition. These two B transporter probe sets did not respond to B treatment but showed opposing expression patterns in the two varieties. One of these probe sets (Contig21126_at) is similar to the B transporter gene isolated from the SSH experiment that maps to the 4H tolerance locus. The map location and expression of this B transporter gene suggest that it could be the borate anion efflux transporter predicted by the proposed efflux model of B tolerance in Sahara 3771 barley. The other B transporter gene (Contig14139_at) showed over expression in Clipper under control condition and could be contributing to high B accumulation in Clipper which needs further investigation. Data from both experiments have indicated that B toxicity triggers oxidative stress and that jasmonate-based signaling plays a key role in B toxicity tolerance. SSH data indicate that Sahara 3771 which evolved in the harsh environment of Africa is more efficient in osmoregulation and ROS scavenging than Clipper. This trait is likely to give Sahara 3771 an edge over Clipper in tolerating toxic the effect of B. In addition to the efflux mechanism, which becomes less efficient with increasing B supply, Sahara 3771 appears to apply a number of other mechanisms for alleviating or withstanding toxic B induced stress to sustain growth. Some of these mechanisms are already known to be used by plants to cope with a number of stresses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">barley; B toxicity; transcriptomics; SSH; microarray; tolerance</field><field name="subject">Barley -- Biotechnology.</field><field name="subject">Barley -- Breeding.</field><field name="subject">Barley -- Hybridization</field><field name="subject">Barley -- Disease and pest resistance -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Boron in agriculture.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the born global : understanding the internationalisation process of biotechnology ventures.</field><field name="creator">Hewerdine, Lisa Jane</field><field name="description">The past decade has seen a surge of interest in &#8216;born global&#8217; firms which internationalise rapidly following their inception. While born global internationalisation paths are commonly associated with high tech firms, there has been some limited research suggesting that biotech ventures do not fit this model. My aim, therefore, was to contribute to international business research by investigating whether biotech firms internationalise as is suggested by born global scholars. Accordingly, my research focused on examining how the internationalisation of these small firms with radical innovations might best be explained. My research proceeded by means of a comparative case study of four Australian biotech companies, with their internationalisation histories forming the focal unit of analysis. The first contribution resulting from my cross-case analysis is to show that oversimplified measures of firm inception have led to &#8216;conceptual stretching&#8217; of the born global category. This does not imply that born globals do not exist; rather; I argue that greater care needs to be applied when measuring inception. Ultimately, biotech firms do not fit easily into the born global category because the lengthy innovation process they undergo means they are likely to have strong pre-organisational roots extending far beyond their incorporation date. This pre-organisational history needs to be factored in because of its effects on firm internationalisation. My second contribution is to suggest a driver for internationalisation that to date has not been included in existing research into high tech firms: namely, the influence of the innovation process. The internationalisation decisions of the case firms could be explained to a large extent by the stage that their core technologies were at. The international partnerships that the firms signed were also very much affected by the uncertainties surrounding the intellectual property being exchanged. My contribution therefore lies in proposing that incorporating the innovation process can advance understanding of high tech internationalisation. I conclude by suggesting that theory development concerning high tech internationalisation should pursue further these linkages between innovation and internationalisation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">born global; biotechnology; international entrepreneurship</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of dietary Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on experimental periodontitis lesions in the mouse.</field><field name="creator">Bendyk, Andrzej</field><field name="description">Periodontitis is an infective disease caused predominantly by gram negative anaerobic bacteria. However it is apparent that alveolar bone loss, which characterises periodontitis, is a result of the host inflammatory response to pathogenic bacteria, not the infectious agents directly. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O-3 PUFAs) are recognised, and used widely, for their anti-inflammatory effects. Evidence is emerging that their oxygenated derivatives are key chemical mediators in the resolution of inflammation. We hypothesised that dietary supplementation with fish oil rich in the O-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid would modify inflammatory reactions within the periodontium and thus reduce alveolar bone loss in mice infected with periodontopathic bacteria. Eighty mice were fed experimental diets containing either 10% tuna oil (40) or a sunola oil (40) which contained no traceable O-3 PUFAs for 57 days. After two weeks each dietary set was split into four groups of ten mice, with these groups being inoculated with either a) Porphyromas gingivalis b) P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum (combined inoculum) c) Carboxymethylcellulose (control) or d) No inoculations (control). Of the twenty mice which received no inoculations, half were sacrificed after fifteen days and half at the end of the experiment to enable comparative fatty acid analysis of the oral soft tissues. Results demonstrated that eicosapentoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were found in significantly higher proportions in the oral soft tissues of mice fed a tuna oil diet, and that animals receiving this diet exhibited an average of 54 - 72% less alveolar bone resorption in response to the different bacterial infections. Irrespective of diet, the combined inoculum resulted in slightly more alveolar resorption than P. gingivalis alone. The findings of this study suggest that fish oil dietary supplementation may have potential benefits as a host modulatory agent in the adjunctive management of periodontitis. Given its advantages in terms of safety, cost effectiveness and widespread availability, this dietary supplement warrants further research in human trials to assess its ability to modulate alveolar bone loss in individuals with periodontitis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Periodontal disease.</field><field name="subject">Periodontal disease -- Nutritional aspects.</field><field name="subject">Unsaturated fatty acids.</field><field name="subject">Omega-3 fatty acids.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Readiness, resilience, and readjustment: a psychological investigation of human factors across the deployment cycle of contemporary peace support operations</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Peter Joseph</field><field name="description">Contemporary peacekeeping missions are complex, demanding, and potentially hazardous. There is general agreement that psychological factors are crucial to effective individual and collective performance of the military personnel deployed in support of these missions. This research has examined the human dimensions associated with capability, functioning, and health across the deployment cycle. The aim of this research was to increase understanding of the psychological issues associated with peace support operations at the individual, group, and organisational levels. The study applied precepts of the transactional model of stress (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984) to the context of military deployment on peace support operations. The overarching Human Dimensions of Operations model for this research incorporated stressor, buffer, and outcome components within the multi-level structure of the military organisation and across the stages (pre, peri, post) of deployment. Participants were Canadian and Australian military personnel deployed on Peace Support Operations. The dissertation comprised seven chapters. Chapter One provided an introduction to the psychological challenges posed by peace support operations and the research opportunities these missions afford. The second chapter detailed the methodology and psychometric evaluation of several measurement scales that were developed as part of this research in order to address the unique characteristics of peace support operations. Each of the six scales examined proved to have a meaningful component structure and adequate subscale reliabilities. The third chapter was devoted to an examination of the psychometric properties of a measure of psychological climate factors, the Unit Climate Profile (UCP), which was the cornerstone instrument of this research. The UCP demonstrated a robust, multi-dimensional structure that was conceptually concordant with its theoretical development and design. In addition, the component structure of the UCP changed in meaningful ways according to its level of analysis - individual or group. The next three chapters examined human dimension constructs at different stages of deployment, notably psychological readiness for operations, psychological resilience during deployment, and readjustment following return from deployment. In Chapter Four, the most compelling structural model that examined collective psychological readiness demonstrated that perceptions of readiness at the group level, along with effective senior leadership, could significantly impact morale. The results in Chapter Five revealed that leadership both buffered the immediate impact of stressors, and also fostered meaning and morale, thereby reducing strain. Positive aspects of deployment and the personal meaning assumed to be derived from these experiences were also found to bolster morale significantly during deployment. In Chapter Six, the stressors specific to the postdeployment transition phase, rather than stressors encountered during deployment, had the strongest impact on postdeployment adjustment. Social support and a positive psychological climate in the unit (particularly evidenced by cohesiveness and caring behaviour by proximal leaders) moderated the impact of homecoming stressors. A concluding chapter summarised the dissertation and discussed its practical significance and avenues for the dissemination of its findings. Broadly, the outcomes demonstrated that an understanding of the human factors in military units within the context of the stressors-strain relationship can provide potentially useful information to commanders who want to enhance the well-being, performance, and commitment of Service members deployed on peace support operations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychological readiness, psychological resilience, readjustment, peacekeeping, deployment, Australian Defence Force, unit climate</field><field name="subject">Armed Forces in foreign countries Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Peacekeeping forces Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Psychology, Military</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural head position: a photographic method and an evaluation of cranial reference planes in cephalometric analysis.</field><field name="creator">Madsen, David Peter.</field><field name="description">Commonly used craniofacial reference planes such as Frankfort Horizontal (FH) and sella nasion (SN) have shortcomings including their variable inter-individual orientation when related to true horizontal (HOR). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of a range of craniofacial reference planes to HOR including those which have not been investigated before: Krogman-Walker line (KW line), neutral horizontal axis, foramen magnum line and posterior maxillary plane. A sample of 57 (38 female, 19 males) consecutive, pre-treatment orthodontic subjects aged 12 to 18 were photographically recorded in a standing mirror guided natural head position (NHP). Cephalograms taken at the same time were traced, oriented to a plumb line (true vertical) transferred from the photograph, and measured for statistical analysis. Thirty nine of these subjects were photographically recorded 2 months later to test the reproducibility of NHP. The results showed that the variability of the 11 selected craniofacial reference planes related to HOR was generally high. The planes illustrating lowest variability to HOR were FH and KW line with standard deviations of 4.6&#176; and 4.7&#176;, respectively. These, however, showed about double the variation in NHP reproducibility (Dahlberg 2.1&#176;). The KW line and palatal plane were also oriented closest to HOR on average. Therefore, KW line and palatal plane are potential substitutes for the commonly used reference planes in the absence of a reliable NHP. However, NHP still represents a more valid craniofacial reference system than the investigated reference planes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural head position; Cephalometric; Reference plane</field><field name="subject">Cephalometry.

Recently, attempts to predict future environments have focused on the consequences of broad scale disturbances. In this thesis I focus on environmental and trophic disturbances as shapers of benthic assemblages. There is growing recognition of the need for greater scientific investment in understanding environmental disturbances to balance the continuing focus of research assessing trophic theories (e.g. herbivory). Historically, it is these theories that have provided a cornerstone to describe and manage subtidal rocky coasts worldwide. In this thesis, therefore, I first assess how our ecological perception of such disturbances (i.e. water pollution and harvesting grazers) may vary as a consequence of the choice of taxonomic classifications used to observe benthic patterns (Chapter 2). I then assess how mechanical disturbance (i.e. wave exposure) may affect the morphology of benthic habitat (Chapter 3) and how temperature disturbances (i.e. oceanographic, cold water pulsing) may affect the consumers of these habitats (Chapter 4). The critical first finding centred on the effectiveness of alternate scales and metrics of taxonomic classification to detect the effects of water pollution (i.e. nutrient enhancement) as the largest disturbing agent on the benthos, and that this effect may be exacerbated by loss of grazers. While observations of the benthos as morphological groups detected the effects of enhanced nutrients, species diversity (as a measure of phylogenetic relatedness) was the only one of the chosen measures sensitive enough to detect the interaction of both top-down and bottom-up stressors. This chapter highlights the importance of choice of classification (e.g. morphology v. species) and indices (e.g. Shannon index v. ABC curves and phylogenetic diversity) in their potential to predetermine our perception of ecological change and thereby predict future environments. Mechanical disturbance (i.e. wave exposure) has been widely studied as a mechanism that creates new space for colonisation by alternate species, but is less well studied as a force that can change the shape of communities by mediating their morphology. Macroalgal morphology varies in response to wave exposure such that individuals at high exposures are often smaller than individuals in more sheltered environments. Observations not only confirmed these patterns for a general assemblage on a wave exposed southern coast, but reciprocal transplants of assemblages between exposures also revealed that morphological differences were likely to be a product of flexibility in morphological response of algae to local environments (Chapter 3). In contrast to the often multi-directional responses of a complex suite of morphological characters (e.g. smoothness, stipe length, frond width), overall size has the potential to be used as a broad and predictive tool to identify hydrodynamic stressors across an entire exposure gradient or geographic range. Strong trophic interactions are often considered characteristic of aquatic systems and due to their perceived ubiquity on temperate rocky coasts, there has been an emphasis in the literature on the influence of herbivores in determining assemblages. Given the importance of the link between herbivores and assemblage structure, in my final chapter I investigated the potential for disturbance to act indirectly on benthos by affecting the survivorship of an herbivorous urchin (Chapter 4). I used observations of variable temperature regimes in a region of upwelling to design an experiment that tested whether this temperature variation could negatively affect the survivorship of settling sea urchins (Heliocidairs erythrogramma). When exposed to cold water, mortality increased by up to 70 %, within 12 h of settlement, representing a massive loss of benthic consumers within a very short time scale. This result was used to assess the potential of temperature to indirectly influence benthic habitats across several spatial scales, a process that may have been profoundly underestimated. In summary, this thesis provides insight into environmental and trophic disturbances as shapers of benthic assemblage patterns, both as natural and human-induced phenomena. I show that our perception of ecological response to the combination of such disturbances can be contingent on the organisational scales and metrics used. Subtle differences in initial choice of such observational units may not only have large affects on the kinds of benthic patterns and disturbances ecologists detect, but also those that they pursue. I recognise that while some physical disturbances can appear subtle (e.g. morphological variation) or strong (e.g. high mortality rate of herbivores), their relative impacts on the broader assemblage (e.g. understorey flora and fauna) will often be dependent on biogeography. Integrating local-scale biological interactions with regional-scale physical processes, therefore, appears to be a potentially progressive line of future enquiry. Indeed, consideration of responses from the physiological through to physical and biogeographical scales will not only strengthen our understanding of the effects of alternate disturbance regimes, but also our predictive power to anticipate future change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Benthic; Disturbance; Marine; Pattern</field><field name="subject">Benthic plants Ecology Australia.

Undernutrition and its consequences are increasingly common problems in an ageing population, and improved management is dependent on an understanding of the factors which are involved in the control of appetite, and the physiological decline of appetite with increasing age termed &#8216;the anorexia of ageing&#8217;. The role of the gastrointestinal hormone ghrelin was specifically evaluated, in relation to the effects of age and nutrient digestion on circulating ghrelin concentrations (Chapters 6 and 7). The effect of fat digestion on the postprandial blood pressure response in healthy older subjects was evaluated in the study reported in Chapter 8. In addition, the results of some intervention studies are described in Chapters 9 and 10, the former study relating to nutritional supplementation as a strategy to increase energy intake, and the latter study to the effects of vitamin D replacement therapy on glucose and insulin metabolism. Whilst plasma ghrelin concentrations are less in older than young rodents, the consequences of healthy ageing on circulating plasma ghrelin concentrations in humans are unclear. The variations in fasting ghrelin concentrations over a sixty year age range were evaluated in healthy young and older subjects (Chapter 6). Plasma ghrelin concentrations were higher in females than males, but did not correlate with age, and were inversely related to body mass index. Ghrelin was independently, and inversely, related to total body skeletal muscle mass, but not to any other body composition variable. Strategies for increasing muscle mass, through resistance exercises, may, accordingly, aid in abolishing the compensatory rise in ghrelin concentrations seen with undernutrition and weight loss. Plasma ghrelin concentrations increase before, and decrease to trough levels within one hour of ingestion of a meal. Macronutrients differ in their ability to suppress ghrelin, being earlier and more pronounced after carbohydrate, and relatively delayed after fat or protein, ingestion. The role of carbohydrate and fat digestion in the suppression of plasma ghrelin concentrations was investigated in healthy young adults (Chapter 7). The suppression of ghrelin concentrations following a sucrose drink was attenuated by acarbose, which slows small intestinal carbohydrate absorption. Ghrelin concentrations were also suppressed after consumption of a fat-enriched drink, however addition of orlistat, which reduces fat digestion and absorption, attenuated the fall in plasma ghrelin. Thus, nutrient digestion is required, in addition to exposure of the small intestine to nutrients, for suppression of ghrelin. Postprandial hypotension describes a significant fall in blood pressure occurring up to two hours after a meal. The magnitude of the fall in postprandial blood pressure depends, in part, on the macronutrient composition of a meal, and the effects are particularly discernable in older adults. Although carbohydrates are particularly potent in reducing postprandial blood pressure in older adults, fat ingestion appears to have comparable, but delayed effects. The role of fat digestion in modifying the blood pressure responses was evaluated in healthy older adults (Chapter 8). There was a fall in blood pressure after ingestion of a high-fat drink. Orlistat, a lipase inhibitor which reduces intestinal fat absorption, potentiated the fall in postprandial blood pressure after a fat-enriched drink. Gastrointestinal function and appetite can be modulated by dietary manipulation of the macronutrient composition of an individual&#8217;s diet. The intervention study described in Chapter 9 evaluated the effects of two weeks of dietary fat supplementation on the sensitivity to the satiating effects of intravenous cholecystokinin-8 in healthy older subjects. No differences were observed in fasting, or postprandial plasma cholecystokinin concentrations after the dietary supplementation period compared to regular diet. There were also no differences in spontaneous energy intake at a buffet meal in response to exogenously administered cholecystokinin between the two diet periods. Vitamin D deficiency is common, as is type 2 diabetes, and the two conditions may be linked. There is mounting evidence linking vitamin D deficiency with abnormalities of glucose and insulin metabolism. The effects of vitamin D therapy in healthy young and older adults with low vitamin D concentrations in the setting of normal or impaired glucose tolerance were evaluated (Chapter 10). Vitamin D therapy, which normalised serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in these individuals, did not alter glucose or insulin concentrations or insulin sensitivity during an oral glucose tolerance test.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vitamin D in human nutrition.</field><field name="subject">Ghrelin.</field><field name="subject">Cholecystokinin.</field><field name="subject">Appetite.</field><field name="subject">Nutrition -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">White hegemony in the land of carnival: the (apparent) paradox of racism and hybridity in Brazil.</field><field name="creator">Cao, Benito</field><field name="description">This dissertation argues that racism in Brazil is largely a product of the Eurocentrism that presides over the formation and formulation of Brazil(ianness). The ideological construction of the nation on notions of identity and difference rooted in a Eurocentric definition of modernity has translated into an epistemological division between modern subjects (the Colonial Self: the Portuguese) and subjects of modernity (the Colonised Others: the Indian and the African). That is, between subjects and objects. The objectification of the Others can be found within the realm of the social (the Other as social object: the Slave), the cultural (the Other as cultural object: the Exotic), and the biological (the Other as sexual object: the Erotic). This epistemological division enabled the hierarchisation of differences between the Civilised Self and the Savage Other(s) and the racist (re)invention of Brazil in the 19th century. This dissertation re-examines racism in Brazil by means of the analysis of the three historical events that have come to define the nation (Discovery, Independence and Abolition) as well as the so-called essence of the nation (Hybridity). The analysis reveals that the reinvention of Brazil as a hybrid nation has not eliminated the hierarchy of differences. On the contrary, the celebration of hybridity has served to obscure the largely exploitative character of the processes of cultural hybridity [mesti&#231;agem or transculturation] and biological hybridity [miscegena&#231;&#227;o or miscegenation] and to mask secular prejudices and discrimination against the Indian and African Others. In Brazil, hybridity still operates within the Eurocentric discourse of Brazilianness that incorporated the Indian and African Others as objects or, at best, dependent subjects in the formation and formulation of Brazil(ianness). The corollary of this is that without unthinking and undoing the Eurocentrism that informs the national imagination there is little that hybridity can do to undermine racism and white hegemony in Brazil.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Racism -- Brazil.</field><field name="subject">Hybridity (Social sciences) -- Brazil</field><field name="subject">Miscegenation -- Brazil</field><field name="subject">Hegemony -- Brazil</field><field name="subject">Brazil -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The portrayal and role of anger in the Res Gestae of Ammianus Marcellinus.</field><field name="creator">Sidwell, Barbara</field><field name="description">The hypothesis for this research project is: Ammianus&#8217; treatment of the emotion of anger reveals as much, if not more, about his education, values, beliefs, personality, than it does about the people he writes about and that he sees in emotion a major causative factor. This research contained within aims to contribute to a greater depth of understanding of the role of the key emotion of anger within the individual and collective lives of the characters as portrayed by Ammianus Marcellinus and how he uses them to influence the reader and colour his narrative. Scholars now tend to examine Ammianus to discern or evaluate the historical reliability of his authorship. Thus there is scope for examining how Ammianus shapes his narrative and tries to influence the reader by his portraits of individuals and collective characters. Although this approach seems an obvious one, the particular value of this thesis and of its contribution to late Roman historiography is that no one has hitherto done this in an extended and thorough way. While we welcome the importance Ammianus gives to emotions as historical agents, his treatment and representations of them have idiosyncratic features that crucially affect any assessment of him as a subjective observer and reporter of Rome and its past. Making the study keyword based reduces the need to make (possibly erroneous) inferences about whether it is really anger or some related emotion that we are dealing with. This has then lead to the compilation of lists of relevant anger words in Latin that relate to the individuals and groups who are the basis for my study.1 Following this analysis of the use of anger by Ammianus Marcellinus through a careful study of his Res Gestae and the characterisations he incorporated within it is hoped that we can better understand the discourse of Ammianus, by unearthing the bias, the propagandist elements and the general trends of his portrayals, through keywords that refer directly to anger. In this way it is anticipated that we can better understand the purpose behind many of these representations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ammianus Marcellinus</field><field name="subject">Anger in literature</field><field name="subject">Historians -- Rome</field><field name="subject">Rome -- History -- Constantine I, the Great, 306-337.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improved iterative schemes for REML estimation of variance parameters in linear mixed models.</field><field name="creator">Knight, Emma</field><field name="description">Residual maximum likelihood (REML) estimation is a popular method of estimation for variance parameters in linear mixed models, which typically requires an iterative scheme. The aim of this thesis is to review several popular iterative schemes and to develop an improved iterative strategy that will work for a wide class of models. The average information (AI) algorithm is a computationally convenient and efficient algorithm to use when starting values are in the neighbourhood of the REML solution. However when reasonable starting values are not available, the algorithm can fail to converge. The expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm and the parameter expanded EM (PXEM) algorithm are good alternatives in these situations but they can be very slow to converge. The formulation of these algorithms for a general linear mixed model is presented, along with their convergence properties. A series of hybrid algorithms are presented. EM or PXEM iterations are used initially to obtain variance parameter estimates that are in the neighbourhood of the REML solution, and then AI iterations are used to ensure rapid convergence. Composite local EM/AI and local PXEM/AI schemes are also developed; the local EM and local PXEM algorithms update only the random effect variance parameters, with the estimates of the residual error variance parameters held fixed. Techniques for determining when to use EM-type iterations and when to switch to AI iterations are investigated. Methods for obtaining starting values for the iterative schemes are also presented. The performance of these various schemes is investigated for several different linear mixed models. A number of data sets are used, including published data sets and simulated data. The performance of the basic algorithms is compared to that of the various hybrid algorithms, using both uninformed and informed starting values. The theoretical and empirical convergence rates are calculated and compared for the basic algorithms. The direct comparison of the AI and PXEM algorithms shows that the PXEM algorithm, although an improvement over the EM algorithm, still falls well short of the AI algorithm in terms of speed of convergence. However, when the starting values are too far from the REML solution, the AI algorithm can be unstable. Instability is most likely to arise in models with a more complex variance structure. The hybrid schemes use EM-type iterations to move close enough to the REML solution to enable the AI algorithm to successfully converge. They are shown to be robust to choice of starting values like the EM and PXEM algorithms, while demonstrating fast convergence like the AI algorithm.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Linear models (Statistics) -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Expectation-maximization algorithms.</field><field name="subject">Algorithms.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New methods for the synthesis of diynyl, diyndiyl and bis(diyndiyl) ruthenium (II) complexes.</field><field name="creator">Scoleri, Nancy</field><field name="description">Chapter One outlines the different methods described in the literature for the synthesis of diynyl, symmetric and asymmetric diyndiyl complexes. The extension to complexes containing a central bridging group within the carbon chain is also introduced with the description of two different linking groups, either an organic or organometallic moiety. A brief overview of molecular electronics and one method of evaluation of electronic communication, cyclic voltammetry, are also addressed. Chapter Two describes the synthesis of novel symmetric and asymmetric bis(diyndiyl) ruthenium(II) complexes of general formula {LnM}-C&#8801;CC&#8801;C-{M&#8221;L&#8221;p}- C&#8801;CC&#8801;C-{M&#8217;L&#8217;m}, featuring two transition metal fragments linked by either a Ru(dppe)2 moiety or a trinuclear copper(I) or silver(I) cluster M3(&#956;-dppm)3 (M = Cu, Ag). Through the use of cyclic voltammetry, it was shown that the inclusion of these three particular bridging groups allows electronic communication between the two terminal end-groups. The chemistry of the starting material trans-Ru(C4H)2(dppe)2 (1) is also described, forming novel complexes when reacted with AuCl(PPh3) or TCNE. Chapter Three describes a new convenient synthetic route to diynyl and diyndiyl ruthenium(II) complexes. Lithiation of the ruthenium(II) diynyl complexes Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CH)(dppe)Cp* and Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CH)(PPh3)2Cp with n-BuLi yields the lithium complexes Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CLi)(dppe)Cp* and Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CLi)(PPh3)2Cp. The most favorable conditions for their formation are examined by using NMR spectroscopy and different assay reactions. These lithium species are further reacted with a range of metal halides to give new asymmetric diyndiyl complexes of general formula [Ru](C&#8801;CC&#8801;C){MLn} (where [Ru] = Ru(dppe)Cp*, Ru(PPh3)2Cp). Chapter Four investigates the reactivity of the novel lithium complex Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CLi)(dppe)Cp* synthesised in Chapter Three. The nucleophilic nature of this complex is assessed with a range of electrophiles such as organic substrates or polyfluoroaromatic compounds. A number of new complexes are prepared and singlecrystal X-ray structure determinations are reported for many of the complexes. The electrochemistry of some of these complexes is also described. Chapter Five summarises the reactions of diynyl ruthenium(II) complexes Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CR)(dppe)Cp* (where R = H, TMS, Au(PPh3)) with three azide reagents TMSN3, TsN3 and AuN3(PPh3). The reactions are suggested to undergo a Huisgen 1,3-alkyne-azide cycloaddition to generate 1,2,3-triazoles which further react to give the various products. The complexes synthesised are characterised by spectroscopic methods and, where possible, by X-ray structure determination. Furthermore, the reactions of the complexes Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CH)(PPh3)2Cp and Ru(C&#8801;CH)(dppe)Cp* with azides to give the ruthenium azido complexes [Ru]N3 (where [Ru] = Ru(PPh3)2Cp, Ru(dppe)Cp*) are described.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diynyl; diyndiyl; rutherium; organometallic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incorporating pedigree information into the analysis of agricultural genetic trials.</field><field name="creator">Oakey, Helena</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a statistical approach which incorporates pedigree information in the form of relationship matrices into the analysis of standard agricultural genetic trials, where elite lines are tested. Allowing for the varying levels of inbreeding of the lines which occur in these types of trials, the approach involves the partitioning of the genetic effect of lines into additive genetic effects and non-additive genetic effects. The current methodology for creating relationship matrices is developed and in particular an approach to create the dominance matrix under full inbreeding in a more efficient manner is presented. A new method for creating the dominance matrix assuming no inbreeding is also presented. The application of the approach to the single site analyses of wheat breeding trials is shown. The wheat lines evaluated in these trials are inbred lines so that the total genetic effect of each of the lines is partitioned into an additive genetic effect and an epistatic genetic effect. Multi-environment trial analysis is also explored through the application of the approach to a sugarcane breeding trial. The sugarcane lines are hybrids and therefore the total genetic effect of each hybrid is partitioned into an additive genetic effect, a heterozygous dominance genetic effect and a residual non-additive genetic effect. Finally, the approach for inbred lines is examined in a simulations study where the levels of heritability and the genetic variation as a proportion of total trial variation is explored in single site analyses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pedigree; additive; dominance</field><field name="subject">Crops Genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of high performance RFID systems for metallic item identification.</field><field name="creator">Ng, Mun Leng</field><field name="description">Although the origins of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology can be traced back for many years, it is only recently that RFID has experienced rapid growth. That growth is mainly due to the increasing application of this technology in various supply chains. The widening of the implementation of RFID technology in supply chains has posed many challenges and one of the biggest is the degradation of the RFID system performance when tagging metallic objects, or when the RFID system operates in a metallic environment. This thesis focuses on tackling the issue of having metallic objects in an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) RFID system. The work presented in this thesis contributes to the research on UHF RFID systems involving metallic objects in several ways: (a) the development of novel RFID tags that range from a simple tag for general applications to tags suitable for metallic object identification; (b) the tag designs target the criteria of minimal tag size and cost to embrace the vision of item level tagging; and (c) the analysis of the performance (through theoretical predictions and practical measurements) of an RFID tag near metallic structures of various shapes and sizes. The early part of this thesis provides a brief introduction to RFID and reviews the background information related to metallic object identification for UHF RFID systems. The process of designing a basic tag, and additional information and work done related to the process, are outlined in the early part of this thesis. As part of this fundamental research process, and before proceeding to the designing of tags specifically for metallic objects, a small and low cost RFID tag for general applications was developed. Details of the design of this tag, with the application of this tag for animal identification, are presented. In the later parts of the work, different tag design approaches were explored and this has generated three rather different RFID tags suitable for attaching to metallic objects. The aim of this research is not just to design tags for metallic objects but also to tackle the constraints of having tags that are small in size, cost effective and suited in size to some familiar objects. Hence, in the later part of this research, the work took a step further where one of the three tags designed for metallic objects addressed the challenge of identifying individual small metallic beverage cans. RFID involves tagging of different types of objects and a tag may be required to be located in a depression of a metallic object. In the final part of this research, the read range performance of one of the RFID tags designed for metallic objects was analysed when the tag was located in metallic depressions of various shapes and sizes. The analysis was performed from a combination of theoretical calculation and simulation perspectives, and also through practical real-life measurements. Metallic objects are very common around us. Their presence is unavoidable and so to identify them, having the appropriate RFID tags suitable for operation on metallic surfaces is essential. Frequently the tags must be small in size and low in cost to allow identification at item level of individual small metallic objects. Understanding and being aware of the potential effects of metallic structures of various shapes and sizes on the tag performance is thus important. The research in this thesis into all the above can bring the industry further towards full deployment of RFID down to item level tagging.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RFID; radio frequency identification; metallic item identification; metallic object identification; supply chain; antenna; RFID tags; item level tagging</field><field name="subject">Radio frequency identification systems.</field><field name="subject">Proximity detectors.</field><field name="subject">Business logistics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The wrist: from anatomy to arthroscopy.</field><field name="creator">Bain, Gregory Ian</field><field name="description">The work described in this thesis was carried out by the author to address perceived deficiencies in the knowledge of wrist anatomy, imaging and arthroscopy that limited the surgical treatment of wrist disorders. The thesis encompasses studies of normal anatomy, imaging of the abnormal wrist and the development of wrist arthroscopy. At the commencement of this work problem areas identified, which were addressed, included (i) the morphology and kinematics of the normal wrist, (ii) imaging of scaphoid deformity and the clinical application of fluoroscopy in the management of the wrist disorders, and (iii) surgery of the wrist, which was usually performed as an open procedure, and the clinical application of wrist arthroscopy, which was in its first decade of development. To address these deficiencies, a radiological study was undertaken to determine how the morphology of the lunate affected the kinematics of the scaphoid. Lunate morphology was demonstrated to be associated with scaphoid kinematics. The result of this finding is that it is now possible to predict scaphoid kinematics because lunate type can be determined from plain radiographs. An anatomical study of the triquetro-hamate joint was undertaken to determine the morphology of this joint and whether it is related to the lunate morphology. Two types of triquetro-hamate joint were identified but these were not associated with the morphology of the lunate. One type had a helicoidal configuration and the other was relatively flat. These morphological differences are likely to have implications for wrist kinematics. To image deformity of the scaphoid, a standardised method of longitudinal computed tomography was developed. An inter-observer reliability study was undertaken to compare the previously reported intra-scaphoid angle to newly developed methods of assessing the humpback deformity. The height-to-length ratio and dorsal cortical angle were found to be more reliable than the intra-scaphoid angle. The concepts of partial volume averaging for the assessment of scaphoid fracture union and pre-operative templating of correction of scaphoid deformity were described. The role of arthroscopy was investigated in a number of clinical conditions. Patients withKienb&#246;ck&#8217;s disease were assessed to determine whether characteristic patterns of articular changes could be identified at arthroscopy. Based on the findings, a classification of these arthroscopic findings was developed and used to direct future treatment. A study of arthroscopically assisted reduction of distal radius fractures was undertaken, which included development of new arthroscopically assisted and mini-open reduction and fixation techniques. Post-operative articular deformity was found to be associated with an increased incidence of pain. Arthroscopic debridement for scaphotrapezotrapezoidal joint arthritis was demonstrated to be a safe and effective treatment, with a lower complication and re-operation rate than with previously reported open procedures. New arthroscopic methods of capsular release of the wrist, arthroscopically assisted drilling of intra-osseous ganglion of the lunate and arthroscopic debridement of the ulnar styloid were developed. Fluoroscopy was valuable in pre-operative assessment as well as the intra-operative management using these new techniques. In summary, the work described in this thesis increases the knowledge of the normal and abnormal wrist morphology and advances the role of arthroscopy in the treatment of wrist conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wrist; Anatomy; Arthroscopy: Imaging</field><field name="subject">Wrist</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation, characterisation and properties of 8,8-methylmethine flavan-3-ol-malvidin-3-glucoside pigments found in red wines.</field><field name="creator">Lee, David, F.</field><field name="description">This study concerns the isolation, characterisation and physio-chemical properties of 8,8-methylmethine-(epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside compounds found in red wines. 8,8-Methylmethine-(epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside compounds were isolated via chromatographic methods developed in this study. The compounds were characterised via nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry which, with the aid of molecular modelling, afforded their possible 3-dimensional structures. Their physio-chemical properties including ionisation and hydration constants, colour parameters and chemical stabilities were determined. The formation of 8,8-methylmethine-flavan-3-ol-malvidin-3-glucoside compounds and other pigments in wines was also studied. 8,8-Methylmethine-(epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside compounds were also synthesised by condensing malvidin-3-glucoside with (epi)catechin in the presence of acetaldehyde. Diastereomers of 8,8-methylmethine-(epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside pigments were isolated from the reaction using size-exclusion liquid chromatography followed by cation-exchange liquid chromatography. The structures of the four 8,8-methylmethine-catechin (and epicatechin)-malvidin-3-glucoside diastereomers were determined using mass spectrometry and one and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It was found that for all four compounds, the methylmethine bridge occurs at the 8-positions of malvidin-3-glucoside and (epi)catechin and that the 3-dimensional structural differences between the diastereomers is the positioning of the (epi)catechin moiety with respect to the glucoside group. One diastereomer has the (epi)catechin on the same side, with respect to the malvidin entity whilst it is on the opposite side for the other diastereomer. The proposed structures also afforded the malvidin entity protection from nucleophilic attack via steric hindrance by the (epi)catechin moiety. 8,8-Methylmethine-(epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside pigments have greater colour stability with regards to changes in pH and SO2 bleaching compared to malvidin-3-glucoside providing evidence that little or no hydration in aqueous solutions is occurring for these compounds. Further evidence for little or no hydration occurring is the presence of isosbestic points in the UV-vis spectra observed for the 8,8-methylmethine-(epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside in the pH range 2 to 7. Although the 8,8-methylmethine-(epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside pigments have greater colour stability to pH, SO2 and oxidation, compared to malvidin-3-glucoside, they have lower temporal stabilities and under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions they have significantly higher degradation rate constants than malvidin-3-glucoside. The ionisation constants of the 8,8-methylmethine-(epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside compounds were determined using high voltage paper electrophoresis (HVPE) and UV-visible spectroscopy. The first ionisation constants (pKa1) of the 8,8-methylmethine-(epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside compounds were found to be higher than that of malvidin-3-glucoside whereas the second and third ionisation constants (pKa2 and pKa3) were found to be lower. The correlation of the ionisation constants between HVPE and UV-visible spectroscopy supports the proposal that there is little or no occurrence of hydration for the 8,8-methylmethine-(epi)catechin-malvidin-3-glucoside compounds in the pH range investigated. 8,8-Methylmethine-flavan-3-ol-malvidin-3-glucoside compounds were the major pigments formed during fermentations of chemically defined grape juice media containing malvidin-3-glucoside and various flavan-3-ols. The yeast strain used for fermentation had a major influence on the levels and rates of formation of these pigments during fermentation. The yeast strain used also has an important influence on wine pigment composition, concentration and evolution during maturation thereby affecting the colour density and hue of the resultant wines. The initial formation of 8,8-methylmethine-flavan-3-ol-malvidin-3-glucoside compounds and their subsequent gradual degradation during maturation, allowed a pool of malvidin-3-glucoside to be available for the formation of other colour stable and more temporally stable pigments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methylmethine; Malvidin; Wine pigment; pKa</field><field name="subject">Glucosides.

The three broad areas that have been investigated in these studies are: (i) the effect of load, and duration, of small intestinal nutrient exposure on gastric motility, gastrointestinal hormone release/suppression, appetite and energy intake in healthy subjects, (ii) the dietary factors that may contribute to symptom generation in patients with functional dyspepsia, through analysis of diet diaries and acute nutrient challenges, and (iii) the effects of the herbal medication, Iberogast&#174;, on gastric motility in healthy subjects. The ingestion of nutrients, triggers a number of gastrointestinal responses, including the modulation of antropyloroduodenal motility, gastrointestinal hormone release/suppression, and the suppression of appetite and energy intake, resulting in a slowing of gastric emptying to an average rate of 1 - 3 kcal/min, which is required for efficient nutrient digestion and absorption. Additionally, the rate at which glucose enters the small intestine influences postprandial glycaemia and incretin responses. These responses have been demonstrated in animals to be dependent on the length, and region, of the small intestine exposed to fat and glucose, however, this has not been directly investigated in humans. Functional dyspepsia is a clinical condition, characterised by chronic upper abdominal symptoms, such as nausea, bloating and early fullness, without a known cause, which affects approximately 11 - 29 % of the population. Many studies have reported that disturbed gastric motor activity may be the cause of these symptoms, but patients frequently experience symptoms following ingestion of food, and some patients report to eat smaller meals more frequently and avoid fatty and spicy foods. In addition, laboratory-based studies have indicated that functional dyspepsia patients may be hypersensitive to fat, but not carbohydrate. To date, the treatments used to reduce symptoms are frequently directed at the normalisation of gastroduodenal motility, using prokinetics. However, the beneficial effect of these drugs is relatively small and variable, and their adverse effects can be substantial. Herbal drug preparations have recently received considerable interest as an alternative treatment option in functional dyspepsia. A commercially available herbal preparation, Iberogast&#174; which contains nine plant extracts, has been reported to improve upper abdominal symptoms in functional dyspepsia and to decrease fundic tone, increase antral contractility and decrease afferent nerve sensitivity in experimental animals. The effects of Iberogast&#174; in the human gastrointestinal tract have not been investigated. The first three studies presented in this thesis have focused on the effects of delivering fat and glucose into the small intestine at different loads (Chapter 5, 6 and 7), lower, comparable to, and higher than gastric emptying normally occurs, and at different durations of infusion (but still at similar caloric loads - Chapter 5, fat only), on gastrointestinal motility, plasma hormone release/suppression, glycaemia, and energy intake in healthy male subjects. The study in Chapter 5 demonstrated that antral pressure waves and pressure wave sequences were suppressed, and basal pyloric pressure, isolated pyloric pressure waves, and plasma cholecystokinin and peptide YY stimulated, during both the low (1.33 kcal/min for 50 min: 67 kcal/min), and high (4 kcal/min for 50 min: 200 kcal), loads of lipid. The effect of the 4 kcal/min load was sustained so that the suppression of antral pressure waves and pressure wave sequences and increase in peptide YY remained evident after cessation of the infusion. The prolonged lipid infusion (1.33 kcal/min for 150 min: 200 kcal) suppressed antral pressure waves, stimulated cholecystokinin and peptide YY and basal pyloric pressure and tended to stimulate isolated pyloric pressure waves when compared with saline throughout the entire infusion period. These results indicate that both the load, and duration, of small intestinal lipid have an influence on antropyloroduodenal motility and patterns of cholecystokinin and peptide YY release. Chapter 6 demonstrated that lipid loads lower than gastric emptying normally occurs (0.25 kcal/min for 50 min: 12.5 kcal) transiently stimulated isolated pyloric pressure waves and cholecystokinin release and suppressed pressure wave sequences and hunger scores. Loads comparable to (1.5 kcal/min for 50 min: 75 kcal) and higher (4 kcal/min for 50 min: 200 kcal), than the normal rate of gastric emptying, were required to stimulate basal pyloric tone and peptide YY release and suppress antral and duodenal pressure waves. Only the 4 kcal/min load suppressed energy intake. The effects of lipid on all parameters, with the exception of hunger, were load-dependent. In addition, there were relationships between antropyloroduodenal motility and cholecystokinin and peptide YY concentrations with energy/food intake. The study in Chapter 7 demonstrated that loads of glucose lower than (1 kcal/min for 120 min: 120 kcal), comparable to (2 kcal/min for 120 min: 240 kcal) and higher than (4 kcal/min for 120 min: 480 kcal) the rate gastric emptying normally occurs, stimulated blood glucose, plasma insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and cholecystokinin concentrations and suppressed the number of antral pressure waves, 2 and 4 kcal/min loads were required for the suppression of duodenal pressure waves and pressure wave sequences and the stimulation of basal pyloric pressure and suppression of energy intake only after the 4 kcal/min loads. There were also relationships between glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide with basal pyloric tone, and food/energy intake with pyloric pressures. The studies presented in the subsequent three chapters investigated the contribution of dietary factors on the generation of symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia when compared with healthy subjects (Chapter 8 and 9) and the effect of Iberogast&#174; on motility in the healthy gastrointestinal tract (Chapter 10). The effects of equi-caloric high-carbohydrate vs. high-fat yoghurt preloads on symptom generation, plasma hormone concentrations, antral area and energy intake were compared between functional dyspepsia patients and healthy subjects (Chapter 8). Nausea and pain were greater in patients after the high-fat, when compared with high-carbohydrate and control, preloads and with healthy subjects. Discomfort was greater after all preloads in patients when compared with healthy subjects. Fasting cholecystokinin and stimulation of cholecystokinin by the high-fat preload were greater in patients, while fasting and postprandial peptide YY were lower in patients than in healthy subjects, with no differences in fasting, or postprandial, plasma ghrelin between patients and healthy subjects. Fasting antral area was greater in patients, with no differences postprandially between patients and healthy subjects. There were no differences in energy intake between the two groups. The relationship between the effect of dietary intake and eating behaviour over a 7-day period on the occurrence and severity of abdominal symptoms was compared between patients and healthy subjects (Chapter 9). The symptoms experienced by the patients included nausea, fullness discomfort, bloating and upper abdominal, and epigastric, pain, of a modest severity, which occurred within 30 min of eating. The number of &#8220;meals&#8221; ingested was significantly less in functional dyspepsia patients and there was a trend for total energy and fat intake to be less. The occurrence of these symptoms was also statistically related to the ingestion of fat and energy intake. The results of these studies indicate that diet, particularly the ingestion of fat, influences the development of symptoms in a subgroup of patients with functional dyspepsia. The study in Chapter 10 evaluated the effect of the herbal drug Iberogast&#174; on gastric motility in the gastrointestinal tract. Iberogast&#174; increased proximal gastric volume, increased antral pressure waves without affecting pyloric or duodenal pressures, and slightly increased the retention of liquid in the total stomach, but had no effect on gastric emptying of solids or intragastric distribution. These results demonstrate that Iberogast&#174; affects gastric motility in humans, and the stimulation of gastric relaxation and antral motility may contribute to the reported therapeutic efficacy of Iberogast&#174; in functional dyspepsia. The studies reported in this thesis provide new information about the regulation of gastric motility, hormone release/suppression, appetite and energy intake, by varying the loads of lipid and glucose infused into the small intestine in healthy subjects, which may have implications in patients with altered gastric motor functions, such as obese, type-2 diabetes and functional dyspepsia patients. In addition, studies in functional dyspepsia patients revealed that diet, in particular the ingestion of fat, contribute to the cause of their symptoms, and these findings may have important implications for the development of diet-based therapies for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. Furthermore, functional dyspepsia patients with impaired gastric relaxation and antral dysmotility may benefit from the effects of Iberogast&#174; as demonstrated in the healthy gastrointestinal tract.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fat; Carbohydrate; Gastrointestinal motility; Cholecystokinin; Peptide-44; Gastrointestinal symptoms; Appetite; Energy intake; Functional dyspepsia; Diet</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inequality-aversion, contracts and incentives.</field><field name="creator">Guan, Bin</field><field name="description">In standard contract-theoretic models, the underlying assumption is that an agent is purely selfish, and his objective is to maximize his own payoff. A large amount of empirical evidence has pointed out that many individuals are also motivated by other psychological considerations, such as fairness concerns and reciprocity. Theorists have been engaged in finding more realistic assumptions that are consistent with the ways in which economic agents behave in real life. Among the existing theories, the theory of inequity aversion developed by Fehr and Schmidt [35] has attracted enormous attention. It soon became a useful tool in behavioral contract theory, which capitalizes on the power of social preferences theories to enhance understanding of real-world contracting phenomena. The present thesis aims at contributing to the behavioral contract literature by investigating how inequality aversion preferences impact on the optimal contract design in a financial contracting environment and the agent's incentive in a career concerns experiment. Chapter 2 reviews some of the recent theoretical contributions to the development of the theories of reciprocity and fairness. Emphasis is placed on sketching the theories, demonstrating their abilities to explain experimental regularities and pointing out some potential problems that are inherent in the existing theories. In addition, we present a survey of the recent theoretical contributions linking inequality aversion and the theory of incentives, where the traditional selfish agent assumption is replaced by the more realistic assumption that the individual agent is also inequality-averse. Incorporating more realism into economic modelling, such as assuming some individuals are inequality-averse, appears to be a promising avenue for research in the theory of incentives, as it generates more refutable predictions that models based on the selfish agent assumption cannot offer. Chapter 3 analyzes a tractable two-period staged financing model in which a single principal interacts with an agent who is risk-neutral and inequality-averse, offering him an equity contract. We fully characterize the menu of the optimal sharing contracts. Our results show that inequality-aversion changes the structure of the optimal contract. More importantly, we show that it is more likely we will observe an equal sharing contract when the agent is inequality-averse. Our findings for efficiency comparison indicate that inequality-aversion exacerbates the distortions caused by moral hazard, which leads to a further downward distortion in terms of total social welfare in this staged financing context. Incorporating inequality-aversion into a dynamic staged financing game thus allows us to interpret real-world contractual arrangements in the venture capital industry where equal split contracts dominate. In Chapter 4, we revisit the innovative Holmstr&#246;m's-type career concerns experiment by Irlenbusch and Silwka [47]. In particular, we introduce inequality-aversion, a theoretical short cut for reciprocity, into the analysis and investigate if it is the missing link that potentially drives the results in the experiment. Two related but conceptually different models are considered. The complete information model confirms that inequality-aversion induces positive effort in the second period, but does not predict any differences in the effort choices across both periods in the revealed-ability setting. The incomplete information model's predictions conform more closely to the observations in the revealed-ability setting, and its predictions for the hidden-ability setting can partly explain the lower effort choices observed in the hidden-ability setting. Our analysis suggests that inequality-aversion is part of the missing link, but not all. Incorporating fairness intentions into the analysis should open more opportunities for explaining the experimental results in Irlenbusch and Silwka.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inequality-aversion; Contracts; Incentives</field><field name="subject">Fairness</field><field name="subject">Equality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coca communications: tales from the Bolivian coca field.</field><field name="creator">Butler, Nadia Kate</field><field name="description">Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork undertaken in Bolivia&#8217;s coca-growing Yungas region, this thesis is concerned with how, on the most practical level, development projects might hold more relevance to the lives of their target groups than they have hitherto tended to do, as well as how the power imbalances that characterise the relationships between development organisations and local people may be understood and addressed. Beginning with the concept of &#8216;communicative ecology&#8217; (Tacchi et al 2003) as a framework for exploring the multifariousness of communicative avenues and the interconnectedness of these within a system, I focus my analysis on the ecosystem of coca communications. I argue, however, that the concept of communicative ecology on its own has little meaning without adopting a political economy approach, which incorporates the work of attempting to understand the social and power relations that surround the production, distribution and consumption of resources, both material and cultural. As a way of analysing the strategies and potentials of people within the ecosystem of coca communications, I utilise Bourdieu&#8217;s (1990) notions of field, habitus and forms of capital, where the coca field characterises itself by virtue of the fact that all those who are a part of it are linked in some way through the production, exchange and consumption of both the coca leaf, and the values, meanings and discourses that surround it. It is concluded that the ecosystem of coca communications is linked intrinsically to the coca production system, in that individuals and groups have differential access to, inclination to use, and success in influencing the discourse via different communicative media, depending on their situation within the coca field. This refers to land ownership, labour, organisational participation, exchange and consumptive practices, which is translated into a system of capital accumulation and exchange. The thesis argues that development organisations will do well to consider a given locality in these terms in order to facilitate the implementation of ICT projects that are relevant and compatible with local social and communicational systems, and further, that these organisations must reflect upon their own role as &#8216;introduced organisms&#8217; within local communicative ecologies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bolivia; Coca; Communication; Development; Internet; NGO; Radio; Telecentre; Yunga</field><field name="subject">Coca industry--Bolivia</field><field name="subject">Communication--Bolivia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The automated synchronisation of independently moving cameras.</field><field name="creator">Pooley, Daniel William</field><field name="description">Computer vision is concerned with the recovery of useful scene or camera information from a set of images. One classical problem is the estimation of the 3D scene structure depicted in multiple photographs. Such estimation fundamentally requires determining how the cameras are related in space. For a dynamic event recorded by multiple video cameras, finding the temporal relationship between cameras has a similar importance. Estimating such synchrony is key to a further analysis of the dynamic scene components. Existing approaches to synchronisation involve using visual cues common to both videos, and consider a discrete uniform range of synchronisation hypotheses. These prior methods exploit known constraints which hold in the presence of synchrony, from which both a temporal relationship, and an unchanging spatial relationship between the cameras can be recovered. This thesis presents methods that synchronise a pair of independently moving cameras. The spatial configuration of cameras is assumed to be known, and a cost function is developed to measure the quality of synchrony even for accuracies within a fraction of a frame. A Histogram method is developed which changes the approach from a consideration of multiple synchronisation hypotheses, to searching for seemingly synchronous frame pairs independently. Such a strategy has increased efficiency in the case of unknown frame rates. Further savings can be achieved by reducing the sampling rate of the search, by only testing for synchrony across a small subset of frames. Two robust algorithms are devised, using Bayesian inference to adaptively seek the sampling rate that minimises total execution time. These algorithms have a general underlying premise, and should be applicable to a wider class of robust estimation problems. A method is also devised to robustly synchronise two moving cameras when their spatial relationship is unknown. It is assumed that the motion of each camera has been estimated independently, so that these motion estimates are unregistered. The algorithm recovers both a synchronisation estimate, and a 3D transformation that spatially registers the two cameras.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer vision; video synchronisation</field><field name="subject">Computer vision.</field><field name="subject">Synchronization.</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional imaging.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collaborative information processing techniques for target tracking in wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="creator">Ma, Hui</field><field name="description">Target tracking is one of the typical applications of wireless sensor networks: a large number of spatially deployed sensor nodes collaboratively sense, process and estimate the target state (e.g., position, velocity and heading). This thesis aimed to develop the collaborative information processing techniques that jointly address information processing and networking for the distributive estimation of target state in the highly dynamic and resources constrained wireless sensor networks. Taking into account the interplay between information processing and networking, this thesis proposed a collaborative information processing framework. The framework integrates the information processing which is responsible for the representation, fusion and processing of data and information with networking which caters for the formation of network, the delivery of information and the management of wireless channels. Within the proposed collaborative information processing framework, this thesis developed a suite of target tracking algorithms on the basis of the recursive Bayesian estimation method. For tracking a single target in wireless sensor networks, this thesis developed the sequential extended Kalman filter (S-EKF), the sequential unscented Kalman filter (S-UKF) and the Particle filter (PF). A novel extended Kalman filter and Particle filter hybrid algorithm, named as EKPF was also developed. The simulation results showed that the EKPF outperformed other three algorithms in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness. Moreover, to help evaluate the performance of the developed tracking algorithms, the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) which is the theoretical lower bound on the mean square error of the target state estimation was also computed. To tackle the measurement origin uncertainty in practical target tracking in wireless sensor networks, this thesis designed a Particle filter and probability density association filter (PDAF) hybrid algorithm, named as PF-PDAF for tracking a single target under the dual assumptions of clutter and missed detections. The PF-PDAF combines the advantages of PDAF algorithm in effectively solving the data association problem with the merits of PF that can accommodate the general non-Gaussian, nonlinear state space model. The PCRLB under measurement origin uncertainty was also derived and computed. For multiple target tracking in wireless sensor networks, this thesis designed a Particle filter and joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF) hybrid algorithm, named as PFJPDAF. The PF-JPDAF algorithm extends the traditional JPDAF to solve the general nonlinear non-Gaussian multiple targets tracking problems in wireless sensor networks. In the highly energy and communication bandwidth constrained wireless sensor networks, a critical consideration is that the information processing needs to be distributive. By adopting the hierarchical network architecture to achieve dynamic sensor nodes clustering and utilizing the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to propagate estimation results amongst sensor clusters, this thesis developed the distributive PF, the distributive EKPF, the distributive PF-PDAF and the distributive PF-JPDAF tracking algorithms. Moreover, this thesis proposed a composite objective function incorporating both the information utility and the energy consumption measures to facilitate the sensing nodes selection in the distributive tracking algorithms. This composite objective function enables the distributive tracking algorithms to achieve the desirable tracking accuracy while still maintaining the lower energy consumption.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">target tracking; wireless sensor network; Kalman filter; Particle filter; collaborative information processing</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor networks.

A.</field><field name="description">This is a prospective study of a cohort sample of injured Kuwaiti First Gulf War survivors designed to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity due to combat and exposures to traumatic events. The study included two main phases. The first phase conducted in 1998, and in 2003 the second phase was executed. This study was designed to investigate the contribution of combat physical injury to the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), prevalence rates of PTSD, depression, anxiety and other psychological morbidity, and predictors of chronic PTSD. The first assessment was in 1998 and the second assessment in 2003 that involved biological investigations. Beside the clinical interview and the physical examination of the site of injury, multiple psychological scales and questionnaires were used. Based on DSM-IV criteria of PTSD, after the second assessment the population of this study were classified to: Chronic PTSD(have PTSD at both assessments), Delayed PTSD (have PTSD only on the second assessment), Recovered (have PTSD only in the first assessment), and Never PTSD (have no PTSD in both assessments). The biological assessment include: blood investigations, BMI, and visual analogue. The data of the study were analyzed based on the four PTSD subgroups. In the first chapter an introduction to the First Gulf War was presented followed by the second chapter that discussed literature review. The third chapter tackled the methods used in this study. The fourth to the sixth chapters discussed the results of this study regarding prevalence of Chronic PTSD, Cortisol and PTSD and Thyroid hormones and PTSD respectively. The last chapter presented the limitations and strengths of the study. There were three main hypotheses. First: combat injured survivors with chronic PTSD have cluster of symptoms severity similar to delayed PTSD after 13 years of the trauma and the prevalence of chronic PTSD is constant over time. Second: low cortisol levels observed in chronic PTSD are constant with chronicity, normalize with recovery, unrelated to degree of disability, and are influenced by comorbid disorders. Third: there is minor role for thyroid hormones in chronic PTSD. All of registered Kuwaiti combat injured survivors at the Social Development Office in Kuwait, were approached to voluntary participate in this study. Of 234 individuals 212 participate in the first stage, and out of these 123 participate in the second stage with the addition of 33 new cases that were not examined in 1998 but were registered in SDO after 1998. An informed consent was taken from the participants at both phases. The participants were assessed using General Health Questionnaire, Trauma Questionnaire, Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Symptom Checklist-90 Revised, and Life Event Scale. Questionnaires and scales applied in the first stage were applied in the second stage with the addition of Impact of Event Scale, Composite International Diagnostic Interview and Scale of Gulf War Syndrome. Biochemical assessment comprised cortisol level, thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The blood samples were taken before starting the interview. Physical assessment involved measurements of: pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist-hip circumference, body mass index and visual analogue before and after the interview. Data entry program using Statistical Package for Social Scientists was used to enter data and analysis. The prevalence rate of delayed onset PTSD (14.6%), chronic PTSD (15.4) recovered from PTSD (22.8%) and never had PTSD (47.2%). With chronic PTSD there are higher cluster of PTSD symptoms severity, not related to severity of physical injury, has more prevalence of PTSD associated symptoms, higher comorbid psychiatric disorders. Intrusions, avoidance and arousal are PTSD cluster of symptoms more predictive of future development of PTSD after the injury. There was a low baseline cortisol level with chronic PTSD, and it was significantly lower in participants with delayed PTSD. Furthermore trauma itself rather than PTSD diagnosis may have an impact on cortisol level. Other psychiatric comorbidity has an enhancing effect on cortisol level. The levels of thyroid hormones were within the normal range. The trend of thyroid function in delayed and chronic PTSD is lower fT3, and TSH and higher fT4 levels, with higher fT3 levels in delayed PTSD compared to chronic PTSD. It was found that the higher severity of trauma score with PTSD the higher fT3 mean values.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PTSD; hormones; biological; thyroid cortisol; Prevalence; chronic; delayed physical parameters; predictors</field><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder Physiological aspects.

The first result involves our published analysis of the evolution for the general initial conditions of the (common) deterministic limiting version of the classical Daley-Kendall and Maki-Thompson stochastic rumour models, [14]. The second result being also part of the general analysis in [14] involves a new approach to stiflers in the rumour process. This approach aims at distinguishing two main types of stiflers. The analytical and stochastic numerical results of two types of stiflers in [14] are presented in this thesis. The third result is that the formulae to find the total number of transitions of a stochastic rumour process with a general case of the Daley-Kendall and Maki-Thompson classical models are developed and presented here, as already presented in [16]. The fourth result is that the problem is taken into account as an optimal control problem and an impulsive control element is introduced to minimize the number of final ignorants in the stochastic rumour process by repeating the process.

In Australia it is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy with approximately 13,000 new cases diagnosed each year. This disease is also the leading cause of cancer related death in Australia with approximately 4,500 fatalities each year. Epidemiological studies have shown geographical variation in the incidence of disease, with diet considered to be a key contributing factor to CRC risk. In particular, diets high in fibre and low in fat have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of developing CRC. Fibre is heterogeneous in nature and can be categorised into different subtypes. Resistant starch is a component of fibre which remains largely intact throughout the gastrointestinal tract until it reaches the colon. Here it undergoes bacterial fermentation to produce the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate and butyrate (BuA). Each of the SCFAs are bioactive in the colon, with the most active being BuA. The beneficial effects of fibre have been linked to BuA&#8217;s ability to induce colon cancer cell differentiation, reduce proliferation and initiate apoptosis. Interestingly, in normal cells BuA is utilised as the preferential energy source and has been shown to promote proliferation. With an apparent &#8220;paradoxical effect&#8221; on normal and cancerous cells BuA has been the subject of much investigation as a potential anticancer agent. Despite numerous studies investigating BuA actions, the exact biological mechanisms remain largely undefined. This thesis explored a possible mechanism for BuA-induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. In 2003, two publications provided evidence that SCFAs, including BuA, were ligands to two members of a previously orphan family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs); GPCR41 and 43. Of the two receptors BuA had the strongest effect on GPCR43. Consequently this thesis investigated the possibility that BuA acts to decrease CRC proliferation and induce apoptosis by binding to and activating GPCR43 on CRC cells. It was hypothesised that GPCR43 acted as a &#8220;BuA sensor&#8221; on the surface of the cell to mediate the effects of BuA. This experimental work utilised PCR, Q-PCR, measures of apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation and RNAi knockdown. The key areas of investigation included: (1) Determining if GPCR43 was present on a range of CRC cell lines with a cell line to represent adenocarcinoma, carcinoma and metastatic stage of disease. (2) Investigating the expression of GPCR43 with manipulated nutrient media and different levels of cell confluence. (3) Exploring GPCR43 expression in normal and malignant human patient biopsies. (4) Determining if the inhibition of G-protein function using inhibitors influenced BuAinduced changes to apoptosis and proliferation. (5) Using RNAi, investigating the effect that GPCR43 knockdown would have on BuA-induced changes to proliferation and apoptosis. The key findings from this work included: (1) Presence of GPCR43 on some but not all CRC cell lines. (2) Modulation of GPCR43 expression with exposure to BuA and altered glucose concentrations in the media. (3) An influence of G-protein inhibition on BuA-induced apoptosis but not proliferation in some cell lines. (4) GPCR43 knockdown using RNAi indicated that GPCR43 is not exclusively required for BuA to regulate apoptosis and proliferation. The results from this work indicate that GPCR43 is not likely to exclusively mediate BuA&#8217;s effects, but opens up new areas of research into the exact role of GPCR43 on CRC cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">butyrate; colorectal cancer; GPCR43; apoptosis; proliferation</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) Cancer</field><field name="subject">Rectum Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene transfer in murine MPS IIIA using canine adenoviral vectors.</field><field name="creator">Lau, Adeline Allison</field><field name="description">Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA) is an autosomal-recessively inherited disorder caused by the deficiency of lysosomal sulphamidase (NS) enzyme activity, resulting in the accumulation of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulphate (HS). MPS IIIA patients experience progressive and severe neurological deterioration with death usually occurring in the mid-late teenage years. A naturally-occurring mouse model of MPS IIIA has been characterised and the biochemical, histological and behavioural changes closely parallel the human condition. In order to treat the neurological effects of MPS IIIA, it is anticipated that a continual supply of replacement enzyme to affected cells will be required. Consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, longevity and safety of gene therapy as a potential treatment for MPS IIIA. Canine adenoviral vectors (CAV-2) were selected on the basis of several important properties. They are non-integrating, are predicted to be less immunogenic in humans than human-derived viral vectors and mediate transgene expression for at least 1 year in vivo. An E1-deleted (&#8710;E1) CAV-2 vector, CAV-NS, co-expressing recombinant human NS (rhNS) and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was constructed and purified. In vitro testing revealed rhNS produced by CAV-NS significantly decreased sulphated GAG storage in human MPS IIIA fibroblasts in a mannose-6-phosphate-dependent manner. Preliminary studies in young adult guinea pigs with CAV-GFP demonstrated widespread GFP expression in the absence of a humoral response. In contrast, minimal GFP expression was found in CAV-injected adult mice due to formation of neutralising antibodies against the CAV-2 capsid. Consequently, intraventricular delivery of CAV-NS was evaluated in newborn mice at various doses. Widespread and dose-dependent GFP expression was observed and the optimal dose for large-scale studies was determined to be 109 CAV-NS particles/hemisphere. Antibodies against CAV-2, rhNS or GFP were not detected. Concurrently, the cognitive function and anxiety-related behaviours of unaffected and MPS IIIA mice were evaluated. MPS IIIA mice had significantly impaired memory and spatial learning in the Morris Water Maze (16-wks) and reduced anxiety in the Elevated Plus Maze (18-wks) when compared to unaffected animals. In a large therapeutic assessment trial, newborn MPS IIIA or unaffected mice received 109 particles of CAV-NS, saline or remained uninjected. GFP expression was visualised for at least 20-wks post-injection. Reductions in the vacuolation of ependymal and choroidal cells of the lateral ventricle and the cerebral cortex of treated MPS IIIA animals were observed in some GFP-positive (and presumably rhNS-expressing) regions. Furthermore, improvements in reactive astrogliosis, but not in the number of activated microglia, were measured in CAVNS- treated MPS IIIA mice. However, insufficient CAV-NS-mediated rhNS expression was generated to improve functional changes as assessed by a behavioural test battery (motor function, open field activity, Elevated Plus Maze, Morris Water Maze), potentially due to chronic inflammatory responses against the CAV-2 vector. Collectively, these data suggest that early intervention with &#8710;E1 CAV-NS gene therapy was able to improve several components of neuropathology in MPS IIIA animals but was unable to significantly alter the clinical progression of murine MPS IIIA.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mucopolysaccharidosis -- Gene therapy.</field><field name="subject">Lysosomal storage diseases -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Gene therapy.</field><field name="subject">Adenoviruses.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is social support? : a grounded theory of social interaction in the context of the new family.</field><field name="creator">Williams, Philippa</field><field name="description">Social support has received considerable research attention. With respect to the new family this attention has focused on the nuclear family and, in particular, on the health and well being of mothers and babies. While some studies have shown that support during pregnancy and postpartum is associated with better physical and psychosocial outcomes for women and babies, other studies have shown little association. One possible explanation for these inconsistent findings is the lack of clarity that exists about the meaning of social support. This lack of clarity is evident in the general social support literature and in empirical studies of social support in the specific context of the new family. This thesis, by focusing on the meaning of social support, does three things. First, it analyses the concept of social support as it is defined in the academic literature. I argue that a contextualised and qualitative approach to the meaning of social support is necessary to improve research in specific contexts and to extend the general discussion of social support. Second, I provide an example of this contextualised approach by exploring the meaning of social support in the context of the new family. In so doing I demonstrate that social support is not a set of supportive behaviours and cannot be discretely defined. As a current research concept, the primacy of social support is undermined in the empirical chapters of this thesis. The substantive theory that develops is one of social interaction in the context of the new family. The meaning of social interaction in this context is shaped by perspective, the situational context and the relationship within which it occurs. While social interaction is inclusive of notions of social support it is not restricted to them. Understanding social support within the broader experience of social interaction renders a holistic picture of what is going on in the context of the new family. Finally, I demonstrate that using a qualitative research methodology to explore the meaning of social support in a specific context improves our understanding of social support in a number of ways. It reveals varied and detailed meanings that can be used to improve research within a particular social context; it highlights processes that can inform research in other social contexts, and, it raises questions that are important for the general discussion of social support.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theoretical evaluation of transmission dosimetry in 3D conformal radiotherapy.</field><field name="creator">Reich, Paul D.</field><field name="description">Two-dimensional transmission dosimetry in radiotherapy has been discussed in the literature for some time as being a potential method for in vivo dosimetry. However, it still remains to become a wide spread practice in radiotherapy clinics. This is most likely due to the variety in radiotherapy treatment sites and the challenges they would present in terms of detection and interpretation at the transmitted dose level. Thus, the full potential and limitations of applying transmission dosimetry in the presence of dosimetry errors still need to be demonstrated.  This thesis is a theoretical evaluation of transmission dosimetry using the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system. The accuracy of predicting reliable and accurate absolute transmitted dose maps using the planning system dose algorithm for comparison with measured transmitted dose maps was initially investigated. The resolution in the dose calculations at the transmitted level was then evaluated for rectilinear and curved homogeneous phantoms and rectilinear inhomogeneous phantoms, followed by studies combining both surface curvature and heterogeneities using anthropomorphic phantoms. In order to perform transmitted dose calculations at clinically relevant beam focus-to-transmitted dose plane distances using clinical patient CT data it was first necessary to extend the CT volume. Finally, the thesis explored the efficacy of applying transmission dosimetry in the clinic by simulating realistic dosimetry errors in the planning system using patient treatment plans for a prostate, head and neck, and breast CRT (Conformal Radiotherapy) treatment. Any differences at the transmitted dose level were interpreted and quantified using the gamma formalism. To determine whether the transmitted dose alone was a sufficient indicator of the dosimetry errors, the magnitude in transmission dose differences were compared with those predicted at the midplane of the patient. Dose-Volume Histograms (DVHs) were also used to evaluate the clinical significance of the dose delivery errors on the target volume and surrounding healthy tissue structures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transmission dosimetry; EPID dosimetry; Conformal radiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Radiotherapy.

Its genome contains niche-specific genes shared with the other inhabitants of dental plaque, which may help to explain its ability to survive and grow in the changing environmental conditions experienced in the gingival sulcus during the progression from health to disease. The pH of the gingival sulcus increases during the development of periodontitis and is thought to occur by the metabolism of nutrients supplied by gingival crevicular fluid. Studies have shown that F. nucleatum is partly responsible for the rise in pH and have concluded that in comparison to other plaque inhabitants, F. nucleatum has the greatest ability to neutralise acidic environments. In common with a number of other oral bacteria, F. nucleatum has also been shown to produce intracellular polyglucose (IP) from simple sugars such as glucose, galactose and fructose. Its response and adaptation to stressful environmental conditions such as pH is unknown. The overall aim of this study was, therefore, to determine how F. nucleatum copes with environmental stresses induced by pH changes.  F. nucleatum was grown by continuous culture in a chemically defined medium at a growth rate corresponding to those measured in vivo. The effect on protein expression, and IP synthesis was examined during steady-state growth at high (&gt;7.2&lt;7.8) or low pH (pH 6.4). The present study also investigated the response of F. nucleatum to growth at pH 8.2. It was found that the organism grew as a biofilm and this corresponded with an increase in cellular hydrophobicity and decreased IP levels. Optimal growth pH&#8217;s differed between the different sub-species used in this study. In response to pH stress, F. nucleatum changed its amino acid and glucose utilisation and increased IP synthesis at the expense of cell numbers. Pulsing the chemostat with glutamic acid or serine produced an increase in IP synthesis and the pattern of end-products observed was dependent upon the amino acid being fermented. The effect on IP synthesis in response to increased levels of exogenous fermentable amino acids was also compared during concomitant fructose or glucose fermentation. Growth media containing fermentable amino acids and supplemented with fructose produced higher cell numbers and non-detectable levels of IP compared to media containing glucose.  The differential expression of cytoplasmic- and cell envelope-proteins induced by changes in pH were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The results represent the first proteomic investigation of F. nucleatum. Twenty-two cytoplasmic proteins were found to have altered expression in response to external pH. At low (sub-optimal) pH, proteins associated with the generation of ATP and ammonia were up-regulated, the latter contributing to the alkalinisation of the gingival sulcus. Conversely, neutral to alkaline pH conditions led to the upregulation of enzymes involved in energy storage. The study also identified several proteins associated with iron limitation and fatty acid synthesis which might not otherwise have been identified as part of the pH-dependent response.  In response to growth at pH 7.8, 14 cell envelope proteins were identified as having significantly altered expression. Down-regulated proteins included those associated with uptake of C4 di-carboxylates and phosphorus, a potential membrane protease and an enzyme associated with amino acid fermentation. The up-regulation of a transcriptional regulator linked to the repression of sugar metabolism was also reported along with proteins linked to the transport of iron. The periplasmic chaperone, peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase, which is responsible for the folding of outer membrane proteins, was also found to be up-regulated.  In conclusion, the proteomic investigation of protein expression by F. nucleatum identified gene products which form part of the organism&#8217;s coordinated stress response to changes in environmental pH. In addition to these, the physiological based studies also presented help to explain the organism&#8217;s persistence during the transition from health to disease in vivo.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Periodontal disease; Bacterial physiology; Proteonics; Protein expression; Fusobacterium nucleatum</field><field name="subject">Periodontal disease.

This qualitative study aims to investigate and understand the use of computers in English language classes in a secondary Smart School in Malaysia by examining the teaching situations and the types of activities carried out in the classroom. In order to understand the factors related to computer use, teachers&#8217; and students&#8217; attitudes towards the use of computers in English lessons were investigated. Using the perspectives from social constructivism, this study examines, this study also looks into classroom interactions to examine the English language learning opportunities for students. A combination of procedures was used for data collection. The data were collected using classroom observations, interviews, field-notes, document, learning diaries and classroom interaction transcripts. The data were analyzed using multiple analyses. This study use thematic analysis as one of the analysis method to examine the interviews, and observations field notes. This study shows that computers in the classroom can be beneficial as tools for facilitating learning English. This study also suggests that in order for the integration of computers in education to be a success the education system needs to be changed or to be adjusted. This study helps to explain the complexity of using computers in the teaching of English as a Second Language in order to fulfil the objectives of the English syllabus and the English curriculum in a Malaysian secondary school.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer; Malaysia; English as a second language; TESL; ESL</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulation of an integrated approach to sustainable water management in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</field><field name="creator">Vo, Phu Le</field><field name="description">In 1986, Vietnam opened up the country&#8217;s economy by launching the Doi Moi (renovation) policy, which made the process of economic liberalisation possible. Accordingly, Ho Chi Minh City, the country&#8217;s biggest city, has undergone rapid growth of population, urbanisation and industrialisation. While achieving remarkable economic growth, the city faces considerable urban environmental challenges. The rapid growth of urbanisation and industry has placed increasing pressure on available freshwater resources, through excessive water use and increasing volumes of untreated wastewater. Firstly, the urban water sector has had to meet growing demand for water use for domestic purposes during the dry season. Secondly, groundwater levels have experienced a substantial drawdown in outlying urban districts as a result of over-abstraction. Thirdly, rapidly expanding industrial activities are causing severe demand on water resources. The city&#8217;s major supply sources have developed an alarming level of pollutants discharged by industry.  The aim of this thesis is to formulate an integrated approach to the sustainable management of water resources in Ho Chi Minh City. In order to achieve this, the research was designed to examine institutional frameworks and arrangements and to explore the perception of water value by water users and stakeholders. The underlying reasons for ineffective management are anchored in fragmented management practices which result from inadequate institutional frameworks and arrangements, inadequate regulations and inappropriate water governance. Weak enforcement of law and insufficient cooperation between government agencies and departments in Ho Chi Minh City and their counterparts in neighbouring provinces also limit management efficacy.  The research results show that stakeholders have different perceptions of water resources. Overall, water value has been considered as a social and economic good by both the urban respondents and government officials. However, most urban residents view water as a social good rather than an economic one. Public involvement in the water sector is limited. Most urban dwellers have little understanding and knowledge about the city&#8217;s water issues or the available channels to access information on water resources.  Many government officials are inadequately trained, poorly qualified, inexperienced and have irrelevant or outdated background knowledge about their field of management. Government respondents did not provide consistent data and information on the water profile because there is no shared common information on water issues in place. Findings from the fieldwork show that decentralisation, privatisation and using rainwater as a potential alternative water source are preferred.  Finally, the study proposes a schematic revision of existing management structures and mechanisms between local government agencies. This thesis proposes a model for a water conservation strategy for which the management and use of water resources is aligned with adequate institutional arrangements and effective regulations. Water governance and management of water resources need to work with economic and urbanisation growth.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Formulation; Integrated approach; Water management; Ho Chi Minh City; Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invariant bilinear differential pairings on parabolic geometries.</field><field name="creator">Kroeske, Jens</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the theory of invariant bilinear differential pairings on parabolic geometries. It introduces the concept formally with the help of the jet bundle formalism and provides a detailed analysis. More precisely, after introducing the most important notations and definitions, we first of all give an algebraic description for pairings on homogeneous spaces and obtain a first existence theorem. Next, a classification of first order invariant bilinear differential pairings is given under exclusion of certain degenerate cases that are related to the existence of invariant linear differential operators. Furthermore, a concrete formula for a large class of invariant bilinear differential pairings of arbitrary order is given and many examples are computed. The general theory of higher order invariant bilinear differential pairings turns out to be much more intricate and a general construction is only possible under exclusion of finitely many degenerate cases whose significance in general remains elusive (although a result for projective geometry is included). The construction relies on so-called splitting operators examples of which are described for projective geometry, conformal geometry and CR geometry in the last chapter.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parabolic geometry; Invariant operators: Conformal geometry; Projective geometry; CR geometry</field><field name="subject">Conformal geometry.</field><field name="subject">Invariants.</field><field name="subject">Geometry, Projective.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic assessment of fault seal risk to hydrocarbon exploration in the Penola Trough, Otway Basin, South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Lyon, Paul John</field><field name="description">A new depth-based method of seismic imaging is used to provide insights into the 3D structural geometry of faults, and to facilitate a detailed structural interpretation of the Penola Trough, Otway Basin, South Australia. The structural interpretation is used to assess fault kinematics through geological time and to evaluate across-fault juxtaposition, shale gouge and fault reactivation potential for three selected traps (Zema, Pyrus and Ladbroke Grove) thus providing a full and systematic assessment of fault seal risk for the area. Paper 1 demonstrates how a depth-conversion method was applied to two-way time seismic data in order to redisplay the seismic in a form more closely representative of true depth, here termed &#8216;pseudo-depth&#8217;. Some apparently listric faults in two-way time are demonstrated to be planar and easily distinguishable from genuine listric faults on pseudo-depth sections. The insights into fault geometry provided by pseudo-depth sections have had a significant impact on the new structural interpretation of the area. Paper 2 presents the new 3D structural interpretation of the area. The geometry of faulting is complex and reflects variable stress regimes throughout structural development and the strong influence of pre-existing basement fabrics. Some basement-rooted faults show evidence of continual reactivation throughout their structural history up to very recent times. Structural analysis of all the live and breached traps of the area demonstrate that traps associated with a basement rooted bounding fault host breached or partially breached accumulations, whereas non-basement rooted faults are associated with live hydrocarbon columns. Papers 3 and 4 demonstrate that for all the traps analysed (Zema, Pyrus and Ladbroke Grove), initial in-place seal integrity was good. The initial seal integrity was provided by a combination of both favourable across fault juxtaposition (Ladbroke Grove) and/or sufficiently well developed shale gouge over potential leaky sand on sand juxtaposition windows to retain significant hydrocarbon columns (Zema, Pyrus). The palaeocolumns observed at Zema and Pyrus indicate that there has been subsequent post-charge breach of seal integrity of these traps while Ladbroke Grove retains a live hydrocarbon column. Evidence of open, permeable fracture networks within the Zema Fault Zone suggest that it is likely to have recently reactivated, thus breaching the original hydrocarbon column. Analysis of the in-situ stress tensor and fault geometry demonstrates that most of the bounding faults to the selected traps are at or near optimal orientations for reactivation in the in-situ stress tensor. The main exception being the Ladbroke Grove Fault which has a NW-SE trending segment (associated with a relatively high risk of fault reactivation and possible leakage at the surface) and an E-W trending segment (associated with a relatively low risk of fault reactivation and a present day live column). The free water level of the Ladbroke Grove accumulation coincides with this change in fault orientation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fault seal; Otway Basin; Penola Trough; Structural</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional imaging in geology.</field><field name="subject">Traps (Petroleum geology).</field><field name="subject">Structural traps (Petroleum geology).</field><field name="subject">Hydrocarbon reservoirs.</field><field name="subject">Petroleum -- Prospecting -- South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Petroleum -- Prospecting -- Otway Basin (Vic. and S.

Yet despite this, the HF band is used by defence agencies for backup communications and spectrum surveillance, and is monitored by spectrum management organizations to enforce licensing. Such activity usually requires systems capable of locating distant transmitters, separating valid signals from interference and noise, and recognizing signal modulation. Research presented here targets the latter issue. The ultimate aim is to develop robust algorithms for automatic modulation recognition of real HF signals, where real means signals propagating by multiple ionospheric modes with co-channel signals and non- Gaussian noise. However, many researchers adopt Gaussian noise models for signals for the sake of convenience at the cost of accuracy. Furthermore, literature describing the probability density function (PDF) of HF noise does not abound. So an additional aim of this research is measurement of the PDF of HF noise. A simple empirical technique, not found in the literature, is described that supports the hypothesis that HF noise is generally not Gaussian. In fact, the probability density function varies with the time of day, electromagnetic environment, and state of the ionosphere. Key contributions of this work relate to the statistics of HF noise and the discrimination of real HF signals via three signal features. Through two unique experiments, the density function of natural HF noise is found to closely follow a Bi-Kappa distribution. This distribution can model natural and man-made HF noise through a single control parameter. Regarding signal features, the coherence function is found to be a brute-force technique suitable only for hard (not soft) decisions. A novel application of an entropic distance measure proves able to separate four real HF signals based on their modulation types. And, an estimator for signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio is shown to provide reasonable measures of SNR for the same real HF signals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HF noise; Feature extraction; Bi-Kappa distribution; Coherence; Entropy; Signal-to-noise ratio; Modulation recognition; Real signals</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanoelectric feedback in the mammalian heart.</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Douglas Robert</field><field name="description">Stretch of cardiac muscle is known to activate various physiological processes that result in changes to cardiac function, contractility and electrophysiology. To date, however, the precise relationship between mechanical stretch and changes in the electrophysiology of the heart remain unclear. This relationship, termed mechanoelectric feedback (MEF), is thought to underlie many cardiac arrhythmias associated with pathological conditions. These electrophysiological changes are observed not only in the whole heart, but also at the single cardiomyocyte level, and can be explained by the presence of stretch-activated ion channels (SACs). Most investigations of the actions of stretch have concentrated on these sacrolemmal ionic currents thought responsible for the proposed MEF-induced changes in contractility. While these studies have provided some useful insight into possible mechanisms, the inappropriate use of solutions and non-physiological degrees of stretch, may have caused somewhat misleading results. Currently, little is known about the involvement or contribution of non-selective or K+ selective SACs to the normal cardiac cycle. Here, I investigate the concept that stretch-induced changes in cardiac electrophysiology (MEF) are important in normal cardiac cycle and demonstrate the effects of stretch on the Frank-Starling mechanism (stretch induced increases in cardiac contractility) while pharmacologically manipulating stretch-activated ion currents. Experiments were conducted using a number of agents known to influence stretch-activated channels either in a positive or antagonistic manner. Results proved somewhat negative toward MEF theory with only substantial or pathological levels of stretch being able to elicit any electrophysiological change in the heart. Furthermore, where electrophysiological changes were associated with pathological stretch they were not consistently modulated by stretch-activated ion channel activators or blockers. Of equal importance was the observation that smaller levels of myocardial stretch associated with positive changes in contractility via the Frank-Starling mechanism were not associated with any electrophysiological changes in the Langendorff perfused heart (as observed by monophasic action potentials) nor in isolated muscle preparations (as observed through transcellular membrane potential recordings). As such, the present research undertaken in this thesis confirms an absence of electrophysiological changes with stretch except under extreme conditions suggesting that MEF is not a robust and necessarily repeatable phenomenon in the mammalian heart.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heart; Electrophysiology; Stretch</field><field name="subject">Myocardium</field><field name="subject">Heart Physiology</field><field name="subject">Heart Contraction</field><field name="subject">Electrophysiology Experiments</field><field name="subject">Heart Electric properties</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multimedia transaction tracking from a mutual distrust perspective.</field><field name="creator">Wong, Angela S. L.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we present a novel, elegant and simple method for secure transaction authentication and non-repudiation for trading multimedia content. Multimedia content can be video, images, text documents, music, or any form of digital signal, however here we will focus particular on still images with application to video. We will provide proof that not only can receiving parties within a transaction be untrustworthy, but the owner, or members within an owning party, also cannot be trusted. Known as the insider attack, this attack is particularly prevalent in multimedia transactions. Thus the focus of the thesis is on the prevention of piracy, with particular emphasis on the case where the owner of a document is assumed to be capable of deceit, placing the system under the assumption of mutual distrust. We will introduce a concept called staining, which will be used to achieve authentication and non-repudiation. Staining is composed of two key components: (1) public-key cryptography; and (2) steganographic watermarking. The idea is to watermark a multimedia document after encryption, thereby introducing a stain on the watermark. This stain is due to the non-commutative nature of the scheme, so that decryption will be imperfect, leaving a residue of the cryptographic process upon the watermark. Essentially, secrets from the owner (the watermark) and the receiver (the cryptographic key) are entangled rather than shared, as in most schemes. We then demonstrate our method using image content and will test several different common cryptographic systems with a spread-spectrum type watermark. Watermarking and cryptography are not usually combined in such a manner, due to several issues such as the rigid nature of cryptography. Contrary to the expectation that there will be severe distortions caused to the original document, we show that such an entanglement is possible without destroying the document under protection. We will then attack the most promising combination of systems by introducing geometric distortions such as rotation and cropping, as well as compressing the marked document, to demonstrate that such a method is robust to typical attacks.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multimedia transaction tracking; Mutual distrust; Insider attack; Watermarking; Cryptography</field><field name="subject">Digital watermarking</field><field name="subject">Data encryption (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Multimedia systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-coded genetic algorithm parameter setting for water distribution system optimisation.</field><field name="creator">Gibbs, Matthew S.</field><field name="description">The management of Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) involves making decisions about various operations in the network, including the scheduling of pump operations and setting of disinfectant dosing rates. There are often conflicting objectives in making these operational decisions, such as minimising costs while maximising the quality of the water supplied. Hence, the operation of WDSs can be very difficult, and there is generally considerable scope to improve the operational efficiency of these systems by improving the associated decision making process. In order to achieve this goal, optimisation methods known as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been successfully adopted to assist in determining the best possible solutions to WDS optimisation problems for a number of years. Even though there has been extensive research demonstrating the potential of GAs for improving the design and operation of WDSs, the method has not been widely adopted in practice. There are a number of reasons that may contribute to this lack of uptake, including the following difficulties: (a) developing an appropriate fitness function that is a suitable description of the objective of the optimisation including all constraints, (b) making decisions that are required to select the most appropriate variant of the algorithm, (c) determining the most appropriate parameter settings for the algorithm, and (d) a reluctance of WDS operators to accept new methods and approaches. While these are all important considerations, the correct selection of GA parameter values is addressed in this thesis. Common parameters include population size, probability of crossover, and probability of mutation. Generally, the most suitable GA parameters must be found for each individual optimisation problem, and therefore it might be expected that the best parameter values would be related to the characteristics of the associated fitness function. The result from the work undertaken in this thesis is a complete GA calibration methodology, based on the characteristics of the optimisation problem. The only input required by the user is the time available before a solution is required, which is beneficial in the WDS operation optimisation application considered, as well as many others where computationally demanding model simulations are required. Two methodologies are proposed and evaluated in this thesis, one that considers the selection pressure based on the characteristics of the fitness function, and another that is derived from the time to convergence based on genetic drift, and therefore does not require any information about the fitness function characteristics. The proposed methodologies have been compared against other GA calibration methodologies that have been proposed, as well as typical parameter values to determine the most suitable method to determine the GA parameter values. A suite of test functions has been used for the comparison, including 20 complex mathematical optimisation problems with different characteristics, as well as realistic WDS applications. Two WDS applications have been considered: one that has previously been optimised in the literature, the Cherry Hills-Brushy Plains network; and a real case study located in Sydney, Australia. The optimisation problem for the latter case study is to minimise the pumping costs involved in operating the WDS, subject to constraints on the system, including minimum disinfectant concentrations. Of the GA calibration methods compared, the proposed calibration methodology that considered selection pressure determined the best solution to the problem, producing a 30% reduction in the electricity costs for the water utility operating the WDS. The comparison of the different calibration approaches demonstrates three main results: 1. that the proposed methodology produced the best results out of the different GA calibration methods compared; 2. that the proposed methodology can be applied in practice; and 3. that a correctly calibrated GA is very beneficial when solutions are required in a limited timeframe.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic algorithm; Calibration; Fitness Function; Statistics; Correlation; Parameter estimation; Genetic drift; Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Water -- Distribution -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms.</field><field name="subject">Mathematical optimization -- Data processing.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Baroque influences in nineteenth and twentieth century piano repertoire: a study of interpretative issues.</field><field name="creator">Xu, Wen</field><field name="description">The exegesis investigates ways in which major piano works of the 19th and 20th centuries reflect elements of baroque tradition and considers the implications for performance.

Critics have thus far neglected the influence of nineteenth and twentieth century psychology in McLuhan&#8217;s work, although a wealth of biographical material supports the argument that McLuhan&#8217;s &#8216;metaphysical&#8217; method is derived as much from psychoanalysis and analytical psychology (C.G. Jung) as from any of McLuhan&#8217;s acknowledged predecessors. Returning to the texts from which McLuhan gained his knowledge of psychology, I trace the influence of Freud, Jung and their disciples upon McLuhan, establishing McLuhan&#8217;s use of Freudian concepts and terminology in his first book The Mechanical Bride (1951), and his use of the psychoanalytic concepts of the &#8216;unconscious&#8217;, &#8216;trauma&#8217; and &#8216;repression&#8217; in the books that came after it. What McLuhan calls the &#8216;unconscious&#8217; is more often named by him as Logos, &#8216;acoustic space&#8217; or the &#8216;media environment&#8217;, and I trace the debts that these concepts owe not only to Freud and Jung but to Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, gestalt theory, art theory, Henri Bergson, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Wyndham Lewis, Siegfried Giedion, Harold Innis, the French symbolist poets of the late nineteenth century and the British modernists of the early twentieth. Despite his rejection of the Freudian argument, McLuhan, like Freud, conceptualizes pain or trauma as the &#8216;cause&#8217; of transformations (i.e. processes) in the unconscious; but while for McLuhan, invoking St. Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, technologies are &#8216;formal causes&#8217; simultaneous with (or &#8216;preceded&#8217; by) their effects, for Freud and his modern interpreter Jacques Lacan, trauma is &#8216;paradoxical&#8217; in structure, presenting as both its own &#8216;cause&#8217; and &#8216;effect&#8217;. Situating McLuhan in relation to French structuralism, I contrast McLuhan&#8217;s concepts of &#8216;figure&#8217; (as cause) and &#8216;ground&#8217; (as effects), elaborated in his last book Laws of Media (1988), to the concepts of the &#8216;signifier&#8217; and the &#8216;signified&#8217; in Ferdinand de Saussure&#8217;s Course in General Linguistics (1916), and critique McLuhan&#8217;s &#8216;tetrad&#8217;, the ideograph with which he illustrates media &#8216;effects&#8217;, in relation to the psychoanalytic concept of the signifier elaborated by Lacan. In reply to McLuhan&#8217;s maxim that &#8216;the medium is the message&#8217;, I conclude that technologies, insofar as they function as &#8216;formal causes&#8217;, are doubly &#8216;hidden&#8217;: firstly, because, as McLuhan says, they can only be grasped through their effects; and secondly because, as Lacan says, their effects can only be articulated when they manifest as &#8216;disturbances&#8217; in the symbolic order, i.e., as fantasies of the Other&#8217;s jouissance (enjoyment). There are numerous stories about how McLuhan would frustrate his critics by refusing to take a &#8216;point-of-view&#8217;, and in fact his (psychoanalytic) technique of &#8216;putting on&#8217; the audience as a mask, and his (deconstructivist) manner of changing perspectives as often as necessary, sit oddly with his championing of Logos. A comparison with Freud and Lacan finds McLuhan at a &#8216;paradoxical&#8217; moment in the history of Western thought, poised between modernism and postmodernism, between structuralism and deconstructivism, and between metaphysics and psychoanalysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">McLuhan; Freud; Lacan; unconscious; metaphysics; psychology; psychoanalysis; structuralism</field><field name="subject">McLuhan, Marshall, 1911-1980 Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Freud, Sigmund, 1856-1939 Influence.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reasons, capacities and the motivational requirement.</field><field name="creator">Lowry, Rosemary</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses theories of practical reason. In particular I compare desire theories of reasons with value theories of reasons. Desire theories of reasons, as I define them, claim that it is a necessary condition of A having a reason to &#1092; that A&#8217;s reason depend on A&#8217;s antecedent desires. In contrast, I define value theories of reasons as those theories that claim that it is a necessary condition of A having a reason to &#1092; that A&#8217;s &#1092;-ing be valuable. In this thesis my main concern lies with those value theorists who accept the motivational requirement: the claim that if an agent is to have a reason to &#1092;, then it must be possible for the agent to &#1092; on the basis of this reason. In particular, I concentrate on those value theorists who claim that A has a reason to &#1092; iff a) A&#8217;s &#1092;-ing is valuable; b) it is possible for A to &#1092; on the basis of this reason. I reject desire theories of reasons on the basis of several criticisms. I claim that our desires are normatively arbitrary, and that according to desire theories of reasons, some of our desires ought to be eradicated. I argue instead for a value theory of reasons that adopts a particular interpretation of the motivational requirement. I distinguish three different interpretations of the motivational requirement, each offering a connection between reasons and motivations that differs in strength. The first, strongest requirement claims that in order for A to have a normative reason to &#1092;, it must be possible for A to &#1092; on the basis of this reason given certain qualities that A possesses (where I take the sense of &#8216;possible&#8217; relevant to these interpretations to be one that reflects an agent&#8217;s capacities). The second and weakest requirement claims that in order for A to have a normative reason to &#1092;, it must be possible for A to &#1092; on the basis of this reason if A possessed certain qualities. The last and moderate requirement claims that in order for A to have a normative reason to &#1092;, it must be possible for A to &#1092; on the basis of this reason if A possessed certain qualities and A either has these qualities, or it is possible for her to get herself into a state where she has them. I argue for a value theory of reasons that employs this last, moderate motivational requirement. I argue that a value theory that adopts the moderate motivational requirement is best, as it allows the theory to be practically useful; reasons on this account have a role in deterrence, encouragement and praise- and blame-worthiness. The theory also aligns with a plausible account of eligible candidates for reasons. While the employment of the moderate motivational requirement in a value theory of reasons likens the theory, in some respects, to a desire theory, it avoids the objections raised against desire theories of reasons. In this way, a value theory of reasons that employs the moderate motivational requirement combines the attractive features of a desire theory and a value theory. Specifically, it generates reasons that are both dependent on an individual&#8217;s qualities, and also aligned with an account of value.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reasons; capacities rationality; value; desires</field><field name="subject">Values</field><field name="subject">Pragmatism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Circadian rhythms and effects of different diets on the development and reproduction of Nabis Kinbergii (Hemipteria : Nabidae).</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Quang Huu</field><field name="description">Nabis kinbergii is a native polyphagous predator in Australia. It has been found in all states and territories of Australia. N. kinbergii has been regarded as an efficient predator of many insect pests in lucerne, cotton and particularly brassica crops. The circadian rhythms, the effects of different prey on development and reproduction, and prey preferences of N. kinbergii have not been studied in South Australia. These are the subjects of this thesis. N. kinbergii is more active at night than in the day. They seemed to be still more frequently at dawn and more active at dusk under natural environmental conditions. Yet, their behaviour was possibly different when they were held in a controlled environment with artificial light. Under both natural and artificial lighting conditions, they would spend more time moving on plants at night. They spent less time moving than other activities. Furthermore, they were more active during the second day of the observations, probably because of the hunger. A mixed diet including Plutella xylostella, Myzus persicae and Brevicoryne brassicae brought the most significant positive influences to the development, survival and longevity of N. kinbergii. It had a shorter preoviposition period and greater egg production when fed on P. xylostella than when fed on M. persicae. Among the three prey, B. brassica was the poorest food because the survival rate between egg hatch and adult eclosion was only 7.5 %, compared to 85 %, 92.5 % and 97.5 % when N. kinbergii fed on M. persicae, P. xylostella and a mixed diet, respectively. Evidence of prey preference was exhibited by N. kinbergii. B. brassica seemed to be the least preferred food. N. kinbergii possibly attacked less mobile prey and delayed eating prey with poor nutrition or that were toxic. In wind tunnel experiments, N. kinbergii may have been attracted by plant volatiles rather than prey odour. These findings may help to refine the timing of experiments and improve the understanding of the role of this predator in integrated pest management.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">predator; prey; biological control; Brassica; Plutella xylostella; Brevicoryne brassicae; Myzus pericae</field><field name="subject">Agricultural pests -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Agricultural pests -- Ecology.</field><field name="subject">Agricultural pests -- Integrated control.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising the "spaces in-between" : the maternal alienation project and the politics of gender in macro and micro contexts.</field><field name="creator">Morris, Anne</field><field name="description">The centrepoint of this thesis is an action research project, the Maternal Alienation Project (MAP), implemented during 2002 and 2003 in Adelaide, South Australia. Resourced by two government-funded community health services, it was established to improve organisations&#8217; (health, welfare and legal) and systems&#8217; responses to the newly termed &#8216;maternal alienation&#8217;. MAP was situated within a tradition of feminist participatory and action research. It was designed to work on three levels: practice, systems and policy-making, and research. The outcomes, processes and events of MAP at the different levels of its operation are examined in the thesis through the employment of a gendered analysis drawn mainly from materialist feminism and standpoint theories. Post-project interviews and focus groups provided further data to the fieldnotes written throughout MAP, and the project&#8217;s formal and informal documents. A recent example of a contested gendered concept, &#8220;maternal alienation&#8221; was first identified and named in 1999 as a component of gender violence (Morris 1999). It forms part of a spectrum of violence perpetrated in households, and had been identified within domestic violence and child sexual abuse. It is a term for the range of tactics used by mainly male perpetrators, predominantly the mothers&#8217; intimate partners and the children&#8217;s fathers or step-fathers, to deliberately undermine the relationship between mothers and their children. The mother-blaming discourses and degrading constructions of mothers conveyed to children and those in the family&#8217;s orbit are strongly related to wider socio-cultural constructions of women and mothers. The thesis examines theories of gender, gendered organisations and gender violence. It develops the concept of an abusive household gender regime, characterised by perpetrators&#8217; imposition of a coercive and abusive regime on household members, and particular patternings of gendered relations. Comparisons are made between household and organisational gender regimes, which are also viewed in relation to the local gender order at the time of MAP. It was found that services that lack an analysis of gender are likely to re-inscribe the dynamics of maternal alienation in their responses to families. Language was found to play a significant part in addressing maternal alienation, particularly in developing congruence between language and women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s &#8220;lived&#8221; experiences. The principles that were developed were founded on supporting mothers and rebuilding their relationships with children, and making visible the tactics employed by perpetrators, thereby reducing their power to coerce and increasing their accountability. The concept of maternal alienation and MAP itself were attacked by a coalition of men&#8217;s rights and Christian Right lobbyists. This compromised the operations of MAP, and of its key supporters, managers of feminist and gender-aware organisations. In many ways these attacks, played out at a macro level, reflected the techniques and dynamics of maternal alienation at a micro level. This thesis raises questions about the strategies that feminist organisations need to develop to more effectively pursue feminist agendas, and to re-invigorate a women&#8217;s movement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">action research; child sexual abuse; child abuse; domestic violence; mother blame; mothering; violence against women; gender; gender violence; feminism</field><field name="subject">Child sexual abuse--South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Child abuse--South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Family violence--South Australia</field><field name="subject">Abused women--South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Feminism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of innovation networks in technology transfer.</field><field name="creator">Rampersad, Giselle</field><field name="description">Network management is a critical concept in innovation and technology transfer. Linkages among network members are fundamental in the innovation process which has been heralded for its contribution to wealth creation in economies increasingly characterized by both globalization and technological connectivity. Innovation networks involve relationships among members of governments, businesses and universities that collaborate continuously to achieve shared scientific goals. This study focuses on identifying the key management factors operating in such networks and on determining the process through which these lead to successful technology transfer. This is of increasing interest for many countries seeking to foster innovation, technology transfer and, in turn, international competitiveness. The study integrates the technology transfer and network research streams in order to provide a unique contribution towards understanding key network factors that are important in technology transfer. Extant technology transfer literature predominantly provides a perspective of a focal organization or, at best, that of inter-organisational relationships while its empirical investigation from a network perspective remains limited. In order to develop a more holistic network perspective, this study draws on the network literature and in particular that of the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) group. Although neither a comprehensive network management theory nor suitable measures at the network level of analysis currently exist, the network literature is quickly evolving and has highlighted several concepts that contribute to achieving network outcomes, albeit in a conjectural fashion. Therefore, this study applies these concepts towards contributing to network management theory development in both the network and technology transfer fields. This study adopts a multi-method research approach. Qualitative exploratory research was necessary as concepts from the technology transfer and network management literatures were combined in a novel way. It was also essential in developing appropriate scales. Quantitative research then followed in order to test these scales by applying exploratory factor analysis and reliability testing. The developed scales were then employed to advance theory development, using confirmatory factor analysis via structural equation modelling. The study predominantly investigates networks within several industries that are relevant internationally and consistent with some of Australia&#8217;s national research priorities. Consequently, a pilot study was conducted in the wine industry to purify scales followed by full field work undertaken in the information and communications technology and biotechnology/nanotechnology industries. Common patterns that emerge within different industries strengthen theory development and lead to generalizations to other related industries while differences lead to industry-specific implications. A number of patterns were uncovered. Evidence was provided for the significant impact of power distribution, trust, coordination and harmony on achieving network outcomes in the ICT and the biotechnology/nanotechnology industries. While both communication and R&amp;D efficiencies were deemed important in achieving network effectiveness, the specific relationships among these factors varied between industries. The study contributes to advancing theory on network management and offers practical management implications particularly for the industries under investigation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">innovation networks; technology transfer; innovation management</field><field name="subject">Technology transfer</field><field name="subject">Computer networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating sites for subsurface CO&#8322;injection/sequestration : Tangguh, Bintuni Basin, Papua, Indonesia.</field><field name="creator">Salo, Jonathan Peter</field><field name="description">The venting of anthropogenic CO&#8322; emissions into the atmosphere at increasing rates is probably influencing global warming and climate change. The Tangguh LNG development project in Papua, Indonesia will produce significant volumes of CO&#8322;, which might be vented into the atmosphere. The LNG process will necessitate the separation of CO&#8322;, estimated at 2.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF sc), from the natural gas reserves prior to liquefaction and shipping. This study screens and assesses the possible alternatives to atmospheric venting, and recommends subsurface CO&#8322; injection and sequestration/storage in saline aquifers. The study identifies specific subsurface locations for several Environmentally-Sustainable Sites for CO&#8322; Injection (ESSCI) in Bintuni Basin, where the Tangguh production fields are located. Alternatives to atmospheric venting of the estimated CO&#8322; volume at Tangguh include both non-geologic and geologic disposal options. Non-geologic options such as biosphere sinks (enhanced forest or agricultural growth), deep-ocean sinks (subsea dispersal), and direct commercial usage (e.g. use in beverage or fertilizer production, fire-retardant manufacturing) are impractical and of questionable impact in remote Papua, Indonesia. Several subsurface geological disposal options were investigated, but the most viable geologic disposal option for Tangguh CO&#8322; is injection into the downdip aquifer leg of the Roabiba Sandstone Formation hydrocarbon reservoir. Injected CO&#8322;, at supercritical phase, is expected to migrate updip into the sealed structural traps at Vorwata or Wiriagar Deep, as the natural gas reserves are produced. A probabilistic ranking of data quality and quantity for five potential ESSCI reservoirs determined that the Middle Jurassic Roabiba Sandstone Formation has the highest likelihood of viable ESSCI sequestration/storage. A probabilistic ranking of data quality and quantity for eight ESSCI structural traps within the western flank of Bintuni Basin, determined that Vorwata, followed by Wiriagar Deep, are the most viable ESSCI structural traps at the Middle Jurassic reservoir level. Five potential ESSCI seals were evaluated and it was determined the best seal potential occurs in the Pre-Ayot Shales, directly overlying the Middle Jurassic reservoir at Vorwata. This unit is capable of holding a 3300 to 4660 foot (1006 to 1420 meter) CO&#8322;_column. Seal integrity of the Pre-Ayot is very good because it is a relatively homogeneous deep-water shale that is composed primarily of ductile illite and kaolinite clays with a minor quartz and feldspar content. Sequence stratigraphy analysis suggests that the zone extends over the entire Vorwata three-way dip closure, with thickness between 17 feet (5 m) and 233 (71 m) feet. The maximum effective storage capacity of the Middle Jurassic reservoirs for each structure was calculated, taking into account irreducible water, trapped water, and trapped residual gas pore volumes. The Vorwata structure is capable of storing 19.3 TCFsc supercritical CO&#8322; at reservoir temperature and pressure. The Wiriagar Deep structure has potential storage capacity of 3.5 TCFsc, and Ubadari 2.8 TCFsc, at their respective reservoir temperatures and pressures. A &#8216;Rating Product Ranking&#8217; was developed to quantify the results of the quality and quantity of four factors: Reservoir Data, Structure Data, Seal Data, and Storage Ratio. Each structure, and the respective top and lateral seal overlying the Middle Jurassic reservoirs, was evaluated. The net result was that Vorwata rated a 0.88 on a scale of zero to one, where 1.0 represents 100% confidence in ESSCI potential. Ubadari and Wiriagar Deep scored, respectively, 0.52 and a 0.45. Finally, the structures were evaluated for relative proximity to the proposed CO&#8322;_source (i.e. the LNG plant location). With a weighted distance factor calculated with the Rating product for each potential injection site, Vorwata rated 0.88 on a scale of zero to one, Wiriagar scored 0.24, and Ubadari scored only 0.09. The Middle Jurassic &#8216;Roabiba Sandstone Formation reservoir&#8217; at the Vorwata structure has the greatest potential as an ESSCI storage site. The Middle Jurassic &#8216;Aalenian Sandstone Formation reservoir&#8217; at the Wiriagar Deep is the second-best potential ESSCI storage site. The subsurface ESSCI injection location proposed for the &#8216;Roabiba Sandstone Formation&#8217; aquifer, 10 km southeast and down-dip from the known gas-water contact (GWC), is on the southeast Vorwata plunging anticlinal nose. An alternate potential ESSCI injection location proposed for the &#8216;Roabiba Sandstone Formation&#8217; aquifer is 6 km south of and down-dip from the known gaswater contact (GWC) on Vorwata structure southern flank. A key issue was to determine the possible risk of fault re-activation from CO&#8322;_ injection. NE-SW striking vertical faults have the highest risk of re-activation requiring an increase of over ~1460 psi (103 kg/cc) over hydrostatic at 14,000 ft TVDss (4267 m), for slippage to occur. The closest fault with a high risk of re- activation is 5 km northwest of the recommended ESSCI site location. Supercritical CO&#8322;_ pressure is not expected to exceed the estimated pressure determined to cause fault re-activation. A 3D geological model of the Mesozoic interval was constructed over a large area of western Bintuni Basin. The model was constructed so as to preserve as much geological heterogeneity as possible yet still have a manageable number of active cells. Faults were incorporated into the model as strike-slip vertical fault surfaces (or indexed fault polygons) as a separate attribute. The geo-cellular model was built suitable for importation into a reservoir simulator (VIP), and a 25-year simulation run for natural gas production from the Vorwata Middle Jurassic reservoir, with concurrent CO&#8322; injection downdip into the Vorwata Middle Jurassic aquifer at the primary recommended ESSCI site location. The simulation verified the recommended location with the CO&#8322; slowly migrating into the Vorwata structural trap within the Middle Jurassic reservoir, and not compromising the hydrocarbon reserves or production. It is recommended that additional data be acquired such as conventional core, formation water samples, and specific logs such as dipole-sonic, multi-chambered dynamic formation testers (MDT), and mechanical rotary sidewall coring tools (MSCT). Lastly, several CO&#8322; monitoring methods and techniques are recommended for Tangguh to monitor CO&#8322; migration, pressures, and potential leakages. One such method is a vertical monitoring well at the recommended injection site. Other monitoring techniques include smart well completions, detection monitors at production wells with tracers injected prior to CO&#8322; injection. In addition, crosswell seismic surveys, electromagnetic methods, and electrical-resistance tomography techniques are suggested during the injection phase.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbon sequestration Indonesia Bintuni Basin.

They depend on their carers for their daily oral hygiene care. Objectives: 1. To describe the dental practices and oral health among people aged 18&#8211;44 years with physical and intellectual disabilities and 2. To determine if residential setting is associated with care recipients&#8217; oral health status, or if there are other factors, which if modified, could improve the oral health of adults with physical and intellectual disabilities. Methods: Cross-sectional mailed questionnaire survey (February 2005 &#8211; June 2006) of carers of adults with physical and intellectual disabilities (18&#8211;44 years) living in South Australia in three settings: family home; community housing; and institutions, followed by oral examinations of care recipients by trained examiners at recalls or new appointments. Decayed (D), missing (M) and filled (F) teeth (DMFT), tooth wear, oral hygiene and gingival status were recorded. Results: Carers completed the questionnaire for 485 adults, a yield of 37.9%, of which 267 care recipients were examined (completion rate = 55.1%). Some 47.4% of the care recipients lived in family homes, 31.4% in community housing and 21.2% in institutions. Some 39.3% of care recipients had their teeth brushed once a day or less, with most needing assistance from their carers. Infrequent toothbrushing and inadequate time to clean were more frequently reported by carers at family homes than those at other settings (P&lt;0.001). Care recipients at institutions visited the dentist more frequently than those at other settings (P&lt;0.001). Other care recipients had problems accessing dental care due to their carers&#8217; lack of awareness of dental services available, lack of dentists with adequate skills in managing people with disabilities, cost, location of dental clinic, lack of dentists willing to treat people with disabilities and transportation problems. Some 18.8% of care recipients required a general anaesthetic and 13.1% an oral sedation for oral examination and treatment. Presence of both oral health problems and treatment needs were reported by almost 50% of carers, but only 13.5% of care recipients reportedly experienced one or more negative impacts. Oral examinations showed that the prevalence of untreated decay among the care recipients in South Australia was 16.9% (95% CI= 12.7, 21.7) and 76.3% (95% CI= 71.0, 81.2) had past and present caries experience. None of the examined subjects wore a removable prosthesis, although nearly 50% had one or more missing teeth. After adjusting for carer and care recipient characteristics, multivariate analysis showed that there was no difference (P&gt;0.05) in the prevalence of untreated decay (D&gt;0) missing teeth (M&gt;0), filled teeth (F&gt;0), caries experience (DMFT&gt;0) or mean DMFT among the three residential settings. However, untreated decay was significantly associated with moderate [OR= 3.7 (1.2, 11.4)] and high intake [OR= 3.3 (1.1, 11.1)] of sweet drinks and never visiting the dentist or visiting only because of a problem [OR= 5.2 (1.7, 15.8)]; missing teeth were significantly associated with requirement for a general anaesthetic for dental treatment [OR= 3.2 (1.4, 7.2)] and having low [OR= 3.4 (1.1, 10.3)] and high [OR= 4.2 (1.7, 10.7)] weekly hours of care; filled teeth were significantly associated with 35&#8211;44 age-group [OR= 5.4 (2.0, 14.9)], lack of oral hygiene assistance from carers [OR= 5.1 (2.2, 11.8)] and high weekly hours of care [OR= 4.4 (2.0, 9.5)]; and caries prevalence was significantly associated with 35&#8211;44 age-group [OR= 7.3 (2.0, 26.3)], lack of oral hygiene assistance from carers [OR= 4.0 (1.3, 12.5)] and high weekly hours of care [OR= 6.3 (2.5, 15.9)]. Mean DMFT was significantly associated with 35&#8211;44 age-group [&#946;= 3.0 (0.4, 5.6)], autism [&#946; = 3.4 (1.3, 5.8)], intellectual disability [&#946; = 2.5 (0.3, 4.8)], and high weekly hours of care [&#946; = 3.6 (1.6, 5.6)]. Anterior tooth wear was found in 45.1% (95% CI= 36.1, 53.9) and posterior tooth wear in 23.9% (95% CI= 18.7, 29.0) of care recipients. Care recipients in the community were more likely to have posterior tooth wear compared to those in family homes. Anterior tooth wear was significantly associated with 25&#8211;34 age-group [OR= 3.1 (1.5, 6.5)], 35&#8211;44 age-group [OR= 2.6 (1.1, 6.2)] and rumination [OR= 3.4 (1.3, 9.2)]. Oral hygiene and gingival status were poor with the prevalence of extensive plaque (dental plaque on all surfaces of the tooth, with a score of 2 or more) of 40.0% (95% CI= 34.1, 45.9), extensive calculus (moderate to abundant amount of supra and subgingival calculus, with a score of 2 or more) of 41.9% (95% CI= 36.0, 47.8), and extensive gingivitis (gingivitis extending all around the tooth, with a score of 2 or more) of 36.0% (95% CI= 30.2, 41.8). Residential setting was not associated with oral hygiene and gingival status. Extensive plaque was significantly associated with 35&#8211;44 age-group [OR= 3.9 (1.4, 11.2)], poor to fair general health [OR= 3.3 (1.2, 9.0)], habit of placing food/medicine/other products in mouth for lengthy periods of time [OR= 7.8 (2.7, 22.7)], care recipients cared for by male carers [OR= 3.9 (1.4, 10.8)], and care recipients with high weekly hours of care [OR= 4.0 (1.5, 10.8)]. Extensive calculus was significantly elevated in prevalence in the 25&#8211;34 age-group [OR= 4.3 (1.8, 10.7)], 35&#8211;44 age-group [OR= 5.3 (1.8, 15.4)]. Extensive gingivitis was significantly associated with always needing help for self-care activities from carers [OR= 3.5 (1.2, 10.2)]. Conclusions: Residential setting was not associated with caries experience, oral hygiene and gingival status among adults with disabilities, after adjustment for age and other relevant characteristics of care recipients. However, care recipients in the community were more likely to have posterior tooth wear compared to those in family homes. Emphasis should be placed on modifiable factors like carer assistance with daily oral hygiene care, diet and regular dental visits, whilst ensuring that carers are not overburdened.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oral health; adults; disabilities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction of a microsatellite based genetic linkage map of almond.</field><field name="creator">Tavassolian, Iraj</field><field name="description">Almond (Prunus dulcis) is the most important nut crop in terms of world production. Due to its health benefit and high nutritional value the consumption and world supply of almond is increasing. To remain competitive in the world market, the Australian almond breeding program was established to produce cultivars with better adaptation to Australian conditions. As part of this program an almond mapping population consisting of 93 F&#8321; progeny derived from a cross between the American cultivar &#8216;Nonpareil&#8217; (NP) and the European self-compatible cultivar &#8216;Lauranne&#8217; (LA) was produced to construct the genetic linkage maps. The first almond linkage map developed prior to the commencement of this project failed to produce the eight linkage groups similar to the basic chromosome number of almond (x = 8) and many large gaps were also observed on the linkage groups. Therefore, more markers were needed to saturate the maps. Microsatellite markers are considered one of the best choices for mapping studies. 195 microsatellite markers isolated from Prunus species were obtained from published papers or by personal communication. Polymorphism was revealed by three different methods, and in general, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) compared to the fluorescent labelled marker detection using an automated DNA sequencer or agarose gel electrophoresis, showed the most efficient and cost effective method of genotyping. A subset of 54 markers which produced reliable and easily interpretable polymorphic bands was selected to screen the whole mapping population. Microsatellites originally isolated from almond species showed the highest rate of amplification and polymorphism followed by peach microsatellites and the least informative markers were isolated from cherry. It seems that the level of transportability and usefulness of microsatellite markers is related to the genetic distance of the closely related species. Almond and peach belong to the same subgenus (Amygdalus) and other Prunus species are classified in Prunophora subgenus. The nut, or kernel, is the commercial part of the almond tree, thus to improve the quality of fruit an understanding of environmental influence, heritability and correlation of traits is required. Pomological and quality characters such as: shell hardness, kernel size, shape, taste, pubescence, colour, and percentage of doubles were measured during three consecutive years (2005-2007) on the total mapping population, but data analysis (ANOVA) was performed only on trees that survived for all three years. Most of the traits showed high broad-sense heritability and kernel shape showed the highest heritability of H&#178; = 0.92 suggesting high genetic control of this trait. Occasionally larger kernels than either parent were found in the progeny indicating potential for improvement of this trait even with smaller kernel size parent that encompass many desirable characters. High correlation was also found between the in-shell and kernel weight (r = 0.74), kernel length / kernel width (r = 0.67), kernel weight to kernel length (r = 0.78) and kernel width (r = 0.80). This correlation estimation pointed out in this study indicates that the improvement of one character may result the progress in another trait. Neither of the parents in the mapping population had bitter or obvious slightly bitter taste but slightly bitter kernels were observed among the progeny. Amygdalin was assumed to be responsible for bitter taste in almond; therefore we measured the amount of amygdalin in sweet and slightly bitter kernel progeny by HPLC. However, the results showed that amygdalin exists in sweet kernels as well. Although the average amount of amygdalin in slightly bitter kernels (20.34 mg kg&#8315;&#185; FW) was higher than sweet kernels (3.67 mg kg&#8315;&#185; FW), some sweet kernels had higher amounts of amygdalin suggesting the impact of other components on slightly bitter kernel. The highest variability within the traits was observed in the percentage of double kernel, which showed the highest standard error. Strong environmental effects, particularly low temperature at pre-blossom time is speculated to produce much higher double kernels. Three genetic linkage maps, one for each parent and an integrated map were constructed by the addition of 54 new microsatellite markers to the previous dataset. All the data was scored and coded according to the coding system necessary by JoinMap3 which was used for map construction. 131 markers including microsatellite, ISSR, RAPD, SCAR and S-allele markers were placed on the integrated map covering 590.7 cM with the average density of 4.5 cM/marker. The minimum number of six microsatellite markers was placed on linkage group 8 and the linkage group 1 which is the longest linkage group has 14 microsatellite markers. Comparative mapping study with other Prunus maps, especially with the highly saturated reference map showed complete synteny and minor changes in the order of four markers on linkage groups compared with Prunus reference map. The conservation of molecular marker order observed in this study supports the idea of looking at Prunus genome as a single genetic system and practical application of this similarity would be in cross-transportability of microsatellite markers from well developed linkage maps to the less studied species in Prunus. Ten microsatellite loci placed on our map have not been reported before and could be used to improve the density of other Prunus maps, especially the reference map. This study contributed to the better understanding of the mode of inheritance and environmental effect on morphological traits and the effect of amygdalin on kernel taste. The most saturated microsatellite based almond linkage map developed in this study can serve as a framework for future almond breeding program in Australia and benefit Prunus improvement programs internationally.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">almond; Prunus dulcis; microsatellite markers; morphological trait; genetic linkage map</field><field name="subject">Almond Australia.

However, research has not established a direct relationship between the complex physiological and psychological processes of the heterogeneous disorder and right hemisphere cortical activity. The present study examined cognitive information processing in people with PTSD, reaction patterns associated with perceived traumatic stressors, and quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) indices of hemispheric asymmetry. Individuals with PTSD (N=34) and age and sex-matched normal controls (N=136) completed standardised web-based self-report questionnaires assessing traumatic stressor events and reaction patterns to those events. Neuropsychological indices of verbal, visuospatial, sensori-motor performance, and electrophysiological recordings, were examined for right hemisphere coding. The relationships among traumatic characteristic reaction patterns of numbing and avoidance, cognitive performance, and frontal and posterior EEG alpha asymmetry were also investigated. Structural and functional alterations were shown in those with PTSD, using indices of working memory for the retrieval of verbal and psychomotor information, indicating a reduced speed of processing and alterations to background cortical arousal in left hemisphere frontal regions. The study supported and extended previous findings of verbal working memory abnormality, alterations to left frontal cortical rhythmic oscillations, and low EEG alpha amplitudes in those diagnosed with PTSD. Results indicated a pattern of compensatory mechanisms associated with reduced speed of information processing and right-sided activation patterns in PTSD participants and control participants who experienced strong reactions to perceived traumatic events. Findings support the impact of traumatic events on psychobiological health in high-risk populations, implicating an association with specific patterns of neural and cognitive functioning in characteristic numbing and avoidance behaviours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantitative electroencephalographic; qEEG; cortical arousal; post-traumatic stress disorder; PTSD; psychobiological; lateralisation; working memory</field><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of crop residue qualities on decomposition rates, soil phosphorus dynamics and plant phosphorus uptake.</field><field name="creator">Iqbal, Shahriar Mohammod</field><field name="description">Phosphorus (P) is an essential plant nutrient that may limit plant growth and agricultural productivity if not available for crop plant uptake in sufficient quantities at the time required. Many Australian soils are deficient in available P, despite a long history of P fertilizer application, and this is due to fertilizer P rapidly becoming unavailable largely through biochemical fixation. The resulting low P fertilizer efficiency, coupled with rapidly rising cost of fertilizers, has increased interest in biological cycling of P from sources such as crop residues. However, to date, much of the Australian research has focussed on soils with relatively high organic matter content (&gt; 2%) and relatively heavy texture i.e. medium to high clay content. Furthermore, although there is information on pasture residue decomposition and P release for sandy soils with low organic matter in Australia, a recent shift to continuous cropping systems means that information for a range of crop residues is required but is not currently available. Therefore the aims of the work described in this thesis were to (i) increase the efficiency of P use when crop residue P are applied to crops and (ii) determine the effect of crop residue biochemical quality on decomposition rates, soil P dynamics and plant P uptake in light textured sandy soils with low organic matter which are typical of a large proportion of the southern Australian wheat growing area. A further aim was to investigate the effects of combined additions of plant residue and P fertilizer on P cycling in these soils, a scenario highly relevant to farming systems. A series of soil incubation and plant growth experiments were undertaken to characterize P dynamics in soil following addition of a wide range of crop residues (total 15) collected from agricultural sites throughout South Australia. The residues, differing in age and biochemical quality, were young shoots of canola, lupin, pea, lucerne and lentil; mature shoot residues of canola, lupin, pea and wheat and mature root residues of wheat, canola and lupin. The concentration of total and water soluble P, C, and N in the residues was measured using standard wet chemical analyses and the carbon chemistry was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Decomposition of crop residues was continuously monitored over a period of up to 140 days by measuring soil respiration. Available P and microbial biomass P and C were also assessed at different times during the incubations. The total P in residues ranged from 0.16% to 0.32% and 0.05% to 0.08% in young and mature shoots, respectively. Water-soluble P was related to residue total P and ranged from 29% to 81% and 13% to 29% of total P in young and mature shoots, respectively. The C: P ratio ranged from 133: 1 to 253: 1 and 504: 1 to 858: 1 in young and mature shoots, respectively. Phosphorus availability and microbial P uptake differed between soils amended with crop residues and soluble P fertilizer as triple super phosphate (TSP). Soil respiration rates were significantly higher in soils amended with crop residues than in the soils amended with TSP or the unamended control in the first 58 days of incubation. In an experiment in which residues and TSP were added at a rate of 10 mg P kg&#8315;&#185;, available P was greater for TSP than residue-amended soil, whereas microbial P showed the opposite trend. Respiration rate and microbial P were positively correlated with C addition rate, which was highest in mature wheat residue because it had the lowest P concentration. In order to assess when P released from the residues is available for plants, wheat was grown over three consecutive crop periods with each period lasting for 4 weeks. Young residues with high content of water soluble P, C, N and amide and low lignin and phenolic content decomposed faster than mature residues. The C type and amount added with residues controlled the dynamics of P availability. Surprisingly, canola mature root increased available P and plant growth as much as young shoot residues while root residues of wheat and lupin resulted in P immobilization and low plant growth. Compared to canola young shoot, canola mature root has a higher total P concentration and a lower C: P ratio. Plant P uptake was positively correlated with residue total and water-soluble P content and negatively correlated with residue C: P and C: N ratio and amount of C added with the residues. In another experiment where residue was added at 2.5 g C kg&#8315;&#185; soil and compared with TSP (4 and 10 mg P kg&#8315;&#185; soil), available P and plant P uptake decreased in the following order: TSP-10P &gt; canola root &#8805; young shoot &#8805; TSP-4P &gt; control &gt; mature shoot. Microbial P was greater with residue addition than with TSP and in the control. Residues with low total P and high C: P ratio resulted in P immobilisation in the microbial biomass. Therefore, residues with high total P and low C: P ratio can be an important source of P for plants. Net P immobilisation of mature wheat residues (0.07% P) was significantly reduced by combining wheat residue (C: P ratio 615: 1) with TSP leading to a C: P ratio of 155: 1 to 310: 1. Furthermore, the combination of wheat residue with TSP increased available P in residue and TSP-amended soils by 3.0 mg P kg&#8315;&#185; soil, which was shown to be sufficient to support wheat growth in the early stages of development in the other experiments. Although water-soluble P fertilizers provide plants with immediately available P, a large proportion becomes unavailable over time. Addition of low C: P residues on the other hand, may not result in high amounts of immediately available P, but the P supply is more sustained due to P release from decomposing residues and turnover of microbial biomass P. Phosphorus immobilization after addition of residues which have high C: P ratio (615: 1) may be offset when residue is applied together with inorganic P fertilizer if the resulting C: P ratio is 300: 1 or less. Overall, this study has highlighted the potential role that crop residues, either alone or in combination with inorganic P, can play in increasing P availability in the light textured, low organic matter, P-limited soils typical of many southern Australian farming systems. The results provide important quantitative information on the potential of a wide range of crop residues to supply wheat with P, and how additions of inorganic P interact with residue decomposition and influence available P supply. This quantitative information will be valuable for the construction or validation of mechanistic models of residue decomposition relevant to low organc matter light textured soils in farming systems of southern Australia, and will ultimately assist in the development of economic management strategies for minimizing P fertilizer inputs and maximizing the benefits of biological cycling of P.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphorus cycle; crop residues; microbial biomass; phosphorus mineralization; available phosphorus; microbial phosphorus; plant phosphorus uptake</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus cycle (Biogeochemistry).</field><field name="subject">Crop residues.</field><field name="subject">Plants, Effect of phosphorus on.</field><field name="subject">Phosphatic fertilizers.</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus in agriculture.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engaging adolescents in high school music.</field><field name="creator">Rosevear, Jennifer Claire</field><field name="description">This investigation aims to explore the attitudes of adolescents towards learning music and to gauge the extent of their involvement in the activities of playing, singing, creating and listening to music. It also seeks to determine the views of adolescents on attributions for success in various activities, including music. Beliefs about selfconcept, or self-identity, and their relationships to academic achievement and musical involvement are explored. The review of literature spans various facets of self-perception, including selfconcept, self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-regulation, and self-concept development, and considers the role of music in self-concept development. The impact of self-perceptions on motivation, which is central to learning, achievement and engagement, is also considered. The basic principles of learning, and their application to learning in music, provide the foundation for specific aspects of music learning, namely, music literacy, learning to play a musical instrument, singing, music technology and informal learning. The relationship between music learning and academic achievement is reviewed. The particular importance of music in adolescence, and adolescent attitudes to school music, provide a backdrop to the analysis of the wide-ranging factors involved in self-concept development, motivation and learning principles, thus leading to an overview of the various approaches which can facilitate the engagement of adolescents in learning in general, and in high school music in particular. A researcher-designed Survey of Musical Experiences and Self-concept was administered to Year 9 and 10 students in three high schools in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. Data from the survey, along with academic results, were collected from the 282 participants in the study. The data provide background information about each participant, along with their perceptions about perceived areas of strength and reasons for success in these areas. Information about involvement in musical activities was collated for all students, with approximately half of the students not studying music at school. Measures for self-esteem (Rosenberg, 1965) and perceived competence (Chan, 1993) were included in the survey. Using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, the data were analysed in relation to the extent of involvement in music, attitudes to learning music, students&#8217; attributions for success, and strengths of the relationships between musical involvement, self-concept and academic achievement. Conclusions can be drawn based on the survey data and the literature review, and these emphasise the importance of the social nature of learning and of providing opportunities for creative work in classroom activities. The most outstanding finding to be highlighted from the study was the aspect of enjoyment as a reason for achievement which appears to feature prominently in students&#8217; responses, yet it is less widely recognised in the literature.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music education; self-perception; academic achievement</field><field name="subject">Music Study and teaching (Secondary) Motivation in education.

All the problems considered are two dimensional and are solved numerically by employing boundary integral equation techniques. In the first chapter I introduce some of the literature and ideas surrounding my thesis. Some background information is stated followed by an outline of the thesis and a list of author&#8217;s published works that support the material in the thesis. Full descriptions of the fundamental equations used throughout the thesis are provided in chapter 2. Chapter 3 contains the first problem considered in this thesis which is infiltration from various shapes of single and periodic irrigation channels. Specifically strip, semi-circular, rectangular and v shaped channels. The solutions are obtained using the boundary element technique. The solutions are then compared with the results obtained by Batu [14] for single and periodic strip sources. In chapter 4 a boundary integral equation method is adopted for the solution of flow from single and periodic semi-circular channels into a soil containing impermeable inclusions. The impermeable inclusions considered are of rectangular, circular and square shapes. The aim is to observe how the various shapes of inclusions can affect the direction of the flow particularly in the region adjacent to the zone where plant roots would be located. Chapter 5 solves the problem of infiltration from single and periodic semicircular irrigation channels into a soil containing impermeable layers. A modification is made to the boundary integral equation in order to include the impermeable layers with the integration over the layers involving Hadamard finite-part integrals. The objective of the work is to investigate how the number and the depth of the impermeable layers affects the flow. Chapter 6 employs a particular Green&#8217;s function in the boundary integral equation. The Green&#8217;s function is useful for flow from a single channel since it removes the need to evaluate the boundary integral along the soil surface outside the irrigation channel. A time dependent infiltration problem is considered in chapter 7. The Laplace transform is applied to the governing equations and the boundary integral equation technique is used to solve the resulting partial differential equation. The Laplace transform is then inverted numerically to obtain the time dependent values of the matric flux potential.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">boundary element method; infiltration; irrigation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding and dealing with evil and suffering: a fourth century A.D. pagan perspective.</field><field name="creator">Wallis, Susanne H.</field><field name="description">People of late antiquity were subjected to the universal and perennial human woes - injustice, affliction, adversity and pain - that cause suffering. The experience of suffering is subjective. There are however, common sources of and expressions of suffering in humans. The fourth century was a period of significant cultural and social changes which drew responses from pagans that not only reflected traditional knowledge but also engaged with new sets of ideas. This thesis examines the problem of evil and suffering as experienced by pagans of the fourth century of the Common Era. Having received imperial sanction from the emperor Constantine after his conversion in 312, Christianity was gaining momentum in both membership and strength. The Graeco-Roman world had become one where Christianity, it seemed to some, had effectively surpassed pagan state cult Against this backdrop of religious change, pagans had taken on a self-consciousness that engendered a rethinking of many traditional ways of coping with and explaining the evils of the world and the suffering that could result from them. Some rules and conditions had changed, so how and where could pagans seek explanation for, protection from or alleviation of their suffering? The study addresses this question by posing and responding to further questions. Firstly, how did pagans understand the presence of evil and suffering in the world? Secondly, from what sources, natural or supernatural, could they draw hope in the face of evil and suffering? And thirdly, what degree of autonomy could pagans claim in approaching the problem? Religion and philosophy might be perceived by pagans to contain the answers to why there was evil and suffering in the world. The addition of science and the occult to religion and philosophy offered further ways through which pagans might seek to deal with the problem. By drawing primarily on extant literary evidence from the period as well as selected material evidence (predominantly pagan, but including some Christian), the research will trace the evolution of ideas regarding evil and suffering that pagan thinkers were bringing to the contemporary debate.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pagan; evil; suffering; late antiquity</field><field name="subject">Good and evil History.</field><field name="subject">Suffering</field><field name="subject">Paganism History.</field><field name="subject">Christianity 4th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathways of paternal antigen presentation to initiate antigen-specific immune responses in pregnancy.</field><field name="creator">Moldenhauer, Lachlan</field><field name="description">The fetus and its placenta, collectively called the conceptus, are semi-allogeneic to the mother, as they express transplantation antigens of paternal origin. Foreign tissues generally experience immunological rejection by the host immune system; however in a normal healthy pregnancy the conceptus does not undergo immune attack. Emerging evidence indicates the conceptus avoids rejection through a number of mechanisms including the induction of active maternal immune tolerance specific for paternal antigens. However, the mechanisms responsible for establishing this tolerance remain undefined, including the timing of the first encounter with paternal antigen and the cellular processes by which paternal antigen is presented to the maternal immune system. Exposure to paternal transplantation antigens occurs in two waves: initially in the context of male seminal fluid at conception, and secondly after placental trophoblast invasion of maternal tissues in mid-gestation pregnancy. Therefore the aim of this research was to evaluate the female immune response to paternal antigens in seminal fluid and those associated with the conceptus. The mechanisms of antigen presentation, the impact of the cytokine environment and the consequences of T cell activation on pregnancy were also investigated. A transgenic system using ovalbumin (OVA) as the model paternal antigen was established. The transgenic Act-mOVA mouse expresses OVA constitutively and ubiquitously under a B-actin promoter and OVA was shown to be present in seminal fluid and in the fetal and placental tissue of sired progeny. The OVA-reactive CD8+ OT-I and CD4+ OT-II T cells were employed to gauge the relative amount of OVA antigen presented, with the strength of the maternal immune response quantified based upon the extent of T cell proliferation, as assessed by CFSE dye-dilution. Utilising bone marrow chimeric mice, it was demonstrated that upon insemination by an Act-mOVA male, seminal fluid-derived OVA was processed and indirectly presented by maternal bone marrow-derived antigen presenting cells to induce activation and proliferation of the CD8+ OT-I T cells within the uterinedraining para-aortic lymph nodes of the female. Likewise, OT-II T cells were responsive to MHC class II-restricted presentation of seminal fluid OVA. Post-implantation conceptus-derived OVA was detected within peripheral lymph nodes and the spleen where it was presented via the MHC class I and class II-restricted pathways to induce systemic proliferation of both OT-I and OT-II T cells. Furthermore, as gestation advanced the extent of OVA presentation and hence T cell proliferation intensified. Conceptus-derived OVA was still presented systemically until 20 days pp. The impact of the uterine cytokine environment was assessed to determine its influence on seminal OVA antigen processing and presentation. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a key factor in regulating the leukocyte population of the female reproductive tract. GM-CSF-deficient female mice were unable to process and present seminal fluid OVA as effectively or efficiently as their wildtype counterparts, as assessed by their reduced capacity to drive OT-I and OT-II T cell proliferation following insemination by an Act-mOVA male. Finally, with highly-reactive OVA-specific T cells activated in response to seminal and conceptus OVA antigen, it was of interest to determine the effect of OT-I T cell activation on fetal survival and pregnancy success. It was found that OT-I T cells activated in vivo to paternal OVA antigen in the context of seminal fluid and pregnancy were not deleterious to pregnancy outcomes. However the transfer of cytotoxic OT-I T cells generated in vitro in the presence of an IL-2 into female mice carrying OVA-expressing conceptuses was detrimental to fetal survival. Collectively these experiments demonstrated that the initial exposure to paternal antigen, and hence the first opportunity to develop paternal antigen-specific tolerance, occurs at insemination. Paternal antigen is presented to the maternal T cell repertoire throughout gestation and may play a role in maintaining immune tolerance during pregnancy. The processing and presentation of paternal-derived antigen is chiefly performed by female bone marrow-derived antigen presenting cells. The cytokine environment of the mated female reproductive tract is critical in allowing optimal antigen processing and presentation, to generate an immune response consistent with maternal immune tolerance of the conceptus.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pregnancy T cells; paternal antigen; mouse; OT-I; OT-II; cross-presentation; GM-CSF; uterus; immunology; Act-mOVA; ovalbumin</field><field name="subject">Immune recognition.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration of youth to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam: determinants of mobility and adjustment experiences.</field><field name="creator">Nguyen Thi, Hong Xoan</field><field name="description">As a result of the economic reforms that were introduced in Vietnam in 1986, the country has grown economically. However, due to a bias toward development policies which have been mainly concentrated in urban areas, the economic gap between rural and urban areas has rapidly widened over time. More job opportunities and better living conditions in the city, as well as low productivity in agriculture, have caused people to move to the major cities. Consequently, rural to urban migration has become one of the dominant flows of internal migration in the country in recent years. This migration stream not only has increased in scale but also in its complexity. Particularly, the age of the migrants has become younger as many young people, especially females, become involved in this flow. Moreover, this migration flow has become less selective in terms of education as both more and less educated people migrate. Also, not only the rich but the poor take part in this movement. This thesis considers the determinants of moving and the experiences of young migrants to Ho Chi Minh City in terms of their economic, social and cultural adjustment in order to provide deep insights into the lives of young people when they migrate. This thesis has used the migration model of Scharping (1997) as the theoretical framework to investigate the decision to move as well as their living experiences in the city. A multiple method approach has been used to the study as both quantitative and qualitative data were analysed. Quantitative data such as secondary data from censuses and data from large-scale surveys at the national and the city levels and primary data from the author&#8217;s survey with 300 young migrants were applied. Qualitative data from 25 in-depth interviews with young migrants, 5 with authorities and 5 with migrant returnees were used in this study, to provide detailed information on migrants&#8217; lives. While the city has attracted a large number of youth from rural areas because of its development advantages, the city&#8217;s government has applied policies to limit this flow. Yet, this migration control policy has proved costly and ineffective in restricting the flows of people to the major cities. This policy has created many difficulties for migrants in the city. In addition, low levels of education and limited work skills force many young migrants to work in the informal sector where their human rights are heavily violated. Other young migrants work in cheap intensive-labour factories. Low pay and hard work, but without labour and medical insurance, lead these young migrants to live on the margins of urban society. These findings suggest that if the local people do not accept these migrants, and urban policies make no effort to assistance them, it is impossible for young migrants in the city to be successful in building new lives and careers. Instead of trying to limit rural to urban migration, the national government should put more effort into narrowing the rural-urban gap by improving development in rural areas. More jobs with better pay in rural areas may be the most effective and sustainable way of reducing rural to urban migration flows.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth migration; Migration adjustment; Migration determinant</field><field name="subject">Rural-urban migration Vietnam.</field><field name="subject">Youth Vietnam Social conditions 21st century.</field><field name="subject">Youth Vietnam Social conditions 20th century.</field><field name="subject">Migration, Internal Vietnam.</field><field name="subject">Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) Social conditions.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49883</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of emotion-based strategies in &#8217;altruistic&#8217; mobilisation: a case study of the animal rights movement.</field><field name="creator">Grivas, Rebecca</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the emotion-based strategies employed by activists for the purpose of persuading individuals to participate directly in social movements. In particular, the emphasis is placed on getting people involved in &#8216;altruistic&#8217; mobilisation; a descriptive utilised in order to distinguish these movements from previous research done in which a tangible material gain is presented as an inducement for participation. The thesis investigates the animal rights movement as it pertains to the issue of animal vivisection, and endeavours to identify the linguistic strategies employed by these activists with the goal of understanding how to facilitate &#8216;altruistic&#8217; movements more generally. A textual analysis, which was consistent with Halliday&#8217;s (2004) systemic functional linguistics, was conducted on mobilisation pamphlets written by groups seeking support for either animal vivisection or animal rights. To this end, the analysis considered both the original movement (i.e. the anti-vivisection movement) and the counter-movement (i.e. the pro-research movement). The analysis considers the linguistic and visual strategies used by movement organisers in placing a moral onus on the reader to support the movement. From this analysis it is argued that the success of the animal rights movement stems from its ability to present graphic visual imagery that supplies evidential support for the claims being made in text. In addition, the animal rights texts have been able to frame the issue of animal vivisection in terms of emotional appeals designed to elicit feelings of moral outrage in the reader. It is posited that the animal rights movement has been able to effectively combine images and emotion-based linguistic strategies in order to facilitate the consideration of the issue in terms of an &#8216;ethical identity&#8217; that helps generate moral outrage in the reader and thereby encouraging participation in the movement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal experimentation Moral and ethical aspects.

The red-tailed phascogale belongs to a group of dasyurids that shows an unusual reproductive strategy amongst mammals, one which provides opportunity for understanding means by which individuals maximise their reproductive success and the role of sperm competition. The broad aim was to gain an understanding of the reproductive biology of red-tailed phascogales and explore means by which individuals can affect their reproductive success. Examination of the red-tailed phascogale reproductive biology showed that females mated with multiple males and were capable of storing sperm in their oviducts for at least a five day period. Captive female red-tailed phascogales showed greater plasticity in their breeding season than has been observed in Antechinus, which exhibits the same life history strategy. Females were observed to invest heavily into the production of young, producing almost twice as many ova (15.1 &#177; 1.9) as young they can raise and 76% of females filling six to eight of the eight available teats in a breeding attempt. A 63% male bias was observed in young attaching to the teats, which could be produced through differential attachment of the sexes to teats at birth. Of the 846 young born in the captive breeding colony, 68% were weaned, with weaning occurring between 90-110 days of age and a 53% female bias observed in young being weaned. By weaning, a litter of young weighed 380% of the mothers mass with male young tending to be heavier than females by weaning. No relationship was observed between maternal weight and either litter sex ratio or sex biased growth of young. A positive relationship between maternal body mass and body mass of offspring at weaning was observed, with the body mass of young at weaning correlated with its body mass at maturity. Multiple paternity was observed in more than half of the litters examined, with heavier males having increased siring success compared to lighter males. Genotyping showed that the effective population size for the captive colony was 1.9x that observed from the group managed studbook. Male reproduction was also not as tightly constrained as in Antechinus, with spermatogenic failure not occurring in captive populations until after mating had occurred, meaning males are not reliant on epididymal stores alone for successful breeding. Scrotal diameter showed a positive relationship with testis and epididymal mass across male life, although this relationship was not evident when analysis was restricted to the time of peak sperm production. Captive males showed the opposite pattern of testosterone fluctuations to that observed in wild animals, with lowest levels occurring during the mating period. Captive animals were able to survive up to five years in captivity, in contrast to the obligate semelparity observed in wild males. Although most captive females can survive to breed in a second year and females are known to breed in a second year in the wild, the reproductive strategy of females appears to be aimed at maximising the returns on their first breeding attempt. In males, the need to maximise the investment into the first breeding season is amplified through the complete absence of opportunity to breed again; either through post-mating mortality in the wild or spermatogenic failure in captivity. The results of this study have implications for captive breeding of red-tailed phascogales, with their reproductive biology; spermatogenic failure, restricted breeding season, teat number limiting the number of young raised, high lactational investment into young, sex biases, the need to maintain genetic diversity and biases in siring success; providing challenges for the maintenance of a captive population. The results of this study also provide comparative information that contributes to understanding the unusual life history strategy of Phascogale and Antechinus, and contributes to the growing body of knowledge about mating strategies in marsupials.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dasyurid</field><field name="subject">Polyandry</field><field name="subject">Marsupials -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human decision-making under uncertainty in the upstream oil and gas industry.</field><field name="creator">Mackie, Steve</field><field name="description">Business under-performance in the upstream oil and gas industry, and the failure of many decisions to return anticipated results, has led to a growing interest over the past few years in understanding the impacts of current decision-making tools and processes and their relationship with decision outcomes. Improving oil and gas decision-making is thus, increasingly, seen as reliant on an understanding of what types of decisions are involved and how they actually are made in the &#8220;real world&#8221;. There has been significant work carried out within the discipline of cognitive psychology, observing how people actually make decisions. However, little is known as to whether these general observations apply to decision-making in the upstream oil and gas industry. Nor has there been work on how the results might be used to improve decision-making in the industry. This research is a step towards filling this gap by developing two themes &#8211; decision-making process and decision type. It distils a &#8220;real world&#8221; oil and gas decision-making model together with a theoretical decision-making model. Comparing and contrasting the two models yields several prescriptions for improved decision-making in the upstream oil and gas industry. This research also documents the development of an oil and gas decision making taxonomy that lays a decision space within which to judge the processes of decision-making. The taxonomy builds on established ideas in the human decision-making literature, but is itself novel, and involves four different dimensions: 1) complexity; 2) task constraint; 3) value functions; and 4) structure of the information environment. A primary observation is that decision-making processes are tailored to the various types of decisions. It is argued that maximising the chances of a good outcome in &#8220;real world&#8221; decisions requires the implementation of such tailoring.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision making.

This policy has not been without problems, particularly in the areas of assessment of skills and qualifications, appropriate orientation and integration into Australian communities, and retention of these doctors within rural and remote communities. To date there has been little evidence-based research on the role of OTDs in the medical workforce in Australia. This study explores the service provision and quality of care provided by OTDs using the 5 Year OTD Scheme as the case study. In doing so, it assesses the adequacy of this strategy and discusses the implications for future workforce policies and programs. A mixed method design was used in the study. The quantitative component involved secondary analysis of Medicare Australia data for all OTDs participating in the 5 Year OTD Scheme in 2002 and all Australian trained doctors (ATDs) practising in rural and remote Australia in the same year. A log Poisson regression model was used to assess the interactive effect of the various GP characteristics, such as age, sex, experience and practice location with OTD/ATD status on the rate of a particular service item per patient, adjusted for patient age and sex. The qualitative component involved two focus groups with OTDs which were used to help explain the relationships between variables found in the quantitative component of the study. Template analysis was used to identify themes from the focus group. Significantly different rates per patient between OTDs and ATDS were found across most service items and GP characteristics examined. The greatest variation was found among items relating to in-surgery consultations and non-surgery consultations such as nursing home visits. Fewer differences were found between groups relating to pathology, imaging or procedural services. Analysis of surrogate quality items identified few differences between OTDs and ATDs. The focus group identified a number of other factors that influenced their patterns of service and accounted for some of the differences identified in the quantitative analysis. These factors included knowledge of the health care system in Australia, cultural and communication influences, health conditions of patients, patient and community attitudes, remuneration influences and training influences. These had varying degrees of influence on their patterns of service. The reasons for the differences found between OTDs and ATDs are partially explained by the characteristics of the GPs examined and partially explained by other external influences that relate to the particular circumstances of the OTDs, such as knowledge of the Australian health care system and cultural and communication issues. Understanding the nature of practice is central to ensuring appropriate professional support measures. The study findings highlight the need for a targeted training program for OTDs that address the areas that have the greatest influence on patterns of service to ensure that rural and remote communities receive the same quality of service from OTDs as provided by ATDs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Overseas trained doctor; Rural; General practice; Practice pattern</field><field name="subject">Physicians, Foreign Australia.

A diverse hydraulic environment should foster biodiversity, because organisms have different hydraulic preferences. In fact, the relationship between spatial hydraulic diversity and biodiversity is largely presumed, and not well-supported by empirical studies, but it underpins efforts in river restoration and conservation. This is particularly so at the reach scale, indicating a stream- or river-section with large-scale homogeneous geomorphic and hydrological conditions and smaller-scale habitat patches, as perceived by organisms in the community under study. This thesis considers the factors that create spatial hydraulic diversity, and the ways that fish respond. It presents a method to characterise hydraulic diversity, and uses this to describe temporal and spatial changes between reaches. It also demonstrates the use of hydraulic modelling for comparing reaches. Finally, it assesses the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) as a method to describe hydraulic conditions in a large, open river channel. Swimming ability tests were applied to three small freshwater fish, the pelagic Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) and common galaxias (Galaxias maculatus ) and the demersal flathead gudgeon (Philypnodon grandiceps). The latter species was the weaker swimmer, but the tests indicated that behaviour also should be considered. A laboratory experiment was designed to investigate how two species with contrasting ecological habits (common galaxias, flathead gudgeon) behave in a diverse hydraulic environment. Habitat choices and activity were monitored in a constructed sinuous channel at three discharges over a 3-hour period. The galaxias favoured the pelagic habitat, and spent 20-60% of the time cruising, whereas the flathead gudgeon preferred the demersal habitat and spent &lt;6% of the time cruising. The flathead gudgeons could access their preferred habitat at all discharges, but the common galaxias were limited by their swimming ability at the highest discharge. Several methods to characterise reaches were compared for eight 3-D model reaches representing the effects of channel form, wood and aquatic plants. The variogram (a measure of the variance between samples as a function of distance) emerged as a superior method because it indicates hydraulic diversity, incorporates the spatial arrangement of hydraulic patches, and facilitates comparisons between reaches. The ADCP proved a quick, reliable means to measure depth and 3-D velocity in rivers. It was effective only in depths &gt;1.5 m, but modified instrumentation may overcome this limitation. Six reaches, including weir-pool and free-flowing sections, were compared at two discharges in the River Murray, Australia. Variograms derived from the ADCP data clearly demonstrated spatial differences between the sections, but temporal differences were less well-defined, suggesting that reaches may retain characteristic hydraulic patterns despite changes in discharge. Opportunities for further research include: the issue of optimal levels of hydraulic diversity for fish and other biota; use of variograms as a tool for field studies of aquatic biota; and measuring reach-scale hydraulic diversity and biodiversity before and after reach manipulation (e.g. the placement of wood), to elucidate the effects of changes in spatial hydraulic diversity on reach biodiversity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydraulic models.

This study examines the accuracy of velocity estimation using two biologi-cally inspired models of motion detection, (i) the Horridge template model and (ii) the Reichardt correlator model. Various extensions and enhancements of these models are implemented with the goal of achieving robust velocity measurements. The template model is one of the prominant models of motion detection, which was proposed by Horridge in 1990. This Thesis further extends this model with the aim of improving accuracy in velocity detection using chrominance as well as luminance channels with various error checking mechanisms using different stimuli. Then the template model response is compared with Dror's elaborated Reichardt model and electro-physiological experimental results obtained from the fly visual system using similar stimuli in each case. A modified Reichardt model is shown to give a more similar response to that of fly neurons. In order to improve velocity performance of the Reichardt model, it is necessary to reduce contrast dependance of the correlator response as well as to make it independent of the structure of the visual stimuli. With this aim, the Reichardt model is then further elaborated to include contrast adaptation by a feedback adaptive mechanism and a clear reduction in contrast dependency is demonstrated. The deviation of the correlator response depending on the stimulus is termed as pattern noise. To reduce this pattern noise, the Reichardt correlator model is further extended to implement compressive non-linearity or saturation. It is seen that saturation has a profound effect on the shape of the pattern noise. Further studies on pattern noise is then performed in this Thesis using different stimuli at different speeds and contrasts. Work carried out in this Thesis on the affect of various receptive field shapes on the pattern noise reveals circular sampled arrays reduce pattern noise and hence, based on this result, a small 16 pixel yaw sensor using our elaborated model is built that shows promising performance with various potential applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion perception (Vision) Physiological optics.

Published in a period of political transition and conspicuous new cultural production and debate in many fields, four decades after India&#8217;s independence from colonial rule in 1947, these architectural discourses have become privileged references that have shaped but also limited perception of late-twentieth century architectural production in India. While subsequent writers have addressed some of these limitations, the small but growing critical literature in this field still exhibits many of the same problems of representation. Despite problematising the construction of &#8216;Indian architecture&#8217; in colonial and postcolonial discourse, these critiques have nevertheless taken for granted (as in the more popular and professionally oriented discourses of the 1980s) the existence of a pan-Indian community of architects, united in their search for a collective identity. Such monolithic perceptions of contemporary &#8216;Indian architecture&#8217; have yet to be interpreted with regard to the conspicuous contexts in which they were produced &#8212; that is, from an &#8216;Indian&#8217; point of view. Through a selective focus on a particularly productive site of discourse in 1980s India, I investigate complexities that have not yet been examined in the formation and reproduction of a dominant consensus on the identity of contemporary Indian architecture. The argument draws attention not only to the agency of particular contemporary Indian architects in the construction of this identity, but also the relativity of region in the architectural production of India during the 1980s. Specifically, I focus on an influential architectural magazine, Architecture + Design (A+D) that began publishing in 1984 from a dominant region of architectural production, Delhi. I provide an account of the manner in which history, context, agency and agents, came together at a point in time, within this architectural magazine, as a complex set of historically constituted social relations, to authorise and sustain particular viewpoints about contemporary Indian architecture. Using the French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu&#8217;s theory of the field of cultural production, I relate issues of dominance and marginalisation observable in the production of this particular discourse on contemporary Indian architecture to the space of the positions held by its producers. Despite its avowed agenda of viewing contemporary Indian architecture differently in the 1980s, I argue, the selection and judgement of exemplary contemporary work deemed worthy of discussion in A+D as &#8216;Indian Architecture&#8217; functioned (and continues to function) through established categories of perception and appreciation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indian architecture; postcolonial; discourse; Pierre Bourdieu; cultural production; representation; colonial discourse; sites of discourse</field><field name="subject">Indian architecture</field><field name="subject">Architecture India</field><field name="subject">Architecture India 20th century</field><field name="subject">Architects India</field><field name="subject">Architecture in literature</field><field name="subject">Postcolonialism India</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards safer and more congruent prison environments for male Aboriginal prisoners: a South Australian study.</field><field name="creator">Grant, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the first empirical study into the accommodation needs of Australian Aboriginal prisoners in prison custody. The over-representation of Aboriginal people in the Australian prison system is increasing and the continuing deaths of Aboriginal peoples in prison custody by suicide are an important national issue. Previous prison studies have not addressed all of the issues surrounding this problem. Although the varying and differing accommodation needs of Aboriginal prisoners have been recognised since the 1800s, there is a limited understanding of the relationship between the prison environment and the rates of suicide among Aboriginal prisoners. The aim of the thesis is to investigate the issues and present findings which may contribute to the creation of prison environments which reduce stress levels, and may in turn decrease rates of suicide among Aboriginal prisoners. The research investigates the prison environment for the Aboriginal prisoner from a people-environments approach, locates the act of suicide among a series of behaviours which may occur in response to an environment incongruent with the needs of users. These responses are influenced by a complex of personal, environmental and institutional factors. Data for the research was gathered by studying five South Australian prisons and conducting a series of interviews with 55 male Aboriginal prisoners incarcerated within them. The prisons were documented using observations, interviews with staff and prisoners, photographic surveys and environmental walkthroughs. Both the accommodation standards, and the responsibility to provide those standards by the Department for Correctional Services (South Australia), are examined. The needs and preferences of the subject group were investigated using a three-stage interview process which included gathering personal and incarceration profiles, a forced choice experiment employing photographic sets and a number of drawing exercises to elicit design preferences. The results present a picture of the Aboriginal prison population in South Australia and their design needs. It shows that there are commonalities among the Aboriginal prisoner population in that they are relatively young, have relatively large numbers of children and are dependent on other family members for stability outside the prison environment. Aboriginal people display non-complaint and resistance behaviours and are consequently segregated at an alarming rate in South Australian prisons. The research identifies that prison environments in South Australia are often incongruent with the needs of Aboriginal prisoners. The thesis presents the argument for prison environments to move from being designed within philosophies of segregation and separation to recognising the importance of Aboriginal domiciliary practices, lifestyles structured around the social group and the need to maintain connections to country for all Aboriginal prisoners. The need for prison environments to take into account the identity and spirituality of Aboriginal prisoners is highlighted. The thesis yields further understandings on the design of prison environments for Aboriginal prisoners and will stimulate debate on incarcerating Aboriginal people in a Western tradition.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prisons; aboriginal prisoners; penal design; penal architecture; prison architecture; prison design; suicide; self harming; congruency; people-environments</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Averting the crisis - or avoiding the compromise?: a regulation approach to social inclusion policies and practices in the Australian context.</field><field name="creator">Averis, Roslyn Ann</field><field name="description">The South Australian Rann Labor government elected in 2002 became the first in the nation to address &#8216;social exclusion&#8217; through the implementation of a Social Inclusion Initiative. The increasingly popular term &#8216;social exclusion&#8217; was first used overseas in the early 1970s to describe serious symptoms of socio-economic disadvantage linked with global economic restructuring. Taking the South Australian policy initiative as a point of departure, this thesis provides a multi-layered analysis of social exclusion discourses and policy approaches, exploring their significance in the context of Australia&#8217;s shifting welfare state terrain. In so doing, the thesis seeks to break new ground both at general theory and specific case study levels by utilising a regulation approach (RA) to test the research hypothesis that &#8216;social inclusion&#8217; policies are reflective of a transitional neoliberal (or, in some instances, Third Way) mode of social regulation which is inadequate to arrest rising socio-economic inequality linked to the collapse of the post-war &#8216;Fordist-Keynesian&#8217; consensus. The cross-disciplinary regulation approach is a method of inquiry used to analyse spatially and temporally specific shifts in phases of capitalist accumulation and the different policy and institutional arrangements that support accumulation in each phase. The complex and interrelated institutional shifts at the Australian national level are critical to understanding the origins and impact of &#8216;social inclusion&#8217; policies. Hence the adoption of this type of policy approach at the South Australian state level is considered in a broader national political economic context where the phenomenon of social exclusion is located within national welfare to work reforms. By applying a regulationist lens to examine the global concept of social exclusion in a local and broader national setting, the thesis offers empirical evidence to one of the &#8216;missing links&#8217; in the &#8216;post-Fordist&#8217; literature. That is, it contributes to the debate about whether nascent neoliberal or Third Way modes of social regulation have potential to stabilise capitalism&#8217;s inherent crisis tendencies, or whether they merely extend a period of institutional searching. The thesis concludes that the South Australian Social Inclusion Initiative in various ways appears to be not only partial and inadequate in its own terms, but fundamentally in conflict with the South Australian government&#8217;s broader policy objectives. In short, it shows that the Initiative has inadequate capacity to address the impact of global structural changes that have caused the polarisation of wealth and increasing poverty. Furthermore, it is argued that this approach attempts to suppress class dissent by silencing potential critics, and fails to intersect with or compensate for national level policies which have served to depress wages and simultaneously reduce the welfare safety net. It is concluded from these findings that these policies do not have the capacity to contribute to an equitable or sustainable new mode of social regulation. The thesis argues that a more comprehensive approach to &#8216;social inclusion&#8217; is required in the post-Keynesian era and proposes further research to this end.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social exclusion; social policy; public policy; welfare state reform; regulation theory; neoliberalism</field><field name="subject">Marginality, Social Australia.

More specifically, this thesis investigates the potential of FD-based texture transform images as tools for aiding in the interpretation of airborne magnetic data. A series of different methods of estimating FD are investigated, specifically: &#8226;	geometric methods (1D and 2D variation methods and 1D line divider method); &#8226;	stochastic methods (1D and 2D Hurst methods and 1D and 2D semi-variogram methods), and; &#8226;	 spectral methods (1D and 2D wavelet methods and 1D and 2D Gabor methods). All of these methods are able to differentiate between varying theoretical FD in synthetic profiles. Moreover, these methods are able to differentiate between theoretical FDs when applied to entire profiles or in a moving window along the profile. Generally, the accuracy of the estimated FD improves when window size is increased. Similarly, the standard deviation of estimated FD decreases as window size increases. This result implied that the use of moving window FD estimates will require a trade off between the quality of the FD estimates and the need to use small windows to allow better spatial resolution. Application of the FD estimation methods to synthetic datasets containing simple ramps, ridges and point anomalies demonstrates that all of the 2D methods and most of the 1D methods are able to detect and enhance these features in the presence of up to 20% Gaussian noise. In contrast, the 1D Hurst and line divider methods can not clearly detect these features in as little as 10% Gaussian noise. Consequently, it is concluded that the 1D Hurst and line divider methods are inappropriate for enhancing airborne magnetic data. The application of these methods to simple synthetic airborne magnetic datasets highlights the methods&#8217; sensitivity to very small variations in the data. All of the methods responded strongly to field lines some distance from the causative magnetic bodies. This effect was eliminated through the use of a variety of tolerances that essentially required a minimum level of difference between data points in order for FD to be calculated. Whilst this use of tolerances was required for synthetic datasets, its use was not required for noise corrupted versions of the synthetic magnetic data. The results from applying the FD estimation techniques to the synthetic airborne magnetic data suggested that these methods are more effective when applied to data from the pole. Whilst all of the methods were able to enhance the magnetic anomalies both at the pole and in the Southern hemisphere, the responses of the FD estimation techniques were notably simpler for the polar data. With the exception of the 1D Hurst and line divider methods, all of the methods were also able to enhance the synthetic magnetic data in the presence of 10% Gaussian noise. Application of the FD estimation methods to an airborne magnetic dataset from the Merlinleigh Sub-basin in Western Australia demonstrated their ability to enhance subtle structural features in relatively smooth airborne magnetic data. Moreover, the FD-based enhancements were able to enhance some features of this dataset better than any of the conventional enhancements considered (i.e. an analytic signal, vertical and total horizontal derivatives, and automatic gain control). Most of the FD estimation techniques enhanced similar features to each other. However, the 2D methods generally produced clearer results than their associated 1D methods. In contrast to this result, application of the FD-based enhancements to more variable airborne magnetic data from the Tanami region in the Northern Territory demonstrated that these methods are not as well suited to this style of data. The main conclusion from this work is that FD-based enhancement of relatively smooth airborne magnetic data can provide valuable input into an interpretation process. This suggests that these methods are particularly useful for aiding in the interpretation of airborne magnetic data from regions such as sedimentary basins where the distribution of magnetic sources is relatively smooth and simple.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fractal dimension; Aeromagnetic data image processing; Signal processing</field><field name="subject">Aeromagnetic prospecting.</field><field name="subject">Fractals -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Geology -- Statistical methods.</field><field name="subject">Geology -- Statistical methods -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Geophysics -- Statistical methods.</field><field name="subject">Geophysics -- Statistical method -- Data processing.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated river basin management for the Ganges: lessons from the Murray-Darling and Mekong River Basins (a Bangladesh perspective).</field><field name="creator">Shahjahan, Mosharefa</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the applicability of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) model of Integrated River Basin Management to the Ganges Basin by utilising the lessons from the Mekong experience of adopting the MDB model. The Ganges is one of the major rivers in the world and the sharing of its water has long been an issue of dispute between the riparian countries. Fragmented and uncoordinated upstream management of the Ganges has caused serious ecological and economic loss in the downstream environment posing a threat to future sustainability of river resources. Cooperation among the riparian countries of the Ganges in order to embrace an integrated and basin-wide management approach is rapidly becoming more important. Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM) is a concept widely advocated in different forums for managing the river basins of the world and is adopted in many transboundary river basins. The Australian example of managing the Murray-Darling Basin is considered as a model in the field. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission is well known internationally as a good example of a multi-jurisdictional water management institution. Similar river basin institutions are also evolving in other regions such as the Mekong River Commission for the management of the Mekong River in South-East Asia. The countries sharing the Ganges could learn lessons from the Murray-Darling and Mekong experiences and adopt a basin-wide approach for the better management of the Ganges. However, the policy transfer from a developed country to a developing country context is a challenging process. The highly pertinent contextual differences in social, economic, political, environmental and hydrological settings of the three cases need to be carefully addressed. The research critically examines these factors in the Murray-Darling, Mekong and the Ganges contexts, identifies the similarities and differences between them and attempts to understand the influence/s of these in the policy transfer or policy development process. This research adopted multiple-case studies involving both qualitative and quantitative methods. The cases of the Murray-Darling and Mekong were studied to understand the process and to utilise the lessons learned for the institutional development towards integrated and basin-wide approach for the Ganges. The study analyses the interview results from the experts in the relevant fields to get an insight of different issues and also to collect their opinions. The responses from the stakeholder interviews in Bangladesh were analysed to understand their perspective in this regard. The thesis concludes that adoption of the Murray-Darling Basin model of integrated management needs modification in the Ganges context and recommends a specific institutional structure for the basin-wide management of the Ganges. The thesis contributes to an area of knowledge in recent times by providing a greater understanding of the Integrated River Basin Management in a multi-jurisdictional context. It critically examines the issues in policy transfer from a developed to a developing country focussing on a little studied but significant international river basin, the Ganges. It is hoped that this thesis will contribute towards better policy options for the sustainable management of the international river system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ganges; River basin management; Bangladesh; Integrated management</field><field name="subject">Water resources development Ganges River Watershed (India and Bangladesh); Sustainable development Ganges River Watershed (India and Bangladesh); Environmental policy Ganges River Watershed (India and Bangladesh); Ganges River (India and Bangladesh) Water rights.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A test of competing models to predict suicidality in patients and students in Taiwan.</field><field name="creator">Ku, Yung-Li</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to test a series of theoretical models based on Beck (1967) cognitive diathesis-stress and Kwon and Oei (1994) linear mediational models as well as earlier research findings to determine the best-fitting model to explain the aetiological processes of suicide attempts in Taiwanese people. The participants were patients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorders (MDD) recruited from three hospitals in Taiwan. They were used for data analyses in both cross-sectional (main) study and longitudinal (follow-up) study. In addition, a sample of students recruited from three universities in Taiwan was used for data analyses in the generalized study to examine the generalization of the results from clinical depressed patients to nonclinical university students. In the main study, by the application of structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, four initial models were compared using the MDD patients (N = 162). The SEM analyses showed that two interactional models failed to provide an adequate fit to the given data, suggesting that the hypothesis of interaction between dysfunctional attitudes and negative life events in predicting the psychopathology of Taiwanese MDD patients was not supported. The SEM analyses supported two mediational models in terms of goodness-of-fit. Because the two mediational models were very similar, they were combined to form a combined mediational model. The SEM analyses indicated that the combined model provided an adequate fit to the given data. After modifying the model to improve its goodness-of-fit, the final modified combined mediational model was selected as the most appropriate in representing the data of Taiwanese MDD patients. The final model revealed that dysfunctional attitudes mediated the relationship between negative life events and depressive hopelessness, which in turn increased depression, which then precipitated suicidal ideation, which finally resulted in suicide attempts. In addition, it was found that negative life events exerted direct influences on depressive hopelessness and suicide attempts; sex and age exerted direct influences on negative life events. However, social support buffered the impact of negative life stress on dysfunctional attitudes and compliance with medications prevented the development of depression. In the follow-up study, the final modified combined mediational model was validated and reexamined with two-wave panel data gathered from the same population of Taiwanese MDD patients who participated in assessments twice, separated by a six-month interval (N = 142). The SEM analyses showed that the model provided an adequate fit to the two-wave panel data, suggesting that the model can be applied for predicting suicide attempts over six months in Taiwanese MDD patients. In the generalized study, the findings obtained from the MDD patients were replicated in a sample of Taiwanese university students (N = 324). Results revealed that the final modified combined mediational model failed to fit the given data. The result suggests that the most appropriate model for Taiwanese MDD patients can not be generalized to Taiwanese students. Some cautions and limitations should be noted. First, the models obtained from clinical and nonclinical people in Taiwan should not be directly generalized to people outside Taiwan. Further research using clinical and nonclinical samples from other countries to cross-validate the models was suggested. In addition, the researcher&#8217;s interventions during the follow-up period may disturb the relationship between predictor variables and subsequent suicide attempts. However, the problems appear to be unavoidable because of the research ethics of protecting participants from suicidal risk.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental illness -- Taiwan</field><field name="subject">Depression, Mental -- Research -- Taiwan.</field><field name="subject">Students -- Mental health -- Taiwan.</field><field name="subject">Students -- Psychological testing.</field><field name="subject">Students -- Suicidal behavior -- Taiwan.</field><field name="subject">Suicidal behavior -- Risk factors -- Taiwan.</field><field name="subject">Suicide -- Prevention -- Taiwan.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV/AIDS behavioral surveillance among men who have sex with men in China: community and internet based surveys.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Dapeng</field><field name="description">BACKGROUND The coverage of HIV/AIDS behavioral surveillance among MSM in China falls far short of what is necessary as the current approach is expensive and time consuming. In addition MSM are difficult to reach in China. Internet-based behavioral surveys have demonstrated a number of advantages compared with the traditional paper-pen method. Chinese MSM are avid users of the Internet. Use of the internet provides an opportunity to access this hard-to-reach population and explore their use of the Internet for sexual purposes as well as to assess risk behaviors among MSM internet users. This thesis aimed to explore the trends in risk behaviors and HIV prevalence among MSM using traditional community-based surveys and Internet surveys, and to analyze the potential of web-based behavioral surveillance among MSM by comparing the differences between Internet and community-based MSM samples, and then to provide insights for the future HIV/AIDS behavioral surveillance, epidemic estimation and prediction as well as health intervention among the Chinese MSM population. METHODS This study has three components. The first focuses on trends in HIV risk behaviors and prevalence among MSM in Harbin in northeast China, based on community-based surveys. Eligible participants were approached by peer recruiters in traditional gay venues and then interviewed by health professionals with a standard questionnaire. Urine samples were collected to screen their HIV status. The second part presents two cross-sectional, Internet-based surveys among MSM in China in 2006 and 2007. The study website was advertised on three selected gay websites using a series of banners, pop-ups and text notifications. After providing consent to the survey, eligible participants were invited to complete an online questionnaire. The third component compares the demographic characteristics and risk behaviors of two samples of Chinese MSM. Participants living in Heilongjiang Province were extracted from the 2006 online survey dataset to compare with the community sample of MSM recruited in Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang Province in the same year. KEY FINDINGS Community-based behavioral surveillance Among MSM in Harbin, a trend was observed towards more self-identifying as homosexual (from 58% to 80%) and more living with a male partner (from 12% to 41%) over the study period 2002-06. Although there was a trend towards a reduction in the rate of never using a condom and an increase in the rate of always using condoms during anal sex in the past six months, the prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) still remained at high level (from 90% in 2002 to 72% in 2006). Most respondents reported having multiple male sexual partners (&#8805; 2) in the past six months: 86.5% in 2002, 76.0% in 2004 and 91.6% in 2006. The HIV prevalence (2.2%, 15/674) among MSM in Harbin in 2006 was higher than that in previous survey years (1.3% in 2002 and 0.94% in 2004), but no statistically significant change was detected. Internet-based behavioral surveys Gay website users in China are young and well educated. The majority (85%) have used the Internet to seek sex and meeting sexual partners online, which is one of the most common reasons for visiting gay websites. Traditional gay venues still play an important role in the sex seeking process, especially for MSM who are older and less educated. Gay website users are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS given their high prevalence of UAI (56.6%) and multiple male sexual partners (66.5%). The type of partners plays an important role in determining consistent condom use. An increase in condom use was observed among MSM having sex between commercial partners relative to those having sex with non-regular partners and regular partners. Among the Internet sample, participants who have regular partners are less likely to have sex with females, less likely to have multiple partners and less likely to engage in commercial sex behaviors than those who do not. Comparisons between Internet and community samples There are significant differences in terms of demographic characteristics and risk behaviors between the Internet and community samples of MSM. The Internet sample was significantly younger, more educated and more likely to be students and self identify as homosexual. Among those who had anal sex in the past six months, the Internet sample tended to use condoms less consistently than the community sample. However, using the total sample size as the denominator to calculate the prevalence of UAI, no significant difference between the two samples was observed (AOR 1.02, CI 0.73-1.43, p = 0.905). After adjusting for differences in demographic characteristics, the community sample was more likely to have had sex with females (AOR 2.01, CI 1.22-3.30, p = 0.006) and have had &#8805; 6 male partners in the previous six months than the Internet sample (46.1% vs. 20.2%; AOR 4.88, CI 3.51-6.80, p &lt; 0.001). The mean number of male partners for the community sample was 13.5 &#177; 16.8, whereas it was 6.0 &#177; 12.2 for the Internet sample. CONCLUSIONS Although there is a trend towards an increase in condom use among MSM in China, they are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infection given their high prevalence of UAI and multiple sexual partners. Public sector officials at all levels need to recognize this risk for HIV transmission. Health promotion and behavioral interventions should be enforced and scaled up to meet the need for controlling HIV transmission among MSM in China. Since the Internet has become a risk environment for MSM and the online MSM population is significantly different from the traditional community MSM group, online MSM should be included as a risk group in national HIV sentinel and behavioral surveillance and the coverage of surveillance for this specific group should be expanded to better understand the health promotion needs of this community as part of an HIV/AIDS strategy in China.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV; AIDS; Behavioral surveillance; MSM; Internet; China</field><field name="subject">HIV infections--China</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease)--China</field><field name="subject">Gay men--Health and hygiene--China.</field><field name="subject">Gay men--China--Sexual behavior.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49985</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterisation of Shigella flexneri outer membrane protease IcsP.</field><field name="creator">Tran, Elizabeth Ngoc Hoa.</field><field name="description">Shigella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria responsible for bacillary dysentery in humans. Shigella flexneri type 2a in particular is responsible for the majority of incidents in developing countries. The S. flexneri protease IcsP, is a member of the Omptin family of outer membrane (OM) proteases which cleaves IcsA, a polarly localised OM protein required for Shigella virulence. Mutations in icsP have been shown to effect the observed distribution of IcsA, however the significance of IcsP in Shigella virulence is incompletely understood. In this study, aspects of IcsP biology were investigated. S. flexneri 2457T and M90T icsP mutants were constructed to investigate the role of IcsP in Shigella intercellular spread, and it was found that icsP in both S. flexneri backgrounds did not appear to be essential for cell-tocell spread in human cervical cancer HeLa cells, but enhanced cell-to-cell spread in monkey kidney CV-1 cells (as determined by plaque assays). Complementation with icsP returned the mutant phenotype to wild-type. The results suggest IcsP does play a role in Shigella intercellular spread. The 2457T icsP mutant was subsequently complemented with an altered icsP gene encoding a haemagglutinin epitope tagged IcsP (IcsPHA) to determine the distribution of IcsP on the cell surface. In both S. flexneri and E. coli K-12 possessing smooth and rough lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the distribution of IcsPHA was found to be punctate across the cell surface. Deconvolution analysis revealed that IcsP distribution was punctate and banded in both LPS backgrounds. A smooth LPS E. coli K-12 yfdI mutant strain expressing IcsPHA was also constructed, and experiments involving treatment of this strain with bacteriophage Sf6 tail spike protein suggested that LPS O antigen chains masked IcsP in smooth LPS strains. During these studies, double-labelling of IcsPHA and LPS in a S. flexneri 5a M90T strain revealed a helical distribution of LPS in this strain. Overall, the results suggest IcsP has a punctate, banded distribution across the cell surface. The effect of virK and rmlD mutations on IcsP was then investigated by constructing a virK, rmlD and virK/rmlD double mutant in S. flexneri 2457T. Western immunoblotting showed no change in IcsP expression levels in either the virK, rmlD or virK/rmlD mutants compared to wild-type. Surprisingly, the virK mutant showed no change in IcsA expression levels by Western immunoblotting and plaque assays (using HeLa and CV-1 cells) suggested that virK was not essential for Shigella intercellular spread (contradicting the published data on this gene). No effect was also observed on IcsP expression level or on IcsP&#8217;s ability to cleave IcsA into culture supernatants. Finally alternative substrates for the protease activity of IcsP were investigated against known Omptin substrates (plasminogen, &#945;2-antiplasmin, complement, protamine and colicins). However, IcsP appeared to have no effect on these substrates as determined by proteolytic cleavage assays and antimicrobial assay. Interestingly, Plg cleavage by rough LPS S. flexneri, and &#945;2AP cleavage by both smooth and rough LPS S. flexneri, was observed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shigella flexneri; IcsP; Outer membrane; Protease</field><field name="subject">Shigella flexneri Molecular genetics.

However, efficacy of UV disinfection is limited by the combined effect of suspended solids concentration and UV absorbance. Limited published UV disinfection data are available that account for the combined effects of UV dose, suspended solids concentration and UV absorbance. This present lack of a rigorous quantitative understanding of the kinetics of UV disinfection limits process optimisation and wider application of UV treatment. The development and validation of an adequate model to describe UV disinfection kinetics presented in this thesis can therefore be justified by an increased confidence of reliability of design for UV disinfection. Using the published data of Nguyen (1999), four established model forms were assessed to account for the combined effect of suspended solids and/or soluble UV absorbing compounds, and UV dose on the efficacy of disinfection. The four model forms were: a log-linear form, Davey Linear-Arrhenius (DL-A), Square-Root (or Ratkowsky- Belehradek) and a general nth order Polynomial (nOP) form that was limited to a third order. Criteria for assessment of an adequate predictive model were established including: accuracy of predicted against observed values, percent variance accounted for (%V), and; appraisal of residuals. The DL-A model was shown to best fit the data for UV disinfection of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922); followed by the nOP, log-linear and Square-Root forms. However, the DL-A form must be used in conjunction with a first-order chemical reaction equation, and was shown to predict poorly at high experimental values of UV dose (&gt; 40,000 &#956;Ws cm-2). The DL-A model was not amenable to extrapolation beyond the observed UV dose range. To overcome the shortcomings of the Davey Linear-Arrhenius model synthesis of two new, non-linear model forms was undertaken. The two models were a modified exponentially damped polynomial (EDPm) and a form based on the Weibull probability distribution. The EDPm model has three terms: a rate coefficient (k), a damping coefficient (&#955;), and; a breakpoint dose ([dose]B). The rate coefficient governs the initial rate of disinfection prior to the onset of tailing, whilst the breakpoint is the UV dose that indicates the onset of tailing. The damping coefficient controls curvature in the survivor curve. The Weibull model has just two terms: a dimensionless scale parameter (&#946;0), and; a shape parameter (&#946;1). The scale parameter represents the level of disinfection in the tail of the survivor curve (as log10 N/N0), whilst the shape parameter governs the degree of curvature of the survivor data. Each model was assessed against the independent and published UV disinfection data of Nelson (2000) for treatment of faecal coliforms in a range of waste stabilisation pond effluents. Both models were found to be well suited to account for tailing in these UV disinfection data. Overall, the EDPm model gave a better fit to the data than the Weibull model form. To rigorously validate the suitability of the new EDPm and Weibull models a series of experimental trials were designed and carried out in a small-scale pilot UV disinfection unit. These trials included data determined specifically at low values of UV dose (&lt;10,000 &#956;Ws cm-2) to fill the gap in the experimental data of Nguyen (1999). The experimental trials were carried out using a commercially available, UV disinfection unit (LC5TM from Ultraviolet Technology of Australasia Pty Ltd). Purified water contaminated with Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) with a range of feed water flow rates (1 to 4 L min-1) was used. E. coli was selected because it is found in sewage, or water contaminated with faecal material, and is used as an indicator for the presence of enteric pathogens. E. coli should not be present in potable water. The hydrodynamics of water flow within the disinfection unit were established using digital video photography of dye trace studies with Methylene Blue. Nominal UV dose (2,700 to 44,200 &#956;Ws cm-2) was controlled by manipulating the flow rate of feed water through the UV disinfection unit (i.e. residence time), or by varying the exposed length of the control volume of the disinfection unit. The transmittance of the feed water (at 254 nm) was adjusted by the addition of either a soluble UV absorbing agent (International RoastTM instant coffee powder; 0.001 to 0.07 g L-1), or by addition of suspended matter as diatomaceous earth (Celite 503TM; 0.1 to 0.7 g L-1, with a median particle size of 23 &#956;m). The absorbing agent (instant coffee), when in a comparable concentration, was found to produce a greater reduction in water transmission than the suspended material (Celite 503TM). It therefore contributed to a greater reduction in the initial rate of disinfection. Neither agent was found to produce a systematic reduction in the observed efficacy of disinfection however. Experimental results highlight that in the absence of soluble absorbing agents, or suspended solids, the initial rate of disinfection is higher when fewer viable bacteria are initially present. Both the new EDPm and Weibull forms gave a good fit to the experimental data. The EDPm better fitted the data on the basis of residual sum-of-squares (0.03 to 2.13 for EDPm cf. 0.16 to 4.37 for the Weibull form). These models are both of a form suitable for practical use in modelling UV disinfection data. Results of this research highlight the impact of water quality, as influenced by the combined effect of UV dose, suspended solids concentration and UV absorbance, on small-scale UV disinfection for potable water production. Importantly, results show that the concentration of soluble UV absorbing agents and suspended solids are not in themselves sufficient criteria on which to base assessment of efficacy of UV disinfection</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ultraviolet; Disinfection kinetics; Predictive model</field><field name="subject">Drinking water Analysis</field><field name="subject">Drinking water Contamination</field><field name="subject">Water Purification Disinfection</field><field name="subject">Ultraviolet radiation Adverse effects.</field><field name="subject">Chemical kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palaeo- to Mesoproterozoic evolution of the Gawler Craton, Australia: geochronological, geochemical and isotopic constraints.</field><field name="creator">Payne, Justin L.</field><field name="description">The Gawler Craton, South Australia, consists of late Archaean to early Mesoproterozoic igneous and supracrustal lithologies which preserve a deformation history lasting the duration of the Palaeoproterozoic. Understanding the evolution of the Gawler Craton is of significance in global supercontient reconstructions as it preserves evidence for earliest Palaeoproterozoic collisional orogenesis (c. 2460-2430 Ma) and, in conjunction with the North Australian Craton and Antarctica, has often been correlated to the western margin of Laurentia. In addition, the Gawler Craton is also host to the world-class Olympic Dam Fe-oxide-Cu-Au-U type-deposit (world's fourth largest Cu and largest U deposit) and related Fe-oxide-Cu-Au-U and Cu-Au mineralising systems. Despite the various geologically and economically important characteristics of the Gawler Craton there has traditionally been a poor understanding of the tectonothermal evolution of the Gawler Craton, in particular for the Palaeoproterozoic. This study addresses and refines the Palaeo-to Mesoproterozoic tectonothermal evolution of the Gawler Craton. This is done using geochemical, geochronological and isotopic analytical techniques to better understand selected supracrustal and igneous lithologies in the Gawler Craton and the orogenic events which have affected them.   Largely unexposed metasedimentary lithologies of the northern Gawler Craton record multiple deformation events but have previously been virtually unconstrained with respect to their timing of protolith deposition and the age of deformation/metamorphism. New geochronological data demonstrate these metasedimentary lithologies were deposited during the time period -1750-1730 Ma before being metamorphosed and deformed during the Kimban (1730-1690 Ma) and Kararan (1570-1545 Ma) Orogenies. Detrital zircon geochronology and isotopic and geochemical characteristics of the sampled metasedimentary lithologies suggest a relatively similar protolith sedimentary succession was deposited across a large extent of the northern Gawler Craton. Detritus for the sedimentary protolith does not appear to have been sourced from the Gawler Craton. Instead the protolith it is more consistent with a North Australian Craton provenance suggesting a proximity between the northern Gawler Craton and North Australian Craton at the time of protolith deposition.   The newly defined presence of the Palaeoproterozoic Kimban Orogeny in the northern Gawler Craton demonstrates the Kimban Orogeny to be a major, high-grade, craton-wide orogenic event. This finding contradicts previous suggestions that the northern Gawler Craton was accreted to the proto-Gawler Craton during the later Mesoproterozoic Kararan Orogeny. In addition, previous reconstruction models for the Palaeo-to early Mesoproterozoic often cite the felsic Tunkillia Suite (1690-1670 Ma), western and central Gawler Craton, as representing arc magmatism prior to the subsequent amalgamation of the Gawler Craton during the Kararan Orogeny. New geochemical and isotopic data for the Tunkillia Suite have allowed for re-examination of the tectonic setting for the petrogenesis of the Tunkillia Suite. Contrary to previous suggestions (based upon discrimination diagrams), the mineralogy, geochemistry and isotopic characteristics of the Tunkillia Suite are not consistent with arc-magmatism. Instead the Tunkillia Suite is interpreted to represent a late-to post-tectonic magmatic suite generated during the waning stages of the Kimban Orogeny. This petrogenesis further highlights the importance of the Kimban Orogeny as a fundamental tectonothermal event in the evolution of the Gawler Craton.   Subsequent to the Kimban Orogeny, the Gawler Craton was thought to undergo a period of subduction-related magmatism (St Peter Suite) prior to the anorogenic magmatism of the voluminous felsic Gawler Range Volcanic (GRV) and Hiltaba Suite magmatism (1595-1575 Ma). New geochronological data for the ms-bi-gt-bearing peraluminous Munjeela Suite (1590-1580 Ma) have demonstrated the Hiltaba/GRV event was accompanied by significant crustal anatexis not associated with the Hiltaba/GRV magmatism. The Munjeela Suite and metasedimentary enclaves within it demonstrate that the Gawler Craton was likely to be undergoing compressive deformation and crustal thickening sometime during the petrogenesis of the Hiltaba/GRV magmatism. This suggests the Hiltaba/GRV magmatism did not occur in an anorogenic setting as previously proposed.   The findings of this study are incorporated into a revised tectonothermal evolution of the Gawler Craton. This is used to discuss previous reconstruction models for Proterozoic Australia and provide a new reconstruction model of Australia and Antarctica during the Palaeoproterozoic. Important facets of the proposed model are links to the Archaean-Early Palaeoproterozoic Sask Craton in the Trans-Hudson Orogen, Laurentia, and the joint evolution of the North Australian and Gawler Cratons throughout the entire Palaeoproterozoic.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gawler Craton; Palaeoproterozoic; Plate tectonic; Isotope geochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentology, sequence stratigraphy and reservoir quality of the Early Cretaceous Murta Formation, Eromanga Basin, Central Australia.</field><field name="creator">Al-Anzi, Homoud</field><field name="description">The Eromanga Basin hosts the Early Cretaceous reservoir sediments of the Murta Formation and its basal McKinlay Member of prograding fluvio-lacustrine and deltaic origin that are characterized by low oil production and recovery factors which are heavily controlled by depositional facies. The integration of the concepts of facies associations, sequence stratigraphy and petrography enabled this study to map the continuity of the Murta Formation and to point out the effect of the diagenetic features on the reservoir quality. The diagenetic effects and spatial distribution of the depositional facies in the basin are essential in nominating locations of good quality reservoirs. The aims of this study were: to characterize the chronostratigraphic depositional facies and distribution, to examine the affect of diagenesis on reservoir quality and to define those parts of the basin where potential reservoir sands are likely to be found. A detailed analysis of depositional facies in the Murta Formation and its basal McKinlay Member was based on drill core analysis and regional wireline log correlations. The application of non-marine sequence stratigraphic concepts to the wireline logs and core description data have led to the identification of 7 chronostratigraphic units. This data was used in constructing a series of schematic palaeogeographic and isopach maps of the study area to predict the changes in depositional styles with time and space. Six depositional facies were identified in the study area with overall fine-grained sandstones, siltstones and mudstones. These depositional facies include; distributary channels, shoreline, protected shoreline, deltaic mouth bars, tempestites and turbidites deposits. One particular unit, the transgressive systems tracts of the McKinlay Member, (Unit 7) is the best target for reservoir development because of relatively high proportion of pay sands, medium to coarse-grained sand sizes and good reservoir quality with low diagenetic affects. High stand systems tract units 2, 3 and 5 are considered to be secondary reservoir targets because of diagenetic affects and their fine-grained character. Units 1, 4 and 6 are not considered of economic value for oil production because of their extremely low reservoir quality and muddy lithologies. The main diagenetic affects on sandstones (quartzarenites) in the study area are quartz overgrowths, formation of authigenic clay (kaolinite), carbonate cement (calcite and siderite), formation of microstylolites (pressure solution) and dissolution of the framework grains to form secondary pores. The McKinlay Member of the Murta Formation in South Australia consists mainly of medium to coarse-grained sandstones of distributary channel origin (facies association 1). It has the highest recorded porosity and permeability (9.5% and 36.8mD respectively). Shoreline, protected shoreline, deltaic mouth bars and tempestites deposits, mainly from Jackson-Naccowlah Trend wells in Queensland, are of finegrained sandstones (facies associations 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively). They have adequate average porosity (7%), but the formation of microstylolites and associated mica parallel to the bedding planes inhibited vertical permeability and has been recorded to be as low as 3.1mD. Turbidites in the central basin are characterized by extremely low reservoir quality (2.6% and 0.25 mD) and muddy lithologies of facies association 6 that are severely degraded by diagenetic effects.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Murta Formation; Dullingari, Strzelecki; Eromanga Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of sustained deficit irrigation on physiology and phenolic compounds in winegrapes and wine.</field><field name="creator">Chalmers, Yasmin Michelle</field><field name="description">Wine grape production in the semi-arid regions of Australia is successful due to the availability of irrigation water. Whilst water is a natural resource it is also becoming extremely valuable. In the hot and semi-arid regions of Australia, the prospect of water restrictions from drought and intensifying horticultural and domestic competition for water has prompted the grape and wine industry to implement strategic deficit irrigation practices to try and maintain sustainable wine grape production. Sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) differs significantly in its management to partial rootzone drying and regulated deficit irrigation and is a technique that could potentially be easily adopted across the winegrape industry if water allocations were reduced. With SDI, the water deficit is not created by withholding water, but rather, by applying a lesser volume of water at each irrigation event for the entire irrigation season. This study aimed to understand the physiological behaviour of wine grape cultivars to SDI and how this deficit irrigation strategy would influence yield and composition of the grapes and wine. The trials were conducted during 2003-2006 on the cultivars Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz grafted to 140 Ruggeri (V. berlandieri x V. rupestris) rootstock and grown in the Murray-Darling region of Australia. Furthermore, while Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz are the main red winegrape varieties grown in the Murray-Darling region, anectodally they are observed to respond differently to hot, dry conditions when managed under similar irrigation regimes. The vines were drip irrigated providing 100% of estimated ETc (control) and three graded sustained water deficits (Cabernet Sauvignon 70%, 52% and 43% of the control; Shiraz 65%, 45% and 34% of the control). For each season, the volume of actual water applied (ML/ha) was calculated for each irrigation treatment and varied depending on seasonal and vineyard conditions. To further explore vine responses to water deficit, glasshouse studies on four own-rooted Vitis vinifera L. cultivars, including Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Grenache and Tempranillo were also conducted. Deficit irrigation management, whilst controlling vegetative growth and manipulating berry composition, may not always produce consistent outcomes among grapevine varieties. This has lead to the observation that deficit irrigation management strategies may need to be tailored to individual grape cultivars. Consequently, an understanding as to how certain grapevine varieties respond to water deficit, particularly in relation to physiological responses, could assist with linking any impacts that water deficits may have on grape and wine composition. Field-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz exposed to approximately 50% SDI experienced significant reductions in leaf water potential and stomatal conductance compared to the control. By contrast, xylem sap abscisic acid (ABA) levels increased significantly for the SDI-treated vines compared to the control that is probably related to root to shoot signals and canopy-derived ABA. Under field situations, Cabernet Sauvignon displayed physiological responses more typical of an isohydric-like (drought avoiding) vine, compared to the anisohydric-like (drought tolerant) responses of Shiraz. These responses may also be supported by the pattern of xylem sap [ABA] production. The differences in canopy development (leaf area index and pruning weights) for Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz may be a reflection of the isohydric-like and anisohydric-like responses of these grape varieties to water deficit, thereby influencing carbohydrate dynamics and long-term viability of vine health under SDI. After three seasons, the SDI treatments significantly reduced yield of the field-grown vines, primarily due to a reduction in berry weight that tended to occur from the beginning of veraison through to harvest. SDI reduced yield (t/ha) by up to 30% in Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz, when applied at approximately 50% of the control irrigation (ML/ha). Irrespective of the yield reductions, water use efficiency was improved between 40-50% for the SDI-treated Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz, compared to the control. The lighter berries from SDI-treated vines tended to have increased pH and decreased titratable acid levels than the control. The SDI treatments applied at approximately 50% of the control increased the concentration of total anthocyanins in Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz berries by 22% and 15% respectively. As less water was applied there was an increase in total malvidin concentration for both varieties, with less effect on delphinidin, peonidin, petunidin and cyanidin for Cabernet Sauvignon and peonidin, petunidin, delphinidin and cyanidin for Shiraz. The increase in total anthocyanin and total phenolic concentrations for the SDI treatments than the control is attributed more to factors such as water deficit, canopy light penetration and/or changes in phenolic synthesis, than to differences in berry size (skin surface area to pulp volume ratio). Differences in grape anthocyanins and phenolics between the irrigation treatments were not the same as those measured in the wine. A decrease in berry weight did not alter the skin weight to berry weight ratios, and were therefore unlikely to be the cause of the altered composition of SDI wines. The increases in wine colour with SDI treatment may be the result of biochemical changes in the flavonoid pathway as a result of altered grapevine physiology responses to the SDI. Alternatively, the increases in red wine colour could possibly be due to a change in chemical properties of the anthocyanins to copigmented forms that may have influenced extractability efficiency during the winemaking or ageing process. This research showed that an SDI of approximately 50% less water could be applied over one or two seasons with improvements in water use efficiency (t/ML) and berry composition compared to fully irrigated vines. Furthermore, for Cabernet Sauvignon exposed to 70% and 52% SDI there tended to be improvements in the overall wine composition and sensory ranking than the control. However from an economic perspective, net returns were not largely affected by using SDI based on the current grape prices. If water becomes a more highly valued resource and priced accordingly, then a larger increase in net return will result from SDI. Additionally, wineries would need to offer price incentives to produce lower yields that may result from adopting SDI. Overall, if the wine industry was faced with reductions in water allocations of 50% or more in a particular season, then the adoption of SDI may be a feasible solution to maintaining winegrape production for the short-term. Through understanding the translation of grape composition into wine, these findings should be able to provide additional knowledge to the Australian grape and wine industry as to how SDI can be used to manipulate grape composition for the production of sustainable wine styles.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio of recorded performances and exegesis: the evolution of the bassoon and its impact upon solo repertoire and performance.</field><field name="creator">Stone, Emily Clare</field><field name="description">The research investigated the conception of the early bassoon in the late 1600&#8217;s and its subsequent development through to the modern day.

This thesis explores cross-cultural encounters and relations between the Narungga and Europeans in the nineteenth century. Contemporary Narungga people, hoping to learn about the lives of their forebears, instigated this research. The Narungga have not previously been the focus of serious historical or anthropological investigation. This thesis therefore fills a significant gap in the historiography. This thesis seeks to re-imagine the past in a way which is empathetic and realistic to Narungga people who lived in the nineteenth century. To understand the impact of the arrival and permanent settlement of Europeans upon the lives of the Narungga, it is necessary to look closely at the cultural systems which orientated and encompassed both the Narungga and the newcomers. The two groups impacted on and shaped the lives of the other and neither can be looked at in isolation. This work has been inspired by the writings of historical anthropologists and ethno-historians. The findings of anthropologists, linguists, geographers, botanists and archaeologists are drawn upon. First hand accounts which provide graphic and immediate depictions of events have been closely analysed. The primary sources that have been examined include local and Adelaide newspapers, official correspondence between settlers, police, the Protector of Aborigines, the Governor and the Colonial Secretary, and private letters, diaries, paintings, photographs and sketches. The archives continuously reveal great injustices committed against the Narungga, and this thesis does not seek to minimize the brutality of &#8216;white&#8217; settlement nor the devastating outcomes of British colonialism on the Narungga. But the records also reveal the majority of Narungga people living in the nineteenth century were not helpless victims being pushed around by autocratic pastoralists or disengaged bureaucrats. On Yorke Peninsula in the nineteenth century, the future was unknown; the Narungga were largely able to maintain their autonomy while Europeans were often in a vulnerable and dependent position. The Narungga were active agents who adapted to and incorporated the new circumstances as they were able and as they saw fit. Rather than living in a closed or static society, the Narungga readily accommodated and even welcomed the Europeans, with their strange customs and exotic animals, plants and goods. The Narungga responded to the presence of Europeans in a way which made sense to them and which was in keeping with their customs and beliefs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narungga; Aboriginal people; European settler; Pastoralist; Point Pearce Mission; Cross-cultural violence; Accommodation; Agency; Frontier; Court; Policemen</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians South Australia Yorke Peninsula (S.

An emphasis on biomedical, as opposed to bio-psychosocial models, underestimates psychological disability and fails to explain burdens resulting from illnesses with no known organic cause. Topics explored were: quality of life, chronic and acute stress, emotion regulation, communication, support services, patient expectations, satisfaction with medical treatment, and health care seeking. Using grounded theory (Glaser, 1992) and active patient participation (Susman &amp; Evered, 1978), the major objective was to develop strategies to improve the management of chronic illness. Two groups were studied: 20 patients with an organic cause (cancer) and 21 patients with a non-organic cause (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). Using quantitative and qualitative measures, observational studies (N=29), interviews (N=41), focus groups (N=12), and a case study (N=10) were conducted. IBS patients reported greater disability (increased distress and reduced quality of life) than the cancer group and other chronic illnesses. Cancer patients showed impaired quality of life but they reported levels of distress up to 50% lower than the general population and 75% lower than another chronic illness group. Some cancer patients appeared to under-report levels of distress; however, when applying Pennebaker&#8217;s (1997) written disclosure method, emotional expression was not uniformly associated with beneficial outcomes. Interviews with IBS patients revealed that determinants of dissatisfaction involved a lack of acceptance and/or understanding of an IBS diagnosis and an expectation that consultants would find an organic cause. Cancer participants reported no need for participation in decisions concerning treatment. Evaluations of the quality of health services received were distinct from evaluations of the quality of care received by specialists. Fighting spirit and positivity were linked with emotional inhibition and a lack of uptake of support services. Patients became more pro-active in seeking emotional and social support later in their illness experience. These findings were interpreted within the Conservation of Resources Theory (COR; Hobfoll, 2001; 1999; 1998). Results in this study challenge public policy recommendations that focus on encouraging consumer participation in health care. Recommendations for intervention and future research with cancer patients focus on application of the COR theory. In IBS, patient education, improvements in communication and the adoption of Drossman&#8217;s (1998) bio-psychosocial model are advocated. Finally, recommendations for improvements in methodology involve suggestions to incorporate quantitative and qualitative measures using longitudinal assessments with the grounded theory (Glaser, 1992) approach being an excellent methodological template.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disability; Chronic illness; Cancer; IBS; Psychosocial; Distress; Quality of life; Emotional inhibition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Androgen signalling in normal and malignant breast epithelial cells.</field><field name="creator">Peters, Amelia Alice</field><field name="description">The growth and survival of normal breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cells is promoted by estrogens. In contrast, androgens inhibit the proliferation of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells. While this effect of androgens on breast cells appears to be androgen receptor (AR) dependent, the precise mechanism of inhibition and its functional significance are unknown. The aims of this thesis were to investigate the effect of androgen signalling on growth of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells, and to assess the interactions between androgen and estrogen signalling in the breast. To investigate the role of androgen signalling in the growth and development of the normal mammary gland, female mice were treated with either the native androgen 5&#945;- dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or the antiandrogen, flutamide. Analysis of the mammary glands at the end of the treatment period demonstrated that DHT reduced ductal branching and mammary epithelial cell proliferation when treatment commenced mid-puberty. Conversely, flutamide treatment that commenced post-puberty significantly increased ductal branching and proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. This data demonstrates that androgen signalling inhibits proliferation in the normal mammary gland, and may therefore oppose to the growth stimulatory effects of estrogen signalling to regulate breast growth and development. The antiproliferative effects of androgens on breast epithelial cells may be due in part to direct AR-mediated activation of androgen regulated genes, or alternatively, androgens could act indirectly through AR to inhibit estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) activity. Expression of fulllength AR or a truncated, constitutively active AR (AR-T707) significantly inhibited the activity of ectopically expressed ER&#945; in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (ER&#945;- and ARnegative), in a dose-dependent manner. The functional consequences of inhibition of estrogen signalling by overexpressing AR were investigated in the T-47D breast cancer cell line (ER&#945;- and AR-positive). Expression of AR-T707 in T-47D cells resulted in inhibition of both basal and estradiol-induced cell proliferation and a marked reduction in the steady-state protein levels of the estrogen regulated gene, PR. The final chapter investigated the mechanism by which AR inhibits ER&#945; activity. A coimmunoprecipitation assay demonstrated an interaction between ectopically expressed AR and ER&#945; in COS-1 cells, but not endogenous AR and ER&#945; in a breast cancer cell line. To delineate the regions of AR required for inhibition of ER&#945; signalling, various functional domains of the AR were mutated or deleted. Reporter gene assays showed that the inhibitory effects of AR were abrogated by deletion or mutation of the DNA binding domain (DBD). Furthermore, overexpression of the AR-DBD alone was sufficient to inhibit ER&#945; activity. Consistent with a requirement for the DBD of AR to inhibit ER&#945; activity, mobility shift assays demonstrated binding of AR to the Xenopus vitellogenin A2 consensus estrogen response element (cERE); however AR/ER&#945; heterodimers were not detected on a cERE. Consistent with these findings, molecular modelling demonstrated that it is feasible for the DBD of AR to bind to a cERE and that it is unlikely that AR/ER&#945; heterodimers could bind. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated recruitment of AR to the promoters of endogenous estrogen regulated genes. The findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of AR on ER&#945; activity may occur either via formation of non-functional AR/ER&#945; heterodimers that are unable to bind to EREs, or AR homodimers competing effectively for binding to EREs, in ER&#945; target genes. The results in this thesis demonstrate an inhibitory effect of androgen signalling on growth of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells. Additionally, the inhibition of breast epithelial cell proliferation by androgen signalling can be attributed, at least in part, to inhibition of ER&#945; activity. These studies have provided insight into androgen action in the breast, and support a model whereby androgens balance the stimulatory effects of estrogen signalling in normal and malignant breast epithelial cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breast cancer; mammary gland; estrogen receptor; androgen receptor; estrogen; androgen</field><field name="subject">Androgens</field><field name="subject">Breast Cancer Endocrine aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fading of signals propagating in the ionosphere for wide bandwidth high-frequency radio systems.</field><field name="creator">Yau, Kin Shing Bobby</field><field name="description">The use of High-Frequency (HF) radio-wave propagation in the ionosphere remains prevalent for applications such as long-range communication, target detection and commercial broadcasting. The ionosphere presents a challenging channel for radio-wave propagation as it is a varying medium dependent on a number of external factors. Of the many adverse effects of ionospheric propagation, signal fading is one of the most difficult to eliminate due to its unpredictable nature. Increase in the knowledge of how the ionospheric channel affects the propagating signals, in particular fading of the signals, will drive the continual improvements in the reliability and performance of modern wide-bandwidth HF systems. This is the underlying motivation for the study of signal fading of HF radio-waves propagating through the ionosphere, from both the theoretical and experimental perspectives, with the focus of application to modern wide bandwidth HF systems. Furthermore, it is the main objective of this investigation to address the lacking in the current literature of a simple analytical signal fading model for wideband HF systems that relates the physics of the ionospheric irregularities to the observable propagation effects due to the irregularities, and one that is verified by experimental observations. An original approach was taken in the theoretical investigation to develop an analytical model that combines the effects of signal fading and directly relating them to the ionospheric irregularities that are causing the fading. The polarisation fading model (PFM) is a combination of geometric optics, perturbation techniques and frequency offset techniques to derive expressions for the Faraday rotation of the radio-wave propagating in the ionosphere. Using the same notation as the PFM, the amplitude fading model (AFM) extends the Complex Amplitude concept using perturbation techniques and Green&#8217;s functions solution to arrive at a set of expressions that describes the focussing and defocussing effects of the wave. The PFM and AFM, together with expressions for combining the effects of multiple propagation paths, provide a simple analytic model that completely describes the fading of the signal propagating in the ionosphere. This theoretical model was implemented into an efficient ionospheric propagation simulator (IPS) from which simulations of wide bandwidth HF signals propagating through the ionosphere can be undertaken. As an example of the type of results produced by the IPS, for a typical 1200km path in the north-south direction with the ionospheric channel under the influence of a travelling ionospheric disturbance (TID), a 10 MHz radio-wave signal in one-hop path is shown to be affected by polarisation fading with fading periods in the order of minutes, and a fading bandwidth in the order of 100 kHz. Further results generated by the IPS have shown to be consistent with the results reported elsewhere in the literature. The experimental investigation involves the study of signal fading from observations of real signals propagating in the ionosphere, a major part of which is the development of a digital compact channel probe (CCP) capable of operating in dual-polarisation mode, and the characterisation of such systems to ensure that data collected are not compromised by the non-idealities of the individual devices contained within the system. The CCP was deployed in experiments to collect transmissions of HF frequency-modulated continuouswave (FMCW) radio signals from the Jindalee Over-the-Horizon radar (OTHR) in dualpolarisation. Analyses of the collected data showed the full anatomy of fading of signals propagating in the ionosphere for both horizontal and vertical polarisations, the results of which are consistent with that from the IPS and thus verifying the validity of the theoretical model of fading. Further experimental results showed that in majority of the observations polarisation fading is present but can be masked by multi-path fading, and confirming that periods of rapid signal fading are associated with rapid changes in the ionospheric channel. From the theoretical and experimental investigations, the major achievement is the successful development of an efficient propagation simulator IPS based on the simple analytical expressions derived in the PFM and AFM theoretical models of signal fading, which has produced sensible signal fading results that are verified by experimental observations. One of the many outcomes of this investigation is that polarisation diversity has the potential to bring improvements to the quality of wide-bandwidth HF signals in a fading susceptible propagation channel. The combination of an efficient propagation simulator IPS based on theoretical signal fading model and the experimental data collection by the dual-polarisation CCP is a major step in allowing one to fully understand the different aspects of fading of signals propagating in the ionosphere, which sets a solid foundation for further research into the design of wide bandwidth HF systems and the possible fading mitigation techniques.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ionospheric propagation; signal fading; Faraday rotation; HF radio systems; software radio; polarisation fading; ray tracing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Belleville rouge, Belleville noir, Belleville rose: re&#769;pre&#769;sentations d&#8217;un quartier parisien depuis le Moyen A&#770;ge jusqu&#8217;a&#768; l&#8217;an 2000.</field><field name="creator">Stott, Carolyn Anne</field><field name="description">The suburb of Belleville is situated on the north-eastern outskirts of inner Paris. Its particular blend of social strata, race and architecture has made it a site of interest for historians, writers and artists since the Middle Ages. Thanks in part to the phenomenal success of Daniel Pennac&#8217;s six tome Malauss&#232;ne series, published towards the end of the 20th century and situated in Belleville, the site has continued to enjoy a privileged status among the historical and cultural precincts of Paris. The representation of Belleville in the written and spoken word has a long history, part of which has been told, although in somewhat piecemeal fashion to date. Existing research may be divided into 3 categories, corresponding to the disciplines of history, sociology and literature. Historical studies are extensive and tend to support the suburb&#8217;s reputation as a site of revolution and social unrest. The sociological studies focus on immigration to the suburb and on the consequences of its physical transformation over the last half of the 20th century. The overall image presented by sociologists is one of a cosmopolitan suburb whose inhabitants manage to co-exist peacefully despite the multicultural mix; Belleville&#8217;s reputation as a melting pot success story sits at odds with that of its image as a centre of rebellion. Literature-based research conducted into the suburb is more sketchy; Belleville&#8217;s association with the noir genre and its inherent illicit elements also contrasts with the previous observations. If the existing studies present various pictures of historical and contemporary Belleville, they do not, however, give a comprehensive image of the suburb, nor do they provide an analysis of the role of Belleville in the noir genre, with particular reference to the Malauss&#232;ne series. I have thus undertaken a multidisciplinary study of the suburb, with the objective of establishing links between the history, sociology and the literature of Belleville, of gaining an understanding of the function of Belleville as a setting for detective fiction and of offering a new explanation of the success of Pennac&#8217;s Malauss&#232;ne series, by relating it to his representation of Belleville. The three focus areas of my research are its history from the Middle Ages until the end of the 20th century, its diverse representations in literature and popular culture, and its connection to a particular literary genre: the noir. The originality of my project lies in the method created to categorise existing research. Belleville rouge presents a view of the site as historically antiauthoritarian in its attempts to promote social justice. Belleville rose incorporates those studies which emphasise the suburb to varying degrees as a utopia, a model of social harmony or a centre of joyful festivities. Belleville noir focuses on the choice of the suburb as backdrop for the noir genre in literature and film; a hub of transgression and criminal activity, the antithesis of the positive space presented in the second category. The first part of my research project looks at the history of Belleville, the changing nature of its borders, which differ greatly from the administrative division according to author and historian, and the creation of a collective Belleville identity. Part two examines the representations of Belleville in literature and popular culture from the Middle Ages until the year 2000, and furthermore attempts to determine to what extent these cultural representations correspond to the suburb&#8217;s history. The third section deals with the role of Belleville in noir film and literature. If a single image corresponding to the d&#233;cor of the neo-polar genre begins to emerge from the representations of Belleville by the film directors and various authors whose texts make up our corpus, this image differs greatly from the nostalgic one offered by Daniel Pennac; his representation of the suburb is hence treated separately. It is this strong sense of attachment to, and identification with, Belleville that is underlined by Pennac in his Malauss&#232;ne series. Setting himself apart from his n&#233;o-polar contemporaries, Pennac draws heavily on all of the three faces of Belleville: the rouge, the rose and the noir. His refusal to adhere strictly to the n&#233;o-polar genre and his corresponding tendency to borrow from other genres such as the fairy tale, has resulted in a fusion of the real and the mythological which has engendered in his series a streak of optimism not found in the works of his contemporaries. Pennac draws on the history and traditions of the suburb to thus present an original view of contemporary Belleville as a peace-loving, cohesive community. If we accept that the cultural memory of a site is dictated in part by its inhabitants, and hence is in constant evolution, outlasting its physical appearance, Pennac&#8217;s role of guardian of the cultural memory of Belleville may extend to that of the cultural memory of the French nation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Belleville; Paris; French popular culture; French detective fiction</field><field name="subject">Belleville (Paris, France) History.</field><field name="subject">Belleville (Paris, France) Social life and customs.</field><field name="subject">Popular culture France Paris History.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Battlefield trauma (exposure, psychiatric diagnosis and outcomes)</field><field name="creator">Coxon, Robert Andrew</field><field name="description">These original data for this research were documented in the clinical diary records of an army psychiatrist on deployment in Vietnam during 1969&#8211;70. This study is unique due to the original battlefield diagnosis data used for foundation comparison analysis and longitudinal retrospective case control paired measurement. In battlefield psychiatric assessment diagnostic data recorded in Vietnam during 1969&#8211;70 of 119 Australian military servicemen (Experimental group) who presented battlefield trauma exposure reactions were examined. The research case controls (Control group) are 275 Australian Vietnam veterans selected from data at the Australian War Memorial Research Centre. Case control identified participants did not present with medical symptoms in 1969-70 and presented the same demographic profile as the Experimental group population. This research examined whether initial psychiatric illnesses initiated by battlefield trauma exposure in 1969-70 by a cohort of Vietnam veterans would have long term pernicious effects on their physical and psychological health, relationships and employment status. This research compared, PTSD, delayed onset PTSD, severity of combat exposure and depressive symptoms, quality of dyads, general health and quality of life. The analysis of specific demographic variables determined the means, standard deviations, and medians for those continuous variables for both groups from 1969-70 (n=394) and 2006-07 (n=97). The 2006-07 Experimental group (n=21) represents 17.65% and the Control group (n=76) represents 28.15% of the original groups selected and matched from 1969-70 data. These participants completed a battery of psychometric questionnaires and a follow up telephone interview. Demographic variables were evaluated for inclusion as covariates. These demographic variables were correlated with combat exposure and the presentation of PTSD in 1969-70 and 2006-07. PTSD identified in 2006-07 was modelled as a latent variable with three manifest indicators (re-experiencing, hyper-arousal and avoidance). Categorical variables were determined by frequency tables for respective group participants. Group differences in continuous variables were analysed by t-test or the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test accounting for non-normal distributions. Categorical variables, chi-square tests or Fisher's Exact Tests were performed when assumptions of chi-square tests were violated. Research participants from 1969-70 and 2006-07 did not indicate a significant difference in demographic, categorical or continuous variables. Initial 1969-70 battlefield psychiatric diagnosis TSD did indicate of a causal link to delayed onset PTSD in research participants in 2006-07. The PTSD (2006-07 diagnosis) indicated a descriptive difference, 64 of the 76 Control met the diagnostic criteria, while 19 of the 21 Experimental met the criteria. A significant difference was identified in the 2006-07 presence and severity of depression, two symptoms (intrusion and avoidance) of PTSD and the reported combat exposure. The prevalence of delayed onset PTSD was also highlighted. Obtaining original battlefield psychiatric diagnoses is rare. Comparison with an identifiable Control group after 35 years informs knowledge of how military personnel cope with battlefield exposure. Specifically concluding that; battlefield exposures during 1969-70 for the majority of the research participants have impacted detrimentally on their psychological and physical health, relationships, employment and ongoing overall wellbeing to this day. Delayed onset PTSD is the principal indicator of this current state for these veterans.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">battlefield trauma; exposure; PTSD; delayed onset PTSD</field><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Veterans Mental health Australia.</field><field name="subject">Vietnam War, 1961-1975 Psychological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of cell death in Parkinson&#8217;s disease using organotypic cell cultures.</field><field name="creator">Tran, Tuyet Thi Bach</field><field name="description">In this study we aimed to investigate the effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and rotenone neurotoxins on dopaminergic (DAergic) neuronal survival using ventral mesencephalic (VM) organotypic cell culture derived from postnatal rat pups (P4-5) and immunocytochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as a marker of DAergic cells. In addition, we examined the neuroprotective effects of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on TH-ir cells exposed to MPTP and rotenone as a possible treatment for PD. The TH-ir cells in co-cultures with striatum (ST) as a target grew better then when VM was cultured alone and that TH-ir cells in co-cultures could be maintained without using conditioned and trophic media. We treated 7 day and 14 day co-cultures at different times with varying MPTP and rotenone concentrations and found 14 day old cultures were more vulnerable than 7 day old co-cultures to the effects of either neurotoxin with TH-ir cell numbers significantly lower in 14 day cultures compared to 7 day cultures. Both neurotoxins induced a dose-dependent TH-ir cell reduction in the co-cultures. In addition we compared the toxicity of MPTP and its active metabolite 1-methyl-4- phenylpyridinium (MPP+) as the neurotoxic effects of MPTP on DAergic cells depends on its conversion to MPP+ by astrocytes. We found no significant difference in TH-ir cell reduction in co-cultures treated with MPTP and MPP+. Rotenone was more toxic than MPTP with less TH-ir cell survival in the weeks post treatment. GDNF exposure produced increased cell size and significant increases in TH-ir cell branching in cocultures in a dose-dependent manner. Post treatment of GDNF against MPTP and rotenone provided significant neuroprotection as TH-ir cell survival was at the lower neurotoxin doses and not at the higher doses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease; protenone; MPTP; organotypic cultures; dopamine neurons</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The family meeting as an instrument for the spiritual care of palliative patients and their families.</field><field name="creator">Tan, Heather Margaret</field><field name="description">Spiritual care is considered to be an important aspect of palliative care however; there has been much debate about the definition of spirituality. In this study a broad definition of spirituality has been utilized. Spiritual needs of palliative patients have been identified. Although evidence relating to bereavement outcomes supports the concept of working with family groups in the provision of holistic palliative care, only one family focused model of spiritual care was identified in the literature and no assessment of the efficacy of this model was found. The needs of staff in the provision of spiritual care have also been found to be important. The objectives of this study were to implement a family meeting model of care to assess it&#8217;s efficacy as an instrument for the provision of spiritual care from the perspective of palliative patients, family members and palliative care staff and to consider implications, if any for the inclusion of this model of care in the regular palliative care service. This qualitative study was informed by interpretivism and hermeneutic phenomenology. Ricoeur&#8217;s Theory of Interpretation was utilized in the interpretation of data. Participants were recruited through two metropolitan palliative care services. Twelve family meetings were facilitated by the researcher. Subsequently forty-seven patients and family members individually participated in in-depth interviews in which they described their experience of the family meeting and any outcomes they had observed. Fourteen staff members participated each in a semi-structured interview in which they described observed outcomes of the family meeting, their process of recruiting patient participants for the study and insights about the suitability of this intervention for regular palliative care services. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed utilizing Ricoeur&#8217;s Theory of Interpretation and with the assistance of qualitative data management software. The most commonly identified outcomes for patient and family member participants were: experience of increased openness of communication, positive and constructive feelings and emotions, gaining new understandings and strengthening or renewal of significant relationships. Their experience of the meeting facilitation was generally positive. These outcomes suggest that spiritual care was provided that had not been made available to these people in the current system. Staff reported positive outcomes for patient and family member participants and considered that this type of intervention would meet a need within the palliative care service. Barriers to implementation such as funding priorities, staff numbers and time were identified. This original study has added to our understanding of the value of working with family units in the provision of spiritual care in palliative care services. Further research such as the application of this intervention to larger and less homogenous populations, the evaluation of long term benefits to family members and ways of identifying families most in need of this intervention are needed. The inclusion of this intervention in regular palliative care service would have implications for staff training and support.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">family meeting; palliative care; spiritual care; families</field><field name="subject">Palliative treatment Sociological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Spiritual life.</field><field name="subject">Families.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A radical reconsideration of serialism and chord stranding, applied to a personal jazz style (CD recordings and exegesis)</field><field name="creator">Martin, Christopher Robert</field><field name="description">Despite a widely held view that serialism is incompatible with jazz improvisation, there are many instances of jazz musicians successfully engaging with this concept. This conflict seems likely to have arisen from differing interpretations of &#8216;serialism&#8217;; however, the question of how a jazz improviser&#8217;s approach to serialism might, or perhaps should, differ from a classical composer&#8217;s, has been left unasked. In addition, most attempts at the use of serialism within improvisation remain undocumented by the musicians concerned. The chord stranding techniques of Lutoslawski are less well known and less controversial than serialism. Connections between Lutoslawski&#8217;s twelve-note chords and traditional twelve-note rows are obvious, as are connections between the concept of harmonic &#8216;strands&#8217; and the jazz harmonic device of superimposition. The possibilities for use of Lutoslawski&#8217;s ideas within a jazz context are interesting and worthy of consideration. This research project involves the composition and performance of jazz pieces applying serialism and chord stranding, as well as the exploration of precedents for these ideas within the jazz tradition. The four CD recordings within this thesis present the initial development of these concepts (CDs 1 and 2); an exploration of serialism in the music of John Coltrane (CD 3); and an album of original material demonstrating the integrated application of these concepts (CD 4). The exegesis describes the broader context of this project and examines the relevant music theory concepts. It uses analysis of transcriptions to show the specific application of techniques. The key outcomes from this research are (i) the development and (ii) the demonstration of techniques for pitch organisation based on serialism and chord stranding that are appropriate for jazz improvisation. The recordings and exegesis show the successful integration of these techniques with existing melodic and harmonic ideas familiar to jazz musicians. It is argued that the approach to jazz improvisation explored within this research represents a novel and radical reinterpretation of the traditional concept of serialism and that this approach is helpful when considering the effective use of serialism in a jazz context. From a broader perspective, this research offers a case study of an improviser grappling with the challenges of synthesis and stylistic integrity and, as such, it has the potential to inform contemporary debates concerning tradition and innovation within jazz.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music; performance; jazz; serialism; chord stranding; Lutoslawski; composition; improvisation</field><field name="subject">Jazz.</field><field name="subject">Jazz 2001-2010</field><field name="subject">Improvisation (Music)</field><field name="subject">Serialism (Music)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49474</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A molecular genetic appraisal of biodiversity and conservation units in freshwater fishes from southern Australia.</field><field name="creator">Hammer, Michael</field><field name="description">The freshwater fish fauna of southern Australia is characterised by low species richness and high endemism in groups displaying southern temperate, temperate-subtropical or temperate-tropical distributions. Comparatively few studies in Australia have incorporated modern molecular techniques to delineate species boundaries and define within-species conservation units. This is problematic because freshwater fishes are likely to show high levels of cryptic speciation and marked spatial sub-structure, and is information which is needed to conserve biological diversity and maintain the integrity of ecological communities and processes. The current study uses a &#8216;combined evidence&#8217; approach, led principally by a set of nuclear genetic markers (allozymes), to assess species boundaries, spatial sub-structure and conservation units in obligate freshwater fishes from southern Australia. A literature review (Chapter 2) concerns the nature and effects of fragmentation in freshwater environments. It considers the implications for freshwater fishes and the types of extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics, both natural and human accelerated, that might drive population fragmentation and divergence. This theoretical framework is then applied to a suite of six largely co-occurring species groups with contrasting biological characteristics, and derive hypotheses about expected levels of genetic divergence across and within different drainages. Major findings Species of Retropinna (Chapter 3) are widespread and generally regarded as &#8216;common&#8217; and mobile. Allozyme analyses revealed species-level and population-level sub-divisions, including five distinct species with contiguous ranges and no evidence of genetic exchange. Three occur along the eastern seaboard (including three instances of sympatry), another in coastal and inland southeastern Australia and Tasmania, and a fifth in the Lake Eyre Basin. There is no indication of a simple &#8216;tasmanica&#8217; versus &#8216;semoni&#8217; dichotomy, but instead a complex pattern involving discrete clusters for the Upper Murray plus Darling rivers, Lower Murray, Glenelg River and Tasmanian regions. These findings have implications for biodiversity, conservation and ecology. This chapter has been published in modified form (Marine and Freshwater Research 58, 327- 341). Nannoperca obscura (Chapter 4) is a small demersal fish with specialised habitat requirements. It is under threat of extinction, particularly in the western section of its range. Combined nuclear and matrilineal genetic data identified congruent within-species sub-structure, divided by patternsof distribution and biogeography. Four monophyletic mtDNA lineages, each distinct at multiple nuclear loci, indicate four Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs), namely (1) Lake Alexandrina in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), (2) Glenelg River, Millicent Coast River Basin and the outlying Mt Emu Creek, (3) Merri River and associated coastal streams, and (4) the eastern range section. Additional genetic and ecological data support multiple Management Units (MUs) within ESUs for individual or groups of river basins separated by marine barriers. Nannoperca australis (Chapter 5) has a similar character to its aforementioned congener, except that it occurs across a much wider area. Although generally common, particular populations are threatened, especially in the MDB. Allozyme analyses of 57 populations confirm the presence of two divergent species, with an eastern species containing two ESUs: (1) Gippsland and Flinders Island, and (2) Ansons River in northeastern Tasmania. The western species shows sub-structure across its range, including a separation of MDB and coastal populations as two heterogenous ESUs. The Lower Murray region (Mount Lofty Range streams and the Lower Lakes) harbours a remarkable level of between- and within-population diversity, underscoring its importance for conserving evolutionary potential. Mogurnda adspersa (Chapter 6) has been presumed extinct in South Australia since the early 1970s and has also been assumed lost from the southern MDB. This chapter reports on the rediscovery of M. adspersa from a wetland near the terminus of the Lower Murray, some 2500 river kilometres from the nearest known population. The nature and basic ecology of this population is documented, but the combined effects of drought and water abstraction recently have led to the probable extirpation of the wild population. A combined allozyme and mtDNA dataset confirmed the &#8216;nativeness&#8217; of the population as a distinct sub-population (and MU), with a moderate level of allele heterogeneity. This information provides a platform for captive breeding as a conservation measure. The endemic genus Philypnodon (Chapter 7) contains two nominal species: P. grandiceps and the long recognised but only recently described P. macrostomus. The former is considered widespread and common (near ubiquitous), whereas the latter is more patchily distributed. Some tolerance to marine conditions is indicated, suggesting that there may be less sub-structure, but allozyme analyses of 269 individuals indicate the presence of multiple, species-level taxa within both described species. This obscures interpretations of existing ecological data. Although the presence of genetically-similar populations within and across some drainage divides indicates higher levels of gene flow, the pattern is complex and suggests historic genetic exchange between some but not other geographically-adjacent taxa. The freshwater blackfish genus Gadopsis (Chapter 8) has been a problem group for taxonomists, and it is unclear where the group is placed phylogenetically and how many species occur. Northern and southern forms on respective sides of the Great Dividing Range have been proposed, but with limited supporting evidence. Its dispersal ability (hence predicted genetic structure) is obscured by opposing life-history traits, including large body size (i.e. good swimming ability) versus habitat specialisation, demersal larvae and restricted home ranges. This chapter provides a genetic overview incorporating 61 locations across the range, and demonstrates unequivocally the presence of distinct northern and southern species of G. &#8216;marmoratus&#8217;. Moreover, distinct genetic discontinuities involving geographically abutting lineages indicate the likely presence of multiple ESUs within each species. A comparison of the allozyme data with previous mtDNA studies also identified two ESUs within G. bispinosus. Overall, considerable complexity is demonstrated signalling the need for a review of how the southern Australian fish fauna should be viewed, studied and protected. The genetic data also provide insight into the interplay of intrinsic biological characters (e.g. dispersal ability, population ecology) with historic and contemporary extrinsic environmental factors (e.g. fragmentation, biogeographic processes). Comparisons between and within traditionally-defined species are problematic, however, owing to multiple species-level splits and other genetic divisions that may have matching biological counterparts. Together with other reports in the literature, the findings presented herein have significant conservation implications, particularly given the rapid pace of human-mediated change in some regions that house high species and genetic diversity and unique evolutionary components, notably southeastern Queensland (especially the Mary River) and the lower River Murray in South Australia. Other regions displaying high genetic substructure or divergent populations include the Clarence River and Lachlan River in New South Wales; Gippsland, Goulburn River, Glenelg River and Mt Emu Creek in Victoria, and the Macquarie River and Ansons River in Tasmania.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecular systematic; Conservation genetic; Freshwater fish; Southern Australia; Biodiversity; Species boundary; Evolutionary significant unit; Management unit; Retropinna; Nannoperca; Mogurnda; Philypnodon; Gadopsis</field><field name="subject">Freshwater fishes Australia, Southern.

Various other hepadnaviruses are used as models to study human HBV infections as all Hepadnaviridae family members have similar virus structure and replication strategies. The studies performed and described in this thesis were carried out using duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection of Pekin ducks as a model system. Hepadnavirus infections can have either an acute or a chronic outcome. The factors that contribute to these outcomes include the immune response, the age of the host at the time of infection as well as size of viral inoculum. The overall aim of this project was to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in clearance of virus and resolution of acute DHBV infections. As a first step, molecular and immunohistochemical detection methods for a range of cellular markers in ducks had to be developed as assays were not readily available. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays (qRT-PCR) were developed for the detection of mRNA of the duck T-lymphocyte markers, CD3, CD4, CD8, duck cytokines, IFN-&#945;, IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945; and the duck housekeeping genes, &#946;-actin and GAPDH. Immunohistochemistry was developed for the detection of duck CD4 + and CD8 + on T cells and for the detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as a marker of cell proliferation. These methods were then widely used throughout the project. The innate immune response during HBV infections is not well understood. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a family of pattern recognition receptors that form part of the innate immune response and are involved in the recognition of bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens. The only TLR that have been reported to recognise viral pathogens are TLR- 2, TLR-3, TLR-4, TLR-7 and TLR-9. The possible role of TLR during hepadnavirus infections had not been well characterized to date. In this project cDNA sequences for duck TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-7 were identified and characterised and qRT-PCR assays were developed for their detection. Changes in duck TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-7 mRNA expression during hepadnavirus infection were identified following DHBV infection of primary duck hepatocytes (PDH) in vitro. The results showed increased levels of expression of duck TLR early during infection indicating an involvement of TLR and the innate immune response during DHBV infection. During the in vivo DHBV infection studies performed to date TLR mRNA expression remained unchanged. As previously mentioned hepadnavirus infection can have an acute or chronic outcome. We aimed to understand the mechanisms involved during the resolution of acute DHBV infection and to elucidate specific factors contributing to the successful resolution of infection. During acute infections immune markers were monitored by qRT-PCR and histological analysis of fixed liver sections was performed. Liver sections were analysed to detect liver inflammation, the number and size of Kupffer cells, hepatocyte apoptosis and changes in hepatocyte proliferation throughout the course of acute DHBV infection in 6-week-old ducks. By determining the percentage of DHBV-positive hepatocytes two patterns of clearance of acute DHBV infection were observed; early clearance of infected hepatocytes occurring before day 14 post infection (p.i.), and late clearance occurring after day 14, but before or on day 31 p.i. This viral clearance was seen to occur in a cell by cell pattern. Higher levels of hepatocyte proliferation and apoptotic hepatocytes were detected during the clearance phase (on day 14 p.i.) of the late clearance group. Periodic acid schiff-diastase (PAS-D) staining was used to show significant increases in both cell number and size of Kupffer cells. Levels of IFN-&#947; mRNA increased significantly over the uninfected age-matched control ducks on day 14 p.i. Levels of CD3, CD4 and CD8 mRNA expression also increased over the uninfected controls on days 14 and 31 p.i. In summary, we found that resolution of acute DHBV infection occurred on a cell by cell pattern of clearance, it was accompanied by increases in hepatocyte proliferation, apoptotic hepatocytes and activated Kupffer cells, indicating that T lymphocytes and cell death play important roles in the rapid clearance of DHBV infection. Following resolution of acute hepadnaviral infections residual viral DNA has been found to persist. Residual HBV DNA in humans can result in reactivation of HBV infection following liver transplantation or immunosuppressive drug treatment. This leads to possible pathogenic outcomes thus the need for further investigations. Previous studies performed in the duck model have shown that the major form of residual DNA is present as covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). We aimed to understand how this residual cccDNA was being maintained and if replication was involved in the process. Following resolution of infection in ducks, levels of residual DHBV DNA were monitored by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Ducks were treated with the Bristol-Myers Squibb nucleoside analogue Entecavir (ETV) in order to suppress any possible replication that might be maintaining levels of residual cccDNA. In DHBV-infected but non-ETV treated ducks, the levels of residual DHBV DNA decreased gradually when measured on days 60, 221 and 316 p.i. The observed decrease in residual DHBV DNA occurred in parallel with decreases in the rate of hepatocyte proliferation measured by PCNA staining. This finding suggests that levels of residual DHBV DNA and hepatocyte proliferation are linked and we hypothesise that hepatocyte turnover is involved in the clearance of residual DHBV DNA. ETV treatment did not have an effect on the levels of residual DHBV DNA which suggests that it is present in a subset of long-lived hepatocytes that do not support virus replication. Mathematical modelling was performed to predict the rate of hepatocyte proliferation required for the elimination of residual cccDNA. The mathematical modelling showed that the predicted rate of hepatocyte proliferation was consistent with the rate of hepatocyte proliferation measured by PCNA. Further mathematical modelling showed that residual cccDNA is most likely to survive mitosis and it decreases due to several rounds of hepatocyte proliferation required for its elimination. Altogether, this project has elucidated mechanisms involved during the resolution of acute DHBV infection and also possible mechanisms by which residual DHBV DNA is maintained following resolution of infection. Detailed understanding of the virological and immunological events that occur during the resolution of an acute hepadnavirus infection would assist in the development of new therapeutic treatments for the cure of chronic HBV infections.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virology; Immunology; Animal model; Hepatitis B virus; Residual infection; Duck hepatitis B virus; Acute infection</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus.

Approximately 85 % of Australia&#8217;s population of New Zealand fur seals reside in the state of South Australia. As a result of their abundance and size, it has been estimated that the New Zealand fur seal population in South Australia consumes the greatest biomass of resources of all marine mammal and seabird species. However, despite the importance of New Zealand fur seals as top predators, our understanding of their foraging ecology in South Australia is limited. In order to better understand the habitat utilized and the diet of New Zealand fur seals, this study explores the foraging ecology of lactating seals from four primary colonies in South Australia, which account for ~ 78 % of the Australian population. These colonies are Cape Gantheaume (36&#1086;04&#8217;S, 137&#1086;27&#8217;E) and Cape du Couedic (36&#1086;03&#8217;S, 136&#1086;42&#8217;E) on Kangaroo Island; North Neptune Island (35&#1086;13&#8217;S, 136&#1086;03&#8217;E) and Liguanea Island (34&#1086;59&#8217;S, 135&#1086;37&#8217;E). I start this study by assessing the seasonal variation in foraging location and dive behaviour of lactating New Zealand fur seals from Cape Gantheaume. 18 seals were fitted with satellite transmitters and time depth recorders (TDRs). The presence of thermoclines (derived from TDRs), were used as a surrogate measure of upwelling activity in continental shelf habitats. During the austral autumn 80 % of lactating fur seals foraged on the continental shelf (114 &#177; 44 km from the colony), in a region associated with a seasonal coastal upwelling system, the Bonney upwelling. In contrast, during winter months seals predominantly foraged in oceanic waters (62 %), in a region associated with the Subtropical Front (460 &#177; 138 km from the colony). Results suggested that lactating New Zealand fur seals shift their foraging location from continental shelf to oceanic habitats, in response to a seasonal decline in continental shelf productivity, attributed to the cessation of the Bonney upwelling in autumn. To study inter-colony differences in foraging locations, 21 New Zealand fur seals were satellite tracked from four colonies within close proximity (46 km &#8211; 200km apart). Seals initiated foraging trips on a colony-specific bearing (Cape Gantheaume 141 &#177; 33&#186;, Cape du Couedic 186 &#177; 12&#186;, North Neptune Island 200 &#177; 23&#186; and Liguanea Island 234 &#177; 69&#186;), and recorded little overlap between colony-specific foraging areas. The distribution of colony-specific foraging grounds appeared to be influenced by the proximity of colonies to predictable local upwelling features, as well as a distant oceanic frontal zone, the Subtropical Front. Foraging site fidelity and route-choice was further assessed by comparing site fidelity between continental shelf and oceanic habitats. Data from 31 lactating females, satellite tracked over 107 consecutive foraging trips indicated that females foraging on the continental shelf recorded a significantly greater overlap in foraging area between consecutive foraging routes, when compared to females that foraged in oceanic waters (55.9 &#177; 20.4 % and 13.4 &#177; 7.6 %, respectively). Findings suggest that seals learn the direction of travel to a predictable foraging region, and initiate a foraging trip on that bearing. However, actual foraging routes are likely to be influenced by a number of factors including previous foraging trip experience and prey encounter rate, which is related to prey density and the spatial scale of the patch exploited. The final chapter integrates scat analysis with milk fatty acid (FA) analysis to investigate dietary differences between continental shelf and oceanic waters. Milk FA composition was determined for 29 satellite-tracked fur seals, that were known to forage in either shelf or oceanic habitats. Based on FA compositions, I predicted the likelihood that milk samples collected at random (n = 131) represented individual seals having foraged either on the continental shelf or in distant oceanic waters. FA analysis and satellite tracking results contrasted with scat analyses, from which only 6 % of scats by frequency of occurrence contained prey remains from oceanic waters. The results suggest that scats were biased toward females foraging on the continental shelf. This study highlights the importance of two predictable ocean features utilised by New Zealand fur seals; (1) a nearby and seasonally predictable coastal upwelling system, the Bonney upwelling and; (2) a distant but permanent oceanic front, the Subtropical Front.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand fur seal; Colony specific foraging; Foraging site fidelity; Subtropical front; Bonney upwelling; Seasonal foraging; Fatty acid analysis</field><field name="subject">New Zealand fur seal Ecology South Australia.</field><field name="subject">New Zealand fur seal Geographical distribution.</field><field name="subject">Seal populations Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New challenges for lucerne in southern Australian farming systems : identifying and breeding diverse lucerne germplasm to match these requirements.</field><field name="creator">Humphries, Alan Wayne</field><field name="description">Lucerne is a deep-rooted perennial pasture that is promoted to land managers in southern Australia to mitigate the effects of dryland salinity, a problem of national significance caused by the replacement of native trees and shrubs with annual crops and pastures. In recent years, the acceptance of climate change has provided further rationale for increasing the use of perennial legumes in our farming systems. Perennial legumes have a role in offsetting C02 emissions by sequestering C and N in soil, and provide new, resilient options for future farming in a warmer and more variable climate. This research has focused on evaluating the diverse range of germplasm found in lucerne (Medicago sativa spp.) for a range of attributes in order to determine its compatibility with existing and future farming systems in southern Australia. Regional field evaluation at 8 sites in southern Australia showed that lucerne is a broadly adapted and robust plant. After 3 years, plant density ranged from 2-55 plants / m2 with differences in persistence attributed to tolerance to a combination of stresses including soil acidity, saline and sodic subsoils, drought conditions and persistent heavy grazing. Highly winter-active lucerne (class 9-10) was confirmed to be the most suitable group for short phase rotations in southern Australia, providing grazing is well managed. This germplasm was less persistent than other winter activity groups, but produces more total herbage yield in environments with winter dominant rainfall patterns. Highly winter-active lucerne has poor persistence under continuous grazing, but this may aid in its removal when used in rotation with crops. Winteractive germplasm (class 6-8) was more grazing tolerant and persistent, making it the most suitable group for longer phase rotations (&gt;4 years), or where more flexible grazing management practices are required (i.e. 35 days grazing followed by 35 days recovery). Individual grazing tolerant plants from this group were selected and randomly inter-mated to form new breeder&#8217;s lines in the development of a grazing tolerant cultivar. For the first time, the high water-use of a farming system involving wheat overcropped into lucerne is presented. Lucerne over-cropped with wheat used an additional 43-88 mm of water in comparison to continuous wheat at Roseworthy and Katanning respectively. Over-cropping reduced wheat yield by 13-63%, but it can be more efficient in terms of land area to grow lucerne and wheat as a mixture than on separate parcels of land. Very winter-dormant lucerne (class 1-2) appears to be less competitive with winter cereal crops during wheat establishment. It may also be possible to reduce lucerne&#8217;s competition with wheat at the critical stage of anthesis, with low spring yielding lucerne varieties identified in this research (SA37908). This group of plants provides excellent potential for the development of high water-use farming systems because they are grazing tolerant and persistent, and have summer forage production and sub-soil water extraction rates that are equivalent to winter active lucerne. The research has been used to identify the perfect ideotype for lucerne in phase farming and over-cropping systems, which can be used to set targets in future breeding programs. The research also highlights current opportunities for the integration of lucerne into southern Australian farming systems to help curb the spread of dryland salinity and reduce the impact of climate change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alfalfa; Salinity; Medicago sativa</field><field name="subject">Alfalfa Australia.

Progressive changes of phenolic compounds, initially extracted from grapes, occur during the storage and aging of red wines. The decrease of astringency occurring during wine aging has been considered as a result of mainly anthocyanin-flavanol condensation either directly or mediated by aldehydes. The contribution of these polymeric pigments formed during wine aging to the unique properties of red wine is an important question still unanswered. Experiments were conducted to synthesise polymeric pigments in model wine solutions under different conditions in the absence of acetaldehyde to provide material for chemical and sensory studies. Only small amounts of polymeric pigments were formed in these experiments confirming that direct polymerisation is a slow process. The low yield of polymers made it necessary to investigate the isolation of polymeric pigments directly from wine. A preparative fractionation protocol was developed to obtain fractions enriched in different red wine pigment combinations for further investigation. A HPLC method was also developed that separated the pigmented and non-pigmented polymers, as well as the monomeric anthocyanins, flavanols (monomeric to trimeric), flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids from each other. A 6 month old and a 5 year old Shiraz wine were fractionated and further analysed by acid hydrolysis in the presence of a nucleophile, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and by different mass spectrometry techniques. The various fractions isolated from the 6 month old wine contained combinations of pentameric to dimeric pigments, while those from the 5 year old wine contained pigments with an average degree of polymerisation (DP) of at least 11 but possibly up to 32. Experiments were conducted to determine the sensorial contribution of anthocyanins to wine as well as the effect of anthocyanin-flavanol polymerisation reactions taking place during maturation. It was shown that significant changes occur in the polymeric phenol composition and in the mean degree of polymerisation of Shiraz wine during aging. With aging more skin tannin were incorporated in the pigmented polymers and the percentage of galloylation in these polymers decreased. In order to describe the sensory attributes of the polymeric pigments a refined vocabulary, describing the astringent and other mouth-feel sensations elicited by dry red table wines representing different styles was developed and called the mouth-feel wheel. The developed mouth-feel wheel was used in a study to investigate the contribution of anthocyanins and anthocyanin-proanthocyanidin reaction products to the mouth-feel properties of red wine. Wines were made from both red and white grapes with and without pomace contact, as well as with and without anthocyanin addition to the white grapes. The white wine made like a red wine did not exhibit the same mouth-feel sensory attributes of a red wine: it was lower in viscosity, less particulate in nature and lower in intensity for the astringency descriptors fine emery, dry and grippy. The presence of anthocyanins during fermentation appeared to increase the intensity of astringency related terms. Treatments with added anthocyanins increased the amount of polymeric phenols to twice that when compared to treatments without added anthocyanins.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Red wine pigment; Mouth feel; Tannin; Polymeric pigment</field><field name="subject">Wine Color.

An example of such a regularization is the Atiyah&#8211;Witten regularization of the T-equivariant Euler class of the normal bundle v(TM) of M in the free loop space LM [2]. In this thesis, we propose a new regularization procedure &#8212; W-regularization &#8212; which can be shown to reduce to the Atiyah&#8211;Witten regularization when applied to the case of v(TM). This new regularization yields a new multiplicative genus (in the sense of Hirzebruch [26]) &#8212; the ^&#915;-genus &#8212; when applied to the more general case of a complex spin vector bundle of complex rank &#8805; 2 over M, as opposed to the case of the complexification of TM for the Atiyah&#8211;Witten regularization. Some of its properties are investigated and some tantalizing connections to other areas of mathematics are also discussed. We also consider the application of W-regularization to the regularization of T&#178;- equivariant Euler classes associated to the case of the double free loop space LLM. We find that the theory of zeta-regularized products, as set out by Jorgenson&#8211;Lang [35], Quine et al [53] and Voros [59], amongst others, provides a good framework for comparing the regularizations that have been considered so far. In particular, it reveals relations between some of the genera that appeared in elliptic cohomology, allowing us to clarify and prove an assertion of Liu [44] on the &#710;&#920;-genus, as well as to recover the Witten genus.

In the lamb, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) results in a low birth weight and an increased visceral fat mass by 45d of postnatal life. In this thesis I have investigated the effect of IUGR on adipose tissue development and function during fetal and early postnatal life in the sheep. IUGR was induced by removal of the majority of endometrial caruncles in non pregnant ewes prior to mating which resulted in the subsequent placental restriction of fetal growth (PR). Fetal blood samples were collected from 116d gestation and visceral perirenal adipose tissue (PAT) collected from PR and control fetuses at 145d. In lambs IUGR was defined as a birth weight less than 2 standard deviations below the mean of a cohort of singleton Merino lambs. Blood samples were collected throughout the first 3 weeks of life and PAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was collected at 21 d. It was determined whether IUGR alters the expression of genes which regulate adipogenesis (IGF1, IGFR1, IGF2, IGFR2, PPARy, and RXR&#945;), adipocyte metabolism (LPL, G3PDH, GAPDH) and adipokine signalling (leptin, adiponectin) in adipose tissue depots before and after birth using qRT-PCR. PR fetuses were hypoglycaemic, hypoinsulinaemic, hypoxic, and had a lower body weight than Control fetuses. The expression of both IGF1 and leptin mRNA in PAT, the major fetal adipose depot, was lower in the PR fetuses, although there was no difference in the expression of other adipokine or adipogenic genes in PAT between PR and control fetuses. Thus restriction of placental and hence fetal substrate supply results in decreased IGF1 and leptin expression in fetal visceral adipose tissue which may alter the functional development of the perirenal fat depot and contribute to altered leptin signalling in the growth restricted newborn and the subsequent emergence of an increased visceral adiposity. At 21d of postnatal life there was no increase in the relative mass of perirenal or subcutaneous fat in IUGR lambs compared with controls. Thus, this study has investigated the effect of IUGR on the development of adipose tissue prior to the development of an obese phenotype. At 21d of life there was a sex specific effect of IUGR on the expression of PPARy and leptin mRNA in perirenal visceral fat such that PPARy and leptin mRNA expression was decreased in male IUGR lambs, but not females. Interestingly PAT mass was greater in females than males, independent of birth weight. Plasma insulin concentrations during the first 24h after birth predicted the size of the adipocytes and expression of adiponectin in visceral adipose tissue in both males and females at 21d. Thus, the nutritional environment before, and immediately after birth, may program adipocyte growth and gene expression in visceral adipose tissue. The differential effect of sex and birth weight on PPARy and leptin expression in visceral fat may be important in the subsequent development of visceral obesity and the insulin resistant phenotype in later life. At 21d of life there was no difference between Control and IUGR lambs in the relative mass of subcutaneous fat, or the expression of PPARy, RXR&#945;, leptin, adiponectin, LPL, G3PDH, and GAPDH in subcutaneous fat at 21d of life. We have shown that the growth of the subcutaneous fat depot is related to plasma glucose, insulin and leptin concentrations, and to the development of perirenal fat. Thus, in contrast to perirenal adipose tissue, the postnatal, but not the fetal nutritional environment, programs subcutaneous adipocyte growth and gene expression. This thesis speculates that there may be a factor secreted from visceral fat that influences the development of the subcutaneous fat depot. At 21d of life there was also an effect of sex, but not IUGR, on the expression of IGF mRNA in adipose tissue. Male lambs had a higher expression of IGF1 mRNA in both PAT and SAT, and a higher expression of IGF1R and IGF2R in SAT compared with female lambs. It is likely that these differences in IGF mRNA levels reflect sexual dimorphism of the GH-IGF axis. When male and female lambs were combined there was a higher expression of IGF1 mRNA in SAT compared with PAT, and a higher expression of IGF2, IGF1R and IGF2R mRNA in PAT compared with SAT. These differences in IGF mRNA expression provide a potential mechanism to explain the sex and depot specific variations in mitogenic potency of IGF1 and proliferative capacities of preadipocytes, the regional variation in adipocyte metabolism, and the difference in incidence of visceral obesity between men and women in adult life.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low birth weight; IVGR; obesity; insulin resistance; neonate; fetus</field><field name="subject">Adipose tissues.

Yet with the emergence of a change in resource values, the rangelands of Australia have started to move away from a strict production land-use towards a multifunctional land-use where pastoralism, tourism and the environment have an influence on one another. With the present mixture of consumption and protection values in the rangelands, ecotourism represents a model for achieving a symbiotic relationship between tourism activity and conservation in a pastoral setting. This study develops a theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between ecotourism, pastoralism and ecological recovery efforts in the Flinders Ranges through employing mixed qualitative and quantitative research techniques to examine the perceptions and practices of tourism operators, local landholders and visitors to the study site. The study finds that while pastoralism and its level of success often remain variable, the strength and stability of tourism is increasing. Because economics is a central component of the concept of sustainability, and because we must manage the environment while accommodating tourists, ecotourism is one way to help reach rangeland sustainability goals, provided that there are adequate levels of agreement amongst the local community and other land users. The results indicate that the vast majority of stakeholders are currently in a state of co-existence with each other rather than one of conflict, suggesting ecotourism has the potential to assist ecological recovery. However, many landholders are constrained in their ability to integrate ecotourism operations and conservation due to economic difficulties and market barriers. There are also conflicting results among visitors who claim to be interested in ecotourism but do not necessarily act accordingly, highlighting the need for a greater focus on environmental education. Ecotourism should be incorporated into a regional sustainability plan where the public are able to assist decision makers through collaborative planning. The thesis concludes that when well-managed, ecotourism can be a business supporting conservation in the Flinders Ranges. It contributes to knowledge of the role that ecotourism can play in encouraging ecological recovery in the rangelands and explores the complex interrelationships involved through consultation with the primary stakeholders of landholders, tourism operators and visitors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecotourism; pastoralism; Flinders Ranges; sustainable land-use; rangelands</field><field name="subject">Ecotourism Environmental aspects Flinders Ranges Region (S.

Often there exist circumstances where there is no clear optimal path to choose, and instead the decision maker must predict future need and allocate accordingly. The application of resource allocation can be seen in many organizations, from military, to high end commercial and political, and even individuals living their daily life. We define resource allocation as follows: the allocation of owner&#8217;s assets to further the particular cause of the owner. We propose two ways that computers can assist with the task of resource allocation. Firstly they can provide decision support mechanisms, with alternate strategies for the allocations that might not have been previously considered. Secondly, they can provide training mechanisms to challenge human decision makers in learning better resource allocation strategies. In this research we focus on the latter, and provide the following general hypothesis: Coevolutionary algorithms are an effective mechanism for the creation of a computer player for strategic decision-making games. To address this hypothesis, we present a system that uses coevolution to learn new strategies for the resource allocation game of TEMPO. The game of TEMPO provides a perfect test bed for this research, as it abstracts real-world military resource allocation, and was developed for training Department of Defence personnel. The environment created allows players to practice their strategic decision-making skills, providing an opportunity to analyse and improve their technique. To be truly effective in this task, the computer player the human plays against must be continuously challenging, so the human can steadily improve. In our research the computer player is represented as a fuzzy logic rule base, which allows us investigation into the strategies being created. This provides insight into the ways the coevolution addresses strategic decision-making. Importantly, TEMPO also gives us an abstraction of another component of strategic decision-making that is not directly available in other games &#8211; that of intelligence (INTEL) and counter intelligence (CI). When resource allocation is occurring in a competitive circumstance, it is often beneficial to gain insight into what your opponent is doing through intelligence. In turn, an opponent may seek to halt or skew the information being gained. The use of INTEL and CI in TEMPO allows research into the effects this has on the resource allocation process and the coevolved computer player. The development of a computer player for the game of TEMPO gives us endless possibilities of research. In this research, we have focused on the creation a computer player that can provide a fun and challenging environment for humans learning resource allocation strategies. We investigate the addition of memory to a coevolutionary algorithm for strategy creation. This includes mechanisms to select memory individuals for evaluation of coevolutionary individuals. We describe a successful strategy of selection, based on the way a human&#8217;s short and long term memory works. We then investigate the use of INTEL and CI in the game of TEMPO, and the way it is used by the coevolved computer players. Through this work, we present a new version of the TEMPO game that more realistically represents INTEL and CI. Finally, we describe a process that uses coevolution to adapt to a human player real-time, to create a tailored game-play experience. This process was tested in a user study, and showed a distinct advantage through the adaptive mechanism. Overall, we have made some important discoveries, and described some limitations that leave future research open. Ultimately, we have shown that our hypothesis is an achievable goal, with an exciting future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coevolution; resource allocation; memory; strategic intelligence; adaptation; TEMPO</field><field name="subject">General Electric Company. -- Technical Military Planning Operation.</field><field name="subject">Decision making -- Computer programs.</field><field name="subject">Decision making -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tertiary fossil waterfowl (Aves: anseriformes) of Australia and New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Worthy, Trevor Henry</field><field name="description">Anseriformes, or waterfowl, are related to Galliformes (chickens and kin), together forming the most basal sister of Neoaves. The order is generally considered to comprise four families: Presbyornithidae (Late Cretaceous - Eocene); Anseranatidae (Paleocene-present); Anhimidae (Oligocene-present); Anatidae (Oligocene-present), but the giant Tertiary flightless taxa Dromornithidae (Australia), Gastornithidae (Eurasia) and Diatrymidae (North America) have also been referred to the order. Australasia presently has a unique waterfowl fauna characterized by low species diversity but high phylogenetic diversity: the Magpie Goose Anseranas (the sole surviving anseranatid), several monotypic endemic anatid genera of uncertain relationships (Cape Barren Goose Cereopsis, Freckled Duck Stictonetta, Pinkeared Duck Malacorhynchus and Musk Duck Biziura), several relatively primitive taxa (the aforementioned plus whistling ducks Dendrocygna and Blue-billed Duck Oxyura). The evolutionary history of this fauna has, until now, not been examined via the fossil record. In this thesis, the literature for the global fossil record of Anseranatidae and Anatidae is reviewed. The Neogene (Oligocene-Pliocene) fossil record of Anseriformes, exclusive of dromornithids, is studied from both New Zealand and Australia. For New Zealand, all materials derive from the St Bathans Fauna, Early Miocene (19-16 Ma), Otago. Herein, the first description of this fauna is provided, with four anatid genera (Manuherikia, Dunstanetta, Matanas and Miotadorna) established for five species, with a sixth taxon reported (Chapter 2). The phylogenetic affinities of Manuherikia, Dunstanetta and Miotadorna are examined using parsimony analysis of morphological data (133 characters) in Chapter 3. Miotadorna is a shelduck related to tadornines, perhaps sister to Tadorna, and Manuherikia and Dunstanetta are oxyurines related to the Stictonetta, Malacorhynchus, Oxyura and Biziura). A further species of Manuherikia and the existence of definite anserines, probably related to Cereopsis, are described in Chapter 4. The fossil record of Australian anseriforms is described in Chapters 5-8. The Oligo- Miocene record derives principally from the Etadunna and Namba Formations (26-24 Ma) in the Lake Eyre and Frome Basins, respectively, in South Australia. Four taxa are described, with all occurring both in the Namba and Etadunna Formations: a single genus, Pinpanetta, is established for three species and another, Australotadorna, for a tadornine. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony and Bayesian) of a dataset (150 characters, 61 taxa) show Pinpanetta is an oxyurine and confirm the previously found oxyurine affinity of Manuherikia and Dunstanetta. A monophyletic clade with moderate support is found for an expanded Oxyurinae that has Stictonetta basal, followed successively by Mionetta (Oligo- Miocene of Europe), Malacorhynchus, Pinpanetta, Manuherikia, Dunstanetta, Oxyura and Nomonyx, Biziura and Thalassornis. This same analysis finds anserines the most basal group in Anatidae, so changing position with Dendrocygna, considered by recent authors to be the most basal anatid. A new genus and species of anseranatid is described from a Faunal Zone A (System A, Late Oligocene) deposit at Riversleigh, northwestern Queensland (Chapter 6). This first pre-Pliocene record of the family in Australia is of equivalent age to the youngest European fossil anseranatid, Anserpica from France, but younger than the Eocene Anatalavis of England. Only one of three other waterfowl bones known from Riversleigh deposits is identifiable and is referred to a species of Pinpanetta found in the Etadunna Formation. Mid-Late Miocene deposits containing waterfowl are restricted in Australia to just the Waite Formation (c. 8 Ma) at Alcoota in the Northern Territory. Three bones indicate an undetermined tadornine and an undetermined anatid, different from any known species. The Pliocene record of anseriforms in South Australia is described from the Tirari Formation (Kanunka and Toolapinna Faunas) (Chapter 7). Nine modern species (Anseranas semipalmata, Cereopsis novaehollandiae, Cygnus atratus, Tadorna tadornoides, Biziura lobata, Oxyura australis, Anas cf A. castanea, A. cf A. gracilis and Aythya australis) are represented. A single extinct species, Tirarinetta kanunka, is described and referred to Oxyurinae. From the Parilla Sands, Late Pliocene, at Bookmark Cliffs on the Murray River, a single humerus is described (Chapter 8) and referred to Tadorna cf. T. tadornoides. A total of 11 anatid taxa is described from latest Oligocene-Early Miocene deposits in Australasia, which considerably adds to the global record of seven species previously reported for this period. Considering also the anseranatids, the Late Oligocene &#8211; Early Miocene fauna of Australia is thus established as having equivalent diversity to that from similar-aged deposits in Europe, but by the late Early Miocene, the New Zealand fauna was more diverse than any other Oligo-Miocene fauna known. The more limited samples available, compared to those from New Zealand, probably explain the lack of a similar diversity being revealed for Australia from this period. In both Australia and New Zealand, the Oligo-Miocene faunas are dominated by oxyurine taxa, as were those in Europe. The presence of a tadornine in Australia in the latest Oligocene and another in New Zealand in the Early Miocene precede the appearance of this subfamily in the Northern Hemisphere by 10 Ma, implying a southern origin for this group. The Late Oligocene presence of Mionetta in Europe and of Pinpanetta in Australia, and their referral to Oxyurinae, establishes a minimum age for the origin of this subfamily in the latest Oligocene. The establishment of a fauna comprised of modern species by the Pliocene indicates substantial faunal turnover probably in the Late Miocene. This turnover is due in part to immigration of taxa (Cygnus, Anas, Aythya) and in situ evolution (all endemic genera), as occurred in other Australian vertebrates (rodents, snakes, bats). Thus faunal composition in Australia appears to have been more affected by attainment of some threshold in proximity to Asia being breached by the northward continental drift of Australia, than by aridification, which has been ongoing since the Middle Miocene.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anatidae; Fossil; Phylogenetic relationship; Tertiary; New Zealand; Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management and nutrition of the replacement gilt.</field><field name="creator">Van Wettere, William</field><field name="description">Replacement gilts and early parity sows constitute a large, and increasing, proportion of modern breeding herds. Breeding herd profitability is therefore increasingly dependant on the efficiency of gilt management strategies as well as litter size at first farrowing; however, incidences of reproductive failures and small first litter sizes are common within cohorts of replacement gilts. Hence, this thesis had two primary aims which were addressed in four experiments; one, to identify whether the puberty stimulation and mating strategies developed for genotypes of 20 to 30 years ago are suitable for today&#8217;s heavier yet leaner genotypes; and two, to better understand the influence of pre-pubertal growth rate and metabolic status on reproductive maturation, puberty attainment and potential litter size. In experiment 1, 192 Large White/Landrace crossbred gilts were used to compare the effects on puberty attainment of commencing boar exposure at 161, 182 or 203 days of age, and the effect of first mating gilts at either the pubertal or second oestrus on ovulation rate and early embryo survival. Gilts were artificially inseminated at the allocated oestrus, with the reproductive tracts collected at 22.8 &#177; 0.4 days after first mating (mean &#177; S.E.M), and the numbers of corpora lutea and viable embryos recorded. Delaying first boar contact until 182 or 203 days of age significantly (P &lt; 0.01) reduced days-to puberty and increased the proportion of gilts attaining puberty within 10 days of start of boar exposure. Gilt age at mating had no effect on potential litter size; however, there was a tendency for gilts mated at their second oestrus to shed 0.6 more ova, and possess one more embryo at day 20 of pregnancy. Experiment 2 determined the effects of long- (chronic) and short- (acute) term moderate dietary restriction on ovarian development and oocyte developmental competence in 161- and 175- day old, pre-pubertal gilts. Both chronic and acute periods of moderate feed restriction reduced the number of medium follicles present on the ovaries of 161- and 175-day old gilts, as well as the proportion of oocytes reaching Metaphase II in vitro. However, feeding level during the 14 days prior to ovary collection had the greatest effect on follicular growth and oocyte quality. Experiments 3 and 4 investigated the effects of the same dietary treatments on the timing of puberty attainment in response to boar exposure and potential litter size following mating at the pubertal oestrus. Chronic dietary restriction during the pre-pubertal period delayed puberty attainment, but the timing of the pubertal response was unaffected by acute, moderate dietary restriction of previously well-fed gilts during the period immediately prior to, and coincident with, boar exposure. Acute dietary restriction or repletion stimulated an increase or decrease, respectively, in pubertal ovulation rates; however, neither the number of viable embryo present on day 22 of gestation nor embryo survival were affected by the nutritional treatments used in these studies. Overall, these results demonstrate that the timing and synchrony of puberty attainment is significantly improved when gilts first receive boar exposure at 182 days of age (or older). It is, therefore, concluded that sexual maturity, as measured by responsiveness to boar contact, occurs later in modern genotypes. It is also evident that within the age range investigated, delaying first mating until the second oestrus does not significantly increase either ovulation rate or embryo number at day 20 post-mating. Further, the current data provide the first evidence that despite profoundly affecting the size and morphology of the antral follicle pool as well as pubertal ovulation rates, subtle alterations in dietary intake have no affect on the number or proportion of embryos surviving the pre-and peri-implantation period. It is evident the litter size of gilts mated at the pubertal oestrus is not determined by the number of ova shed, with the current data demonstrating that increasing ovulation rates results in increased embryo mortality.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gilt; Puberty; Litter size; Nutrition; Oocyte; Embryo</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Time to care": relationship between time spent caring for pre-school children with developmental delays and psychological, social and physical well-being of parents.</field><field name="creator">Crettenden, Angela D.</field><field name="description">Advances in medical technologies and changing philosophies of health care have led to a rapid increase in home-based care for children with disabilities. While there are cost savings for health services if children are cared for at home there are extensive additional demands on the time and resources of parents, particularly primary caregivers, who are usually mothers. Previous studies have shown that parents caring for children with disabilities experience considerable stress and increased rates of mental health problems. The present dissertation investigated the impact of caring on the daily lives of parents and in particular, a model proposing factors contributing to parental psychological, social and health outcomes. A preliminary qualitative study found time demands to be a core theme when discussing the consequences of caring, and when describing tasks of caring. A second, larger scale quantitative study focused on assessing the time constraints facing parents of children with developmental disabilities. Participants were 95 primary caregivers (mostly mothers) and 65 secondary caregivers (mostly fathers) of children (mean age = 4&#189; years) with developmental disabilities who were clients of the Early Childhood Service, part of Disability Services SA. Children&#8223;s diagnoses included global developmental delay, Down syndrome, and autism. Caring and other activities of parents were assessed using a 24 hour pre-coded time-use diary. Parents also completed questionnaires measuring characteristics of child disability; their experience of time pressure and partner support; and psychological, social and physical well-being. Examination of time-use diaries found parents of children with disabilities spent more time in &#8220;active&#8221; rather than &#8220;passive&#8221; caring tasks, than parents of children in the general community. As well, they spent less time in personal care, and less time in recreational activities. Intensity of caring, rather than total time caring was correlated with reports of daily stress for primary caregivers. Patterns of caring and non-caring activities carried out by primary caregivers on weekdays and weekend days differed from those undertaken by secondary caregivers, reflecting gender differences in parenting roles. Analysis of questionnaire data showed children to have high levels of emotional and behavioural problems. Parents (particularly primary caregivers) had significantly poorer psychological, social and physical health outcomes than normative samples. Feelings of time pressure had a stronger association with parental depression than actual time spent caring. Further, testing of the model showed time pressure and partner support to be potential mechanisms by which caring for a child with a disability may lead to poor parental mental health. It is suggested that professionals providing early intervention services need a greater awareness of the constraints of the caring role undertaken by parents, together with the key role played by feelings of time pressure and partner support in contributing to the mental health of parents of children with disabilities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children; Disability; Caregiver; Time</field><field name="subject">Parents of children with disabilities -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Children with disabilities -- Care.</field><field name="subject">Parents -- Psychology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pharmacological management of dentine to protect against plaque microorganism degradation.</field><field name="creator">Knight, Geoffrey Macdonald</field><field name="description">Background There is a transition towards minimally invasive restorative techniques in restorative dentistry based upon reducing bacterial viability and encouraging remineralization of caries infected tissue. To improve the predictability of the antibacterial and remineralization potential of carious dentine by either the application of medicaments or placement of restorative materials that encourage remineralization would be a significant benefit in disease management. Materials and Methods An experimental model was developed using a chemostat for in vitro analysis of the effects of silver fluoride followed by potassium iodide (AgF/KI) and ozone treatment on non demineralized and demineralized dentine. Electron Probe Micro Analysis (EPMA) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on the treated dentine were conducted to investigate ion transfer, and biofilm formation. Bacteria growth was measured by optical density. An in vitro caries model using a chemostat was developed to determine the ability of glass ionomer cement and composite resin to inhibit dentinal degradation in adjacent dentine and to measure ion exchange at the restorative interface. Tests were made to determine the bond strength between dentine and glass ionomer cement after application of silver fluoride to the surface of the dentine. Results S. mutans migrated through all dentine samples. Samples treated with AgF/KI had significantly lower optical densities than the corresponding controls. Optical density readings were significantly lower in demineralized dentine treated with AgF/KI than non demineralized dentine. There were lower but not significant differences in the optical density readings between ozonated and non ozonated dentine. An S. mutans biofilm covered all control discs. No biofilm was detected on discs treated with AgF/KI and these discs were significantly more resistant to further demineralization than the control discs. Detectable amounts of silver and fluoride were found up to 450 &#956;m in the AgF and AgF/KI sections. Ozone infusion prevented S. Mutans and L. acidophilus biofilm formation on all the treated dentine samples, biofilm was present on all control specimens. There was calcium and phosphorus present in all auto cure glass ionomer cements to a depth beyond 50 microns. Aluminium and strontium ions were also present in dentine except strontium subjacent to Ketac Molar restorations. Fluoride uptake was significantly higher under glass ionomer cement restorations where the dentine was pretreated with AgF/KI compared to non treated specimens. Silver and iodine deposits were present in demineralized dentine treated with AgF/KI. Calcium and phosphorus levels up to 130 microns from the restorative interface were similar to non demineralized dentine adjacent to auto cure glass ionomer cements and half that adjacent to composite resin. There was significant surface degradation in auto cure glass ionomer cements compared to composite resin. Washing away the AgF/KI precipitate produced higher bond strengths to dentine than samples where the precipitate remained. Conclusions Under the conditions of these in vitro studies, the application of AgF/KI and ozone pharmacologically reduces the initiation and rate of dentine caries. Glass ionomer cements were shown to protect dentine from experimental carious degradation and assist with remineralization. AgF/KI application enhances remineralization beneath glass ionomers and does not interfere with bond strengths.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plaque; Biofilm; Micro-organism; Dentine; Recurrant caries; Silver Fluoride; Ozone; Glass ionomer cement</field><field name="subject">Dental plaque</field><field name="subject">Dental glass ionomer cements</field><field name="subject">Dental pharmacology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stroke prevention and hospital management.</field><field name="creator">Yip, Man-tat (Albert)</field><field name="description">Stroke is a preventable disease. Minor stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are important warning signs of the possibility of a major stroke. Worldwide, stroke is the third most common killer and the largest cause of disability. The incidence of stroke is predicted to increase with the predominance of unhealthy lifestyles and the aging population. The adoption of a healthy lifestyle can reduce many of the risk factors. This descriptive study was designed to explore patients&#8217; understanding of modifiable risk factors of cerebrovascular disease. It investigated lifestyle changes actually made, as well as the factors affecting patients&#8217; decisions about whether to make lifestyle changes. The two major factors considered were patients&#8217; sources and level of knowledge and their attitudes and beliefs around making changes. A convenience sample of patients who had suffered a minor stroke or TIA was recruited through a major metropolitan hospital. Thirty-five subjects responded to a postal questionnaire. The mean age was 68 years and 37% of the subjects had sustained some disability as a result of the TIA or minor stroke. The results demonstrated that many subjects had a poor understanding of risk factors of stroke. While smoking was well recognised as a risk factor, subjects showed less awareness of other risk factors, such as excessive alcohol consumption and obesity. Subjects also reported significant confusion regarding diet. Sixty-six percent of subjects depended on doctors as their main source of health information. This may be problematic as the current shortages of General Practitioners has put pressure on doctors to keep appointment times short and reduce the time available for health education. The main barriers to lifestyle change, were lack of motivation, and inadequate, knowledge, guidance, and support and the inability to access good information. Although 83% of subjects suffered from hypertension, medication was the accepted method of control, few subjects realised the significance of lifestyle factors. Nine percent of subjects were only diagnosed with hypertension after their stroke or TIA and few monitor their own blood pressure, despite the wide availability of home monitoring devices. From the findings of this study it is concluded that health promotion and education are very important strategies in the prevention of stroke and it is recommended that this kind of education begins in childhood with tailored, age-specific programs delivered to the public over the lifespan. The role of health screening cannot be underestimated in the detection of risk factors such as hypertension and obesity. Early detection makes effective treatment possible and helps prevent the occurrence of strokes, thus reducing the cost to the community. Long-term health strategies such as improving health resource distribution and enhancing health education are needed where patients and their families participate together in comprehensive education programs. It is hoped that this may lead to a shared understanding, which may translate to patients being more supported, and therefore more able, to make the necessary lifestyle changes.  Dysphagia is a common complication following stroke, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Multidisciplinary collaboration facilitates management strategies, decision-making and the efficiency of rehabilitation. Nurses are responsible for coordination of management and in particular for continuous monitoring, assessment of swallowing and nutritional state, maintaining safety and preventing complications. An understanding of the issues and strategies relating to management may provide valuable information to enhance the safety, cost-effectiveness and quality of care. A retrospective review of patients&#8217; medical records was used to collect data. A sample of ninety-five adults who were admitted to an Australian public hospital between January 2003 and April 2006, with a diagnosis of dysphagic stroke were recruited. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse the quantitative data, while content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. All subjects were assessed by a speech pathologist, the mean age was 75 years and 50.5% were male. Except for critically ill subjects, almost all were assessed within three days. Ninety-six percent of subjects had communication problems and 81% had upper limb motor impairment. During hospitalisation almost 60% of subjects had an improvement in their oral intake including 8% resuming their premorbid diet. Eighteen percent were on enteral tube feeding upon discharge, 4% deteriorated and 16% died. It appears that oral intake of most subjects was unsatisfactory. When recorded the mean body weight lost was 2.3kg. At least 22% had malnutrition or dehydration. Forty-five percent aspirated and 22% had respiratory infection. Almost half of the subjects (48%) were discharged to aged care facilities. Eighty percent had no documented follow-up scheduled for management of their dysphagia. Early identification of dysphagia, prudent supervising of appropriate oral intake and mouth care may help to maintain safe swallowing, preventing aspiration and chest infection. Regular checks of body weight, serum albumin level, oral intake and early enteral feeding are essential to guide nutritional support, minimise malnutrition and problematic medication administration. Encouraging oral intake and providing families with support could promote recovery of swallowing skills and help patients to regain the ability to eat independently. Providing helpful information on the care options available may allay patient and family anxiety. A qualified nurse practitioner could assess patients and ensure that a tailored care plan was designed to meet patients&#8217; needs and this may improve the outcomes considerably.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke; Transient ischaemic attack; Hospital management; Dysphagia</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease Prevention.</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease Treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time-dependence in Markovian decision processes.</field><field name="creator">McMahon, Jeremy James</field><field name="description">The main focus of this thesis is Markovian decision processes with an emphasis on incorporating time-dependence into the system dynamics. When considering such decision processes, we provide value equations that apply to a large range of classes of Markovian decision processes, including Markov decision processes (MDPs) and semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs), time-homogeneous or otherwise. We then formulate a simple decision process with exponential state transitions and solve this decision process using two separate techniques. The first technique solves the value equations directly, and the second utilizes an existing continuous-time MDP solution technique. To incorporate time-dependence into the transition dynamics of the process, we examine a particular decision process with state transitions determined by the Erlang distribution. Although this process is originally classed as a generalized semi-Markov decision process, we re-define it as a time-inhomogeneous SMDP. We show that even for a simply stated process with desirable state-space properties, the complexity of the value equations becomes so substantial that useful analytic expressions for the optimal solutions for all states of the process are unattainable. We develop a new technique, utilizing phase-type (PH) distributions, in an effort to address these complexity issues. By using PH representations, we construct a new state-space for the process, referred to as the phase-space, incorporating the phases of the state transition probability distributions. In performing this step, we effectively model the original process as a continuous-time MDP. The information available in this system is, however, richer than that of the original system. In the interest of maintaining the physical characteristics of the original system, we define a new valuation technique for the phase-space that shields some of this information from the decision maker. Using the process of phase-space construction and our valuation technique, we define an original system of value equations for this phasespace that are equivalent to those for the general Markovian decision processes mentioned earlier. An example of our own phase-space technique is given for the aforementioned Erlang decision process and we identify certain characteristics of the optimal solution such that, when applicable, the implementation of our phase-space technique is greatly simplified. These newly defined value equations for the phase-space are potentially as complex to solve as those defined for the original model. Restricting our focus to systems with acyclic state-spaces though, we describe a top-down approach to solution of the phase-space value equations for more general processes than those considered thus far. Again, we identify characteristics of the optimal solution to look for when implementing this technique and provide simplifications of the value equations where these characteristics are present. We note, however, that it is almost impossible to determine a priori the class of processes for which the simplifications outlined in our phase-space technique will be applicable. Nevertheless, we do no worse in terms of complexity by utilizing our phase-space technique, and leave open the opportunity to simplify the solution process if an appropriate situation arises. The phase-space technique can handle time-dependence in the state transition probabilities, but is insufficient for any process with time-dependent reward structures or discounting. To address such decision processes, we define an approximation technique for the solution of the class of infinite horizon decision processes whose state transitions and reward structures are described with reference to a single global clock. This technique discretizes time into exponentially distributed length intervals and incorporates this absolute time information into the state-space. For processes where the state-transitions are not exponentially distributed, we use the hazard rates of the transition probability distributions evaluated at the discrete time points to model the transition dynamics of the system. We provide a suitable reward structure approximation using our discrete time points and guidelines for sensible truncation, using an MDP approximation to the tail behaviour of the original infinite horizon process. The result is a finite-state time-homogeneous MDP approximation to the original process and this MDP may be solved using standard existing solution techniques. The approximate solution to the original process can then be inferred from the solution to our MDP approximation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telecommunications; Markov decision processes; Markov process; time-dependent processes; phase-type distrubutions</field><field name="subject">Markov processes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene therapy for mesothelioma : studies of conditionally replicative adenoviruses and measles virus.</field><field name="creator">Xia, Wei</field><field name="description">Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive malignancy of the pleural and peritoneal surfaces. Australia has the highest reported national incidence of mesothelioma in the world, and rates are increasing (Leigh et al., 2002). The clinical outcome for patients with this disease is extremely poor, with median survival of 9 to 12 months (Rizzo et al., 2001; Carbone et al., 2002). The latest developments in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and radical surgery have done little to improve the overall survival rate (Kindler 2000; Zellos et al., 2002). New approaches to therapy are thus required (Nowak et al., 2002). Cancer therapy using conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds) and attenuated measles virus (vaccine strain MV-Edm) are novel and promising approaches to cancer treatment. CRAds strategy relies on selective viral replication in tumour cells but not normal cells. Major efforts have been directed toward achieving selective replication by the deletion of viral functions dispensable in tumour cells or by the regulation of viral genes with tumour-specific promoters (Alemany et al., 2000). However, the major clinical limitation of viral therapy has been lack of efficacy rather than safety concerns. In this study, I constructed CRAds in which tumour-specific promoter for Flt-1 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) control the essential E1 gene expression, and evaluated the cell-killing efficacy and specificity of CRAds driven by VEGF and Flt-1 promoters in the number of established mesothelioma cell lines and actual primary tumour cells from patients. CRAds with either VEGF or flt-1 promoters showed a strong killeg effect on mesothelioma cells. Co-delivery of CRAds with MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) was assessed to determine whether therapeutic efficacy could be improved by reducing tumourassociated fibrosis thereby enhancing viral spread through a tumour mass. Combined therapy did result in greater suppression of tumour growth in vivo. I also identified an immuno-competent murine model of mesothelioma that was permissive for adenoviral replication. Combined viral therapy with immunotherapy (FGK45, an anti-CD40 antibody) in this model resulted in greater effect than Adwt or FGK45 alone and in greatest survival. I evaluated the capacity of MV-Edm to infect human mesothelioma cells to form syncytia, and lead to apoptosis and cell death. I also assessed the mode of death by analysis of markers of apoptosis including caspase-3. In vivo study showed that MVEdm- GFP transduction could be detected in human xenografts in immune deficient mice. Further studies to evaluate the mechanisms and efficacy of anti-tumour immune stimulation induced by tumour cell killing with CRAds and MV-Edm will be discussed in this study. MV-Edm has good killing effect on mesothelioma cells in vitro. In summary the work presented herein provide new insights into stratgies to improve viral therapies for mesothelioma.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mesothelioma; gene therapy; conditionally replicative adenoviruses; measles virus</field><field name="subject">Mesothelioma.

Various signal processing techniques have been developed to improve the reliability of GPS receivers against different types of interference. Among these techniques, null steering is recognized as an effective method to protect GPS against both narrowband and broadband interference. However, due to the requirement of multiple antenna channels, it has mainly been implemented for large platform applications. This thesis examines the suitability of null steering techniques for small UAV applications and determines the practically achievable anti-jamming ability by implementing a two-element miniaturized adaptive antenna array. The adaptive antenna array is tested against a 2MHz broadband jamming signal under both laboratory testing conditions and a real jamming environment. Approximately 40dB anti-jamming range was achieved in the laboratory testing conditions. 38dB and 42dB were obtained in a real jamming environment with different antenna configuration.

Although it has long been accorded a particular significance in the context of his life and work, Maurice Ravel&#8217;s conception of childhood, together with the musical language through which it found expression, has never been the subject of a detailed, extended study. This thesis, therefore, explores the roles and realisations of childhood in Ravel&#8217;s music, arguing that they were inextricably linked with the language, traditions and idioms of the literary fairytale &#8211; an hypothesis Ravel himself supported when he wrote that his intention in his fairytale-based Ma m&#232;re l'Oye was to evoke &#8216;the poetry of childhood&#8217;. Through a study of these intertwined themes, the thesis develops new analytical and interpretative approaches to three major works: the piano duet suite Ma m&#232;re l&#8217;Oye (1910), the Trois chansons for mixed choir (1914-1915), and the opera L&#8217;Enfant et les sortil&#232;ges (1919-1925). These works span a fifteen-year period that saw a decisive evolution in Ravel&#8217;s compositional style, and was crucially impacted by the great cataclysm of the First World War. Ravel deliberately aligned his music with the traditions of the fairytale through the creation and expressive manipulation of musical and dramatic structure, language, gesture and perspective. One may trace the voice and presence of the storyteller in Ma m&#232;re l&#8217;Oye, a work dedicated to two children for whom Ravel was a favourite companion and teller of fairytales. L&#8217;Enfant et les sortil&#232;ges presents a detailed portrait of its eponymous Child, set within a fairytale in which traditional elements combine with a complexity of dramatic, musical and psychological construction that invokes the zeitgeist of the 1920s. The shadows of real events intrude more disturbingly upon the Trois chansons, whose distorted fairytale narratives represent a direct and personal response to the War. In its balance of musical interpretation and explication, supported by a clearly defined historical and philosophical context, the study yields new insights into a central facet of Ravel&#8217;s musical identity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ravel; childhood; fairytale; opera; French music; L'Enfant et les sortileges</field><field name="subject">Ravel, Maurice, 1875-1937 Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Music France 20th century History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Fairy tales.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of interpretation and improvisation in the performance of Brazilian guitar music.</field><field name="creator">Bevan, Michael</field><field name="description">This research into Brazilian music in general, and choro guitar music in particular, focuses primarily on the various and contrasting ways in which the repertoire is interpreted by Brazilian choro musicians, classical guitarists and jazz guitarists.

The research aims to investigate the processes of developing an interpretation together with associated performance issues. The principles of interpretation and performance are discussed in the exegesis, especially the process of developing an interpretative concept and of realising it in performance. More specifically, it addresses interdependence of analytical and intuitive approaches to a performed work. As part of this, the researcher presents a personal view of the nature of the performer/audience relationship, discusses aspects of practice and explores the special challenges of ensemble performance. This provides a backdrop to a more detailed discussion of the works of C&#233;sar Franck, especially the importance for the performer of understanding his use of cyclic forms. The major argument of the exegesis lies in the idea that the analytical approach to a musical work does not suffice for its full comprehension and therefore should not eliminate an exploration of such properties of music that can only be grasped by the musical intuition of the performer. The exegesis draws on the personal ideas of the researcher, who has found the research time as a convenient way of putting different thoughts together in a systematized and structured form.

These detectors use long-baseline Michelson interferometers, where the critical enabling component is the laser. The laser required for these interferometers must provide a low noise, single frequency, diffraction limited, high power TEM&#8320;&#8320; beam. Very importantly, the laser beam must be available continuously and without the need for operator intervention. In this thesis I describe the development and characterisation of injection-locked 10 W Nd:YAG lasers, designed specifically for use at the Australian Consortium for Interferometric Gravitational Astronomy (ACIGA) High Power Test Facility (HPTF) in Western Australia, and on the Japanese TAMA 300 gravitational wave interferometer (GWI). The starting point was a 5 W laboratory laser that had demonstrated the proof-of-principle; however this laser had insufficient power, inadequate reliability, and was not suitable for deployment to a remote site. I describe the development of this laser technology and design to realise reliable, longterm operation and field deployability, while satisfying the requirements for a GWI, with the final laser system bearing little resemblance to the proof-of-principle system. Injection-locked lasers were successfully installed at the ACIGA HPTF and at TAMA 300 in June 2004 and September 2005 respectively. The 10 W laser uses a Nd:YAG Coplanar Pumped Folded Slab (CPFS) gain medium. The slab is side-pumped using a temperature controlled, fast-axis collimated, custom laser diode array, and conduction cooled in the orthogonal direction. Interferometry is used to measure the thermal lensing within the gain medium; these measurements are used to design a single-mode, travelling-wave slave resonator. The entire slave laser is temperature controlled and mounted on an integrated, air-cooled base. The thermal design is validated by extensive thermal testing. Long-term and robust injection-locking is achieved by using a servo system based on the Pound-Drever-Hall technique. I describe the development of a split feedback servo system to provide increased frequency stabilisation loop bandwidth and show that long-term injection-locking of the slave laser to a low power non-planar ring oscillator (NPRO) master laser produces a single frequency output at ~ 10 W with M&#178;[subscript]x.y approx &#8804; 1.1. Finally, the noise of the injection-locked laser is characterised. Relative intensity noise measurements demonstrate stability comparable to current GWI laser sources, while the results of a heterodyne beat measurement show that the 10 W injectionlocked laser output has frequency noise limited by the NPRO input. The laser installed at the ACIGA HPTF has been used to investigate the effects of increased intracavity laser powers on next-generation interferometers, with the laser described in this thesis being the key enabling component of this research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lasers; gravitational waves; interferometry</field><field name="subject">Interferometry.</field><field name="subject">Gravitational waves.</field><field name="subject">Gravitational waves -- Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Lasers.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The modelling and analysis of command and control decision processes using extended time petri nets.</field><field name="creator">Bowden, Fred D. J.</field><field name="description">Effective command and control is crucial to both military and non-military environments. Accurate representations of the processes associated with the inter and intra activities of nodes or agencies of such systems is essential in the analysis of command and control. One of the most important things is to be able to model the decision processes. These are the parts of the system that make decisions and then guide the direction of other elements in the system overall. This thesis uses a new type of extended time Petri net to model and analyse command and control decision processes. A comprehensive review of existing time Petri net structures is given. This concludes with the introduction of a time Petri net structure that incorporates the most commonly used time structures. This extended time Petri net structure is then used in the definition of the basic modelling blocks required to model command and control decision processes. This basic modelling block forms the basis of the direct analysis techniques that are introduced in the thesis. Due to the transient nature of the systems being modelled and the measures of interest a new type of measure is introduced, the mean conditional first hitting reward. This measure does not currently appear to be part of the stochastic process literature. Explicit procedures are given to determine the hitting probabilities and mean conditional first hitting reward for decision process models and discrete, continuous and semi-Markov chains. Finally the some extensions of the decision process sub-class are considered.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">petri nets</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape scale measurement and monitoring of biodiversity in the Australian rangelands.</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Kenneth David</field><field name="description">It is becoming increasingly important to monitor biodiversity in the extensive Australian rangelands; currently however, there is no method capable of achieving this goal. There are two potential sources of relevant data that cover the Australian rangelands, and from which measures of biodiversity might be extracted: traditional field-based methods such as quadrat surveys have collected flora and fauna species data throughout the rangelands, but at fine scale; satellite remote sensing collects biologically relevant, spatially comprehensive data. The goal of this thesis was to provide the spatially comprehensive measure of biodiversity required for informed management of the Australian rangelands. The study specifically focused on the Stony Plains in the South Australian rangelands. To that end the thesis aimed to develop indices capable of measuring and/or monitoring biodiversity from vegetation quadrat survey data and remotely sensed data. The term biodiversity is so all-encompassing that direct measurement is not possible; therefore it is necessary to measure surrogates instead. Total perennial vegetation species richness (y-diversity) is a sound surrogate of biodiversity: the category of species is well defined, species richness is measurable, and there is evidence that vegetation species richness co-varies with the species richness of other taxonomic groups in relation to the same environmental variables. At least two broad scale conventional vegetation surveys are conducted in the study region; the Biological Survey of South Australia; and the South Australian Pastoral Lease Assessment. Prior to the extraction of biodiversity data the quality of the BSSA, the best biodiversity survey, was evaluated. Analysis revealed that false-negative errors were common, and that even highly detectable vegetation species had detection probabilities significantly less than one. Without some form of correction for detectability, the species diversity recorded by either vegetation survey must be treated with caution. Informed by the identification of false-negative errors, a method was developed to extract y-diversity of woody perennials from the survey data, and to remove the influence of sampling effort. Data were aggregated by biogeographic region, rarefaction was used to remove most of the influence of sampling effort, and additional correction removed the residual influence of sampling effort. Finally, additive partitioning of species diversity allowed extraction of indices of a-, &#946;- and y-diversity free from the influence of sampling effort. However, this woody perennial vegetation y-diversity did not address the need for a spatially extensive, fine scale measure of biodiversity at the extent of the study region. The aggregation of point data to large regions, a necessary part of this index, produces spatially coarse results. To formulate and test remotely sensed surrogates of biodiversity, it is necessary to understand the determinants of and pressures on biodiversity in the Australian rangelands. The most compelling explanation for the distribution of biodiversity at the extensive scales of the Australian rangelands is the Productivity Theory, which reasons that the greater the amount and duration of primary productivity the greater the capacity to generate and support high biodiversity. The most significant pressure on biodiversity in the study area is grazing-induced degradation, or overgrazing. Two potential spatially comprehensive surrogates of pressure on biodiversity were identified. The first surrogate was based on the differential effect of overgrazing on waterenergy balance and net primary productivity: water-energy balance is a function of climatic variables, and therefore a measure of potential or expected primary productivity; net primary productivity is reduced by high grazing pressure. The second surrogate was based on the effect of grazing-induced degradation on the temporal variability of net primary productivity: overgrazing reduces mean net primary productivity and rainfall use efficiency, and increases variation in net primary productivity and rainfall use efficiency. The two surrogates of biodiversity stress were derived from the best available remotely sensed and climate data for the study area: actual evapotranspiration recorded by climate stations was considered an index of water-energy balance; net primary productivity was measured from NOAA AVHRR integrated NDVI; rainfall use efficiency (biomass per unit rainfall) was calculated from rainfall data collected at climate stations and the net primary productivity measure. Finally, the surrogates were evaluated against the index of woody perennial a-, &#946;- and y-diversity, on the assumption that prolonged biodiversity stress would reduce vegetation species diversity. No link was found between Surrogate 1 and woody perennial a-, &#946;- or y-diversity. The relationship of Surrogate 2 to woody perennial diversity was more complex. Only some of the results supported the hypothesis that overgrazing decreases y-diversity and average NPP and RUE. Importantly, none of the results supported the most important part of the hypothesis that the proposed indices of biodiversity pressure would co-vary with woody perennial a-diversity. Thus, the analysis did not reveal a convincing link between either surrogate and vegetation species diversity. However, the analysis was hampered to a large degree by the climate data, which is interpolated from a very sparse network of climate stations. This thesis has contributed significantly to the measurement and monitoring of biodiversity in the Australian rangelands. The identification of false-negative errors as a cause for concern will allow future analyses of the vegetation survey data to adopt methods to counteract these errors, and hence extract more robust information. The method for extracting sampling effort corrected indices of a-, &#946;- and y-diversity allow for the examination and comparison of species diversity across regions, regardless of differences in sampling effort. These indices are not limited to rangelands, and can be extracted from any vegetation quadrat survey data obtained within a prescribed methodology. Therefore, these tools contribute to global biodiversity measurement and monitoring. Finally, the remotely sensed surrogates of biodiversity are theoretically sound and applicable in any rangeland where over-grazing is a significant source of degradation. However, because the evaluation of these surrogates in this thesis was hampered by available data, further testing is necessary.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biodiversity; remote sensing; non-detection; rarefaction; additive partitioning; arid; landscape scale</field><field name="subject">Biodiversity -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Biodiversity -- Monitoring -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Remote sensing -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Rangelands -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Rangelands -- Monitoring -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental numerical schemes for parameter estimation in computer vision.</field><field name="creator">Scoleri, Tony</field><field name="description">An important research area in computer vision is parameter estimation. Given a mathematical model and a sample of image measurement data, key parameters are sought to encapsulate geometric properties of a relevant entity. An optimisation problem is often formulated in order to find these parameters. This thesis presents an elaboration of fundamental numerical algorithms for estimating parameters of multi-objective models of importance in computer vision applications. The work examines ways to solve unconstrained and constrained minimisation problems from the view points of theory, computational methods, and numerical performance. The research starts by considering a particular form of multi-equation constraint function that characterises a wide class of unconstrained optimisation tasks. Increasingly sophisticated cost functions are developed within a consistent framework, ultimately resulting in the creation of a new iterative estimation method. The scheme operates in a maximum likelihood setting and yields near-optimal estimate of the parameters. Salient features of themethod are that it has simple update rules and exhibits fast convergence. Then, to accommodate models with functional dependencies, two variant of this initial algorithm are proposed. These methods are improved again by reshaping the objective function in a way that presents the original estimation problem in a reduced form. This procedure leads to a novel algorithm with enhanced stability and convergence properties. To extend the capacity of these schemes to deal with constrained optimisation problems, several a posteriori correction techniques are proposed to impose the so-called ancillary constraints. This work culminates by giving two methods which can tackle ill-conditioned constrained functions. The combination of the previous unconstrained methods with these post-hoc correction schemes provides an array of powerful constrained algorithms. The practicality and performance of themethods are evaluated on two specific applications. One is planar homography matrix computation and the other trifocal tensor estimation. In the case of fitting a homography to image data, only the unconstrained algorithms are necessary. For the problem of estimating a trifocal tensor, significant work is done first on expressing sets of usable constraints, especially the ancillary constraints which are critical to ensure that the computed object conforms to the underlying geometry. Evidently here, the post-correction schemes must be incorporated in the computational mechanism. For both of these example problems, the performance of the unconstrained and constrained algorithms is compared to existing methods. Experiments reveal that the new methods perform with high accuracy to match a state-of-the-art technique but surpass it in execution speed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parametric estimation; maximum likelihood linear dependencies; generalised inverse; problem conditioning; homography fitting; trifocal tensor estimation</field><field name="subject">Computer vision.</field><field name="subject">Computer vision -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Parameter estimation -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Tensor algebra.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the therapeutic potential of transgenic CD40 ligand expression.</field><field name="creator">Brown, Michael Paul</field><field name="description">The CD40 ligand (CD40L) molecule is central to innate and adaptive immunity. CD40L expression is very tightly regulated whereas its CD40 receptor is constitutively expressed by many different cell types. CD40L is expressed transiently on helper T cells (Th) only after activation by specific immune recognition molecules carried by professional antigen presenting cells, in particular, dendritic cells (DC). CD40L subsequently binds to CD40 on DC to enable full Th activation. CD40 ligated DC produce interleukin-12 (IL-12) and contribute both to the development of IFN&#947;-secreting natural killer cells, a vital component of innate immunity, and of IFN&#947;-secreting type 1 Th (Th1) cells. CD40 ligated DC also contribute to the development of IL-4- and IL-10-secreting Th2 cells. CD40L on Th cells also binds CD40 on macrophages to enhance their cytotoxic functions. CD40L-expressing Th cells provide the &#8216;help&#8217; pivotally required to activate other components of adaptive immunity responsible both for clearing invading pathogens and generating the memory cells required to prevent re-infection. Th-supplied CD40L binds (i) B cell CD40 to switch production of antibodies to more potent effector molecules that have higher avidity for antigen, and (ii) DC CD40 to prime then expand antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Activated NK cells and CTL are required both to eradicate malignant cells and cells infected with viruses or other intracellular pathogens. Genetic CD40L deficiency causes the very rare HyperIgM Syndrome Type 1 (HIGM1), which is realistically modelled by genetically engineered CD40L-deficient mice. Neither CD40L-deficient patients nor mice make effective antibodies or mount cellular immune responses that would defend them against intracellular pathogens such as parasites. Consequently, the only potentially curative therapy is allogeneic stem cell transplantation or CD40L gene replacement. Here, we used a retroviral vector, which constitutively expressed CD40L, to genetically modify CD40L-deficient bone marrow cells, which were used to reconstitute partially the immunity of CD40L-deficient mice. The crucial importance of tight regulation of CD40L expression was revealed when these mice later developed lethal thymic T cell malignancy. Growing tumours escape immune vigilance by genetic alterations that reduce their sensitivity to IFN&#947;. Using murine tumour models, we incorporated transgenic CD40L expression in therapeutic tumour vaccines to show that CD40L gene transfer augmented the immunogenicity of the host&#8217;s tumour thus reducing its tumorigenicity. We translated this finding clinically to safety and immunogenicity testing of a transgenic CD40L- and IL-2- expressing leukaemia vaccine. Finally, the common viral respiratory pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mainly infects young infants and the elderly to cause potentially lethal pneumonia. Both groups have reduced cellular and humoral immunity, which predisposes them to re-infection with RSV. Using a murine model, we showed first that simultaneous adenoviral expression of CD40L augmented primary RSV-specific Th1 responses that were associated with accelerated pulmonary viral clearance. Second, we showed that expression of CD40L in RSV-F and RSV-G subunit DNA vaccines elevated antibody and cellular immune responses to RSV challenge four and eight months after the initial immunisation. These results demonstrate the potent ability of CD40L gene transfer to solve the absolute immune deficiency caused by genetic lesions of CD40L. However, physiological regulation of the transgene is required to prevent serious adverse consequences. In contrast, no adverse effects were observed after transgenic CD40L expression was used to overcome relative immune deficiencies imposed by malignancy and RSV infection.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer immunology; cancer immunotherapy; deficiency; respiratory syncytial virus</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Immunotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Immunogenetics.</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of the cumulus oocyte matrix during maturation of oocytes.</field><field name="creator">Dunning, Kylie Renee</field><field name="description">Female gametes, or oocytes grow and mature in a niche environment maintained by the somatic cells of the ovarian follicle. At ovulation ovarian follicle cells respond to the luteinising hormone (LH) surge coordinating the final maturation, meiotic resumption and release of oocytes. Simultaneously, production of a unique &#8220;mucified&#8221; extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte through synthesis of Hyaluronan (HA) and HA cross-linking proteins produces an &#8220;expanded&#8221; and stabilised cumulus oocyte matrix with a specific composition, structure and function. In vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes is a procedure by which cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) are stimulated to produce cumulus matrix and undergo oocyte maturation ex vivo. In vitro maturation is a useful procedure for studying oocyte competence as well as offering health benefits for patients undergoing assisted reproduction. Oocytes derived from IVM have much lower developmental competence than in vivo matured oocytes, likely as a result of altered environmental conditions and gene expression leading to suboptimal maturation and/or inappropriate metabolic control in oocytes. Cumulus matrix expansion is widely used as an indicator of good oocyte developmental potential, however, the mechanism(s) that endow oocyte quality and how these may be influenced by the cumulus matrix are poorly understood. To better understand the process by which cumulus matrix is linked to the final stages of oocyte maturation, I undertook investigation of mouse COC matrix composition and function after in vivo maturation in comparison to IVM. The gene responsible for Hyaluronan synthesis, Has2, was not impaired under IVM conditions. In contrast, two key extracellular matrix proteins; Versican and Adamts1, which are normally selectively incorporated into periovulatory COCs in vivo, were greater than 10-fold reduced in IVM whether stimulated with Egf and/or FSH. This work is the first to show that commonly used IVM conditions result in altered gene expression in cumulus cells. Furthermore, the absence of Adamts1 and Versican suggest that COC matrix may be functionally insufficient. Although associated with good developmental potential, the function of the COC matrix in oocyte maturation is unknown. I assessed the properties of COC matrix that control metabolite supply to oocytes by examining transport of fluorescently labelled glucose and cholesterol across mouse COCs. Profound differences in the control of metabolite supply to oocytes in IVM were observed. In vivo matured complexes were capable of excluding glucose from the entire COC and cholesterol was excluded from oocytes. Conversely IVM COCs were more permissive to rapid equilibration of glucose and cholesterol concentrations across the complex and in oocytes. In fact both metabolites accumulated rapidly in IVM oocytes resulting in inverse gradient patterns of glucose and cholesterol abundance with highest concentrations accumulating in the oocyte after IVM vs highest concentrations surrounding the COC after in vivo maturation conditions. As oocytes are highly sensitive to high glucose my results indicate that metabolic balance in IVM may be disrupted due to impaired molecular filtration properties of the mucified COC matrix that controls supply of hydrophilic and lipophylic substrates. Importantly these novel findings can explain the glucose sensitivity of IVM oocytes and identifies a mechanism by which IVM may lead to poorer oocyte developmental competence. To translate these findings into the improvement of IVM I generated recombinant expression plasmid constructs for several Adamts1 and Versican functional domains. The efficacy of Versican as an IVM supplement that activates cumulus cell signal transduction was proved in principle, by showing enhanced COC matrix expansion when added to mouse IVM cultures. Similar mechanisms are likely to be functional in human COCs since I demonstrated VERSICAN and ADAMTS1 expression in human in vivo matured cumulus and granulosa cells. This work has advanced our understanding of oocyte maturation and will lead to improvements in IVM and healthier outcomes from reproductive therapies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oocyte maturation; cumulus cells; mural granulosa cells; ovary; assisted reproductive technology; extracellular matrix</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Copulas for credit derivative pricing and other applications.</field><field name="creator">Crane, Glenis Jayne</field><field name="description">Copulas are multivariate probability distributions, as well as functions which link marginal distributions to their joint distribution.

In the first part of this study, copulabased conditional expectation formulae are described and are applied to small data sets from medicine and hydrology. In the second part of this study we develop a method of improving the estimation of default risk in the context of collateralized debt obligations.

Previous studies in mice with a null mutation in the Tgfb1 gene (TGF&#946;1-/- mice) implicate a key role for TGF&#946;1 in male reproductive function. These mice show profound infertility due to an inability to copulate successfully, associated with reduced testosterone and sperm production. The focus of this project was to 1) further characterize mechanisms underpinning reproductive deficiency in male TGF&#946;1-/- mice, 2) identify a reliable physiological marker of TGF&#946;1 availability in vivo, and 3) to determine whether exogenous TGF&#946;1 administration influences TGF&#946;1 availability and restores fertility. To investigate the causes of unsuccessful copulation by TGF&#946;1-/- mice, penis morphometry was examined. Penile organ structure, as assessed by scanning electron microscopy, was comparable between genotypes however a superfluous epidermal covering that impeded penile spine protrusion was evident in TGF&#946;1-/- mice. The epidermal covering was not due to increased epithelial cell proliferation, as measured by Brdu labelling and immunohistology. Behavioural observations of erectile activity showed that TGF&#946;1-/- mice achieved spontaneous erections albeit at reduced frequency compared to TGF&#946;1+/+ mice. The efficacy of exogenous TGF&#946;1 replacement was evaluated by first identifying measures of in vivo TGF&#946;1 availability and/or function and selecting an effective route of administration. Serum TGF&#946;1 and testosterone levels were reliable discriminators of TGF&#946;1 genotype. Gene expression and phagocytic function of peritoneal macrophages revealed no differences between genotypes. Exogenous sources of TGF&#946;1 for replacement studies included colostrum, naturally occurring in breast milk and recombinant human latent TGF&#946;1 (rhLTGF&#946;1). Colostrum did not increase circulating levels and rhTGF&#946;1 injection caused only transient elevation of serum levels. Thus mini-osmotic pumps were used to deliver a constant supply of cytokine to TGF&#946;1-/- mice. The fertility status of TGF&#946;1-/- mice receiving exogenous TGF&#946;1 was investigated. Reproductive behaviour in response to normal receptive female mice was assessed twice during treatment, on day 7 and day 14. Blood, liver and reproductive tissues were collected at sacrifice. Circulating TGF&#946;1 was increased in TGF&#946;1 treated TGF&#946;1-/- mice above TGF&#946;1-/- control levels, although this did not affect circulating testosterone. Erectile activity and sperm production were unchanged. Videotaping behaviour with estrous females revealed that the TGF&#946;1+/+ mice successfully mounted and intromitted, unlike the TGF&#946;1-/- controls. The TGF&#946;1-/- mice receiving exogenous TGF&#946;1 displayed moderately enhanced mounting and intromission behaviour although this remained less frequent than in the TGF&#946;1+/+ controls. Ejaculation behaviour was not observed in any TGF&#946;1-/- mice regardless of TGF&#946;1 replacement, compared to TGF&#946;1+/+ controls where &gt;90% mice displayed ejaculated. Modest improvement in the copulation activity of the TGF&#946;1-/- mice receiving exogenous TGF&#946;1 suggests that systemic TGF&#946;1 availability can influence reproductive performance in male TGF&#946;1-/- mice. However since fertility was not restored, locally produced TGF&#946;1 in the reproductive tract and/or hypothalamic pituitary axis are also implicated in regulating fertility. These findings advance our knowledge of the role of the TGF&#946;1 cytokine in male reproductive physiology and may have relevance for devising new treatments for infertility and erectile dysfunction in men.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transforming growth factor; tgf; exogenous reproductive; male; regulation; immune; serum; penis; testosterone; skin; erection mounting; ejaculation; behaviour; spine macrophage; testes; milk; colostrum</field><field name="subject">Transforming growth factors-beta.</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Genetics.</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Reproduction.</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Fertility.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role and optimal timing of flexible bronchoscopy and broncho-alveolar lavage chemokine measurement in severely immunocompromised febrile neutropenic patients.</field><field name="creator">Liew, Chien-Li</field><field name="description">Respiratory infection remains a leading cause of morbidity and death in severely immunocompromised febrile neutropenic haematology patients, despite the introduction of numerous prophylactic strategies and advances in diagnosis and treatment. Prognosis is improved if an organism can be isolated and specific therapy commenced as soon as possible. Current practice in this population group is to commence empirical antibiotics and perform flexible bronchoscopy (FB) if temperature does not settle or after patients develop clinical or radiological features suggesting a respiratory source. This delay may result in a lower procedural diagnostic yield due to prior or prolonged anti-microbial treatment, and increased risk of respiratory compromise and procedural complications due to advanced respiratory infections.

With this randomised, prospective trial, we aim to further define the role of FB with reference to optimal timing of the procedure and its impact on diagnostic yield, future management and complication rate. We also aim to analyse the impact of proven infection on the cytokine profile of immunocompromised patients. Methods: Patients with acute leukaemia, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) being treated with Fludarabine/ Mabthera without an obvious non-respiratory source of infection were prospectively randomised into early bronchoscopy or conventional management groups at onset of febrile neutropenia. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid chemokine levels (IP-10, RANTES, MIG, IL-8, MCP-1) were measured using a human Chemokine cytometric bead array (CBA) kit. Results: Thirty-one episodes of febrile neutropenia in 29 patients were analysed; 17 conventional and 14 early. There was an increased yield in fungal growth in the early bronchoscopy group, which was not predicted by prior clinical or radiological changes. However, this had no impact on clinical management in the short-term due to the delayed growth. Overall diagnostic yield was not significantly different between the two groups. Procedural complication rate was negligible overall and there was no difference associated with either group. IP-10 and MIG were significantly lower in those patients who had a fungal pathogen isolated, compared with those study patients who did not (175.17 vs 1157.8, p=0.03, 30.33 vs 247.8, p=0.03 respectively). IP-10 levels were higher in the conventional than early group (1253.0 vs 261.14, p = 0.035) and the study population had higher MCP-1 (734 vs 2.83, p=0.006) and IL-8 levels (606.9 vs 14.25, p=0.00655) than normal controls. Those cases with fungal infection had higher mean MCP-1, RANTES and IL-8 levels than in normal controls (844.0 vs 2.83, p=0.007; 17.5 vs 2.1, p=0.03; 156.0 vs 14.25, p=0.004). Conclusions: Early bronchoscopy as a component of the septic screen in febrile neutropenic patients was feasible and safe. A significant difference in fungal yield was seen in the early bronchoscopy group compared to conventional methods, with a negligible complication rate, but this did not result in a change in immediate clinical management or outcomes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bronchoscopy; chemokine; febrile; neutropenic; haematology</field><field name="subject">Respiratory organs Diseases Diagnosis.

It is hoped that such tests could provide a unique and important addition to the range of tests currently employed by researchers interested in these constructs. The results of five separate studies are presented across three published papers. In Paper 1-Study 1 (N = 49) a speeded computerized coding test (Symbol Digit) using the mouse as the response device was assessed. Because speeded tests are thought to be highly sensitive to response methods (Mead &amp; Drasgow, 1994) it was deemed important to first assess how a mouse response method might affect the underlying construct validity of a speeded coding test independently of whether it was game-like. Factor analytic results indicated that the computerized coding test loaded strongly on the same factor as paper-andpencil measures of Gs. For Paper 2-Study 1 (N = 68) a more computer-game-like version of Symbol Digit was developed, Space Code. Development of Space Code involved the provision of a cover story, the replacing of code symbols with &#8216;spaceship&#8217; graphics, the situating of the test within an overall &#8216;spaceship cockpit&#8217;, and numerous other graphical and aural embellishments to the task. Factor analytic results indicated that Space Code loaded strongly on a Gs factor but also on a factor comprised of visuo-spatial (Gv) ability tests. This finding was further investigated in the subsequent study. Paper 2-Study 2 (N = 74) involved a larger battery of ability marker tests and a range of additional computer-game-like elements were added to Space Code. Space Code included a scoring system, a timer with additional voice synthesized countdowns, aversive feedback for errors, and background music. Factor analysis indicated that after a general factor was extracted Space Code loaded on the same factor as paper-and-pencil measures of Gs and did not load on a factor comprised of non-speeded Gv tests. Paper 3-Study 1 (N = 74) was aimed at assessing a computer-game-like test of WM (Space Matrix) and further assessing Space Code within a broader network of tests. Space Matrix used a dual task format combining a simple version of Space Code with a visually presented memory task based on the Dot Matrix test (Miyake, Friedman, Rettinger, Shah, &amp; Hegarty, 2001). The cover story and scoring system for Space Code was expanded to incorporate this additional memory element. Factor analysis indicated that Space Matrix was loaded on the same first order factor as standard WM tests and the Raven&#8217;s Advanced Progressive Matrices (Gf). Space Code was substantially loaded on the second order factor but was weakly loaded on each of two first order factors interpreted as Gs and WM/Gf. A final study is presented (Paper 3-Study2) in which Space Code and Space Matrix was administered to a school aged sample (N=94). Space Matrix exhibited construct validity as well as predictive validity (as a predictor of school grades), while results for Space Code were less encouraging. Space Matrix and Raven&#8217;s Progressive Matrices showed comparable relationships to school grades for Mathematics, English and Science subjects. It is concluded that the development of computer-game-like tests represents a promising new format for research and applied assessment of known cognitive abilities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognitive abilities; computer games; computer-game-like; computerised assessment; CHC; intelligence; psychological assessment</field><field name="subject">Cognition Testing.</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychological tests.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetic basis of barley black point formation.</field><field name="creator">March, Timothy</field><field name="description">Black point of barley grain refers to a discolouration of the embryo end of the grain. Historically black point has been proposed to be due to fungal colonisation of the grain. However, Koch&#8217;s postulates have yet to be satisfied. The discolouration occurs during grain fill in response to high humidity or rainfall during the grain filling period. In wheat, which is also affected by black point, the discolouration has been proposed to be due to the oxidation of phenolic acids within the grain to form discoloured end products. Within this study, two approaches were investigated in order to understand the proteins and genes associated with this disorder. Firstly, a proteomics approach enabled the identification of individual proteins associated with black point. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to compare the proteome of the husk and whole grain tissue of mature black pointed and healthy grain. Very little watersoluble protein was extracted from the husk tissue. However, a significantly larger amount of protein was extracted using a salt extraction buffer, indicating the husk proteins were mostly cell wall bound. Due to the effect of residual salt and low protein concentrations these proteins were not conducive to analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Further experiments using acid hydrolysis of the husk tissue and subsequent amino acid analysis revealed that the proteins were bound to the husk cell walls via covalent bonds. In contrast, large quantities of protein were obtained from the whole grain samples. This allowed statistically significant comparisons to be made between gels from healthy and black pointed grains. Two proteins were identified as being more abundant in black pointed grains. Mass spectrometry identified these as isoforms of barley grain peroxidase 1 (BP1). In addition, three proteins were identified as being more abundant in healthy grain. Mass spectrometry revealed these to be isoforms of the same protein with sequence similarity to a partial EST sequence from barley. Using 3' RACE the entire coding sequence of the gene was isolated which revealed that it encoded a novel putative late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein. Northern blot analysis was performed for BP1 and LEA and showed that gene expression differences could not account for the differences seen in protein quantities. Western blot analysis revealed that the LEA protein was biotinylated in vivo which is consistent with similar LEA proteins from other plant species. To further understand the role of these proteins in black point, antibodies were raised against the two proteins. Subsequent immunolocalisation studies indicated BP1 was present throughout all tissues of the grain whilst LEA was most abundant in the embryo and aleurone tissue. The second major area of investigation within this thesis was to further delineate the previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with black point in barley. Previous studies have reported QTL for black point and kernel discolouration in both barley and wheat. Comparison of the published QTL revealed a locus on the short arm of chromosome 2H to be of particular interest. To identify genes underlying this QTL the genomes of barley, wheat and rice were compared. An in silico approach showed that the QTL shared macro-synteny with rice chromosomes 4 and 7. From the rice genome sequence, barley ESTs with sequence similarity were selected. In total, 20 ESTs were selected based on two main criteria: their putative role in black point and also being evenly spread across the region of the QTL length. These QTL were mapped within the Alexis x Sloop double haploid population. This approach revealed that there was some conservation of synteny but also identified clear boundaries where synteny between barley and rice had been lost since divergence. Significantly, the additional markers mapped to this region have enabled the initial black point QTL to be reduced from approximately 30cM to 20cM. In conclusion, this study has added significant knowledge our understanding of the genetics of black point in barley through the use of two approaches. The proteomics approach has aided in understanding the biochemical processes occurring within the grain in response to black point. The comparative genetics approach has aided in understanding the genetic control of an important region of the genome influencing black point susceptibility. Combined, these findings will direct future research endeavours aimed at producing black point resistant barley cultivars.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">barley; black point; grain development</field><field name="subject">Barley -- Disease and pest resistance -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Barley -- Diseases and pests -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Barley -- Genetics.</field><field name="subject">Grain -- Disease and pest resistance -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Grain -- Diseases and pests -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Grain -- Genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On-line condition monitoring and detection of stator and rotor faults in induction motors.</field><field name="creator">Supangat, Randy</field><field name="description">Induction motors are reliable and widely used in industrialised nations. However induction motors, like any other machine, will eventually fail. If the failure is not anticipated, it can result in a significant revenue loss. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop an efficient maintenance program. The most cost-effective solution is condition-based maintenance. An effective condition-based maintenance program requires an on-line condition monitoring system that can diagnose the condition of an induction motor in order to determine the types of faults and their severity while the motor is under a normal operating condition. The work in this thesis investigates the detection of stator and rotor faults (i.e. shorted turn faults, eccentricity faults, and broken rotor bar faults) using three types of sensor signals (i.e. current, leakage flux, and vibration) under different loading conditions. The work is based on an extensive series of sensor measurements taken using a number of nominally identical healthy machines (2.2 kW) and custom-modified machines (2.2 kW) with configurable stator and rotor fault settings. The thesis starts by investigating the estimation of rotor speed and rotor slot number. These two parameters are important in determining the fault frequency components that are used for detecting the stator and rotor faults. The rotor speed investigation compares four different estimation methods from the three different sensor signal types. It is found that the speed estimation techniques based on the eccentricity harmonics and the rotor frequency in the stator current, the axial leakage flux, and the motor vibration sensor signals can detect the rotor speed very accurately even when the load is as low as 2%. Similarly, this thesis proposes three different rotor slot number estimation techniques from the three different types of sensors and demonstrates that all three techniques can estimate the rotor slot number accurately. In addition, it is shown that the reliability of the estimation techniques can be increased significantly when the three techniques are combined. The shorted turn investigation in this thesis examines and compares potential shorted turn features in the three sensor signal types under five different fault severities and ten different loading conditions. The useful shorted turn features are identified in the thesis, and then examined against variations between the healthy machines in order to determine the loads and the fault severities in which the feature can reliably detect the faults. The results show that the feature based on the EPVA (extended Park&#8217;s vector approach) is the best method. This feature can detect turn to turn faults with a severity of 3.5% or greater at loads greater than 20% and phase to phase turn faults with a severity of 1.7% or greater under all loading conditions. However, estimating the fault severity is generally found to be difficult. The thesis also examines the feasibility of detecting static eccentricity faults using the different types of sensor signals under ten different loading conditions. The thesis compares potential eccentricity features under nine different fault severities. The useful features are identified and then combined through weighted linear combination (WLC) in order to produce a better eccentricity fault indicator. The indicator begins to show significant magnitude variation when the fault severity is greater than or equal to 25% and the load is greater than or equal to 25%. The experimental results show that detecting the static eccentricity faults is possible but estimating the fault severity may be difficult. Furthermore, the effects of misalignment faults on the useful eccentricity features are investigated. In this thesis, the analysis of broken rotor bar faults is performed under motor starting and rundown operation. The starting analysis introduces a new approach to detect broken rotor bar faults that utilises the wavelet transform of the envelope of the starting current waveform. The results of the wavelet transform are then processed in order to develop a normalised parameter, called the wavelet indicator. It is found that the wavelet indicator can detect a single broken bar under all loading conditions during motor starting operation. The indicator also increases its magnitude as the severity of the fault increases. On the other hand, the rundown analysis proposes several broken rotor bar fault detection techniques which utilise the induced voltage in the stator windings and the stator magnetic flux linkage after supply disconnection. The experimental results show that detecting the faults during rundown is generally difficult. However, the wavelet approach, which is based on monitoring changes in the motor torque for a given slip, seems to give the best result.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">condition monitoring; fault detection; induction motors; signal processing</field><field name="subject">Electric motors, Induction.</field><field name="subject">Electric motors, Induction -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Electric fault location.</field><field name="subject">Signal processing.</field><field name="subject">Machinery -- Monitoring.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In situ stress and overpressures of Brunei Darussalam</field><field name="creator">Tingay, Mark Robert Paul</field><field name="description">ix, 271 leaves : ill.

Brother Nation is set in Australia at the beginning of the twenty-first century, a time of great political and social change. The novel explores ambiguities in issues of race, crime and moral justice through the eyes of an adolescent who comes of age amidst a chain of disturbing events. Omar Assaf is a sensitive sixteen-year-old with a problem&#8212;he needs to lose his virginity. However, like most boys his age, he is anxious and naive about matters of sex and love. When a young female friend, Belle, rejects his romantic overtures, Omar is crushed. He rapidly falls under the corrupting influence of his older brother, Sam, and Sam&#8217;s motley band of miscreant friends. Fuelled by drugs, alcohol and pornography, the boys roam the migrant suburbs of southwest Sydney, alleviating their boredom and frustration by flirting with crime, cruising in cars and pursuing girls. However, Omar soon learns that being involved with Sam and the boys has dangerous consequences. In compensating for his sense of emasculation, Omar finds himself taking part in a series of attacks, including a betrayal of Belle. Though ambivalent about and at times sickened by his complicity, Omar realises much too late that he and his brother have entered a theatre where their fate will be determined by broader, more powerful forces than he could ever have imagined. The exegesis charts the creation of Brother Nation via the author&#8217;s movement from a mode of autopoiesis to allopoiesis, through the practice of narrative research. That is, the essay is structured to illustrate how the process of researching the novel resulted in the production of knowledge external to the creative work itself. In doing this I discuss the genesis of the idea to write the novel, the basis and modes of my narrative research, the style of the finished work in relation to the genre of the &#8216;faction&#8217; or &#8216;non-fiction novel&#8217;, and the internal and external conflicts that arose in relation to the representation of demonised Arabic Other characters in the story. I also contextualise the work in relation to other relevant fiction and non-fiction texts that address similar subject matter, and make a case for holding a non-essentialised notion of cultural identity regarding my own speaking position. In particular, this exegesis investigates problematic questions in relation to representations of contemporary characters with an immigrant Other background; and, via the framework of Bakhtinian theories of dialogism and heteroglossia, considers the extent to which seemingly incompatible moral viewpoints can be coherently instantiated in fiction through a multiplicity of characters&#8217; voices.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative writing; representations of the Other; other, otherness; othered; media representations; dialogic fiction; dialogism; protest masculinity; racialisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investing in resources to create customer value: the organisational, strategic and performance implications.</field><field name="creator">Zubac, Angelina</field><field name="description">This qualitative, case-based study examined how managers conceptualise customer value and translate customer learning into customer value creating processes. The study considered a sample of high and low performing firms operating in non-dynamic and dynamic market environments to investigate market and firm-level effects. It was found regardless of whether a firm operates in a non-dynamic or dynamic market environment, managers approach customer value as a time dependent and tridimensionally construct. In order to operationalise customer value, managers need to constantly consider: 1. The attributes or benefits that are embedded in or customers can associate with the firm&#8217;s products and services, 2. The consequences achieved by customers when using or being provided with the firm&#8217;s products and services, and 3. The goals and purposes which are achieved by customers after they use or received the firm&#8217;s products and services. In other words, in order to create optimal levels of customer value, managers must be able to map the configuration of activities that need to be undertaken at the firm to the configuration of commercial and assurance-based benefits customers want to have delivered to them through the firm&#8217;s products and services at different points in time. They must then be able to map these activities and benefits to the combination of resources that can realise them. This includes the combination of dynamic capabilities which the firm uses to develop products and services that can help customers cope with change and have their idiosyncratic problems addressed. However, it was found that firms that operate in dynamic market environments tend to invest in and develop more structured and ordered approaches to customer learning than the firms that operate in non-dynamic market environments. They also rely more on bottom-up/top down decision-making processes to develop the firm&#8217;s customer value delivery strategy than firms that operate in non-dynamic market environments. Firms that operate in non-dynamic market environments tend to use top-down decisionmaking processes and are more likely to lever off their strategic planning processes to develop their customer value delivery strategy than firms that operate in dynamic market environments. Consistent with these findings and the RBV literature, it was found that the high performing firms were better at creating value for their target customers across three customer value dimensions. Their managers were also better at identifying when it was in everyone&#8217;s best interests to differentiate between customer groups, and integrate and link critical customer learning and decision-making processes. This includes processes that promote strategic and operational forms of customer learning, and continual customer value learning and performance tracking. In summary, the study demonstrated that heterogeneous firm performance can be explained by the way managers at different firms are able to conceptualise customer value, how they develop their customer value delivery strategies, and their differing abilities to integrate key customer value learning and decision-making processes. Moreover, it demonstrated that a firm is more likely to sustain a competitive advantage and be persistently high performing if it develops a core customer value learning and customer value delivery competency.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strategy; resource-based view; customer value</field><field name="subject">Customer relations -- Management.</field><field name="subject">Customer loyalty.</field><field name="subject">Business planning.</field><field name="subject">Strategic planning -- Management.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50872</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A longitudinal study of dental arch dimensions in Australian aboriginals using 2D and 3D digital imaging methods.</field><field name="creator">Thiyagarajan, Ramya</field><field name="description">This study investigated arch dimension changes associated with growth and tooth wear in Australian Aboriginals aged from age 8 to 15 years using 2D and 3D digital imaging systems. Serial dental casts of Australian Aboriginals from Yuendumu were used in the study. The sample comprised 25 females and 24 males for whom casts were available at ages of 8, 12 and 15 years ( a total of 294 dental study casts). The primary method of data acquisition involved obtaining digital photographs and digitizing the images using an Apple IIGS computer and customised software program. A subset of 40 dental stone models (5 individuals at ages 8, 12, 15 and 18 years) were duplicated and scanned using the Minolta Vivid 900 laser surface scanner at the DSIRO Laboratories, National University Singapore. The 3-D images were digitised using the Rapidform software package (Inus, technology, Seoul, Korea). Study variables included mesiodistal crown diameters, arch widths, arch depths and arch lengths. Mesiodistal crown dimensions in males tended to be larger than those in females. All arch dimensions were significantly larger in males than females. Upper and lower Intercanine width increased from age 8 to age 12 years but did not change thereafter. Upper and lower intermolar widths increased with age from 8 years to 15 years while arch depth decreased. No significant reduction in arch lengths was found from age 12 to 15 years. The two imaging systems were comparable in their measurement reliability, although the 2D method provided consistently larger crown diameters than the 3D method. Changes in arch dimensions with age in the Aboriginal sample were similar to those reported for other populations. However, no measurable change was detected in arch length over time, even though the Aboriginals had abrasive diets that would be expected to contribute to interproximal wear. It was concluded that the 2D and 3D imaging methods were suitable for clinical use but would require further refinement for research projects aimed at assessing minor changes in arch lengths associated with interproximal wear.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tooth width; attrition; arch dimension; 2D, 3D imaging; study models</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">Dental arch.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor receptors in colorectal cancer.</field><field name="creator">Brierley, Gemma Victoria</field><field name="description">The IGF system is a crucial regulator of normal growth and development, however dysregulation of the system on multiple levels is associated with the incidence of a wide variety of malignancies including the breast, thyroid, lung, and colon, making the IGF system an important anti-cancer therapeutic target. Due to its role in mediating cellular proliferation, protection from apoptosis, and metastasis, traditional focus has been set on examining the role of the type 1 IGF receptor [IGF1R] in cancer. However there is mounting evidence to suggest the insulin receptor [IR] may also be involved in the potentiation and pathogenesis of cancers. The observation that IGF-II is overexpressed, compared to normal tissues, by cancers suggests signaling via target receptors by this ligand has important implications on cancer pathogenesis. Indeed, both the IGF1R and IR have been demonstrated to be up-regulated in a variety of malignancies. In regards to IR isoform, the IGF-II binding IR-A is preferentially expressed by a number of cancer cell types. Together with the observation that an autocrine proliferative loop exists between IGF-II and the IR-A in malignant thyrocytes and cultured breast cancer cells, suggests signaling via the IR-A may play a role in cancer cell growth and survival. However, very few studies on the IR-A have been conducted in cells co-expressing the IGF1R. This is mainly due to the difficulties associated with discrimination between signaling arising from IGF1R homodimers, IR-A homodimers, and IGF1R/IR-A hybrid receptors. It is not known how the IR-A interacts, and functions in conjunction with the other receptors of the IGF system to signal biologically relevant outcomes, especially in terms of anti-cancer therapeutics that aim to block and down-regulate the IGF1R. Current anti-cancer therapies targeting the IGF system have concentrated on blocking IGF signaling via the IGF1R, due mostly to the functional properties of the receptor, but also in part due to the metabolic consequences associated with blockade and inhibition of the IR. This individual targeting of the IGF1R potentially leaves a pathway by which IGF-II secreted by the tumour can circumvent current IGF1R based therapies. Consequently, this thesis investigated whether the IR-A could compensate for the targeted loss of the IGF1R and how the IR-A interacts with the IGF1R in cells co-expressing these two receptors. In addition, the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation was assessed. The main experimental techniques used throughout this body of work included; assessment of protein expression and activation by Western blot, siRNA mediated gene silencing, and measures of cell proliferation, survival, and migration. The key areas of investigation included: 1. Investigation of the individual ability of the IR isoforms to signal biological outcomes in response to IGF stimulation 2. Identification of an appropriate cell line model in which to investigate the interactions between the IR-A and IGF1R 3. Optimisation of siRNA mediated knock-down of the IR-A and IGF1R in SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells 4. Determination of the biological role of the IR-A in SW480 cells co-expressing the IGF1R The key findings from this work included: 1. The IR-A could not compensate for IGF1R depletion in SW480 cells 2. Dual silencing of the IR-A and IGF1R indicated signaling via the IGF1R was dominant to signaling via the IR-A in SW480 cells 3. Signaling via IR-A/IGF1R hybrid receptors may not be as potent as signaling via IGF1R homodimers 4. IGF-I at physiological concentrations can stimulate biological responses via both isoforms of the IR.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin-like growth factors; cancer; colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Cell receptors.</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Rectum Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Threshold photo-ionisation and density functional theory studies of metal-carbide clusters.</field><field name="creator">Dryza, Viktoras</field><field name="description">Neutral gas-phase metal-carbide clusters are generated by laser ablation and are detected in the constructed time-of-flight mass-spectrometer by laser ionisation. Photo-ionisation efficiency (PIE) experiments are performed on the metal-carbide clusters to determine their ionisation potentials (IPs). Complimentary density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed on the energetically favorable structural isomers of the metalcarbide clusters. Comparison between the calculated IPs of the isomers and the experimental IP allows the carrier of the observed ionisation onset for a metal-carbide cluster to be assigned. The niobium-carbide clusters Nb&#8323;Cy (y = 0&#8211;4), Nb&#8324;Cy (y = 0&#8211;6) and Nb&#8325;Cy (y = 0&#8211;6) are examined by PIE experiments and DFT calculations. The IPs of the niobium-carbide clusters are found to be either left reasonably unchanged from the IPs of the bare metal clusters or moderately reduced. The clusters Nb&#8323;C&#8322;, Nb&#8324;C&#8324;, Nb&#8325;C&#8322; and Nb&#8325;C&#8323; display the largest IP reductions for their corresponding cluster series. The structures assigned to the IPs of the Nb&#8323;Cy (y = 1&#8211;3) clusters are based on the carbon atoms attaching to the niobium faces and/or niobium-niobium edges of the triangular Nb&#8323; cluster. However, for Nb&#8323;C&#8324; the ionisation onset is assigned to a low-lying isomer, which contains a molecular C&#8322; unit, rather than the lowest energy isomer, a niobium atom deficient 2&#215;2&#215;2 face-centred cubic (fcc) nanocrystal structure. The structures assigned to the IPs of the Nb&#8324;Cy (y = 1&#8211;4) clusters are based on the carbon atoms attaching in turn to the niobium faces of the tetrahedral Nb&#8324; cluster, developing a 2&#215;2&#215;2 fcc nanocrystal structure for Nb&#8324;C&#8324;. For Nb&#8324;C&#8323; two ionisation onsets are observed; one weak onset at low energy and another more intense onset at high energy. It is proposed that the two onsets are due to ionisation from both a metastable &#179;A&#8321; state and the ground &#185;A&#8321; state of the lowest energy isomer. The ionisation onsets of Nb&#8324;C&#8325; and Nb&#8324;C&#8326; are also proposed to originate from metastable triplet states of the lowest energy isomers, with the transitions from the ground singlet states calculated to be greater than the highest achievable photon energy in the laboratory. The structures of Nb&#8324;C&#8325; and Nb&#8324;C&#8326; have one and two carbon atoms in a 2&#215;2&#215;2 fcc nanocrystal substituted with molecular C&#8322; units, respectively. The structures assigned to the IPs of the Nb&#8325;Cy (y = 1&#8211;6) clusters are based on the underlying Nb&#8325; cluster being in either a &#8220;prolate&#8221; or &#8220;oblate&#8221; trigonal bipyramid geometry; the former has six niobium faces available for carbon addition, while the latter has two niobium butterfly motifs and two niobium faces available for carbon addition. Both the structures of Nb&#8325;C&#8325; and Nb&#8325;C&#8326; have the underlying Nb&#8325; cluster in the oblate trigonal bipyramid geometry and contain one and two molecular C&#8322; units, respectively. The tantalum-carbide clusters Ta&#8323;Cy (y = 0&#8211;3), Ta&#8324;Cy (y = 0&#8211;4) and Ta&#8325;Cy (y = 0&#8211;6) are examined by PIE experiments and DFT calculations. The IPs of the tantalum-carbide clusters in each series show trends that are very similar to the corresponding iso-valent niobium-carbide cluster series, although the IP reductions upon carbon addition are smaller for the former. For the vast majority of tantalum-carbide clusters, the same structural isomer is assigned to the ionisation onset as that assigned for the corresponding niobium-carbide cluster. Bimetallic tantalum-zirconium-carbide clusters are generated using a constructed double ablation cluster source. The Ta&#8323;ZrCy (y = 0&#8211;4) clusters are examined by PIE experiments and DFT calculations. The IP trend for the Ta&#8323;ZrCy cluster series is reasonably similar to that of the Ta&#8324;Cy cluster series, although the IP reductions upon carbon addition are greater for the former. The structures assigned to the IPs of the Ta&#8323;ZrCy (y = 1&#8211;4) clusters are based on the carbon atoms attaching in turn to the metal faces of the tetrahedral Ta&#8323;Zr cluster. In summary, the work presented in this thesis demonstrates that the structures of metalcarbide clusters can be inferred by the determination of their IPs through PIE experiments in combination with DFT calculations on candidate structural isomers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">laser spectroscopy; ionization potential; metal cluster; DFT; nanocrystal; isomer; met-car</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of external acoustic loadings on a launch vehicle fairing during lift-off.</field><field name="creator">Morshed, Mir Md. Maruf</field><field name="description">During the lift-off of a launch vehicle, the acoustic pressure fluctuations caused by the engine exhaust gases produce high noise levels inside the cavity of the fairing and can damage the payload inside the fairing. Hence reducing the noise transmitted into the payload bay is an important area of research. Work presented in this thesis investigates the external acoustic pressure excitations on the fairing of a launch vehicle during the lift-off acoustic environment. In particular, it investigates the external sound pressure levels in the low frequency range from 50Hz to 400Hz, on the fairing during the lift-off of a launch vehicle. This study establishes theoretical and numerical models for the prediction of external sound pressure loading on composite structures representing launch vehicles, such as a large composite cylinder referred to as a Boeing cylinder and a Representative Small Launch Vehicle Fairing (RSLVF). To predict the external sound pressure loading, various incident wave conditions were investigated, including incident plane waves, oblique plane waves and oblique plane waves with random phases that strike the circumference of the composite structures. For the theoretical model, both the incident and scattered sound pressure fields due to incident plane waves; perpendicular to an idealised long cylinder were investigated. The results show that the scattered sound pressure field plays a major role in determining the total circumferential sound pressure field at the surface of the cylinder and cannot be ignored for the launch case. The theoretical model was developed further for a point source, line source and oblique incident waves, and modified to determine the incident, scattered and total sound pressure fields away from the cylinder. The approach developed overcomes some limitations of previous analytical derivations. An experiment was undertaken to determine the sound pressure patterns at the surface of a cylinder at various frequencies due to a point source positioned at a finite distance from the cylinder surface. The experimental work confirmed the accuracy of the theoretical model for a point source at a finite distance from the cylinder. The Boundary Element Method (BEM), approach was used for the numerical investigation of the acoustic loadings. The numerical analysis was developed for various acoustic loading conditions and verified with the theoretical results, which showed that the numerical and theoretical models agree well. Both models were extended to a Boeing composite cylinder and an RSLVF for various acoustic loading conditions. The complex acoustic environment generated during the lift-off of a launch vehicle was investigated and used as a basis for the acoustic loading on an RSLVF. To predict the acoustic excitations on an RSLVF, two different source allocation techniques were investigated, which considered acoustic sources along the rocket engine exhaust flow. The investigations were conducted both numerically and analytically. Both results agree well and show that it is possible to predict the acoustic loads on the fairing numerically and analytically.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acoustic loading; launch vehicles; acoustic scattering from cylinders; BEM; boundary element method</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gastro-duodenal motility &amp; nutrition in the critically ill.</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Marianne</field><field name="description">Inadequate delivery of nutrition to the critically ill is common, and may adversely affect clinical outcomes, including survival. This thesis reports studies designed to characterise the gastrointestinal dysfunction underlying feed intolerance in the critically ill, as well as the pathophysiology of these dysfunctions, and investigate potential therapeutic measures. While it has been established that enteral nutrition is frequently unsuccessful in the critically ill, assessment of the success of feeding in an Australian intensive care unit (ICU) had not been performed previously. A prospective survey examined the incidence of, and risk factors for, feed intolerance in the ICU at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and demonstrated that, in 40 patients receiving enteral feeding, only about 60% of their nutritional requirements were met at the end of the first week. The main cause for this lack of success was large gastric residual volumes, indicative of delayed gastric emptying (GE). This study, accordingly, quantified the limitations of nutritional delivery in contemporary practice in a local ICU. The results suggest that a better understanding of the pathogenesis underlying this problem is warranted in order to direct research into improved therapies. Scintigraphy is the most accurate technique to measure GE, but is difficult to perform in the ICU. A simpler, more convenient, test would increase the accessibility of GE measurement for both research and clinical purposes. A study comparing a breath test technique and gastric residual volume measurement to the scintigraphic measurement of GE in 25 mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated that GE measured by a breath test technique closely correlated with that measured by scintigraphy. While the breath test had a specificity of 100% it only had a sensitivity of about 60% in the prediction of delayed GE. Similarly, gastric residual volume measurement correlated with scintigraphic measurement of GE but also lacked sensitivity. The breath test has previously been demonstrated to be highly reproducible and it represents a useful option for repeated measurement of GE in the same patient. It is therefore likely to be useful to determine changes in GE over time or in response to a therapeutic intervention. There is a lack of information about the prevalence and determinants of delayed GE in the critically ill. Previous studies have substantial limitations and scintigraphic measurement of GE has only rarely been used. A study comparing GE measured by scintigraphy in 25 patients to 14 healthy subjects demonstrated that GE was delayed in approximately 50% of the ICU patients (&gt;10% retention at 4h) and markedly delayed in about 20% (&gt;50% retention at 4h). Patients with trauma and sepsis appeared to have a relatively higher prevalence of delayed GE (80% and 75% respectively). In addition, the longer the patient had been in ICU the more normal the rate of GE. Quantification of delayed GE may prove useful by defining patients who may benefit from preventative or therapeutic options. The abnormalities in gastrointestinal motility underlying delayed GE in the critically ill are poorly characterised. Simultaneous manometric and gastric emptying measurements were performed in 15 mechanically ventilated patients and 10 healthy subjects. These studies demonstrated that delayed GE was associated with reduced antral activity, increased pyloric activity and increased retrograde duodenal activity in the patients. Persistent fasting motility during feeding was also frequently observed. Furthermore, the feedback response to small intestinal nutrients was enhanced. This latter observation may provide an explanation for the delayed GE and warrants further investigation. Recent studies suggest that the hormone cholecystokinin may be a mediator of increased small intestinal feedback and, if confirmed, this has clear therapeutic implications. Nutrient absorption has rarely been measured in the critically ill. GE and glucose absorption (using 3-O-methyl glucose) were measured simultaneously in 19 ICU patients and compared to 19 healthy subjects. Glucose absorption was shown to be markedly reduced in the patients. Slow GE was associated with delayed, and reduced, absorption. However, glucose absorption was also reduced in patients with normal GE suggesting that reduced glucose absorption in critical illness is only partly due to delayed GE. Accordingly, measures to improve the effectiveness of GE and thereby improve overall nutritional status may be compromised by abnormal small intestinal absorption. The mechanisms underlying this warrant further investigation. A number of therapeutic options directed at improving the delivery of nutrition were examined. In a study involving 20 mechanically ventilated patients, administration of 200mg erythromycin intravenously was shown to be superior to placebo for treating feed intolerance. The optimal dose of erythromycin, however, was unclear. In a subsequent study involving 35 ICU patients, GE was measured using a breath test technique, before and after 2 different doses of erythromycin or placebo and a &#8216;low&#8217; intravenous dose (70mg) of erythromycin appeared to be as effective as a &#8216;moderate&#8217; dose (200mg). Both doses were only effective in subjects who had delayed GE at baseline. Based on the outcome of these studies, low doses of erythromycin have subsequently been routinely used to treat feed intolerance in the critically ill patients at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Animal and human studies suggested that the antibiotic, cefazolin, may have a prokinetic effect. Cefazolin, however, did not demonstrate similar prokinetic activity at a &#8216;low&#8217; dose (50mg) in a critically ill cohort. The results of this study do not support the use of this agent, at this dose, as a prokinetic, in this population. If nasogastric administration of nutrition proves unsuccessful an alternative is to infuse nutrient directly into the small intestine. However, the placement of feeding tubes distal to the pylorus is technically difficult. A novel technique for postpyloric tube insertion was examined with promising results. In summary, the studies described in this thesis have provided a number of insights relevant to the management of the critically ill by quantifying the prevalence of feed intolerance and delayed GE, characterising some of the disturbances in gastrointestinal motility underlying this problem, and evaluating a number of therapeutic interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical illness; gastric emptying; intensive care; prokinetics; nutrition; erythromycin; gastrointestinal motility</field><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system Motility</field><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of bacterial biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis.</field><field name="creator">Psaltis, Alkis James</field><field name="description">This thesis embodies research investigating the role that bacterial biofilms play in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). It focuses on their detection on the sinus mucosa of CRS patients and the implications of their presence. Finally, it addresses deficiencies in the innate immune system that may predispose to their development in this condition. Bacterial biofilms are structural assemblages of microbial cells that encase themselves in a protective self-produced matrix and irreversibly attach to a surface. Their extreme resistance to both the immune system as well as medical therapies has implicated them as playing a potential role in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases. Although their role in many diseases is now well established, their objective presence and importance in CRS remains largely unknown. Chapter 1 of this thesis reviews the current literature pertaining to CRS and biofilms and critically evaluates the small body of research relating to this topic. Chapter 2 describes the development of a sheep model to study the role of bacterial biofilms in rhinosinusitis. It compares the use of traditional electron microscopy (EM) and more recent confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) in the detection of biofilms on the surface of sinus mucosa. The results of this study inferred a causal relationship between biofilms and the macroscopic changes that accompany rhinosinusitis. Furthermore it illustrated the superiority that CSLM has over EM in the imaging of biofilms on sinus mucosa Chapter 3 and 4 outline the results of human studies utilizing the more objective CSLM to evaluate the prevalence of bacterial biofilms on the sinus mucosa of CRS patients and their effect on post-operative mucosal healing. The results of these studies demonstrated a biofilm prevalence of approximately 50% in the CRS population studied and suggested, that biofilm presence may predispose to adverse post-operative outcomes following sinus surgery. Chapter 5 and 6 describe experiments examining the level of the innate immune system&#8217;s anti-biofilm peptide lactoferrin, in patients with CRS. Lactoferrin was found to be downregulated at both an mRNA and protein level in the majority of CRS patients, with biofilm positive patients demonstrating the most significant reduction. In summary, this thesis provides further evidence that bacterial biofilms play a major role in the pathogenesis and disease persistence in a subset of CRS patients. Deficiencies in components of the innate immune system, such as lactoferrin, may play an important role in the predisposition of certain individuals to the initial development of bacterial biofilms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biofilms; chronic rhinosinusitis; lactoferrin</field><field name="subject">Sinusitis</field><field name="subject">Biofilms</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ca&#178;&#8314; and phosphoinositides regulations in &#945;-actinin -4 F-actin binding.</field><field name="creator">Chen, Huang-Hui</field><field name="description">&#945;-actinin-4 is a non-muscle isoform of &#945;-actinin that belongs to the spectrin superfamily. It comprises three functional regions: an N-terminal actin-binding region that consists of two calponin homology (CH) domains, a central region that consists of four copies of the spectrin-like repeat domain and a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain that is predicted to bind Ca&#178;&#8314;. &#945;-actinin-4 is organised as an antiparallel homodimer formed by the interaction of four spectrin-like repeats between the two monomers, giving a rod-like shape, with actin binding regions at both ends. &#945;-actinin-4 is an abundant actin-bundling protein, which provides a direct link between actin filaments and integrins, and is believed to play an important role in stabilising cell shape and adhesion and regulating cell migration. It also acts as a tumor suppressor and influences the metastatic potential and invasiveness in human cancers. A cluster of three actin binding motifs have been identified in the CH domains (2X CH) from other members of the spectrin superfamily, utrophin and dystrophin. Two of them reside in the CH1 domain and the third resides in the first &#945;-helix of the CH2 domain. In addition, a PIP2 binding site has been mapped on a region adjacent to actin-binding site-3. These observations imply the F-actin binding activity would be regulated by phosphoinositides. Five mutations of &#945;-actinin-4, K122N, an alternative splice variant, K255E, T259I and S263P, have been reported to be involved in three human diseases, non-small lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The mutation site within these mutants is located on the actin binding region. Therefore, the actin binding region is presumed to be associated with the progression of human disease. The aims of this thesis focused on the regulation of the F-actin binding activity of &#945;-actinin-4 by phosphoinositides (PIP2 and PIP3), the calmodulin-like domain and Ca&#178;&#8314; , determination of the three-dimensional structure of the CH2 domain in solution and identification of the phosphoinositide binding site on the CH2 domain. In order to investigate the F-actin binding activity quantitatively, a novel in vitro F-actin binding assay (solid phase) was established to replace the semi-quantitative actin bundling assay. Using this novel solid phase F-actin binding assay, Ca&#178;&#8314; was shown to enhance the F-actin binding activity of &#945;-actinin-4 in a concentration-dependent manner. The presence of 10 mM Ca&#178;&#8314; results in a two-fold increase in the F-actin binding activity. Both PIP2 and PIP3 inhibited the F-actin-binding activity of &#945;-actinin-4 in a concentration-dependent manner with an approximate IC&#8325;&#8320; of 75 and 45 &#956;M, respectively. In order to characterise how phosphoinositides regulated the F-actin binding activity of &#945;-actinin-4, the solution structure of &#945;-actinin-4 CH2 domain was determined and the phosphoinositide binding residues within the CH2 domain were identified using NMR spectroscopy. The solution structure of &#945;-actinin-4 CH2 domain contained six &#945;-helices and was similar to that of other spectrin superfamily members. The strategy used in identification of the phosphoinositide binding site was an NMR-based 2D &#185;H-&#185;&#8309;N HSQC ligand titration assay to replace the traditional semi-quantitative protein-lipid overlay assay. Using the NMR-based ligand titration assay, the recognition site for the inositol head group resides in residues Trp 172, Tyr 265 and His 266 and the binding region of acyl chains resides in the first &#945;-helix structure which is one of the putative F-actin binding sites. In order to examine the interaction of phosphoinositides with this site, Y265A and H266E mutants of &#945;-actinin-4 CH2 domain were generated using site-directed mutagenesis and verified the interaction with phosphoinositides and the inositol head group using an NMR-based ligand titration assay. These results confirmed the phosphoinositide binding site on the CH2 domain and residues, Tyr 265 and His 266, are critical for interacting with phosphoinositides. Wildtype and mutants (Y265A and H266E) of &#945;-actinin-4 were expressed in mammalian cells as EGFP-fusion proteins. Wildtype &#945;-actinin-4 was shown to be co-localised with focal adhesions and actin stress fibres. However, Y265A and H266E mutants of &#945;-actinin-4 were co-localised with actin stress fibres but poorly co-localised with focal adhesions. Moreover, both Y265A and H266E mutants of &#945;-actinin-4 were co-localised with actin in the cytoplasm rather than localised along the cell membrane after EGF stimulation for 30 minutes. These results suggested that PIP2 assists the co-localisation of &#945;-actinin-4 with focal adhesions. Taken together, the results described in this thesis concluded that Ca&#178;&#8314; enhanced the F-actin binding activity of &#945;-actinin-4 in vitro. However, phosphoinositides (PIP2 or PIP3) inhibited the F-actin binding activity in vitro. Moreover, the results described in this thesis provided a phosphoinositide binding site on &#945;-actinin-4 CH2 domain. Binding to PIP2 is important to the localisation of &#945;-actinin-4 in focal adhesions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alpha-actinin-4; calponin homology-2; domain; phosphoinositides; calcium</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using shell morphology to characterise abalone populations across multiple spatial scales.</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Thor M.</field><field name="description">Many sedentary marine invertebrates have a fine-scale (100s m) population structure that complicates their conservation and management. This is a consequence of the limited information on the boundaries between component populations and the biological variability among them. Blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) form discrete populations many of which are &#8216;stunted&#8217; with individuals reaching a maximum length less than those in adjacent areas. A range of morphological measurements from samples of stunted and &#8216;non-stunted&#8217; H. rubra collected from sites spread across broad (10s km) and fine (100s m) spatial scales in southern South Australia. In addition, information on the growth, size at maturity and fecundity of H. rubra was obtained from these same sites. The ratio between shell length and shell height showed clear and significant differences among samples from stunted and non-stunted sites. The fine-scale morphometric collections suggested that stunted populations existed at smaller spatial scales compared to those for non-stunted populations. Spatial variation in these key life history parameters could primarily be attributed to differences between stunted and non-stunted sites. Relationships between each of these parameters and the ratio between shell length and shell height were also examined. The spatial patterns in morphology and biology were highly correlated suggesting that shell length:shell height ratio can be used as a simple &#8216;morphometric marker&#8217; to distinguish among populations of abalone and identify their biological characteristics. The detection of differences H. rubra morphology among variable environments cannot determine whether these differences represent a plastic response to the local environment, or whether morphology is genetically fixed. A reciprocal transplant experiment was used to test whether stunted H. rubra are the result of a plastic response to the environment or fixed genetic trait. Furthermore, environmental factors that affect food availability were related to differences in morphology. Morphological plasticity was confirmed as the mechanism causing morphological variation in H. rubra. Individuals transplanted to sites with non-stunted H. rubra grew significantly faster when compared to stunted controls, while individuals transplanted to stunted sites grew significantly slower compared to non-stunted controls. It is suggested that these differences are related to resource availability with areas limited in food supply resulting in stunted populations and areas with abundant food resulting in non-stunted populations. To reduce the risks of over-fishing and localised depletion of H. rubra, management units (MUs) that encompass individual populations need to be determined and then managed according to their life-history characteristics. Potential MUs in the South Australian abalone fishery were identified from the broad-scale, spatial distribution of stunted and non-stunted populations of H. rubra, by applying the morphometric marker to commercial shell samples. Key life-history parameters of the H. rubra populations within the potential MUs were estimated using relationships between this marker and H. rubra biology. Data from fine-scale systematic sampling by commercial fishers were used to validate spatial patterns observed from the more broadly distributed commercial catch samples. The location, distribution and size of potential MUs were largely inconsistent with that of current management. The locations of two MUs were consistent across the broad- and fine-scale datasets with the fine-scale samples being more informative for identifying a potential boundary between these. These results suggest that this morphometric marker can used as a tool for the spatial management of abalone fisheries by simply and inexpensively inferring key biological parameters for individual populations and identify the boundaries among these based on these differences. This approach is among the first to provide a practical means of more closely aligning the scales of assessment and management with biological reality for sedentary marine invertebrates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">morphology; population structure; fisheries management; biological variation; spatial management; morphometric marker</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gravity wave coupling of the lower and middle atmosphere.</field><field name="creator">Love, Peter Thomas</field><field name="description">A method of inferring tropospheric gravity wave source characteristics from middle atmosphere observations has been adapted from previous studies for use with MF radar observations of the equatorial mesosphere-lower thermosphere at Christmas Island in the central Pacific. The nature of the techniques applied also permitted an analysis of the momentum flux associated with the characterised sources and its effects on the equatorial mean flow and diurnal solar thermal tide. An anisotropic function of gravity wave horizontal phase speed was identified as being characteristic of convectively generated source spectra. This was applied stochastically to a ray-tracing model to isolate numerical estimates of the function parameters. The inferred spectral characteristics were found to be consistent with current theories relating convective gravity wave spectra to tropospheric conditions and parameters characterising tropical deep convection. The results obtained provide observational constraints on the model spectra used in gravity wave parameterisations in numerical weather prediction and general circulation models. The interaction of gravity waves with the diurnal solar thermal tide was found to cause an amplification of the tide in the vicinity of the mesopause. The gravity wave-tidal interactions were highly sensitive to spectral width and amplitude. Estimates were made of the high frequency gravity wave contribution to forcing the MSAO with variable results.

The prospect of characterising the genetic makeup of individuals or trace samples from a wide variety of depositional and post-mortem circumstances raises the question of how reliable the methods are given the potential for prolonged exposure to variation in environmental factors, i.e. temperature, pH, UV irradiation and humidity, that are known to induce damage to DNA. Thus, it is crucial to verify the validity of the DNA profiling for characterising the genetic makeup of post-mortem tissues. This project aimed to assess the reliability of sequence and microsatellite based genotyping of tissues (muscle, hair and bone) sampled from carcasses over a two year post-mortem period. This assessment investigated the impact of environment induced DNA degradation in the local geographic region that is typical of the circumstances that confront forensic practitioners in southern Australia and to utilise rigorous controls by studying animals whose time of death and burial was known and for which we had pre-decay tissue samples available. A &#8216;body farm&#8217; with 12 pig carcasses on the northern Adelaide plains, ~60km north of Adelaide, which has a typical southern Australian Mediterranean climate, i.e. cold wet winters and hot dry summers. Pigs (Sus scrofa) were used as an experimental analogue for human subjects because of the logistical and ethical reasons. The pig carcasses were allocated among three treatments: four were left on the surface, four were buried at 1m depth, and four were buried at 2 m depth. These &#8216;burial&#8217; conditions mimic a range of conditions encountered typically in forensic and archaeological studies. Cortical bone samples were taken from each pig carcass at one week, one month, three months, six months, one year and two years post-mortem and muscle and hair over the same sampling period for as long as those tissue types were present. A set of PCR primers to amplify two (short and a long) fragments from the hypervariable part of the mitochondrial control region (HVRI) that is used in forensic and evolutionary studies of humans and many other mammal species were developed. Also a panel of four pig microsatellite loci with fluorescent labels to facilitate automated multiplex genotyping. These loci matched as closely as possible the core motifs and allele lengths typical of the commercially available microsatellite marker kits used in Australian forensic science labs so that our experiments were as good a model as possible of the human forensic DNA technology. In this study it was possible to retrieve samples from muscle tissue up to 90 days, hair up to one year and bone at two years post-mortem. The analyses showed that the long and short HVRI region PCR fragments were only amplifiable up to 30 days from muscle tissue and that these fragments were amplifiable up to one year from hair. In contrast, in cortical bone both PCR fragments were amplifiable up to two years. The long fragment disappeared in muscle tissue completely after 30 days and in hair after six months. However, the long fragment was present in cortical bone even at two years. Overall, there was a general trend of loss of concentration of both the long and short fragments over time. Comparisons of the HVRI nucleotide sequences among tissues sampled from individual animals showed substitution changes in muscles as early as 30 days (3 out of 6 individuals) and hair at six months (1 out of 6 individuals). In contrast, in cortical bone substitutions first appeared at 365 days (1 out of 6 individuals). The most common substitution observed in all tissues types was the C-T transition, with A-G transversions observed in two episodes and C-A transversion observed in one episode. Analyses of microsatellite genotypes in muscle tissues showed high allele peaks on chromatograms up to day seven samples. However, by three months PCR was not successful from muscle tissue. While, bone tissue had lower allele peak heights compared to the muscle tissues, alleles were detectable up to six months. Allele drop out occurred for one animal (at 2 meters) in muscle tissue at the dinucleotide locus and for another animal (kept on surface) also in muscle tissue at a tetranucleotide locus. Stuttering was observed for a single animal at dinucleotide locus in muscle tissue (buried sample 2 meter depth). No stuttering or allele drop outs were seen in the bone tissue. Overall the four loci completely disappeared after 30 days in muscle tissue and after 180 days in bone tissue. In summary, analyses showed that post-mortem DNA degradation was present in all the three tissue types (muscle, hair and bone). The types of damage identified were DNA fragmentation, nucleotide substitutions and DNA loss, which resulted in a diminished frequency of successful PCR for mitochondrial and nuclear markers over time and stuttering and allele drop out in microsatellite genotyping. In addition, two nucleotide substitutions were concentrated in &#8216;hotspots&#8217; that correlate with sites of elevated mutation rate in vivo. Also the frequency of successful PCR of longer nuclear and mitochondrial PCR products declined markedly more quickly than for shorter products. These changes were first observed at much shorter post mortem intervals in muscle and much longer post mortem intervals in hair and bone tissue. When considering the carcass deposition treatments, tissues that were retrieved from buried carcases showed higher levels of DNA degradation compared to tissues retrieved from carcases left on the surface. Overall, muscle tissue is a good source for DNA analysis in immediate post mortem samples, whereas hair and bone tissue are good source for DNA analysis from older samples. When comparing the microsatellite genotyping and mtDNA analyses, mtDNA is a reliable source for DNA analysis from tissue recovered from bodies that had decayed for longer post-mortem durations such as months to years, whereas microsatellite genotyping gives reliable results for tissue from shorter post mortem intervals (hours to few days). Therefore it is recommended that when analysing mtDNA sequences, cloning and sequencing PCR products can help to identify the base pair substitutions especially for tissue retrieved from longer post mortem intervals. In addition, increasing the template DNA concentrations and "neutralising" co-extracted DNA inhibitors should be considered when dealing with tissue from longer post mortem intervals. Finally, the more stringent protocols used in ancient DNA studies should be considered when dealing with tissue with much longer post mortem intervals in forensic settings.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA; DNA profiling; DNA degradation; DNA decay; environmental effects</field><field name="subject">DNA fingerprinting -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Forensic anthropology -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Forensic genetics -- Technique.</field><field name="subject">DNA -- Analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impacts of financial development on economic activities in Vietnam.</field><field name="creator">Phan, Nguyen Dinh</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impacts of financial development on economic activities in Vietnam at both the macro and the micro level in three core chapters. The first core chapter examines the role of financial development in growth and sources of growth in Vietnam by using the provincial panel data. It shows that financial development has a positive influence on the efficiency of using savings, on the quantity and quality of investment, on productivity, and hence growth. It also finds that there is an indirect impact of financial development on growth mainly through increasing the quality of foreign direct investment rather than the quantity. The following chapter analyses the determinants of household financial development and its role in economic activities of Vietnamese households by using the Household Data Survey. It suggests that the social relationship, location, fixed assets, household size, education, age and Kinh group are the key determinants of household financial development. Moreover, financial development contributes to household income through improving the level of savings and investment, labour productivity and reducing the problem of asymmetric information. Financial development is positively related to household welfare. The final core chapter looks at the impacts of financial development on firm performance in Vietnam by using the Firm Data Survey. It suggests that around 80.7% of Vietnamese firms lie between 0% and 20% in the efficiency scores derived from the DEA technique for 1,886 firms. Financial development plays a key role in firm performance. Smaller firms benefit more from the higher level of financial development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">financial development; growth; savings; investment; productivity; Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Economic development Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Vietnam Economic conditions 1975-</field><field name="subject">Vietnam Social conditions 1975-</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for holistic sustainability: a study of the &#8217;process&#8217; in Kerala (India) and Sweden.</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Vigya</field><field name="description">Numerous attempts have been undertaken to deliver a common understanding of the concept of sustainability. Most of these attempts however, have remained contested and ineffective. Weak conceptualisation has also affected the process of operationalisation of sustainability. This thesis addresses the above issues by firstly, interpreting sustainability and its underlying principles from a perspective that draws together social, economic, environmental, cultural, and institutional conditions and cross-linkages. Secondly, and more importantly, the research focuses on &#8216;how&#8217; to operationalise sustainability across different regions. In doing so, the research acknowledges the significance of planning pathways in the process of achieving sustainability. The research has been conducted using two case studies that critically examine the effectiveness of contemporary sustainability planning processes in Kerala (India) and Sweden. A total of 42 in-depth interviews, three focus group discussions and several participant observations have contributed to primary data collection for the two case studies. The research has developed a set of &#8216;substantive&#8217; and &#8216;process&#8217; criteria based on which planning efficacy in Kerala and Sweden has been evaluated. By focusing on the &#8216;how&#8217; and &#8216;why&#8217; rather than the &#8216;what&#8217; aspects of the sustainability problematique, the research findings contribute new knowledge that reduces the chasm between theory and practice with regard to operationalising holistic sustainability. The research also demonstrates that despite significant differences between social, economic and environmental settings, planning for sustainability in both Kerala and Sweden largely exhibits similar behavioural patterns. For instance, both regions suggest the importance of public participation and community engagement in achieving sustainability while planning process in both cases suffer from lack of integration between different components, issues and discourses and weak mechanisms of plan evaluation and feedback generation. The research thus argues that the division of the world into the developing South and the developed North does not affect the process of operationalising sustainability in any significant way. Finally, the thesis highlights implications of sustainability planning on policymaking and identifies priorities for governance that better reflect the complexity underlying sustainability operationalisation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">planning; sustainability; operationalisation</field><field name="subject">Planning -- Sweden.</field><field name="subject">Planning -- Kerala (India)</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development -- Sweden.</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development -- Kerala (India)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of compressive cyclic loading on the retention of cast crown copings cemented to implant abutments.</field><field name="creator">Dudley, James</field><field name="description">Summary Background The cementation of crowns to dental implant abutments is an accepted form of crown retention that requires consideration of the properties of available cements within the applied clinical context. Most current dental cements were developed primarily for use with natural tooth crowns, but must act in a different manner with implant components. Cements are exposed to a number of stressors that may reduce crown retention in vivo, not the least of which is occlusal loading. This study investigated the influence of compressive cyclic loading on the physical retention of cast crown copings cemented to implant abutments. Method Cast crown copings were cemented to Straumann synOcta titanium implant abutments with three different readily used and available cements. Specimens were placed in a humidifier, thermocycled and subjected to one of four quantities of compressive cyclic loading. The uniaxial tensile force required to remove the cast crown copings was then recorded. Data analysis was conducted using two-way ANOVA and paired post tests. Results Statistical analysis arising from post tests following two-way ANOVA testing revealed the mean retention values for crown copings cemented with Panavia-F cement (5.103, 2.681, 3.178, 2.986MPa) were statistically significantly greater than both KetacCem (0.646, 0.701, 1.083, 0.914MPa) and TempBond non&#8211;eugenol (0.074, 0.181, 0.190, 0.303MPa) cements at each compressive cyclic loading quantity. KetacCem and TempBond non&#8211;eugenol cements produced relatively low mean retention values that were not statistically significantly different at each quantity of compressive cyclic loading. Compressive cyclic loading had a statistically significant effect on Panavia-F specimens alone, but increased loading quantities produced no further statistically significant difference in mean retention. Compressive cyclic loading had no overriding statistically significant effect on the retention of all specimens as a population. Conclusions Within the limitations of the current in vitro conditions employed in this study, the retention of cast crown copings cemented to Straumann synOcta implant abutments with Panavia-F, KetacCem, and TempBond non-eugenol was significantly affected by cement type but not compressive cyclic loading. Panavia-F is the cement of choice for the definitive non-retrievable cementation of cast crown copings to Straumann synOcta implant abutments out of the three cements tested. The implications of these results relate to the choice of cement to provide the desired crown coping retention.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">implant abutments; dental cements; retention; compressive cyclic loading</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio of original compositions.</field><field name="creator">Grant, Quentin Stuart David</field><field name="description">This submission comprises a portfolio of fifteen original musical works and an exegesis that comments on five of these works.

Despite burgeoning research into accountability relatively little is known about the nature of accountability in religious organizations. The present study seeks to address this need by exploring the accountability practices of a business entity owned and operated by an Australian religious minority. This study focuses on the accountability practices of the Sanitarium Health Food Company (SHF), a food manufacturing business owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. SHF is a non-profit organization whose annual gross revenue is estimated at between A$300m to A$400m, making it one of Australia&#8217;s top earning charities. SHF provides no formal financial reporting to church members and only a handful of church elites know the financial details of this organization. As a charity SHF is not required to pay income tax; as a department of the Adventist Church it is subjected to minimal regulatory requirements and therefore justifies not disclosing its financial details to church members or the public. However, as a charity there is an expectation that the organization would detail how profits are used, the causes it supports and the extent of that support. This information has not been readily forthcoming from the organization. Church members view SHF as being an Adventist organization upholding and promoting denominational teachings, values and practices; to the public the organization presents itself as a charity promoting disinterested humanitarianism. This case study combines historical and field research methodology. It draws on archival and published material relating to the SHF and Adventist community and data from interviews with a range of stakeholders. The primary focus of the study is the period between 1970 and 2005, during which time SHF grew significantly and underwent major restructuring of its operations, management and orientation. The study reveals that while SHF presents minimal formal reporting, the organization has evolved a sophisticated socialising accountability, aimed at promoting the operation to church members as an Adventist institution and to the wider public as a mainstream charity. The study highlights that a feature of Adventist accountability relates to a unique interpretation of the notion of being accountable to God. Adventists believe in a literal investigative audit in heaven commencing in 1844. This teaching differentiates Adventists from other religious groups. The teaching provides the primary focus of Adventist accountability, motivates social action and regulates Adventist organizational behaviour. The study of SHF provides a vantage point from which to examine the role that religious beliefs play in promoting commercial activities. In the study of SHF, religious beliefs and secular business practices overlap, each reinforcing the other. The evidence presented in relation to SHF highlights a meshing of religious values and secular operations in ways that make it impossible to compartmentalise sacred and secular activities within the Adventist organization.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accountability; stewardship; business; religious organisation; secular; sacred; Sanitarium Health Food Company; Seventh-day Adventist</field><field name="subject">Seventh-Day Adventist Church -- South Pacific Division</field><field name="subject">Sanitarium Health Food Company.</field><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations -- Accounting.</field><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations -- Finance.</field><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations -- Evaluation.</field><field name="subject">Business -- Religious aspects.</field><field name="subject">Seventh-Day Adventists.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corpus callosum morphology and function in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the relationship between the corpus callosum and cognitive functioning in healthy adults.</field><field name="creator">Hutchinson, Amanda Dianne</field><field name="description">The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest fiber&#185; tract in the brain and connects homological regions of the two cerebral hemispheres. Research with split-brain patients, whose CC has been surgically severed, and neurologically intact groups has shown that the CC is important for sustained and divided attention. Due to its role in attention, the CC is of interest to clinical conditions in which attention is affected, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although the size of the CC has been examined in children and adolescents with ADHD, the results have been inconsistent. Therefore, the first of three studies in this thesis synthesized the current research in a metaanalysis, which analyzed the data from 13 studies that examined CC area in children and adolescents with ADHD, when compared to healthy controls. This study found that the splenium, the most posterior region of the CC, was smaller in ADHD and the rostral body, an anterior region, was smaller in boys with ADHD compared with controls. Thus, there is evidence for differences in area in both the anterior and posterior regions of the CC in ADHD. It was not known whether these differences persist into adulthood, however, because CC size had not been examined in adults with ADHD. Therefore, the second study examined CC area and structural integrity in young adults with ADHD compared with healthy controls using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), respectively. The difference in the size of the splenium was not present in this adult sample, although the genu (an anterior region of the CC) was smaller and two midposterior regions were larger in adults with ADHD when compared with controls. In addition, a reduction in the integrity of the genu and greater integrity in the splenium was found in ADHD. The relationship between CC morphology and measures of attention and IQ was also examined in young adults with ADHD and controls in order to assess the functional significance of differences in the CC. The integrity of the splenium was correlated with performance on the Stroop task, which requires attentional control. Hence, this study indicated that the morphology of the CC is atypical in young adults with ADHD and that these differences in the CC may impact on cognitive functioning. Interestingly, an estimate of performance IQ was negatively correlated with CC area in controls. This result conflicts with previous research on the relationship between IQ and the CC in healthy adults although the literature has yielded inconsistent findings. The third study, therefore, examined the relationship between IQ and both CC area and integrity in more detail in a larger sample of young adults. A negative correlation was found between the area of posterior regions of the CC and an estimate of performance IQ, while an estimate of verbal IQ was associated with decreased structural integrity in the genu. This study supports the hypothesis that differences in CC size and or integrity may have cognitive consequences. In summary, this thesis confirms the view that the development of the CC is atypical in children and young adults with ADHD. In addition, differences in CC integrity were associated with cognitive functioning in young adults with ADHD. Finally, the morphology of the CC is related to cognitive performance in healthy adults. &#185; American spelling is used throughout the thesis in order to be consistent with the published papers which have been published or prepared using American spelling.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corpus callosum; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="subject">Corpus callosum.

Following graduation from an English style mission boarding school at Chefoo in northern China, Pike came to Melbourne in 1924; and from 1926 spent twelve years jackerooing on various New South Wales country properties. He returned to Melbourne in 1938, trained for the ministry in a Churches of Christ College, graduated in November 1941, married Olive Hagger and was sent to Adelaide. During pastorates at Colonel Light Gardens and Glenelg he studied at the University of Adelaide for his BA. He achieved History Honours, resigned from the ministry, taught briefly in Adelaide and at the University of Western Australia then returned to Adelaide as Reader from 1950 to 1960. Pike obtained his MA, then the D. Litt. for Paradise of Dissent, a history of South Australia. During the 1950s he wrote a series of newspaper articles, &#8216;Early Adelaide with the lid off&#8217;. Douglas Pike (1908-1974) South Australian and Australian Historian. In 1960 he was appointed to the Chair of History at the University of Tasmania and published his second book, Australia: The Quiet Continent. In 1964 he moved to the Australian National University and commenced his pioneering task as founding editor of the Australian Dictionary of Biography. Therefore the most significant period of his working life in history and historiography covers the years from 1948 until his sudden illness in November 1973, and death in May 1974. The Second World War at first slowed but then stimulated the teaching and writing of history in Australia. Pike commenced his university studies during the war; his research and writing followed in the post-war period. His years in academia witnessed the establishment between 1946 and 1958 of four more universities in Australia, including the ANU, where he spent the last ten years of his life. However, apart from book reviews, obituaries in newspapers and journals, biographical paragraphs and the ADB, Pike&#8217;s contribution and significance to Australian historiography has been largely neglected. My thesis is based on personal interviews and correspondence with people who knew Douglas Pike, including family members, together with archival material from the Australian National Library and the universities where Pike worked.

Security of water supply has always played a critical role in the economic and social development of South Australia, and will continue to do so while dependency on water from the River Murray is so high and there is competition over this from states and for different uses &#8211; municipal, irrigation, industry, and the environment. The drive towards sustainable development has evolved to attenuate overconsumption of the world&#8217;s natural resources of which water is a key element. Provision of reliable water supplies to regional South Australia has always presented challenges, given the vast distances involved and the limited number of natural water sources. Despite these, a majority of South Australians enjoy the benefit of a reliable and safe water supply, adequate waste disposal system, good community health and high standard of living. A challenge remains to determine the sustainability of current major water pipe transfer systems from remote resources to small communities. There may be scope for managing existing water supplies more effectively and further developing local water harvesting and reuse solutions to minimise the need for more significant infrastructure investment. This study investigates the challenges and opportunities for extending development of non-potable (secondary) water supply schemes in South Australian towns. These schemes will conserve the State&#8217;s freshwater resources. The primary focus of this study is harnessing stormwater runoff and treated effluent generated by normal township development to supplement higher quality public water for uses such as irrigation of public areas and sporting fields in country areas. Water harvesting and reuse is not likely to occur due to some technological breakthrough but through application of known technology and the adoption of water conscious ethics by society. However, it is a sensible reality for the South Australian climate, particularly when coupled with appropriate conservation and suitable landscaping practices. Thus, the major theme of this study is information sharing since if people are familiar with and understand the concepts then more communities may be encouraged to develop their resources. Water reuse has proven to be a beneficial strategy for addressing stormwater runoff and wastewater disposal problems and alleviating localised water supply problems for several South Australian towns and communities. The existing projects demonstrate both the strong community-based and innovative approach to water resources management in this state. They are inherently simple in form, and can often be assembled with readily available materials by people with a basic understanding of plumbing and construction skills (locally available). The potential for localised water harvesting and reuse in South Australian towns is generally limited to single purpose communal non-potable systems. Further, it is likely to only be sustainable in rural communities willing to make a commitment to its long term, proper operation and maintenance, or they could endanger public health.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stormwater harvesting; Effluent reuse; Wastewater reuse; Small town; Small system; South Australia</field><field name="subject">Water reuse South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Cities and towns South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Water harvesting South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of strengthened unreinforced masonry (URM) walls by new retrofitting technologies for blast loading.</field><field name="creator">Su, Yu</field><field name="description">Terrorism has become a serious threat in the world, with bomb attacks carried out both inside and outside buildings. There are already many unreinforced masonry buildings in existence, and some of them are historical buildings. However, they do not perform well under blast loading. Aiming on protecting masonry buildings, retrofitting techniques were developed. Some experimental work on studying the effect of retrofitted URM walls has been done in recent years; however, these tests usually cost a significant amount of time and funds. Because of this, numerical simulation has become a good alternative, and can be used to study the behaviour of masonry structures, and predict the outcomes of experimental tests. This project was carried out to find efficient retrofitting technique under blast loading by developing numerical material models. It was based on experimental research of strengthening URM walls by using retrofitting technologies under out-of-plane loading at the University of Adelaide. The numerical models can be applied to study large-scaled structures under static loading, and the research work is then extended to the field of blast loading. Aiming on deriving efficient material models, homogenization technology was introduced to this research. Fifty cases of numerical analysis on masonry basic cell were conducted to derive equivalent orthotropic material properties. To study the increasing capability in strength and ductility of retrofitted URM walls, pull-tests were simulated using interface element model to investigate the bond-slip relationship of FRP plates bonded to masonry blocks. The interface element model was then used to simulate performance of retrofitted URM walls under static loads. The accuracy of the numerical results was verified by comparing with the experimental results from previous tests at the University of Adelaide by Griffith et al. (2007) on unreinforced masonry walls and by Yang (2007) on FRP retrofitted masonry walls. To study the de-bonding behaviours of retrofits bonded to masonry, and find appropriate solution to protect certain masonry walls against blast loading, various retrofitting technologies were examined. The simulation covers explosive impacts of a wide range of impulses. Based on this work, pressure-impulse diagrams for different types of retrofitted URM walls were developed as a design guideline for estimating the blast effect on retrofitted masonry walls. The outcomes of this research will contribute to the development of numerical simulation on modelling retrofitted URM walls, improving the technique for explosion-resistant of masonry buildings, and providing a type of guideline for blast-resistant design.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retrofitting; FRP; Masonry; Blast; Aluminium foam; Spray-on polyurea; Numerical</field><field name="subject">Masonry -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Masonry -- Testing -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Building materials -- Research.</field><field name="subject">Blast effect -- Measurement.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative neuropharmacology of the substituted amphetamines: p-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) &amp; 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)</field><field name="creator">Callaghan, Paul Damian</field><field name="description">Dramatic growth in substituted amphetamines (&#8216;Ecstasy&#8217;) use since the 1980&#8217;s has correlated with increased incidence of acute toxicity and residual neuropsychological deficits. This thesis aimed to characterise the acute neurochemical mechanisms and residual neurochemical alterations produced by p-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), which is usually sold as &#8216;ecstasy&#8217; and is associated with greater acute toxicity than 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). While both PMA and MDMA primarily modulate dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, little is known of the differences in the neurochemical effects of PMA within the central nervous system, in vivo. This thesis used in vivo chronoamperometry to elucidate the acute neurochemical alterations in monoaminergic pharmacology in vivo after local application of PMA or MDMA within discrete brain nuclei in anaesthetised rats. Measurement of evoked release of monoamines including serotonin (5-HT), and inhibition of neurotransmitter uptake via membrane transporters were assessed. Initial studies compared pharmacodynamic responses of PMA and MDMA, showing PMA to have greater efficacy and potency for alteration of core body temperature in rats, a primary cause of acute toxicity, within minimal alteration in locomotion. Dose-response studies indicated local PMA application within striatum resulted in significantly greater 5-HT evoked release than MDMA, yet lesser dopaminergic release, as predicted by the pharmacodynamic data. Only PMA-evoked release could be partially blocked by pre-treatment with a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SERT). Differences in both the qualitative and quantitative nature of striatal evoked-release of 5HT and dopamine were noted for both drugs, which had not been previously seen. Both PMA and MDMA inhibited 5-HT clearance, but only MDMA inhibited dopamine clearance in striatum. Doseresponse studies in the CA3 region of hippocampus indicated PMA was also more efficacious than MDMA in the inhibition of 5-HT clearance in vivo. While the question of whether long term MDMA use induces selective neurodegeneration (reductions in serotonergic in vitro biomarkers) is still unclear, it was not known for PMA prior to this work. Repeated PMA administration was shown to result in reductions in cortical SERT (indicative of potential loss of 5-HT terminal axons), cortical 5-HT content was unaltered. A subsequent comprehensive study followed, comparing the residual effects of PMA or MDMA administration on in vitro serotonergic biomarkers (markers of selective neurodegeneration) and SERT function in vivo. PMA administration resulted in reductions in hippocampal SERT binding and [3H]-5HT synaptosomal uptake, correlating with in vitro biomarkers previously used. SERT function in vivo using chronoamperometric techniques was reduced, as would be predicted. However, hippocampal 5-HT content was again not reduced, indicating that selective neurodegeneration of 5-HT fibres may not in fact be occurring. MDMA administration reduced all measured in vitro serotonergic biomarkers, however SERT function in vivo was completely unaltered. These data indicate that reductions of in vitro biomarkers of 5-HT axonal degeneration do not necessarily predict the potential compensatory mechanisms that maintain SERT function in vivo. Compensatory mechanisms appear to exist in vivo to maintain clearance of extracellular 5- HT that may be disrupted or eliminated during tissue preparation for in vitro assays. In summary, while PMA produced significantly greater alterations, compared to MDMA, in processes intrinsic to 5-HT neurotransmission in both striatum and hippocampus, the magnitude of these responses did not explain the significantly higher risk of acute toxicity seen clinically with PMA use. The second component of the thesis extended beyond prior work, investigating the potential neurodegenerative effects of PMA and MDMA through the assessment of changes in key functional processes in 5-HT neurotransmisson. It is hoped this will contribute to the subsequent characterisation of the mechanism(s) of functional compensation in 5-HT neurotransmission which may lead to more targeted treatments to modulate potential psychological/psychiatric deficits that occur in regular &#8216;ecstasy&#8217; users.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecstasy; Neurochemistry; 5HT; Dopamine; Voltammetry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High protein dietary patterns and Type 2 diabetes.</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Karma Louise</field><field name="description">By the year 2025, it is anticipated that over 300 million individuals world wide will have type 2 diabetes, with a projected increase from 84 to 288 million (170%) in developing countries and from 51 to 72 million (42%) in developed countries. Diabetes leads to a markedly increased risk of heart disease and renal failure and to expensive and debilitating retinopathy and neuropathy. Cognitive decline is also increased. As there is accumulating evidence of the beneficial effects of moderate carbohydrate, low fat dietary patterns compared to high carbohydrate diets, this thesis will focus on the effects of moderate carbohydrate high protein dietary patterns (total carbohydrate: protein: fat ratio of 40%:34%:26%) on glycemic control, risk factors for macrovascular disease and cognitive function. Information on two key areas in type 2 diabetes will be presented, 1. Acute effects of dietary patterns, moderately carbohydrate restricted and high in protein on glucose levels assessed using continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) with verification of these results through a small repeat study. 2. Chronic effects of energy restricted dietary patterns, moderately carbohydrate restricted and high in protein on glucose levels, HbA1c, cognitive function, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers and renal function. In the acute study, we recruited 23 subjects with type 2 diabetes. The participants were randomized to each of 4, 3-day interventions in a cross over design with a 4 day wash out period in which the carbohydrates were distributed differently at each meal; carbohydrates evenly distributed across the day, or carbohydrates loaded at breakfast, lunch or dinner. Glucose levels were continuously measured using CGMS. Outcomes were assessed by postprandial peak glucose (Gmax), time spent above 12 mmol/L (T&gt;12) and total area under the glucose curve (AUC20). The intervention showed that an even distribution of carbohydrates did not optimise blood glucose control, whereas carbohydrates loaded at the lunch time meal provided the most favourable postprandial profile. To verify these results we conducted a repeat study. Six of the previous participants accepted the invitation to return and complete the even distribution arm of the study after a 20 week time lag. The intervention showed that although HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG), AUC, exercise and ambient temperature remained constant there was a significant effect of change in sunlight hours on Gmax, suggesting an effect of sunlight. To assess the chronic effects of energy restricted dietary patterns on the determinants of HbA1c, cognitive function, CVD risk markers and renal function under conditions of weight loss, we recruited 82 participants with type 2 diabetes. These participants were randomised to one of two high protein energy restricted dietary patterns that differed in cholesterol content, for a 12 week period, in a parallel design. A sub group of these participants completed cognitive function testing with (n=34) or without (n=17) CGMS at baseline and at 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of the intervention the determinants of HbA1c under conditions of energy restriction were evaluated. The intervention showed the change in FBG accounted for most of the variance in change in HbA1c, but % energy reduction also contributed independently of FBG. Both energy restricted high protein diets equally improved glycemic control, particularly T&gt;12, AUC, HbA1c and FBG. Fifty one participants completed cognitive testing to evaluate the effect of weight loss and blood glucose control on cognition. Cognitive function was not altered by time, diet, baseline lipid levels. Working memory was predicted by FBG. Short term memory was predicted by FBG, Gmax and AUC24. Sixty five participants completed 12 weeks of the intervention to assess CVD risk markers and renal function. Renal function was maintained and CV markers improved on both dietary patterns, with greatest improvement in HDL-C observed in the group consuming a high protein, energy restricted dietary pattern, high in dietary cholesterol. In conclusion, in the context of a high protein, carbohydrate restricted dietary pattern, cognitive function and renal function did not change, while glycemia and CV risk profiles improved with weight loss over the short term. Under conditions of energy balance diurnal glucose profiles were optimal when the carbohydrates were loaded in the lunch meal.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Type 2 diabetes; High protein; Moderately restricted dietary pattern; Carbohydrate distribution; Glycemic control; Cardiovascular risk factor; Cognitive function; Renal function; Energy balance; Energy restriction</field><field name="subject">Non-insulin-dependent diabetes.</field><field name="subject">High-protein diet.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiovascular and mental health benefits of soy consumption: role of soy isoflavones.</field><field name="creator">Thorp, Alicia A.</field><field name="description">Regular soy consumption has been shown to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk through plasma cholesterol reduction. According to the current health claim, this benefit is attributed to soy protein (SP). Dietary intervention trials indicate that isoflavones (ISO), weak phytoestrogens in soy, may also contribute by offering additional vascular and metabolic protection. Equol, a metabolite of the ISO daidzein (DAZ) with greater estrogenic potency, may be an important mediator of such effects. This thesis examines effects of soy, in particular, ISO consumption on CV risk factors and the potential for ISOs to enhance cognition, possibly through improvements of circulatory function. Two crossover design intervention trials were undertaken: a food-based intervention, investigating differential effects of SP and ISO on plasma lipids and other risk factors for CVD, and an ISO supplementation trial, examining effects on cognition and vascular function. Both addressed whether benefits were dependent on equol production. In the first trial, 91 subjects with untreated mild hypercholesterolemia were randomised to consume each of the following three diets in random order for sequential 6 week periods: (S) soy foods containing 24 g of SP and 75-90 mg ISO per day, (SD) soy/dairy foods containing 12 g SP, 12 g dairy protein (DP) and 75-90 mg ISO per day or (D) dairy foods containing 24 g DP only per day. At the end of each diet period, blood lipids, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, blood pressure, arterial compliance and anthropometric measures were assessed. Compared with the control diet (D), there was a small but significant reduction in total cholesterol on the S diet only (2.8 + 1.1%, P&lt;0.05), which could be accounted for by a decrease in saturated fat intake. FMD was found to be significantly improved when SD and S diet data were nested (P=0.03). Plasma triglycerides (TG) improved on both the SD and S diets compared with D (P&lt;0.01). Other lipid, metabolic and vascular parameters did not differ between diets. There were no differences in outcomes between equol (n=30) and non equol producers (n=61). In a subsequent 12 week double-blind supplementation trial, 34 healthy males were randomised to take 4 capsules providing 120mg ISO per day or a matching placebo for 6 weeks, after which they crossed over to the alternate supplement. FMD and cognitive assessments relating to measures of memory and executive function were performed at the beginning and end of each treatment phase. Spatial working memory, a test in which females consistently perform better than males, was significantly improved by ISO supplementation (P&lt;0.02). However, other measures of cognition and FMD were unaffected and there were no differences between equol (n=8) and non-equol producers (n=26). These interventions indicate that ISOs offer specific health benefits, independent of equol production. ISO supplementation can enhance specific cognitive processes which appear dependent on estrogen activation. Additionally, soy foods containing ISOs improved FMD and TG but were unable to improve LDL cholesterol, even in equol producers. Thus dietary ISOs may reduce CV risk but the validity of the current health claim for SP is questioned.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytoestrogen; Equol; Dietary intervention; Cognition; Lipid; Cholesterol: Vascular function</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Action research in preventing workplace burnout in rural remote community mental health nursing.</field><field name="creator">Petrie, Eileen Margaret</field><field name="description">The social phenomenon of stress and workplace burnout has spanned over five decades. Despite a plethora of literature that exists, there still remain problematic issues that neither scientific investigation or government legislation have been able to resolve. The literature examined throughout this research is extensive and does reflect this 50-year period. It demonstrates that studies into this phenomenon have attempted to define stress, identify causal factors of workplace stress, workplace burnout and environmental congruence; and discusses strategies (focused on both the individual and organizational levels) that have been implemented to effect beneficial outcomes for individuals affected by any one of these. As this thesis continues, the more recent literature gives a greater recognition to violence in the workplace and legislative enactments as preventative measures to reduce the heavy burden of costs, both physical and financial, to organizations. This extensive literature review indicates no answer to the problem has been identified to date and that this phenomenon remains, giving a clear indication that further scientific investigation is required to find a solution to what was described as the most serious health issue of the 20th century. Based on the literature examined this health issue has now gone well beyond the 20th century, giving relevance to the research study described in this thesis. The investigation is validated as vital and should be used as a basis for further research. This study undertook a collaborative social process, action research, empowering participants to identify and change stressful factors identified within their practice indicative to rural remote community mental health teams. A critical social theory arose out of the problems within the context of the research setting, based on the ideal that the significant issues for this group of individuals within this organization could be solved through the action research process. The group &#8216;existed&#8217; within the issues indicative to this rural remote area, however these issues were outside their control. Through the implementation of the action research process courses of actions were undertaken that provided enlightenment in self-knowledge with dialogue heightening collective empowerment to effect change within their practice. The action research process, being a holistic process, facilitated this change in practice, developed and refined theory as it proceeded in a cyclic fashion within this local setting. It concerned actual not abstract practices in the social world in which these participants practice. This methodology facilitated examining the significant stressors identified by the Community Mental Health Support Team (CMHST) that caused distress, allowing them to implement changes in their practice. The forum provided an avenue that could reduce stressors significantly and prevent ongoing occupational stress that contributes to workplace burnout. It offered an opportunity to work with a group of participants in a nonhierarchical and non-exploitative manner and enabled members of this group to identify their roles as effective practitioners, empowering them to effect the changes they deemed as essential criteria to reduce the stress they were experiencing indicative to their remoteness. Critical reviewing throughout the data collection attempted to understand and redefine these significant issues. It aimed to acknowledge the way things were relative to how things could be improved from organizational, personal and wider community perspectives. Simple principles and guidelines of action research were followed potentiating acceptance as a rigorous research approach from a positivist perspective whilst retaining the attributes that characterise action research. There are solutions to the dilemma of the employee overcoming the debilitating effects of stress leading to workplace burnout. This includes the cooperation of managers, policy makers, academic researchers and government officials working collaboratively to reduce the impact of occupational stress. Through this collaborative process, changes can be effected to ensure the health of the nation improves and that relevant recognition is given to the fact that there is a significant threat to a healthy workforce. Examining the nursing profession from a social perspective provides alternatives to medicalising workplace injuries and illnesses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">action research; workplace burnout; rural remote; community mental health nursing</field><field name="subject">Psychiatric nurses Job stress Australia.

The Drosophila ortholog Wwox was identified and subjected to targeted &#8216;loss of function&#8217; mutagenesis. The resulting mutants were found to be viable when homozygous with no obvious defects in the adult fly. As Wwox mutant flies were found to exhibit an increased sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR), a number of Wwox proteins specifically deleted or mutated at positions consisting of conserved functional protein motifs, or regions that are highly conserved among WWOX / Wwox homologs. The Wwox variants were tested for their ability to modify the IR sensitivity phenotype. In the course of this study, it was found that background mutations introduced during the generation of the mutant flies was responsible for the IR sensitivity phenotype. As a result, proteomic alterations resulting from changes in Wwox protein levels in Drosophila were investigated in order to ascertain the possible molecular functions of the Wwox protein. 2D-DIGE analysis was conducted on a number of different fly genotypes expressing differing levels of Wwox protein in both adult and embryonic flies. The proteomic changes resulting from lack of Wwox function as well as Wwox over-expression were detected with the proteins of interest identified by mass spectrometry (MS) using both MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS. Label free quantitative MS analysis was also performed in order to determine the most abundant protein(s) in those spots found to contain multiple proteins. These proteomic studies identified changes in a wide variety of proteins with a significant number of metabolic proteins as well as proteins involved in oxidative stress response as a result of different levels of Wwox expression. Of particular interest, consistent changes in different isoforms of superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) were identified. Due to the known roles these proteins play in pro and anti-apoptotic pathways, it is possible that Sod1 and Wwox may work in concert to regulate the delicate balance of defence mechanisms in response to environmental stresses, particularly oxidative stress. The protein/gene targets identified in this work therefore offer some insights into normal Wwox function.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chromosomal fragile sites; cancer; WWOX; Drosophila; ZD-DIGE; proteomics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of welding fume plumes using laser diagnostics.</field><field name="creator">Owen, Lucas</field><field name="description">In many occupations such as welding, workers are exposed to a combination of several hazards. One of these is the exposure to fumes, particularly those produced from welding processes involving electrical arcs. The inhalation of welding fume can cause both temporary side effects and longer term health complications. These health effects lower the productivity and quality of life of the welder which in turn costs the employer through reduced worker productivity and potential compensation. Current techniques of fume measurement determine bulk quantity of formation without regard to fume plume dissipation into the work place. While some research has been conducted into dissipation, measurements near the welding arc have proven difficult and either numerical or salt water modelling have been used. Such modelling aims to replicate the welding process but is ultimately detached from the actual welding variables involved and does not provide data on fume concentration. Since welder exposure is determined by both fume concentration and dissipation into the workplace measurement techniques which could provide both would be considered highly desirable. In the field of combustion research a number of different laser techniques are used to image soot particulates in flames. These techniques include laser scattering, laser extinction and laser induced incandescence. As yet none of these techniques have found application to the measurement or imaging of particulate matter in arc welding fume plumes. In the work presented here these techniques have been investigated for welding fume measurements of concentration and dissipation. Laser scattering was used successfully to image the fume plume close to the welding arc of actual gas metal and flux cored arc welding processes. The resulting images provided relative fume concentration maps that were quantified when combined with measurements from laser extinction. Laser induced incandescence, while successfully applied to the imaging of soot concentration in flames, was found to have limited capabilities when applied to welding fume particulates. Fume box measurements were undertaken for GMAW and FCAW to determine actual FFR in response to changes in welding variables. The results were in general agreement with those obtained from laser techniques and referenced in literature. The fume plume images collected from in-situ laser measurements were compared with those from previous modelling of plume shape, radial spread and virtual origin. Laser diagnostics demonstrated a number of capabilities not available with traditional fume measurements. The findings of this research provide unique insight into fume dissipation. Such findings can be applied to minimise the quantity of fume, the transmission to the breathing zone and ultimately worker exposure in the workplace.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GMAW; welding; fume; plume; Mie; LII; Laser; BOHICA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient embeddings of meshes and hypercubes on a group of future network architectures.</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yawen</field><field name="description">Meshes and hypercubes are two most important communication and computation structures used in parallel computing. Network embedding problems for meshes and hypercubes on traditional network architectures have been intensively studied during the past years. With the emergence of new network architectures, the traditional network embedding results are not enough to solve the new requirements. The main objective of this thesis is to design efficient network embedding schemes for realizing meshes and hypercubes on a group of future network architectures. This thesis is organized into two parts. The first part focuses on embedding meshes/tori on a group of double-loop networks by evaluating the traditional embedding metrics, since double-loop networks have been intensively studied and proven to have many desirable properties for future network architecture. We propose a novel tessellation approach to partition the geometric plane of double-loop networks into a set of parallelogram tiles, called P-shape. Based on the characteristics of P-shape, we design a simple embedding scheme, namely P-shape embedding, that embeds arbitrary-shape meshes and tori on double-loop networks in a systematic way. A main merit of P-shape embedding is that a large fraction of embedded mesh/torus edges have edge dilation 1, resulting in a low average dilation. These are the first results, to our knowledge, on embedding meshes and tori on general doubleloop networks which is of great significance due to the popularity of these architectures. Our P-shape construction bridges between regular graphs and double-loop networks, and provides a powerful tool for studying the topological properties of double-loop networks. In the second part, we study efficient embedding schemes for realizing hypercubes on a group of array-basedWDMoptical networks by analyzing the new embedding metric of wavelength requirement, as WDM optical networking is becoming a promising technology for deployment in many applications in advanced telecommunication and parallel computing. We first design routing and wavelength assignments of both bidirectional and unidirectional hypercubes on WDM optical linear arrays, rings, meshes and tori with the consideration of communication directions. For each case, we identify a lower bound on the number of wavelengths required, and design the embedding scheme and wavelength assignment algorithm that uses a provably near-optimal number of wavelengths. To further reduce the wavelength requirement, we extend the results to WDM ring networks with additional links, namely WDM chordal rings. Based on our proposed embedding schemes, we provide the analysis of chord length with optimal number of wavelengths to realize hypercubes on 3-degree and 4-degree WDM chordal rings. Furthermore, we propose an embedding scheme for realizing dimensional hypercubes on WDM optical arrays by considering the hypercubes dimension by dimension, called lattice embedding, instead of embedding hypercubes with all dimensions. Based on lattice embedding, the number of wavelengths required to realize dimensional hypercube on WDM arrays can been significantly reduced compared to the previous results. By our embedding schemes, many communications and computations, originally designed based on hypercubes, can be directly implemented in WDM optical networks, and the wavelength requirements can be easily derived using our obtained results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">network embedding; mesh; hypercube; optical networks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution of proteins involved in carbon catabolite repression in Aspergillus nidulans.</field><field name="creator">Roy, Preeti.</field><field name="description">Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is a mechanism by which micro-organisms preferentially utilize more easily metabolizable carbon sources in comparison to less easily metabolizable carbon sources. It prevents the organisms from unnecessary expenditure of energy and enables them to exploit the nutrients in appropriate manner. It represents a complex system of gene regulation. The main aim of this study was to study the intracellular localization of proteins involved in CCR including CreA, CreB, CreC and CreD in A. nidulans in repressing and derepressing conditions. The major regulatory protein involved in CCR in A. nidulans is CreA. It is a DNA-binding repressor, but very little is known about the molecular events that allow CreA function to result in appropriate regulation in response to carbon source. To determine the amount and localization of CreA in different carbon sources, strains were made over-expressing GFP and HA tagged CreA. Western analysis showed that high levels of full length CreA can be present in cells that show normal responses to carbon catabolite repression, whether they are grown in repressing or derepressing media. Hence the amount of CreA is similar in both the conditions and thus degradation of CreA is not a key step in carbon catabolite repression. Fluorescence microscopy studies have shown that CreA is in the nucleus under repressing and derepressing carbon conditions and this is not affected by the absence of CreB or CreD, the other important proteins in A. nidulans. Thus mere localization of CreA in nucleus is not sufficient to cause carbon catabolite repression and there is some modification process involved for CreA to act as a repressor protein in CCR. CreB is a deubiquitinating protein and CreC is a protein containing five WD 40 repeats, a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a proline rich region and both the proteins are present in the cell in a complex. CreB was localized using strains that over-expresses GFP tagged CreB and fluorescence microscopy. CreB is present mainly in the cytoplasm in both repressing and derepressing conditions. Moreover, intracellular localization of CreB is unaffected by the presence or absence of CreD. However, the amount of CreB was higher in a creD+ background as compared to a creD34 mutant background, implying that the presence of CreD affects the amount of CreB in the cell. CreC was localized by using strain that over-expresses YFP tagged CreC and it is also present mainly in the cytoplasm. CreD contains arrestin domains and PY motifs and is highly similar to the Rod1p and Rog3p from S. cerevisiae. CreD is proposed to be involved in ubiquitination process in CCR in A. nidulans. Localization studies have shown that CreD is present throughout the cell in a punctate pattern with more in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. CreB and CreD co-localize in some regions of the cell whereas in other regions either CreB or CreD is present.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CreA; nuclear localization; ubiquitination</field><field name="subject">Aspergillus nidulans Molecular genetics.

By 1988 Australia and New Zealand were the only countries permitting its use, limited to the treatment of refractory angina pectoris conditional upon the therapeutic monitoring of patients, due to recognition of the concentration dependent nature of its efficacy and toxicity. An understanding of the extreme interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of perhexiline due to metabolism by the polymorphic Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) has prompted a recent resurgence of its use in Australasia and Europe. Perhexiline is a chiral molecule and is administered as a racemic mixture. Prior to the publication of the papers that are the topic of this thesis the characterisation of the clinical pharmacology of the enantiomers of perhexiline had been limited to one pharmacokinetic study that suggested that the (+) enantiomer of perhexiline may display a smaller polymorphic effect in its metabolism than its optical antipode. The four publications that comprise this thesis describe a comprehensive investigation of the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the enantiomers of perhexiline in extensive and poor metabolisers (EM and PM, respectively) of CYP2D6 in both an in vitro model and clinically. The aim was to determine if the CYP2D6 polymorphism affects the metabolism of (+)-perhexiline significantly less than (-)-perhexiline, such that the inherent variability observed in the pharmacokinetics of the racemic preparation used clinically might be overcome by administration of only (+)-perhexiline. Although both the in vitro and in vivo studies determined that the involvement of CYP2D6 was proportionately greater in the total clearance of (-)- than (+)-perhexiline, the empirical data also demonstrated that the role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of (+)-perhexiline was simply too pre-eminent for a chiral preparation of this enantiomer to significantly reduce the difference in clearance observed between EM and PM. An unexpected finding was that the enantioselectivity observed in the clinical pharmacokinetics of perhexiline in EM was, in fact, significantly greater in PM. Whilst the enantioselectivity in EM was attributable to metabolism by CYP2D6, the mechanism responsible for this in PM could not be determined, but was postulated to involve enantioselective biliary excretion. Because PM are effectively exposed to greater concentrations of (+)-perhexiline and lower concentrations of (-)-perhexiline, when the relative pharmacodynamic activities of the individual enantiomers have been established therapeutic drug monitoring may be improved by the development of specific enantiomer target concentration ranges in plasma. What is certain is that perhexiline will remain an essential option in the armamentarium for the treatment of refractory angina pectoris and therapeutic drug monitoring will remain obligatory due to the inter- and intra-subject pharmacokinetic variability attributable to the respective polymorphic and saturable metabolism of both enantiomers by CYP2D6.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pharmacokinetics; Perhexiline; stereoselective; CYP2D6</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of obesity and diet induced weight loss on cardiovascular risk factors, vascular and ventricular structure and function, prostate symptoms and sexual function in obese men.</field><field name="creator">Piantadosi, Cynthia</field><field name="description">Obesity is a major epidemic and is increasing in prevalence worldwide. The health problems and consequences of obesity include cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus. Each of these abnormalities directly promotes atherosclerosis. More recently, visceral obesity has been shown to be independently associated with abnormalities of both the ventricular and vascular structure and function. The mechanisms by which they occur remain incompletely defined. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) offers several advantages for evaluation of cardiac structure and function in the obese. The high accuracy and reproducibility of the technique allows for detection of very small changes in ventricular volumes, mass, ejection fraction, and cardiac output with a relatively small sample size, as compared with echocardiography. In this thesis we investigated whether cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging can better characterize possible cardiac abnormalities associated with obesity, in the absence of other confounding comorbidities. Obesity is associated with myocardial and vascular function, the extent of reversibility of these abnormalities with rapid acute weight loss remains uncertain. Therefore the first aim of the study was to (i) determine the relationship between obesity and left ventricular structure and function using magnetic resonance imaging, and (ii) the acute effects of rapid diet-induced weight loss on cardiac and vascular function in normal obese and obese diabetic men. Erectile dysfunction is related to cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity by an impairment of endothelial function. Therefore, symptoms of erectile dysfunction are probably to precede cardiovascular disease and events. The second aim of this study was to (i) determine the relationship between obesity and erectile function (EF), sexual desire (SD), lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and quality of life (QOL) measures in obese males, and (ii) determine the effects of rapid diet-induced weight loss on EF, SD, LUTS and QOL measures in normal obese and obese diabetic men. In this group of men, obesity was associated with mild/moderate erectile dysfunction, and significant LUTS, which together with sexual desire improved following rapid diet induced weight loss, but was not directly related to the amount of weight loss or changes in measured metabolic state. Pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) covers 80% of the heart and constitutes 20% of its weight. PAT mass is related to the amount of abdominal fat and the risk of coronary atherosclerosis. Epicardial fat mass may be a sensitive indicator of cardiovascular risk. The third aim of this study was to (i) determine the relationship between obesity and PAT volume and (ii) effectively evaluate the impact of caloric restriction and associated weight reduction on epicardical fat volume via cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). This is the first study to show a reduction in PAT volume is associated with caloric restriction.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obesity; ventricular function; Endothelial function; cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; sexual function</field><field name="subject">Men Health and hygiene.</field><field name="subject">Obesity in men.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system Diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I dream of Magda.</field><field name="creator">Lashchuk, Stefan</field><field name="description">People who write books are invariably asked how they do it, by people who read them, in a similar way, for example, to how pilots might be asked &#8216;How do you fly a plane?&#8217; by passengers who couldn&#8217;t imagine steering several tonnes of metal through the sky at 30,000 feet.

First, the impact of bearer length on yield components within the canopy was investigated in season 2005/06, on a commercially-managed, mechanically-pruned vineyard of Vitis vinifera L. Cabernet Sauvignon in Coonawarra, South Australia. Pruning resulted in the retention of bearers with 1-7 nodes, with the weighted average bearer length being two nodes for the canopy. As bearers of one to five nodes in length were the most common, these were studied. Yield components (on a per shoot basis) were analysed according to the node position on the bearer at which the shoot arose. Both budburst and inflorescence number per node were highest at the distal node positions on each length bearer, even if the nodes were at the same positions from the base of the bearer and would normally be expected to have similar fertility. Budburst appeared to act by modifying inflorescence number per node based on the relative location of each node from the apex of the bearer. Shoots that arose from the most distal node positions had the highest flower number per inflorescence and berry number per bunch. Flower number per inflorescence was significantly higher on two-inflorescence shoots than single-inflorescence shoots. The relationship between bunch size and node position, unlike that between inflorescence number and node position, was dependent on bearer length. The relative size of the inflorescence appeared to be affected more so by the node pOSition at which the shoot occurred on the bearer, as opposed to the actual node position on the shoot at which the inflorescence occurred. There was a positive, non-linear relationship between average fruit yield per bearer and bearer length. Although yield was highest from the bearer with the highest node number (five nodes), there was no significant difference in yield per bearer for the bearers of three to five nodes in length. If average bearer length was increased from two to three nodes, the potential yield gain per bearer is estimated at 38 per cent. The second study presents results of correlations between bunch number and components of bunch weight (flower number and berry number) to investigate co-development of bunch number and bunch size. These data were collected from 4 vineyards in the Limestone Coast Zone of South Australia from Vilis vinifera L. Chardonnay, Shiraz and Cabemet Sauvignon during seasons 2002/03 to 2006/07. The significant correlations found between fertility and both bunch weight and flower number per inflorescence suggest that the same factors that affect bunch number in a particular season will also affect bunch size. When inflorescence primordia were initiated and differentiated under cool conditions, actual bunches per node and flowers per inflorescence were low. Differences in climate between the vineyard sites were found to be minimal and therefore did not strongly affect the magnitude of the yield components at the vineyard sites. Cultural practices at each vineyard site were sufficiently variable to affect fertility levels. Genotype is thought to determine the range of flowers per inflorescence that a variety can potentially carry, whereas actual flower number per inflorescence is thought to be determined by inflorescence primordium initiation and differentiation temperatures, as well as temperatures during budburst. Despite significant correlations between flower number per inflorescence and berry number per bunch, flower number per inflorescence preflowering for Cabemet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Chardonnay is inversely related to actual percentage fruit set. This is possibly a survival mechanism for the grapevine as it allows the vine to maximise yield each season without detriment to its longevity. Bunches per vine accounted for the majority of the seasonal variation in yield per vine. Fluctuations in bunch number per vine (and therefore yield) are likely to be reduced by varying the number of nodes retained per vine according to the relative fruitfulness per node present pre-pruning. This practice is therefore likely to result in the seasonal variation of berries per bunch becoming a stronger driver of yield. The commercial impacts of these studies are two-fold. Data presented will assist growers to understand the reasons for which their pruning regimes are affecting yield production and how these pruning regimes may be modified to achieve a target yield-particularly when growers are faced with seasons of low predicted fertility. In addition, data presented will allow growers to improve their crop forecasting accuracy, with a greater understanding of the link between bunch number and bunch size. In the current situation of oversupply in the wine industry, wineries are adopting a tough stance towards growers over-delivering on their grape contracts. Therefore, any assistance that can be provided to growers on improving accuracy of yield estimates will be beneficial both to the grower and winery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapevine; yield; node position; bearer length; berry number per bunch; flower number per inflorescence; climate</field><field name="subject">Grapes Climatic factors.</field><field name="subject">Crops and climate Australia.</field><field name="subject">Crop yields Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interradicular mineralized tissue adaptation in an aseptic necrosis model.</field><field name="creator">Chang, Andrew</field><field name="description">This study used vital bone markers to investigate mineralized tissue adaptation in the periodontium of rats after a hypothermic insult to their maxillary first molars.

The timing of the labels was such that all rats were euthanased 2 days after the last label. The rat maxillae were fixed in ethanol and embedded undecalcified in methylmethacrylate. Ten micrometre coronal sections were obtained through the furcation of the first molars with three of each group of ten consecutive sections being unstained, stained with von Kossa/ hematoxylin and eosin counterstain, or decalcified and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, respectively. Unstained sections were viewed under fluorescence, while transmitted light microscopy was used for the other sections. Mineral apposition rates along the bone, root and pulpal surfaces as well as periodontal ligament width were measured using histomorphometry. Semiquantitative measurements of the resorptive surfaces within the periodontium were also noted. Multivariate and negative binomial regression statistical analyses were used to identify influencing variables. A focal pattern of ankylosis was observed at days 14 and 21 in 3 rats and was not seen at day 28. In both the treated and control teeth, appositional activity was greatest along bone and least along the root surface. Mineral tissue apposition rates along the bone and root surface displayed an initial spike during day 14 but declined to levels of the control teeth by day 28. A longer time lag was observed with appositional activity in the pulp which also displayed a declining trend towards the control teeth values by day 28. Resorption levels along the root surface continued to remain significantly (p&lt;0.0001) elevated. The significantly (p&lt;0.0001) wider periodontal ligament width in the treated molars showed a declining trend towards that of the control teeth by day 28. There was a temporary disturbance of mineralized tissue adaptation on the bone and root surfaces with a recovery of cellular vitality within the periodontium and pulp and a trend towards homeostasis of the periodontal ligament width. The null hypotheses that a single prolonged thermal insult on a rat has no effect on mineralized tissue adaptation within the periodontium and pulp chamber and that the periodontal ligament width within the interradicular region does not change in response to thermal trauma induced by the present study were rejected.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankylosis; Resorption; Label; Periodontal Ligament; Rat</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NK, T and NK T-cells in ageing, coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease.</field><field name="creator">Grose, Randall Hilton</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the number and function of natural killer T-cells (NK T-cells) as a function of age, in coeliac disease, Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis. NK T-cells are a newly appreciated class of immune cells that are able to regulate the activity of the broader T-cell population. NK T-cells have been implicated in animal models of autoimmune disease and in human autoimmune disease. A subset of NK cells express the T-cell receptor (TCR) and are termed NK T-cells. In humans a further small subset of NK T-cells express an invariant TCR &#945; chain (V&#945;24J&#945;18) and contain the immunoregulatory cell population that is distinguished from classical T-cells by promptly producing interleukin-4 (IL-4). Invariant NK T-cells (iNK T-cells) have the surface phenotype of V&#945;24+ V&#946;11+ T-cells and express CD161+ NK markers. They are CD4+ (single positive; SP) or CD4- (double negative; DN), CD1d restricted and are &#945;-galactosylceramide (&#945;-GalCer) reactive. NKT cells have been implicated in numerous autoimmune disorders. Early work showed a major deficiency of NKT cell numbers in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a well-established model of spontaneous, autoimmune T-cell mediated insulin-dependent diabetes. Both the number of NKT cells and function, as assessed by IL-4 release following TCR ligation, are dramatically reduced in NOD mice. NK T-cells have been implicated in other models of autoimmunity such as, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). They have since been investigated and shown to be deficient in a number of human autoimmune diseases including, systemic sclerosis (SSc), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis, atopic asthma, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus and scleroderma. The basis of the work presented within this thesis originated from the deficiency of NK T-cells in models of autoimmune diseases and human autoimmune diseases. The initial aim of this thesis was to investigate the phenotype and function of V&#945;24+ NK T-cells in normal healthy control subjects and with respect to age. The original aim was to investigate whether NK cells, T-cells, NK T-like cells and invariant NK T-cells (iNK T-cells) are deficient in coeliac disease, Crohn&#8217;s disease and/or ulcerative colitis. Blood was collected for flow cytometry from normal control subjects, subjects with coeliac disease, Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis. The number of circulating NK cells, T-cells, NK T-like cells and iNK T-cells was assessed by three-colour flow cytometry. Intracellular cytokine production was measured after in vitro anti-CD3/ anti-CD28 antibodies, gluten fraction 3 and PMA:ionomycin stimulation. V&#945;24+ T-cells were quantified in ileocolonic biopsies by immunofluorescence and as mRNA by relative and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The number of circulating V&#945;24+ T-cells and iNK T-cells decrease with age in normal healthy control subjects. Cytokine production was also affected by age. The work of this thesis has identified a subpopulation of otherwise normal healthy individuals whom have normal numbers of circulating V&#945;24+ T-cells, reduced numbers of circulating V&#945;24+ V&#946;11+ T-cells and consequently iNK Tcells. Circulating CD161+ NK cells, V&#945;24+ T-cells and the SP subset of V&#945;24+ Tcells were reduced in coeliac disease. The low numbers of circulating V&#945;24+ T-cells was independent of diet. The number of circulating V&#945;24+ V&#946;11+ Tcells were reduced in coeliac disease, and as a consequence, the number of circulating V&#945;24+ V&#946;11+ &#945;-GalCer/CD1d tetramer+ and V&#945;24+ 6B11+ iNK T-cells were reduced. The deficiency of V&#945;24+ T-cells was not confined to the blood, but observed within the intestinal mucosa. Intestinal V&#945;24 mRNA expression from subjects with coeliac disease was reduced compared to levels in normal subjects as assessed by relative and RT-PCR. Thus, V&#945;24+ T-cells were deficient in coeliac disease both systemically and mucosally. Cytokine production by V&#945;24+ T-cells, 6B11+ and V&#945;24+ &#945;-GalCer/CD1d tetramer+ iNK T-cells after 4 h in vitro anti-CD3 stimulation was also impaired in subjects with coeliac disease. Circulating CD56+, CD57+, CD94+, CD161+ NK cells were reduced in Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis. V&#945;24+ T-cells and the SP subset of V&#945;24+ T-cells were reduced in Crohn&#8217;s disease but not in ulcerative colitis. Circulating V&#945;24+ V&#946;11+ T-cells, V&#945;24+ V&#946;11+ &#945;-GalCer/CD1d tetramer+ and V&#945;24+ 6B11+ iNK T-cells were deficient in both Cohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis. The deficiency of V&#945;24+ T-cells was also observed within the intestinal mucosa. Intestinal V&#945;24 mRNA expression from Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis was reduced compared to levels in normal subjects as assessed by relative and RT-PCR. Cytokine production by V&#945;24+ T-cells, 6B11+ and V&#945;24+ &#945;-GalCer/CD1d tetramer+ iNK T-cells after 4 h in vitro anti-CD3 stimulation was impaired for subjects with Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis. In summary, V&#945;24+ T-cell number and function were affected by age. Further investigations are warranted to see if deficiency of this immunoregulatory population is associated with disease. The decrease and dysfunction in immunoregulatory cells, V&#945;24 T-cells and iNK T-cells could contribute to the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis. Coeliac disease, Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis are polygenetic diseases in which environmental factors play a significant role in disease development and state. The reduced numbers of iNK T-cell along with their impaired function may only be two factors. Presumably, other factors are involved. Nevertheless, iNK T-cells offer a potential target for the therapeutic intervention of coeliac disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#8217;s disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NK T-cell; Ageing; Coeliac disease; Crohn's disease; Ulcerative collitis</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Inflammatory bowel diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the missing links : a critical inquiry into the role of social capital in Australian regional development.</field><field name="creator">Chiveralls, Keri</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of social capital in Australian regional development. It does so though a case study of one of the most socio-economically disadvantaged regions in Australia, the City of Playford, (perhaps best known as the former City of Elizabeth and home of South Australian Manufacturing). The approach taken involves an examination of the historical roots, more recent academic and political debates, along with the structural political and economic conditions which have inspired the rise of social capital. This is accompanied by an exploration of the application and implications of the social capital approach to development in the City of Playford. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in social capital theory. Of particular interest to policy makers has been the suggestion that there is a link between social capital and economic development. This argument has lent support to the idea that inequality in regional economic development can be tackled by building social capital in disadvantaged regions. In this thesis I take a critical approach to both the concept &#8216;social capital&#8217; and the link between social capital and economic development. I suggest that the popularity of social capital may be due more to the political and academic environment in which the concept was spawned, than its ability to address issues of inequality in regional development. The results of the case study in the City of Playford highlight the continuing importance of issues of class and structural inequality in Australian regional development. I argue that contemporary applications of social capital in regional development are not only unable to adequately address such issues, but may also be contributing to their exacerbation. Having drawn attention to the inherently problematic nature of the concept, I then discuss the implications of the research findings for the future of social capital in both policy and social theory.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social capital; Labour; Playford; Anthroplogy; Elizabeth; Class; Inequality; Regional development; Economic development; Political economy</field><field name="subject">Social capital (Sociology) Australia Elizabeth (S.

In particular, it explores how the poet&#8217;s depiction of this violence and suffering might affect readers of the collection. Four poems (poems II, III, IX and XI) are studied from the point of view of the emotions they are likely to evoke in the reader. The question of whether different types of readers might undergo different emotional experiences while reading these poems arises as a result of the proposed study. The first chapter of this thesis thus examines the nature of emotions, focussing on their sources and composition. This examination suggests that an individual&#8217;s emotional experience can be influenced both by biological factors and by social and cultural environment. With this in mind, an examination follows of various aspects of Roman society and culture which were likely to influence the ways in which its citizens, in particular, reacted to the violent scenes in the poems. We will also consider how our own specific cultural milieu may influence modern readers to sometimes react differently to Roman readers. In particular, it is proposed that most readers of the Peristephanon will react with varying shades of disgust and horror. These two emotions are thus used as a framework for discussing reader reactions to the poems. Disgust and horror are understood in a very broad sense, allowing for different varieties of these emotions, which at times even give rise to contradiction and paradox. The remaining chapters of the thesis are devoted to examinations of the four chosen poems which explore the various ways in which they might evoke horror and disgust among both Roman and modern readers. Often, there is considerable overlap between these two groups. These examinations provide a way of understanding why these poems are so striking, and have impacted so strongly on readers through the ages.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Roman poetry; persecution of Christians; reader response</field><field name="subject">Prudentius, b. 348.

This thesis evaluates the ecological roles of these reintroduced species and their relationship to ecosystem functioning and the restoration of these ecosystems. Surveys of foraging diggings and soil seed banks, and dietary analysis were used to measure impacts of these species on three main habitats within the Reserve. The results showed that bilbies and bettongs have three major roles in ecosystem functioning: consumers, ecosystem engineers, and dispersers of seeds and fungi. Both bilbies and bettongs were omnivorous, though their diets were distinctly different, with the bilbies focused more on invertebrates and seeds, while the bettongs consumed a greater proportion of coarser plant materials. The seed portion of the diets of both species during 2003-04 differed from a similar study three years previously, shortly after the animals had been reintroduced to Arid Recovery in 2000- 01. During 2003-04, the bilbies consumed a lower proportion of seeds of species of grasses and more of forbs, while seed consumption by bettongs narrowed to be almost exclusively the seeds of shrubs. The number of bilby and bettong diggings varied significantly both spatially and temporally, with averages of 7,530 &#177; 820 diggings ha-1 in Dunes, 10,560 &#177; 980 diggings ha-1 in Mulga, and 7,120 &#177; 610 diggings ha-1 in Swale. This resulted in an average of 2 to 3% disturbance of soil surface area, which is similar to or higher than reported for other Australian or overseas semi-fossorial species. The temporal variation in rates of digging was correlated with minimum daily temperatures and rainfall but not moonlight. This variation was also correlated with counts of bilby but not bettong tracks, suggesting that the temporal variability of diggings was related to levels of bilby activity. The persistence of bilby and bettong diggings differed between the three habitat types, with the majority of the diggings in the Mulga (94%) and Swale (87%) persisting for over 12 months, while Dune diggings filled much faster, with only 15% persisting over 12 months. These diggings were shown to accumulate and bury seeds and litter, and, under some conditions, enhance germination. The seeds of two plant species, the annual grass, Dactyloctenium radulans, and the shrub, Enchylaena tomentosa, germinated from bilby faecal pellets, and over a third of bilby faecal pellets contained fungal spores. Therefore bilbies have the potential to be dispersers of both seeds and fungi. All three major roles of the bilbies and bettongs in ecosystem functioning (consumers, ecosystem engineers, and dispersers of seeds and fungi) have the potential to affect the flows of organic, soil and water resources, and therefore vegetation structure and overall productivity. Soil seed bank densities differed between areas with and without bilbies and bettongs. However, the heterogeneity of the system made it difficult to confidently relate these differences to any particular effects of the bilbies and bettongs. Both bilbies and bettongs were able to locate and dig seeds buried 20 cm deep, and the caches of seed-harvester ants. Experiments showed that in areas of high digging density, 71 to 94% of seed rain accumulated and became buried in diggings. Since bilbies and bettongs have the potential to use buried seed resources, they have the potential to significantly affect soil seed banks through their consumption of seeds, redistribution of seeds through their digging activities and their interactions with other granivorous species. This study is a first step towards understanding the roles of reintroducing CWR mammals to arid ecosystems. Possible longer term effects of these reintroductions will depend on suitable regulation of animal numbers, and climatic patterns, as restorative effects of diggings would be greatest during periods of good rainfall, whereas droughts would slow restorative processes. Although the results of this research are unique for Arid Recovery, the principles of evaluating all major ecological roles of reintroduced species and their interactions with their environment could provide guidance for other reintroductions. These interactions are complex and would require longer-term studies over a range of conditions and locations to further understand the role of reintroducing CWR mammals to ecological restoration.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greater Bilby; Burrowing Bettong; Foraging digging; Soil seed bank</field><field name="subject">Macrotis lagotis -- South Australia</field><field name="subject">Bettongs -- South Australia</field><field name="subject">Soil seed banks</field><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-linear individual and interaction phenomena associated with fatigue crack growth.</field><field name="creator">Codrington, John David</field><field name="description">The fatigue of materials and structures is a subject that has been under investigation for almost 160 years; yet reliable fatigue life predictions are still more of an empirical art than a science. The traditional safe-life approach to fatigue design is based upon the total time to failure of a virtually defect free component. This approach is heavily reliant on the use of safety factors and empirical equations, and therefore much scatter in the fatigue life predictions is normally observed. Furthermore, the safe-life approach is unsuitable for many important applications such as aircraft, pressure vessels, welded structures, and microelectronic devices. In these applications the existence of initial defects is practically unavoidable and the time of propagation from an initial defect to final failure is comparable with the total life of the component. In the early 1970&#8217;s, the aircraft industry pioneered a new approach for the analysis of fatigue crack growth, known as damage tolerant design. This approach utilises fracture mechanics principles to consider the propagation of fatigue cracks from an initial crack length until final fracture, or a critical crack length, is reached. Since the first implementation of damage tolerant design, much research and development has been undertaken. In particular, theoretical and experimental fracture mechanics techniques have been utilised for the investigation of a wide variety of fatigue crack growth phenomena. One such example is the retardation and acceleration in crack growth rate caused by spike overloads or underloads. It is generally accepted, however, that the current level of understanding of fatigue crack growth phenomena and the adequacy of fatigue life prediction techniques are still far from satisfactory. This thesis theoretically investigates various non-linear individual and interaction phenomena associated with fatigue crack growth. Specifically, the effect of plate thickness on crack growth under constant amplitude loading, crack growth retardation due to an overload cycle, and small crack growth from sharp notches are considered. A new semianalytical method is developed for the investigations, which utilises the distributed dislocation technique and the well-known concept of plasticity-induced crack closure. The effects of plate thickness are included through the use of first-order plate theory and a fundamental solution for an edge dislocation in plate of arbitrary thickness. Numerical results are obtained via the application of Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature and an iterative procedure. The developed methods are verified against previously published theoretical and experimental data. The elastic out-of-plane stress and displacement fields are first investigated using the developed method and are found to be in very good agreement with past experimental results and finite element simulations. Crack tip plasticity is then introduced by way of a strip-yield model. The effects of thickness on the crack tip plasticity zone and plasticity-induced crack closure are studied for both small and large-scale yielding conditions. It is shown that, in general, an increase in plate thickness will lead to a reduction in the extent of the plasticity and associated crack closure, and therefore an increase in the crack growth rates. This observation is in agreement with many findings of past experimental and theoretical studies. An incremental crack growth scheme is implemented into the developed method to allow for the investigation of variable amplitude loading and small fatigue crack growth. The case of a single tensile overload is first investigated for a range of overload ratios and plate thicknesses. This situation is of practical importance as an overload cycle can significantly increase the service life of a cracked component by temporarily retarding the crack growth. Next to be studied is growth of physically small cracks from sharp notches. Fatigue cracks typically initiate from stress concentrations, such as notches, and can grow at rates higher than as predicted for a long established crack. This can lead to non-conservative estimates for the total fatigue life of a structural component. For both the overload and small crack cases, the present theoretical predictions correlate well with past experimental results for a range of materials. Furthermore, trends observed in the experiments match those of the predictions and can be readily explained through use of crack closure arguments. This thesis is presented in the form of a collection of published or submitted journal articles that are the result of research by the author. These nine articles have been chosen to best demonstrate the development and application of the new theoretical techniques.

Real soil profiles are often multi-layered with material constantly varying with depth, which affects the footing response significantly. Furthermore, the properties of the soil are known to vary with location. The spatial variability of soil can be described by random field theory and geostatistics. The research presented in this thesis focuses on quantifying the effect of soil variability on the bearing capacity of rough strip footings on single and two layered, purely-cohesive, spatially variable soil profiles. This has been achieved by using Monte Carlo analysis, where the rough strip footings are founded on simulated soil profiles are analysed using finite element limit analysis. The simulations of virtual soil profiles are carried out using Local Average Subdivision (LAS), a numerical model based on the random field theory. An extensive parametric study has been carried out and the results of the analyses are presented as normalized means and coefficients of variation of bearing capacity factor, and comparisons between different cases are presented. The results indicate that, in general, the mean of the bearing capacity reduces as soil variability increases and the worst case scenario occurs when the correlation length is in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 times the footing width. The problem of estimating the bearing capacity of shallow strip footings founded on multi-layered soil profiles is very complex, due to the incomplete knowledge of interactions and relationships between parameters. Much research has been carried out on single- and two-layered homogeneous soil profiles. At present, the inaccurate weighted average method is the only technique available for estimating the bearing capacity of footing on soils with three or more layers. In this research, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to develop meta-models for bearing capacity estimation. ANNs are numerical modelling techniques that imitate the human brain capability to learn from experience. This research is limited to shallow strip footing founded on soil mass consisting of ten layers, which are weightless, purely cohesive and cohesive-frictional. A large number of data has been obtained by using finite element limit analysis. These data are used to train and verify the ANN models. The shear strength (cohesion and friction angle), soil thickness, and footing width are used as model inputs, as they are influencing factors of bearing capacity of footings. The model outputs are the bearing capacities of the footings. The developed ANN-based models are then compared with the weighted average method. Hand-calculation design formulae for estimation of bearing capacity of footings on ten-layered soil profiles, based on the ANN models, are presented. It is shown that the ANN-based models have the ability to predict the bearing capacity of footings on ten-layered soil profiles with a high degree of accuracy, and outperform traditional methods.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil variability; Bearnig capacity; Artificial neural network</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics.</field><field name="subject">Foundations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of the transmitted dose in an EPID using a Monte Carlo method.</field><field name="creator">Pham, Thuc M.</field><field name="description">The BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc codes from EGSnrc Monte Carlo (MC) system are considered to be the gold standards for simulating radiotherapy linear accelerators and resulting dose depositions (Rogers, Faddegon et al. 1995). The aim of this project was to setup the EGSnrc system for the simulation of the linear accelerator (linac) head and a Scanning Liquid Ionisation Chamber (SLIC) Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) for calculations of transmitted dose in the EPID. The project was divided into two parts. The head of a 6 MV Varian 600C/D photon linac was first simulated by BEAMnrc. The modelling parameters such as the electron beam energy and the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the electron spatial distribution were adjusted until the absorbed dose profiles and the Percentage Depth Dose (PDD) curves, in general agreed better than the measured profiles and PDDs by 2%. The X-ray beam obtained from the modelled linac head was used for the simulation of the transmitted dose in the EPID in the second part of the project. The EPID was simulated by DOSXYZnrc based on the information obtained from Spezi and Lewis 2002 (Spezi and Lewis 2002), who also modelled the Varian SLIC EPID (MK2 Portal Vision system, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). The comparisons between the measured and the simulated transmitted doses were carried out for three different phantom setups consisting of an open field, homogeneous water equivalent phantom and a humanoid phantom (RANDO). These phantom setups were designed so that the accuracy of the MC method for simulating absorbed dose in air, homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantoms could be assessed. In addition, the simulated transmitted dose in an EPID was also compared with values obtained from the Pinnacle treatment planning system (v6.2b, Phillips Medical Systems). In the process of selecting the electron beam energy and FWHM, it was confirmed (Sheikh-Bagheri and Rogers 2002; Keall, Siebers et al. 2003) that the variation of the electron beam FWHM and energy influenced the beam profiles strongly. The PDD was influenced by the electron beam energy less strongly. The increase in the energy led to the increase in the depth of maximum dose. However, the effect could not be observed until the energy change of 0.2 MeV was made. Based on the analysis of the results, it was found that the combination of FWHM and energy of 1.3 mm and 5.7 MeV provided the best match between the measured and MC simulated beam profiles and PDDs. It can be concluded that an accuracy of 1.5% can be achieved in the simulation of the linac head using Monte Carlo method. In the comparison between the Monte Carlo and the measured transmitted dose maps, agreements of 2% were found for both the open field and homogeneous water equivalent phantom setups. The same agreements were also found for the comparison between Monte Carlo and Pinnacle transmitted dose maps for these setups. In the setup where the humanoid phantom RANDO was introduced in between the radiation field and the EPID, a general agreement of about 5% found for the comparison between Monte Carlo and measured transmitted dose maps. Pinnacle and measured transmitted dose map was also compared for this setup and the same agreement was found.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transmitted dose; Monte Carlo; Linear accelerator; EPID</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic characterization and QTL mapping for grain fructan in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Bao Lam</field><field name="description">Fructans are polysaccharides that are made up mainly of fructose. They are non-digestible carbohydrates and act as prebiotics to selectively promote the growth of colonic bifidobacteria, thereby improving human gut health. Fructans are present in the grain of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a staple food crop. Until now, there has been no research on genetic improvement of the concentration of fructans in wheat grain, partly because it has been difficult to accurately measure. One aim of this research project was to develop a simple and effective method to measure the fructan concentration in wheat grain. This was achieved by modifying a method that involves extraction of fructans from wheat grain followed by enzymatic hydrolysis to break down fructans into monosaccharides and quantification by anion-exchange liquid chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection. The modified procedure is reliable and allows the handling of large numbers of flour samples at a relatively low cost, and can therefore be useful for assessing large numbers of wheat breeding lines. Using this method, grain samples taken from a diverse set of 117 wheat cultivars and breeding lines, including parents of mapping populations, were analysed for grain fructan concentration. There was significant genotypic variation among these materials, with grain fructan concentration ranging from 0.3 to 2.3% of grain dry weight. There was no evidence of strong genotype-byenvironment interaction; the fructan concentrations of the same genotypes were positively correlated over different environments in Australia. Genetic mapping was carried out to detect and map loci affecting grain fructan concentration in wheat using a doubled haploid population derived from a cross between Berkut (high fructan) and Krichauff (low fructan). Grain samples were obtained from two field sites in South Australia and one in Kazakhstan. Fructan concentration varied widely within the population (0.6-2.6% of grain dry weight), with heritability estimated as h&#178; = 0.71. A linkage map of 528 molecular markers covering 21 wheat chromosomes was used for locating quantitative trait loci (QTL). Genetic mapping identified two major QTLs on chromosomes 6D and 7A, with the (high fructan concentration) alleles contributed from Berkut, contributing to a 30-40% increase in wheat grain fructan compared to the Krichauff alleles. Effects of these chromosome regions were validated in additional environments and in another mapping population, Sokoll/Krichauff, with the favourable alleles contributed from Sokoll. The major QTL on chromosome 7A was in the same region with a reported fructosyltransferase orthologue (AB029888), while the major QTL on chromosome 6D seemed to be co-located with a reported gene encoding for a fructan-degrading enzyme 1-exohydrolase (1-FEHw2). It is concluded that grain fructan concentration of wheat can be improved by breeding and that molecular markers could be used to select effectively for favourable alleles in two regions of the wheat genome.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fructan; biofortification; prebiotics; Quantitative Trait Loci; wheat; QTL; molecular cereal breeding</field><field name="subject">Wheat Genetics</field><field name="subject">Fructans</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of smoking on concentrations of RANKL and OPG in human gingival crevicular fluid.</field><field name="creator">Tang, Teck Huah</field><field name="description">Background and Objective: Smoking is one of the major risk factors for chronic periodontitis. However, the mechanisms involved in tissue degradation due to cigarette smoking are not clear. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are a system of molecules that regulate bone resorption. The aim of this study was to compare the levels of soluble RANKL (sRANKL), OPG and their relative ratio in GCF among periodontitis patients with varying smoking histories. Material and Methods: GCF samples were collected from 149 periodontitis patients who were never smokers (n=58), former smokers (n=39) and current smokers (n=52). sRANKL and OPG concentrations in GCF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: sRANKL, OPG and their relative ratio were not statistically significant among the never smokers, former smokers and current smokers. However, OPG was significantly reduced and subsequently the sRANKL:OPG ratio was significantly increased in the high pack-years group as compared with never smokers. The positive correlation between packyears and sRANKL:OPG ratio was statistically significant even after adjusting for age and current smoking status. Conclusion: Increased lifetime exposure to cigarette smoking above a minimum threshold suppresses OPG production and leads to increased sRANKL:OPG. This may partially explain increased bone loss in smoking-related periodontitis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">periodontics; smoking</field><field name="subject">Gingival fluid.</field><field name="subject">Smoking Health aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A neurobiological and computational analysis of target discrimination in visual clutter by the insect visual system.</field><field name="creator">Wiederman, Steven</field><field name="description">Some insects have the capability to detect and track small moving objects, often against cluttered moving backgrounds. Determining how this task is performed is an intriguing challenge, both from a physiological and computational perspective. Previous research has characterized higher-order neurons within the fly brain known as 'small target motion detectors&#8216; (STMD) that respond selectively to targets, even within complex moving surrounds. Interestingly, these cells still respond robustly when the velocity of the target is matched to the velocity of the background (i.e. with no relative motion cues). We performed intracellular recordings from intermediate-order neurons in the fly visual system (the medulla). These full-wave rectifying, transient cells (RTC) reveal independent adaptation to luminance changes of opposite signs (suggesting separate 'on&#8216; and 'off&#8216; channels) and fast adaptive temporal mechanisms (as seen in some previously described cell types). We show, via electrophysiological experiments, that the RTC is temporally responsive to rapidly changing stimuli and is well suited to serving an important function in a proposed target-detecting pathway. To model this target discrimination, we use high dynamic range (HDR) natural images to represent 'real-world&#8216; luminance values that serve as inputs to a biomimetic representation of photoreceptor processing. Adaptive spatiotemporal high-pass filtering (1st-order interneurons) shapes the transient 'edge-like&#8216; responses, useful for feature discrimination. Following this, a model for the RTC implements a nonlinear facilitation between the rapidly adapting, and independent polarity contrast channels, each with centre-surround antagonism. The recombination of the channels results in increased discrimination of small targets, of approximately the size of a single pixel, without the need for relative motion cues. This method of feature discrimination contrasts with traditional target and background motion-field computations. We show that our RTC-based target detection model is well matched to properties described for the higher-order STMD neurons, such as contrast sensitivity, height tuning and velocity tuning. The model output shows that the spatiotemporal profile of small targets is sufficiently rare within natural scene imagery to allow our highly nonlinear 'matched filter&#8216; to successfully detect many targets from the background. The model produces robust target discrimination across a biologically plausible range of target sizes and a range of velocities. We show that the model for small target motion detection is highly correlated to the velocity of the stimulus but not other background statistics, such as local brightness or local contrast, which normally influence target detection tasks. From an engineering perspective, we examine model elaborations for improved target discrimination via inhibitory interactions from correlation-type motion detectors, using a form of antagonism between our feature correlator and the more typical motion correlator. We also observe that a changing optimal threshold is highly correlated to the value of observer ego-motion. We present an elaborated target detection model that allows for implementation of a static optimal threshold, by scaling the target discrimination mechanism with a model-derived velocity estimation of ego-motion. Finally, we investigate the physiological relevance of this target discrimination model. We show that via very subtle image manipulation of the visual stimulus, our model accurately predicts dramatic changes in observed electrophysiological responses from STMD neurons.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small target motion detection; insect vision; feature discrimination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Progressive albitisation in the "Migmatite Creek" region, Weekeroo Inlier, Curnamona.</field><field name="creator">Yang, Cheng Lin</field><field name="description">Albitisation is pervasive and intense in the Curnamona Province. Most FeO-Cu-Au-U-REE deposits are associated with sodic alteration or albitisation (alkaline alteration) worldwide. The minor Cu-Au-U-REE mineralisation occurs in the large albitisation system in the Curnamona Province. Progressive albitisation allows us to demonstrate the mobility of metals linked to mineralisation in the Migmatite Creek, Weekeroo Inliers, Curnamona Province. Lithological and thematic mapping of albitisation intensities distinguishing low-, medium-, and high- grade albitisation was carried out in the Migmatite Creek area using ArcGIS mapping tools. Progressive albitisation was investigated using whole rock, electron microprobe and Laser Ablation ICPMS analytical methods to establish major, trace and rare earth element variation on a range of scales in bulk samples and individual mineral phases. Albitisation is structurally controlled by OD3 antiformal folds and development of a network of breccias creating pathways of fluid flow. Intensities of albitisation decrease from antiformal to synformal fold hinges. Mass balance estimates, using isocons allow a semi-quantitative view of the evolution of fluid and rock compositions and the mobility of elements during progressive albitisation. The evolution of temperature was independently identified by using mineral geothermometers. Mobility of rare earth element (REE) resulted in extreme changes of REE patterns during progressive albitisation. The initial albitisation fluids were identified in the range of hypersaline (approximately 30 wt% equi. NaCl) with the NaCl rich - CO&#8322; - KCl - MgCl&#8322; &#177; Al(OH)[SUBSCRIPT]x &#177; CaCl&#8322; - H&#8322;O was related to regional fluids of metamorphism and migmatisation. 87 % of Eu and 99% of La were removed from psammites to fluids during high intensity albitisation. Most of the siderophile elements, Ni, Co, Cr, Mn and Mo, as well as Zn, Ba and Sr, were removed from unaltered rock to the fluids in the area. The chemical equilibria of fluid/rock reaction were completely attained between quartz and albite during high&#8211;medium intensity albitisation against uncompleted equilibria in low intensity albitisation. New albite +quartz + accessory minerals replaced the original quartz + feldspars + biotite + magnetite assemblages. Progressive albitisation resulted in evolution of fluids and then lead to a secondary stage biotite alteration and a weak quartz alteration (inserted quartz veins). Fe &#8211; U &#8211; REE elements were extremely removed from all types of lithologies (metasediments and pegmatites and amphibolites) during progressive albitisation. A highly charged, metal fluid was formed during albitisation. Albitisation has great potential as a source process for mineralisation and from its characteristics shows links to the IOCG-REE systems.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">albitisation; mobility; Weekeroo Inlier; Curnamona</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and cellular mechanisms of increased angiogenesis in multiple myeloma : a role for CXCL12.</field><field name="creator">Martin, Sally K.</field><field name="description">Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable haematological malignancy characterised by the clonal proliferation of plasma cells (PCs) within the bone marrow (BM). MM PC survival and expansion is dependent upon an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients, and increased BM angiogenesis is a critical feature of MM progression. While MM PCs express and secrete a number of angiogenic factors, our current understanding of the precise mechanisms by which MM-induced angiogenesis occurs is incomplete. In this study, we collected specimens from patients with MM and the benign precursor condition MGUS, and demonstrated for the first time that circulating levels of the CXCL12 chemokine positively correlate with the degree of BM angiogenesis. Using conditioned media from a MM PC line, the contribution of MM PC-derived CXCL12 to angiogenesis was also examined and found to strongly induce vascular tube formation in vitro. In several other cell types, hypoxia has been shown to up-regulate CXCL12 expression. Studies investigating the hypoxic regulation of CXCL12 in MM PCs revealed that, while acute hypoxia is unable to stimulate CXCL12 expression, prolonged hypoxia significantly up-regulates CXCL12 mRNA and protein expression. To determine the mechanism(s) responsible for this, over-expression and RNA interference technology was employed to create genetically modified MM cells in which either HIF-1&#945; or HIF-2&#945; were overexpressed or knocked down. These studies showed that HIF-2&#945; is the predominant mediator of the hypoxic induction of CXCL12 in MM PCs. The ability of HIF-2&#945; to bind to the CXCL12 promoter was confirmed using EMSA and ChIP analyses. The role of CXCL12 in in vivo angiogenesis and the contribution of HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; were also examined. In these studies, transduced MM cells, in which HIF-1&#945;, HIF-2&#945; and CXCL12 were over-expressed or knocked down, were implanted into a vessel-poor, subcutaneous environment in immunocompromised mice. Tumour-induced angiogenesis was assessed after two weeks by measuring the haemoglobin content of excised implants. These studies confirmed that over-expression of CXCL12, HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; each stimulates a strong angiogenic response. Using the well-characterised CXCR4 antagonist, T140, CXCL12 was found to play a key role in the increased angiogenesis observed in response to HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; over-expression. These novel studies have shown that CXCL12 is an important mediator of angiogenesis in MM patients, and that aberrant CXCL12 expression by MM PCs is due, in part, to its hypoxic up-regulation mediated predominantly by HIF-2.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CXCL12; angiogenesis; multiple myeloma; SDF; hypoxia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating bacterial biofilms in chronic Rhinosinusitis : an in vitro study, in vivo animal study and a examination of biofilms in human CRS.</field><field name="creator">Kien, Ha Rach</field><field name="description">Introduction Bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS). This thesis consists of a number of separate studies. The results of each study were designed to help provide an evolution of knowledge that could be applied to our subsequent investigations on the topic of bacterial biofilms and chronic rhinosinusitis. In vitro studies were utilized to document the capacity of CRS bacteria to form biofilms as well as to investigate the efficacy of various antimicrobials at high concentrations. Additionally, an in vivo sheep model was developed to examine different biofilm detection techniques. Finally, a study of CRS patients was conducted to investigate the incidence of biofilm related sinus disease. Methods Our in vitro studies used 96 well crystal violet microtiter plate assays to determine the biofilm growth characteristics of S.aureus isolated from patients with CRS. Established biofilms were then subjected various antimicrobial agents, and the degree of biofilm reduction calculated to examine their potential for sinus biofilm treatment. A sheep sinusitis model involved performing endoscopic sinus surgery, occlusion of frontal sinus ostia and the introduction of bacteria. Mucosal specimens were subsequently examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). CSLM was also used in a prospective study to document the presence bacterial biofilms on the mucosa of patients with CRS compared to controls. Results The findings of in vitro experiments revealed that not all isolates were capable of forming biofilms. Of the antibiotics tested, only Mupirocin was capable of reducing biofilm mass by 90% in all isolates. The animal model showed considerable variation in biofilm detection rates. The CSLM biofilm detection rate was 100% in obstructed sinuses with bacteria introduced, whereas TEM detected only 66%. Both these objective measures failed to identify biofilms in control groups. SEM found biofilms in all experimental groups including controls. CSLM analysis of CRS patients found Bacterial biofilms in 44% and no biofilms in controls. Conclusion The demonstration of biofilms in the sheep model for sinusitis and biofilms on the mucosal specimens of patients with CRS, and the ability of bacteria in CRS to form biofilms in vitro, further supports the hypothesis that biofilms play a role in the pathogenesis of CRS. CSLM is the modality of choice in documenting the presence of bacterial biofilms on sinus mucosal surfaces due to the inherent flaws of sampling error and subjectivity of TEM and SEM. Finally, CRS is a multi-factorial disease, topical Mupirocin via nasal irrigation may be a therapeutic option in patients with likely S.aureus biofilms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronic rhinosinusitis; biofilms; CRS; bacterial biofilms;in-vitro; in-vivo</field><field name="subject">sinusitis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resistance, wave-making and wave-decay of thin ships, with emphasis on the effects of viscosity.</field><field name="creator">Lazauskas, Leo Victor</field><field name="description">Three interrelated topics in ship hydrodynamics - resistance, wave-making and wave decay - are investigated in an attempt to improve the accuracy of some simple methods used in the preliminary design of thin ships. Several published sets of data from classical and recent boundary layer experiments on flat plates are used to estimate boundary layer quantities such as thicknesses and eddy viscosities. These quantities are subsequently used to modify the hull shape and the free-surface boundary condition as a means of including viscous effects on wave-making and ship-wave decay. A recent technique is used to analyse 161 experimental flat-plate turbulent boundary layer velocity profiles, and a new skin-friction line is derived. Some practical methods are proposed for the numerical quadrature of integrals arising in thin-ship hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that for some integrals, rapid oscillation, rather than being a hindrance to accurate quadrature, can actually be beneficial if appropriate techniques are employed. We find that boundary layer displacement thickness effects on wave resistance are very small and can be safely ignored for full-size vessels. On the other hand, the idea of a detachment layer, an indication of where the boundary layer begins to thicken rapidly, is shown to have a significant effect on wave resistance. A modification to the Kelvin free-surface boundary condition is used as a means of including viscous effects on wave-making. Detailed comparisons of total resistance predictions and experiments are made for three model-size Wigley hulls. It is shown that inclusion of viscous effects smooths out the well-known humps and hollows in the wave resistance curves calculated using Michell's (inviscid) integral. Predictions of the total resistance of a model Wigley hull using Michell's integral and a simple skin-friction line are shown to be as good as those of a modern CFD computer code. Furthermore, the simple method does so in a very small time on an inexpensive computer. The effect of employing a form factor on the skin-friction is shown to improve correlations between resistance predictions and experiments. It has recently been proposed that a form factor should also be applied to the wave resistance. We show that good predictions are indeed possible, but that the use of a modified form of Michell's integral and an &#8220;appropriate" value of the eddy viscosity leads to even better agreement. Two existing wave-decay models are examined and a new formulation is suggested that combines the theoretical &#8211; 1/2 decay rate of transverse waves with the -1/3 decay rate of diverging waves. The effects of viscosity on ship-wave decay are considered. It is found that large values of the viscosity, of the order required to have a significant effect on wave resistance, lead to an over-damping of far-field waves at low Froude numbers. We show that it may be possible to get a rough estimate of the (ambient) eddy viscosity from an analysis of the decay of ship-waves with transverse distance from the sailing line, without resorting to computationally expensive Fourier transform methods. Three wave decay models are used to estimate the eddy viscosity from the behaviour of the wave decay. The model that uses the theoretical decay rates of transverse and of diverging waves is found to be slightly better at recapturing the original eddy viscosity than the other two models.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ship hydrodynamics; viscosity; resistance; wave decay</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International trade agreements.</field><field name="creator">Wei, Zhang</field><field name="description">In recent years, the use of the mode of regional trade liberalisation has proliferated, while the multilateral talks through the WTO have proceeded slowly, resulting in a debate on the role of bilateral and multilateral trade liberalisation. This thesis aims to provide new insights to this debate by studying the welfare effects of different types of trade agreements and the equilibrium outcome(s) of trade negotiation. We apply the three-country and three-good &#8220;competing-exporters model" developed by Bagwell and Staiger (1999) as our basic trade framework. By comparing the equilibrium welfare of each country under different structures of trading blocs, we clarify the welfare impacts of each trade agreement. Then we model the process of trade negotiation as a trade negotiation game, in which each country endogenously decides whether to negotiate through multilateral or bilateral trade liberalisation. By solving the equilibrium of the game, the stable structure of trading blocs and the path(s) to reach it can be found. We start with a framework in which all countries are welfare maximising. We find that at the early stage of trade negotiation, a free trade agreement (FTA) is Pareto welfare improving, despite the fact that member countries benefit more than any non-member. Although being the hub is the best position, a spoke is in a worse position than being outside a single FTA. Thus, a &#8220;hub-and-spoke" structure cannot be achieved and the unique equilibrium outcome of trade negotiation is given by multilateral free trade (MFT) through a multilateral trade agreement (MTA). The welfare-maximising analysis is followed by the examination of cases in which each government is politically motivated. The political structure we use is similar to Ornelas (2005), which follows the basic framework developed by Grossman and Helpman (1995), emphasising the interaction between lobby groups representing the special interest of one industry and the government in their home country. We first consider a circumstance where the political pressures are only from the import- competing sector. It is then generalised to a case in which all sectors are allowed to lobby the local government. Furthermore, the analysis is extended into an asymmetric world that includes two big countries and one small country. Our results show that political economy forces usually reduce the likelihood of forming trade agreements and that when the political concerns are sufficiently large, all trade agreements can be prevented by political pressures. Also, our findings suggest that the option of bilateral FTAs does not cause an initially infeasible MFT to become feasible, while a previously feasible MFT is likely to be blocked by the option of FTAs. Thus, our thesis provides some evidence to support the argument that the formation of FTAs can be a &#8220;stumbling block" for global trade liberalisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bilateral trade agreements; multilateral trade liberalisation; political economy</field><field name="subject">International trade.</field><field name="subject">Foreign trade regulation.</field><field name="subject">Commercial treaties.</field><field name="subject">Tariff Law and legislation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loop groups, Higgs fields and generalised string classes.</field><field name="creator">Vozzo, Raymond</field><field name="description">We consider various generalisations of the string class of a loop group bundle. The string class is the obstruction to lifting a bundle whose structure group is the loop group LG to one whose structure group is the Kac-Moody central extension of the loop group. We develop a notion of higher string classes for bundles whose structure group is the group of based loops, &#937;G. In particular, we give a formula for characteristic classes in odd dimensions for such bundles which are associated to characteristic classes for G-bundles in the same way that the string class is related to the first Pontrjagyn class of a certain G-bundle associated to the loop group bundle in question. This provides us with a theory of characteristic classes for &#937;G-bundles analogous to Chern-Weil theory in finite dimensions.

This thesis aims to show how narrative in general, and in particular in the novels of French Lebanese writer, Amin Maalouf, plays a crucial role in the transmission of collective memory. The thesis demonstrates that narrative fulfills this function in three ways. Firstly, narrative gives meaning to past events. Secondly, narrative changes and evolves over time. Lastly, narrative ensures a continual exchange between individual and collective memory. Thus, in its capacity to sustain aspects of individual and collective memory, narrative expresses the values that unite society. Central to our analysis of narrative in the work of Amin Maalouf is the concept of "l'autre c&#244;t&#233;" or "the other side". This is the expression used by Maalouf when referring to his passion for forgotten or uncomfortable aspects of Western and Arab cultural heritage. By informing the contemporary reader of the shared past, Maalouf strives to build bridges of understanding between the two groups. Maalouf's novels explore themes of origins, of exile and of memory. In the three novels we examine, the narrative is centered on the life of the hero who, endowed with exceptional qualities, is tested by the political and religious challenges of his time. The personal qualities of the hero, revealed in his dealings with the crises which form the particularity of his time, determine the orientation of collective memory. The first novel, L&#233;on l'Africain, published in 1986, is based on the life of Hassan al-Wazzan who lived in Spain, Africa and Rome in the early sixteenth century. Hassan tells the story of his family, and of the political circumstances which led to the expulsion of the Arabs from Spain. The second novel, Les Jardins de lumi&#232;re, published in 1991, examines the life of the poet, doctor and philosopher named Mani who lived in the third century A.D. In the Epilogue of the novel, the narrator states his intention of challenging the misconceptions and distortions concerning the life of Mani. In the third novel, Le Rocher de Tanios, published in 1993, the narrator sets out to find the truth concerning the events surrounding the birth, life and disappearance of the young man named Tanios, who lived in the narrator's village in Lebanon at the beginning of the nineteenth century.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social memory; francophone; literature; identity; history and fiction; narrative stucture</field><field name="subject">Maalouf, Amin Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the induction of neuroplastic changes in human motor cortex.</field><field name="creator">Sale, Martin V.</field><field name="description">The human primary motor cortex (M1) undergoes structural and functional change throughout life by a process known as neuroplasticity. Techniques which artificially induce neuroplastic changes are seen as potential adjunct therapies for neurological conditions reliant on neuroplasticity for recovery of function. Unfortunately, the reported improvements in function when these techniques have been used in combination with regular rehabilitation have so far been inconsistent. One reason attributed to this is the large variability in effectiveness of these techniques in inducing neuroplastic change. This thesis has investigated factors influencing the effectiveness and reproducibility of neuroplasticity induction in human M1 using several experimental paradigms. The effectiveness and reproducibility of inducing neuroplasticity in human M1 using two variants of a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol was investigated in the first set of experiments (Chapter 2). Both protocols repeatedly paired a peripheral electrical stimulus to the median nerve of the left wrist with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered 25 ms later to the contralateral M1. Neuroplastic changes were quantified by comparing the amplitude of the muscle evoked potential (MEP) recorded in abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle by suprathreshold TMS prior to and following PAS. With both protocols, neuroplasticity induction was more effective, and the responses across sessions more reproducible, if the experiments were performed in the afternoon compared to the morning. Subsequent experiments confirmed the time of day modulation of PAS-induced neuroplasticity by repeatedly testing twenty-five subjects on two separate occasions, once in the morning (8 am), and once in the evening (8 pm) (Chapter 3). Time of day was also shown to modulate GABAergic inhibition in M1. In a further set of experiments, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated that artificially elevated circulating cortisol levels (with a single oral dose of hydrocortisone) inhibits PAS-induced neuroplasticity in the evening (8 pm), indicating that the time of day modulation of neuroplasticity induction with PAS is due, at least in part, to differences in circulating cortisol levels (Chapter 3). The cortical circuits that are modulated by PAS have also been shown to be important in motor learning. Therefore, the final set of experiments, described in Chapter 4, investigated whether motor-training-related changes in motor performance (and cortical excitability) following a ballistic motor training task are also modulated by time of day. Twenty-two subjects repeatedly abducted their left thumb with maximal acceleration for thirty minutes during two experimental sessions (morning (8 am) and evening (8 pm)) on separate occasions. Motor training improved motor performance, and increased cortical excitability, however these changes were independent of time of day. It may be that the motor training task and/or outcome measures used were not sufficiently sensitive to detect a subtle time of day effect of motor training on motor performance. Alternatively, the normally functioning motor system may be able to compensate for changes in cortical excitability to maintain optimal motor performance. These findings have important implications for therapies reliant on neuroplasticity for recovery of function, and indicate that rehabilitation may be most effective when circulating cortisol levels are low.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plasticity; motor cortex; transcranial magnetic stimulation; circadian</field><field name="subject">Neuroplasticity</field><field name="subject">Motor cortex</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of cosmetic surgery accounts and a proposed counselling framework.</field><field name="creator">Gooden, Rebecca</field><field name="description">The thesis determined predominant themes that surround the topic of cosmetic surgery. On the basis of the findings a thematic counselling framework for cosmetic surgery clinical practice is proposed. A mixed methods design was chosen for this study. A thematic analysis was used to ascertain themes. A quasi-numerative approach was also utilised to establish the relative incidence of themes. Sources of data were media, internet message boards and interviews with men and women about cosmetic surgery. Two overarching themes emerged within the coding process. These were factors that might persuade someone to have and factors that might dissuade someone from having cosmetic surgery. A number of persuading and dissuading sub-themes were identified. Quantitative results demonstrated that within the two overarching themes 58% of the talk was persuasive of, whilst 42% was dissuasive of having cosmetic surgery. Some of the sub-themes found in the thesis were considered to compete with one another. This is evidence that patients have to negotiate conflicting information about cosmetic surgery. The findings of the dissertation are interpreted within a theoretical context. Through applying theories of decision-making and cognitive dissonance, suggestions are made about how health professionals might proceed clinically in counselling with cosmetic surgery patients or those considering having a procedure. The thematic counselling framework proposed within this thesis is intended to assist patients and clinicians with the numerous messages from our social community (societal messages) that shape their relationship to cosmetic surgery.

These conclusions, however, were based on data from few studies in the western GAB which were assumed to reflect conditions throughout the entire GAB. More recent studies have reported the occurrence of coastal upwelling in the eastern GAB (EGAB) during summer/autumn (November-April), characterized by low sea surface temperatures and elevated concentrations of chlorophyll &#945;, which suggests that certain areas of the GAB may be highly productive during certain times of the year. The eastern Great Australian Bight (EGAB) forms part of the Southern and Indian Oceans and is an area of high ecological and economic importance. Although it supports the largest fishery in Australia (the South Australian Sardine fishery, annual catches since 2004 ~ 25,000 to 42,500 t), quantitative estimates of the primary productivity underlying this industry are open to debate. Estimates range from &lt; 100 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185; to &gt; 500 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185;. Part of this variation may be due to the unique upwelling circulation of shelf waters in summer/autumn (November-April), which shares some similarities with highly productive eastern boundary current upwelling systems, but differs due to the influence of a northern boundary current, the Flinders current, and a wide continental shelf. Shelf waters encompass an area of ~115,000 km&#178;, and the diverse coastal topography forms part of one of the longest stretches of southward facing coastline in the world. In summer-autumn, winds are upwelling favourable, and the Flinders current running along the continental slope causes the upwelling of the deep permanent thermocline from around 600 m depth (dynamic uplift), allowing nutrient rich cold water to entrain onto the shelf. In winterspring, the EGAB is dominated by westerly downwelling-favourable winds, and upwelling via the Flinders current is suppressed. Thus, the area is highly dynamic, with significant spatial and temporal variations in meteorology and oceanography which may drive variations in nutrient enrichment and productivity. This study represents the first intensive investigation of the primary and secondary productivity of the EGAB, and was designed to evaluate the general hypothesis that spatial and temporal variations in meteorology and oceanography in the EGAB will drive spatial and temporal variations in phytoplankton size structure, and primary and secondary productivity. It examines variations in primary and secondary productivity in the EGAB during the upwelling and downwelling seasons of 2004, and the upwelling seasons of 2005 and 2006. Daily integral productivity calculated using the vertically generalised production model (VGPM) showed a high degree of spatial variation. Productivity was low (&lt;800 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185;) in offshore central and western regions of the EGAB. High productivities (1600-3900 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185;) were restricted to hotspots in the east that were influenced by the upwelled water mass. There was a strong correlation between the depth of the euphotic zone and the depth of the mixed layer that suggested that ~50% of the euphotic zone lay below the mixed layer depth. As a result, high rates of primary productivity did not require upwelled water to reach the surface. A significant proportion of total productivity in the euphotic zone (57% in 2005 and 65% in 2006) occurred in the upwelled water mass below the surface mixed layer. This result has implications for daily integral productivities modelled with the VGPM, which uses surface measures of phytoplankton biomass to calculate productivity. Macro nutrient concentrations could not be used to explain the difference in the low and high productivities (silica &gt;1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, nitrate/nitrite &gt;0.4 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, phosphate &gt;0.1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;). Mixing patterns or micro-nutrient concentrations are possible explanations for spatial variations in primary productivity in the EGAB. On a global scale, daily rates of primary productivity of the EGAB lie between the highly productive eastern boundary current upwelling systems, and less productive coastal regions of western and south eastern Australia, and the oligotrophic ocean. However, daily productivity rates in the upwelling hotspots of the EGAB rival productivities in Benguela and Humbolt currents. Temporal variation in mixing and primary productivity was examined in upwelling influenced nearshore waters off south western Eyre Peninsula (SWEP) in the EGAB. Mixing/stratification in the region was highly temporally variable due to the unique upwelling circulation in summer/autumn, and downwelling through winter/spring. Highest productivity was associated with pwelled/stratified water (up to 2958 mg C m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185;), with low productivity during periods of downwelling and mixing (~300-550 mg C m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185;), yet no major variations in macro-nutrient concentrations were detected between upwelling and downwelling events (silica &gt;1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, nitrate/nitrite &gt;0.4 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, phosphate &gt;0.1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;). We hypothesise that upwelling enriches the region with micro-nutrients. High productivity off SWEP appears to be driven by a shallowing of mixed layer depth due to the injection of upwelled waters above Z[subscript]cr. Low productivity follows the suppression of enrichment during downwelling/mixing events, and is exacerbated in winter/spring by low irradiances and short daylengths. Phytoplankton abundance and community composition was also examined in the shelf waters of the EGAB. Phytoplankton abundances were generally higher in near shore waters compared with offshore waters, and during the summer/autumn upwelling season compared with the winter/spring downwelling season. Three distinctly different phytoplankton communities were present in the region during the upwelling and downwelling seasons of 2004, and the upwelling season of 2005, with distinctions manifest in variations in the abundance of dominant types of phytoplankton, and differences in average cell sizes. In summer/autumn, waters influenced by upwelling were characterised by high phytoplankton abundances (particularly diatoms) and larger average cell sizes, while the warmer high-nutrientlow- chlorophyll (HNLC) waters in the region had lower phytoplankton abundances and smaller average cell sizes. The winter/spring community was made up of low abundances of relatively large cells. Diatoms always dominated, but evidence of Si limitation of further diatom growth suggests there may be an upper limit to diatom productivity in the region. The maximum observed diatom concentration of ~164,000 cells L&#8315;&#185; occurred in February/March 2004, in an area influenced by the upwelled water mass. Variations in phytoplankton biodiversity in the shelf waters of southern Australia appear to be related to variations in the influence of upwelling in the region. Meso-zooplankton abundance and community composition was examined in the coastal upwelling system of the EGAB. Spatial and temporal variations were influenced by variations in primary productivity and phytoplankton abundance and community composition, which were driven by variations in the influence of upwelling in the region. Peak meso-zooplankton abundances and biomass occurred in the highly productive upwelling influenced nearshore waters of the EGAB. However, abundances were highly variable between regions and years, reflecting the high spatial and temporal variations in primary productivity and phytoplankton abundance that characterise the shelf waters of the region. Spatial and temporal variations in community composition were driven by changes in the abundance of classes of meso zooplankton common to all regions in both years of this study. Meroplanktonic larvae and opportunistic colonizers dominated the community through the upwelling season, in response to increased primary productivity and phytoplankton blooms. Differences in community composition between upwelling influenced waters and the more HNLC regions appear to be reflected in the relative abundances of cladocera and appendicularia, with cladocera more abundant in productive upwelling influenced areas, and appendicularia thriving in the more HNLC regions of the EGAB. Highest potential grazing rates in the EGAB occurred in nearshore regions with highest mesozooplankton biomass, most likely in response to the high phytoplankton biomass that occurs in the same regions. Peak meso-zooplankton grazing rates in the EGAB were ~80% less than those measured in south west Spencer Gulf in March 2007, and ~35% greater than grazing rates in the Huon Estuary in February 2005. Productivity in the EGAB shows significant spatial and temporal variation, with changes reflecting regional and seasonal variation in meteorology and oceanography, and the water masses present in the region. The overall productivity of a summer/autumn upwelling season was highly dependent on within-season variations in wind strength and direction, which dictate the number, intensity, and duration of upwelling events. Rates of primary productivity measured in the EGAB at a given time depended on the meteorological and oceanographic conditions in the region in the lead up to, and during, the sampling event. We hypothesise that during upwelling events, high productivity in the EGAB is driven by the enrichment of waters above Z[subscript]cr, but below the surface mixed layer, with micro-nutrients. Low productivity within summer/autumn upwelling seasons follows the suppression of this enrichment during downwelling/mixing events, and the overall productivity of the upwelling season will depend on the number, duration and intensity of these downwelling/mixing events. Low productivity during winter/spring is driven by the absence of upwelling, low irradiances and short daylengths.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary productivity; coastal upwelling; secondary productivity; mixing; critical depth; phytoplankton; meso-zooplankton</field><field name="subject">Marine plankton Great Australian Bight (W.A. and S.

In Part I of the novel Mary arrives and it soon becomes obvious that her presence is bringing back the deceptions in Grace&#8217;s past. In Part II five years have passed and Grace is struggling to cope with the way she treated Mary. Exploring the myth of &#8220;for their own good&#8221; The Heaven I Swallowed is a tale of the Stolen Generations, told from the perspective of the white perpetrator. The exegesis accompanying the novel, &#8216;Whose Shoes? Writing The Heaven I Swallowed&#8217;, is also divided into two parts. Part I traces my awareness of the Stolen Generation stories and the reasoning behind the decision to narratively take the perspective of a white woman who steals an Aboriginal child. In Part II, I turn to two contemporary literary texts &#8211; Kate Grenville&#8217;s The Secret River and Gail Jones&#8217;s Sorry &#8211; to examine different strategies that the non-indigenous writer might employ to counter-act stereotypical representation of Aboriginality. Further analysis of the novel in the lead up to the final draft is then aided by another two texts: Elizabeth Jolley&#8217;s The Well and Joyce Carol Oates&#8217;s Black Girl/ White Girl. Using these as models &#8211; one in regards to a Gothic re-rendering of the work and the other in regards to the depiction of ambiguous race relations &#8211; I find a way to reconcile myself with the representation of Aboriginality in The Heaven I Swallowed. Finally, I come to the conclusion that the novelist might often travel a great deal away from their original intent but that these footsteps have to be taken to ensure motivations are justified and one&#8217;s conscience is at ease.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative writing; aboriginal representation; stolen generations; Kate Grenville; Gail Jones; World War II; white guilt</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hungry ghosts.</field><field name="creator">Hester, Stephanie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">'Hungry Ghosts' is an account of thirty-six hours of a young woman's life following her arrival in Singapore. Sarah, the protagonist of the novel, is accompanying her partner Paul on a business conference. It is increasingly apparent that Sarah's motives for leaving her home town, Adelaide, have more to do with her need to escape than her commitment to Paul. A room in an international hotel offers Sarah the comforts of a cocoon, where signs of previous occupation and ties to the past are erased on a daily basis. But Sarah is obviously dislocated from her surroundings, which are in turn out of step with the external environment: the air-conditioning is freezing; the orchids are plastic and nod in an artificial breeze. In this sterile environment Sarah is troubled by flashbacks of what she has left behind. Sarah begins to emerge from her cocoon, venturing into a big city that, for her, could be anywhere. She recognizes places generic to big cities as well as a few unique landmarks, becoming aware of the continual and universal tensions of progress and the past. In this way the novel becomes a study of the role of memory, ghosts and the absent dead, all of which play a part in informing Sarah's present and her understanding of the future. At the hotel Sarah encounters a group of war &#8216;pilgrims'. A mother, her son Bradley and an elderly British Army Major are all on a 'pilgrimage', and, in their different ways, all trying to make peace with the past and its insatiable ghosts. As Sarah learns their stories and witnesses the battles they wage, she is forced to challenge her own beliefs about being able to leave traumatic events behind. Her absent mother haunts her on the sun-drenched streets of fast-moving Singapore. A bond begins to form between herself and Bradley who, like Sarah, has been left out-of-whack by a recent calamity. 'Hungry Ghosts' explores several dualities: the claims of the past, both cultural and personal, balanced against the demands of the future; private memories that must be reconciled with the demands of public living and progress; the world of the mind that is dependent on the physical body occupying 'real' space. The novel examines the strangely transitory spaces that people can find themselves in: the liminal areas of grief, travel, dislocation, the unfamiliar. It asks why, in an age of globalisation, the claims of place, and in particular of home, remain so strong. My exegesis, written as three essays, addresses three aspects of my manuscript, &#8216;Hungry Ghosts&#8217;. In the first essay I look at the importance of &#8216;place&#8217; in my novel, and the different types of &#8216;places&#8217; I explore. In the second essay I look at how contemporary theories on war commemoration, coupled with my own research and witnessing of &#8216;actual&#8217; events, have informed my depiction and treatment of the theme of war memory. In my final essay I reflect on the role mourning has played in the development of my manuscript, considering both the challenges it has presented to my narrative and the ways in which it has strengthened it.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative writing; memory; grief; humour; Singapore; Hungry Ghosts Festival; orchids; Changi; World War II</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ghetto Medic: a Father in the &#8217;Hood.</field><field name="creator">Hennick, Rachel</field><field name="description">Ghetto Medic: A Father in the &#8217;Hood, a biographical memoir, examines Baltimore City through the experiences of my father, Bill Hennick, a white paramedic who worked in Baltimore City for over thirty years, beginning his career at the height of the civil rights movement. Numerous stories have been written about African Americans living in slums, struggling to survive, but few are told from the point of view of a white man who endured the traumas of the ghetto while trying to assist them. The Major Work explores what motivated Bill Hennick to risk his life in caring for the poorest of the poor in a city with one of the world&#8217;s highest crime rates. What did he think as he witnessed the devastation of Baltimore as upwardly mobile whites and blacks abandoned the &#8216;wasteland&#8217; and headed for the suburbs? Why did he remain with the underdogs? How did he learn about ghetto culture? How did he win the trust of people in the community who were otherwise suspicious of Caucasians? How did the environment affect him and how did he cope with tragedy? The Major Work also considers whether Bill Hennick survived unscathed. In representing his encounters with an underclass in Baltimore, Ghetto Medic offers a microcosm of race relations and poverty in the United States. It raises questions about the development of the African American ghetto while considering the problem of racial stereotypes, exploring historical influences and offering insight into the chasm that still exists between black and white people. While Bill Hennick bandaged gunshot wounds, gave mouth to mouth resuscitation and assisted in birthing the babies of people who were ignored by the wider community, he tried all the while to provide a stable life for his family, sheltering us from the dangers of his job with his sense of humour. His life as a ghetto medic stands in stark contrast to suburban family life. He began his career wanting to make a difference. But did the ghetto change him? In my exegesis accompanying Ghetto Medic, I have tried to demonstrate how creative nonfiction can be used as a powerful medium in initiating social change and building a bridge between races. The genre liberated me from the constraints of traditional nonfiction while allowing me to preserve factual and historical integrity in the overall work. Because I was attempting to tell someone else&#8217;s story from his point of view, it became necessary and inevitable to understand my responsibilities, roles and rights as a creative nonfiction writer. The exegesis considers the evolution of Ghetto Medic from a dictated autobiography, based on a series of transcribed interviews interspersed with Baltimore&#8217;s history, to a &#8216;biographical memoir&#8217;, including my personal recollections of my father. In this process I became both listener and storyteller. My exegesis describes my experimentation with different points of view, analyses the collaborative process between subject and author and considers the relationship between assumed objectivity and &#8216;truth&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative writing; nonfiction; memoir; biography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reproductive biology and recruitment dynamics of snapper, Chrysophrys auratus.</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Richard James</field><field name="description">The population dynamics and fishery productivity of snapper, Chrysophrys auratus, in South Australia are strongly driven by inter-annual variation in recruitment. This variable recruitment produces the occasional strong year-class which, over a number of years, results in a cycle of increasing and then decreasing biomass. The aim of this study was to develop an understanding of the recruitment dynamics of snapper through a study of the reproductive biology of adults, as well as the biology and ecology of 0+ recruits. Field sampling was done through 2006 to 2008 in northern Spencer Gulf, the region that generally contributes the majority of South Australia&#8217;s snapper catch. The recruitment of 0+ snapper was measured from a study of inter-and intra- annual patterns of distribution and abundance. This was done using two independent trawl sampling regimes, one using a beam trawl and the other an otter trawl, at different times in the settlement season. There was considerable inter-annual variation in abundance of 0+ fish of up to two orders of magnitude and, in some years, almost no recruitment was observed. The spatial pattern of dispersion of recruits was clumped and consistent between years; one area, Western Shoal, always produced the highest catches indicating that it is an important nursery. The effects of the timing of spawning and water temperature on growth patterns of the 0+ snapper collected in the trawl sampling were studied to determine possible impacts on recruitment processes. Growth was studied from age/length regressions and by measuring the widths of microincrements in the sagittal otoliths. Sub-surface water temperature was also logged in the region. Growth rate varied inter- and intra-annually but was not limited by temperature in the pre-settlement period. However, post-settlement growth rate was significantly correlated with water temperature and fish exhibited a dramatic slowing of growth as temperature declined in autumn. Later spawned fish were considerably smaller than earlier spawned fish of the same age, which may have implications for post-settlement survival. The reproductive biology of snapper was studied to determine if annual variation in recruitment was related to egg production. Reproductive samples from northern Spencer Gulf were collected over three seasons (2005/06, 2006/07 and 2007/08) and were analysed macro- and microscopically. Spawning activity was determined by calculating estimates of spawning fraction and batch fecundities. The onset of spawning occurred in November but varied between years and corresponded with times when water temperature was between 18 and 20&#186;C. The length of the spawning season also differed between years. In each year the peak spawning activity occurred during December when fish spawned almost daily. Spawning frequency and relative batch size did not differ between the first two spawning seasons but, in the third season, batch size was considerably greater and spawning fraction lower. However, recruitment was considerably more variable than the annual differences in spawning output could explain. This indicates that mortality processes during the planktonic or early post-settlement period are important in the recruitment dynamics of snapper. The impact of water temperature, lunar cycle and tide on the timing and strength of recruitment was investigated. Pre-settlement duration, spawn dates and settlement dates were determined from the microstructure of the sagittal otoliths of 0+ snapper. The patterns of successful spawning and settlement were determined by back-calculating to the day on which individual recruits were spawned and settled. The frequency distributions of these dates were compared with water temperature, lunar periodicity and the temporal variation in spawning. There was considerable variation within a season in the timing and magnitude of successful recruitment. Strongest recruitment resulted from spawning during December and January on days when water temperatures were between 21 and 23&#186;C but spawning on days in this range did not necessarily result in recruitment. Pre-settlement duration was unaffected by water temperature. Some evidence of lunar periodicity was detected in both the spawn and settlement date frequencies. Importantly, the spawn date frequency distributions of successful 0+ recruits did not correspond with the measured spawning activity of adults as considerable portions of the spawning season in each year did not produce successful recruits. These results indicated that spawning output and water temperature cannot explain the observed magnitude in recruitment variation. Food availability for 0+ snapper has been implicated in their patterns of distribution and abundance in New Zealand and Japan. Stomach contents of 0+ snapper were described as an initial step in developing some understanding of the dispersion of 0+ recruits. In spite of their generalist feeding habit, in the area of highest abundance (Western Shoal), snapper took considerably more polychaetes than elsewhere in northern Spencer Gulf. If polychaetes are more abundant at Western Shoal, this could explain the higher density of 0+ snapper there but insufficient information was available on these animals for northern Spencer Gulf to address this hypothesis. Food availability and/or quality may influence the distribution of 0+ recruits. The multi-species collections from the beam trawls were described to develop an understanding of the spatial dispersion of recruits and their habitat associations. 0+ snapper co-occurred with an assemblage that was characterised by fish and invertebrate species that are associated with mud/soft bottom, but they never occurred with the assemblage of species associated with seagrass, even when recruitment was strongest. This association partly explains the observed distribution pattern, but not all areas of mud/soft bottom had 0+ recruits, even in strong recruitment years. In northern Spencer Gulf, seagrass areas could be excluded from future snapper recruitment surveys. The recruitment dynamics of snapper in northern Spencer Gulf were characterised by dramatic inter-annual variation but a consistent pattern of dispersion. 0+ snapper were concentrated in a few small areas in northern part of the study region. One of these areas, Western Shoal, appears to be very important as a nursery for snapper. Furthermore, the pattern of 0+ snapper dispersion was independent of recruitment strength. The potential magnitude of 0+ snapper recruitment, set by egg production, was altered by mortality during the early life history. Some of this mortality was related to temperature regimes at the time of spawning but this did not explain all the variation in the magnitude and timing of recruitment. Snapper spawning occurred at times with suitable temperature conditions but recruitment did not always result. This indicates the presence of other factor(s) that have substantial influences on mortality in the early life history.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spencer Gulf; assemblage; diet Pagrus</field><field name="subject">Chrysophrys auratus</field><field name="subject">Fishes Reproduction.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender, mobility and population history : exploring material culture distributions in the Upper Sepik and Central New Guinea.</field><field name="creator">Fyfe, Andrew.</field><field name="description">New Guinea is the most linguistically diverse region in the world. There are over 1000 languages found there, reflecting a complex history of migration and interaction. The Upper Sepik is one of New Guinea&#8217;s most linguistically heterogeneous areas but because the area has not been marked by the significant population movement and intense and far-reaching exchange systems apparent for some parts of New Guinea, this diversity may be more indicative of processes that maintain rather than lead to linguistic diversity. Accordingly, the region may offer great potential for those investigating population histories. With this potential in mind ethnographers went into the Upper Sepik during the 1960s and 1970s with the intention of making representative material culture collections for the language groups found there. These collections combine to be, arguably, one of the most fine-grained material culture datasets that exist for New Guinea. This thesis describes the manner in which these collections were documented and used to create a dataset to test for relationships between material culture and language. It begins with an overview of the study area including descriptions of the geography, environments, subsistence systems, settlement structures and social patterns, including an appraisal of marriage exchange, ritual, trade and warfare and how these may have facilitated or inhibited the spread of culture. This appraisal leads to an assertion that the sociality and mobility of men and women are affected differentially by such mechanisms, and that material culture belonging to men and women may differentially reflect population histories and the social processes that underpin the evolution of linguistic diversity. The thesis then describes a round of analytical procedures used to test for relationships between language and attributes belonging to string bags and arrows which are respectively and exclusively produced by women and men. Associations between languages, measured in terms of their material culture similarity, are then compared to those determined according to their linguistic family relationship and their relative positions in geographical space. The analysis also tests whether differences in the way that women and men socialise and move through space influence the way in which material culture patterns through space. The thesis concludes that attributes of classes of material culture are distributed differently for objects made by men compared to those made by women, that distance seems to be a stronger factor than language, and that environmental factors are also relevant. This study foreshadows ongoing research involving the dataset.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Upper Sepik; Central New Guinea; cultural transmission; material culture; gender</field><field name="subject">Ethnology Methodology.</field><field name="subject">Ethnology Papua New Guinea.</field><field name="subject">Sociolinguistics Papua New Guinea.</field><field name="subject">Language and culture Papua New Guinea.</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea Languages.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DC resistivity modelling and sensitivity analysis in anisotropic media.</field><field name="creator">Greenhalgh, Mark S.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I present a new numerical scheme for 2.5-D/3-D direct current resistivity modelling in heterogeneous, anisotropic media. This method, named the &#8216;Gaussian quadrature grid&#8217; (GQG) method, co-operatively combines the solution of the Variational Principle of the partial differential equation, Gaussian quadrature abscissae and local cardinal functions so that it has the main advantages of the spectral element method. The formulation shows that the GQG method is a modification of the spectral element method and does not employ the constant elements and require the mesh generator to match the earth&#8217;s surface. This makes it much easier to deal with geological models having a 2-D/3-D complex topography than using traditional numerical methods. The GQG technique can achieve a similar convergence rate to the spectral element method. It is shown that it transforms the 2.5-D/3-D resistivity modelling problem into a sparse and symmetric linear equation system, which can be solved by an iterative or matrix inversion method. Comparison with analytic solutions for homogeneous isotropic and anisotropic models shows that the error depends on the Gaussian quadrature order (abscissae number) and the sub-domain size. The higher order or smaller the subdomain size employed, the more accurate the solution. Several other synthetic examples, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous, incorporating sloping, undulating and severe topography are presented and found to yield results comparable to finite element solutions involving a dense mesh. The thesis also presents for the first time explicit expressions for the Fr&#233;chet derivatives or sensitivity functions in resistivity imaging of a heterogeneous and fully anisotropic earth. The formulation involves the Green&#8217;s functions and their gradients, and is developed both from a formal perturbation analysis and by means of a numerical (finite element) method. A critical factor in the equations is the derivative of the electrical conductivity tensor with respect to the principal conductivity values and the angles defining the axes of symmetry; these are given analytically. The Fr&#233;chet derivative expressions are given for both the 2.5-D and the 3-D problem using both constant point and constant block model parameterisations. Special cases like the isotropic earth and tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) media are shown to emerge from the general solutions. Numerical examples are presented for the various sensitivities as functions of the dip angle and strike of the plane of stratification in uniform TTI media. In addition, analytic solutions are derived for the electric potential, current density and Fr&#233;chet derivatives at any interior point within a 3-D transversely isotropic homogeneous medium having a tilted axis of symmetry. The current electrode is assumed to be on the surface of the Earth and the plane of stratification given arbitrary strike and dip. Profiles can be computed for any azimuth. The equipotentials exhibit an elliptical pattern and are not orthogonal to the current density vectors, which are strongly angle dependent. Current density reaches its maximum value in a direction parallel to the longitudinal conductivity direction. Illustrative examples of the Fr&#233;chet derivatives are given for the 2.5-D problem, in which the profile is taken perpendicular to strike. All three derivatives of the Green&#8217;s function with respect to longitudinal conductivity, transverse resistivity and dip angle of the symmetry axis (dG/d&#963;&#8321;,dG/d&#963;&#8321;,dG/d&#952;&#8320; ) show a strongly asymmetric pattern compared to the isotropic case. The patterns are aligned in the direction of the tilt angle. Such sensitivity patterns are useful in real time experimental design as well as in the fast inversion of resistivity data collected over an anisotropic earth.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anisotropy; topography; variational principle; helmholtz equation; GQG; Frechet derivatives</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">War, politics and morality : the Spanish Catholic church and World War II.</field><field name="creator">Varley, Gerald</field><field name="description">This thesis starts from the proposition that moral and ideological issues now drive the continuing intense interest in World War II. There has been an increasing challenge to the probity of the response of both opponents and bystanders to the threat raised by Nazism. The thesis views these issues from the viewpoint of the Spanish Catholic Church, an institution involved in yet detached from the war, having morality as its core concern yet itself struggling to reconcile moral principles with political imperatives. Such tensions might illuminate, in particular, the similar struggles of the Western Allies. This study has been set against a background of historiographical development. It has considered the evolution of Catholic teaching on the morality of war and threats posed to the Church in the early twentieth Century political world of conflicting ideologies. In Spain, the Church, quintessentially Spanish yet inspiring extremes of devotion and hatred in Spain's total, ideological Civil War, had been devastated by that struggle. In defending its urgent spiritual priorities during a new European war, it faced many challenges that necessitated reactions involving complex interplay of morality and politics. Not only was its relationship with the victorious Franco regime uncertain but it feared the infiltration into Spain of any of the European war's contending ideologies-Fascism and Nazism, Communism and liberal democracy. The thesis describes the Church's response. This work also takes the view that the intensity of the ideological struggle made World War II a war of unprecedented totality. This study examines the attitudes of the Spanish Church to aspects of total war.

Therefore the focus of this thesis is on dihydroxylation of bicyclic endoperoxides and examination of their further utility. A broad range of 1,4-disubstituted-2,3-dioxabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-enes were synthesized featuring a variety of alkyl and aryl substituents. These compounds were subsequently dihydroxylated with osmium tetroxide to yield diols anti to the peroxide linkage, as single diastereomers, in excellent yields. Reduction of the peroxide bond afforded cyclohexane-1,2,3,4-tetraols of toxocarol relative stereochemistry in excellent yield; this configuration of hydroxyl groups is quite prevalent in nature. In order to demonstrate the synthetic scope of dihydroxylation of bicyclic endoperoxides followed by reduction of the peroxide linkage, tetraol formation from alkyl and aryl substituted diols was examined. It was confirmed that both alkyl and aryl substituents can be tolerated in the 1,4-positions. Dihydroxylation of endoperoxides containing H atoms at the 1,4-positions was also documented. The methodology of dihydroxylation followed by reduction of the peroxide linkage was employed to synthesize the reported natural product (1S,2R,3S,4R,5R)-2-methyl-5-(propan-2-yl)cyclohexane-1,2,3,4-tetrol in a short sequence from (R)-&#945;-phellandrene. The 2,3-dioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-5,6-diols discussed above were also found to undergo an extremely clean rearrangement to yield 1,4-dicarbonyls and glycoaldehyde, a rearrangement not reported in the literature. The possible mechanism of this rearrangement was probed and is discussed in detail. The repercussions of diol orientation to product outcome were also investigated. Finally, the possibility of expanding the scope of synthetic application for this rearrangement, particularly the potential for synthesis of optically pure 1,4-dicarbonyls is discussed. Some preliminary results are reported.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bicyclic endoperoxides; dihydroxylation diols; tetraols; rearrangement; 1,4-diketones</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying nutritive, physical and volatile characteristics of oaten and lucerne hay that affect the short-term feeding preferences of lactating Holstein Friesian cows and Thoroughbred horses.</field><field name="creator">Pain, Sarah Jean.</field><field name="description">Feeding behaviour is controlled by the integration of both perceived cues from the plant and postingestive signals received by the animal. In general practice, dairy cattle are presented with a variety of feedstuffs throughout each day, in addition to changing feedstuffs over time. In the Australian context, the feeds generally include fodder (usually hay) and pasture whilst grazing, as well as various concentrates. For horses that are stabled for prolonged periods, their diet consists of fodder (again usually hay or chaff) and concentrates, in addition to the pasture consumed whilst allowed access to graze. In such situations, where animals are presented with a range of feedstuffs, some of them novel and for discrete periods of time, it is important that they readily accept the feeds when they are first presented to them. For both lactating dairy cows and performance horses, for example, it is important to avoid periods of low intake, as this can have immediate and sometimes longer-term consequences to animal performance. The daily rate of food intake is the single most important factor affecting animal performance and productivity (Illius et al. 2000) and an animal&#8223;s responses to a feedstuff can be considered the ultimate measure of its quality. The animal&#8223;s first response to the presentation of a new feed, which in this particular study was oaten or lucerne hay, is its level of voluntary intake, which depends in part on palatability. Palatability is an integrative term (Provenza 1995); to provide a quantitative measure of the acceptability of a feedstuff, a &#8222;preference value&#8217; can be obtained by describing the preference of one hay relative to an alternate hay also on offer. The Australian fodder industry is increasingly adopting more objective measures of hay quality to improve marketing opportunities, especially in the export industry, and to meet the demands and expectations of local and overseas purchasers of hay. Being able to efficiently and reliably predict the preference value of any particular hay would be beneficial to processors, exporters, users (purchasers) of hay, and possibly plant breeders, to make more informed decisions. This thesis describes a comprehensive analysis of the chemical and physical characteristics of a selected number of oaten and lucerne hays and their relationship to the acceptability or &#8222;preference value&#8223; of the hays for lactating Holstein Friesian cows and Thoroughbred horses. The project aimed to (i) quantify preference values for a large number of oaten hays with dairy cows and horses and a similarly large number of lucerne hays with horses only, and (ii) develop predictive equations for animal preferences based on the chemical and physical properties of the hays and the animal&#8223;s short-term rate of consuming the hays. A total of approximately 8,500 preference tests were conducted with 85 oaten hays offered to lactating Holstein Friesian cows and Thoroughbred horses, and 70 lucerne hays offered to Thoroughbred horses. The hays were selected to cover a range of nutritive values. The intake rate and preferences for all the hays were quantified in a series of tests replicated over time and with different animals. Each &#8222;trial&#8223; hay was offered with four &#8222;standard&#8223; hays (in separate tests). A suite of chemical (nutritive value) traits and physical traits were quantified for the hays. An assessment of the &#8222;odour profile&#8223; was also included in the characterisation of the hays. The nutritive, physical and volatile traits were then related to hay preference values in multiple and simple linear regression models and equations generated to predict hay preference values. A prediction of hay preference made directly from the spectra obtained by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was also developed. Overall, the average preference value of an oaten hay (i.e., that obtained using the comparisons with all four standard hays) could be predicted from a range of nutritive value traits, typically the contents of acid detergent fibre (ADF), hemicellulose, crude protein (CP) and water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) - with a correlation co-efficient of about 79% with cows and 61% for horses. Acid detergent fibre and CP contents tended to have the biggest influence on preference value for both cows and horses, followed by WSC and hemicellulose content. Examination of lucerne hays offered to horses increased the correlation co-efficient to 74%, with ADF, hemicellulose and CP each having a similar magnitude of effect. This means that these traits, with an appropriate weighting for each, could account for up to about three-quarters of the variation in hay preference values for cows and horses. The in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVD) of oaten and lucerne hay was nearly as accurate in predicting preference values as using the four nutritive value traits of ADF, hemicellulose, CP and WSC, which was anticipated as digestibility is a function of these chemical traits. Hay physical traits could also be used to predict preference values, although not as accurately as the nutritive value traits or IVD. Of the physical traits, shear energy had the largest effect (co-efficient approximately -1.15 compared to an average of -0.35 for the other traits in the equation). The use of NIRS to directly predict preference values was also encouraging, with the best calibration model yielding a correlation co-efficient of 61 to 81%, depending on the hay (oaten or lucerne) and the animal (cows or horses). Of the total 120 volatile compounds isolated from the oaten hays, six had some relationship with cow preferences and there were also six oaten hay volatiles related to horse preferences. Of the oaten hay volatiles significantly related to preference, four were positively related to cow preference whilst two were negatively related to cow preference. Similarly there were four volatiles positively related to horse preference and two consistently negatively related. Of the six oaten hay volatiles found to influence the preferences of dairy cows and horses, four were common to both species. Of the total of 147 volatile compounds isolated from the lucerne hays, 15 had some relationship with horse preference, with nine positively related to horse preference and six negatively related. The data reported here suggest that a predicted preference value for a hay can be generated using commonly measured quality traits, which would improve a buyer&#8223;s confidence of animals responding favourably when first offered the hay. More specifically, for an average preference value, the most reliable prediction equation was based on nutritive value traits: ADF, hemicellulose, crude protein and water soluble carbohydrates solely. Alternatively a combination of nutritive and physical traits can be used to predict preference: in vitro digestibility, crude protein, water soluble carbohydrates and shear energy. The visible and near infrared spectra obtained by NIRS was also a promising method of prediction, and given the speed and affordability of NIRS, this technology could be further refined and used for routine measurement of predicted hay preference values. The volatile compounds shown to influence preference value of the hay should be identified and further research undertaken to investigate novel approaches to manipulate the preference of hays. Caution should be taken when attempting to use these prediction equations on a single specific hay in a single specific situation. The predictions and relationships investigated in this thesis are based on populations of hays and preferences of a group of animals and therefore some care should be taken when applying them to a particular situation with difference circumstances. Other factors that can influence feed preferences include an animal&#8223;s feeding experiences, basal diet and diet history and various environmental factors unaccounted for here.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Short-term reference; Oaten hay; Lucerne hay; Dairy cow; Horse; Nutritive value; Physical trait; Volatile characteristic</field><field name="subject">Hay as feed.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Platelet and endothelial function : Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and the renin-angiotensin system.</field><field name="creator">Rajendran, Sharmalar</field><field name="description">The phenomenon of platelet hyperaggregability and decreased platelet responsiveness to nitric oxide (also termed as nitric oxide resistance), documented in several cardiovascular disease states, is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The series of experiments described in this thesis address primarily some aspects of the pathophysiology, epidemiology and therapy of the phenomenon of end-organ resistance to nitric oxide (NO) in two important conditions, that are closely associated with cardiovascular risk factors and disease states:-  Polycystic ovary syndrome, which is closely linked with the metabolic syndrome and premature subclinical atherosclerosis.  The renin-angiotensin system, which is recognized as a significant mediator in the pathophysiology of a number of cardiovascular disease states. The first study examined the epidemiology/pathophysiology of putative platelet/endothelial dysfunction in young individuals with PCOS. The subsequent studies focused on the potential impact of the renin-angiotensin system on platelet and endothelial function. This mechanistic review is set in the context of a number of recent major clinical studies which have demonstrated surprising efficacy of certain angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ramipril and perindopril) in the prevention of thrombotic processes. Thus we tested the hypothesis whether ACE inhibitor ramipril sensitizes platelets to NO (as a potential mechanism for improved cardiovascular outcomes) in a high risk patient cohort. In addition, particular attention will be given to the emerging role of the heptapeptide Angiotensin- (1-7), a possible physiological antagonist to Angiotensin II in the vasculature and the limitation of the current literature concerning potential effects of the renin-angiotensin system on thrombotic mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Platelet; Endothelial function; Polycystic ovary syndrome; Renin-Angiotension system</field><field name="subject">Polycystic ovary syndrome</field><field name="subject">Renin-angiotensin system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A life course approach to measuring socioeconomic position in population surveillance and its role in determining health status.</field><field name="creator">Chittleborough, Catherine R.</field><field name="description">Measuring socioeconomic position (SEP) in population chronic disease and risk factor surveillance systems is essential for monitoring changes in socioeconomic inequities in health over time. A life course approach in epidemiology considers the long-term effects of physical and social exposures during gestation, childhood, adolescence, and later adult life on health. Previous studies provide evidence that socioeconomic factors at different stages of the life course influence current health status. Measures of SEP during early life to supplement existing indicators of current SEP are required to more adequately explain the contribution of socioeconomic factors to health status and monitor health inequities. The aim of this thesis was to examine how a life course perspective could enhance the monitoring of SEP in chronic disease and risk factor surveillance systems. The thesis reviewed indicators of early life SEP used in previous research, determined indicators of early life SEP that may be useful in South Australian surveillance systems, and examined the association of SEP over the life course and self-rated health in adulthood across different population groups to demonstrate that inclusion of indicators of early life SEP in surveillance systems could allow health inequities to be monitored among socially mobile and stable groups. A variety of indicators, such as parents&#8217; education level and occupation, and financial circumstances and living conditions during childhood, have been used in different study designs in many countries. Indicators of early life SEP used to monitor trends in the health and SEP of populations over time, and to analyse long-term effects of policies on the changing health of populations, need to be feasible to measure retrospectively, and relevant to the historical, geographical and sociocultural context in which the surveillance system is operating. Retrospective recall of various indicators of early life SEP was examined in a telephone survey of a representative South Australian sample of adults. The highest proportions of missing data were observed for maternal grandfather&#8217;s occupation, and mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s highest education level. Family structure, housing tenure, and family financial situation when the respondent was aged ten, and mother and father&#8217;s main occupation had lower item non-response. Respondents with missing data on early life SEP indicators were disadvantaged in terms of current SEP compared to those who provided this information. The differential response to early life SEP questions according to current circumstances has implications for chronic disease surveillance examining the life course impact of socioeconomic disadvantage. While face-to-face surveys are considered the gold standard of interviewing techniques, computer-assisted telephone interviewing is often preferred for cost and convenience. Recall of father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s highest education level in the telephone survey was compared to that obtained in a face-to-face interview survey. The proportion of respondents who provided information about their father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s highest education level was significantly higher in the face-to-face interview than in the telephone interview. Survey mode, however, did not influence the finding that respondents with missing data for parents&#8217; education were more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged. Alternative indicators of early life SEP, such as material and financial circumstances, are likely to be more appropriate than parents&#8217; education for life course analyses of health inequities using surveillance data. Questions about family financial situation and housing tenure during childhood and adulthood asked in the cross-sectional telephone survey were used to examine the association of SEP over the life course with self-rated health in adulthood. Disadvantaged SEP during both childhood and adulthood and upward social mobility in financial situation were associated with a reduced prevalence of excellent or very good health, although this relationship varied across gender, rurality, and country of birth groups. Trend data from a chronic disease and risk factor surveillance system indicated that socioeconomic disadvantage in adulthood was associated with poorer self-rated health. The surveillance system, however, does not currently contain any measures of early life SEP. Overlaying the social mobility variables on the surveillance data indicated how inequities in health could be differentiated in greater detail if early life SEP was measured in addition to current SEP. Inclusion of life course SEP measures in surveillance will enable monitoring of health inequities trends among socially mobile and stable groups. Life course measures are an innovative way to supplement other SEP indicators in surveillance systems. Considerable information can be gained with the addition of a few questions. This will provide further insight into the determinants of health and illness and enable improved monitoring of the effects of policies and interventions on health inequities and intergenerational disadvantage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surveillance; Life course epidemiology; Self-rated health; Socioeconomic position; Population survey; Health inequities</field><field name="subject">Health surveys South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Health status indicators South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Social status Health aspects South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Public health Social aspects South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corrected head position.</field><field name="creator">Barbera, Andrew Lawrence.</field><field name="description">Background: Historically, many reference lines and planes of the human skull have been used in an attempt to depict the head in a natural head position (NHP) which is a relaxed/balanced position when looking ahead at their eye level. Head position correction has been attempted in fields such as anatomy, art, anthropology, orthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, and forensics. In orthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and plastic surgery, corrected head position (CHP) is particularly important for diagnosis of the normality/protrusion/retrusion of the patient&#8217;s facial skeleton. Usually a single plane, such as Frankfurt horizontal, is used to correct head position, but its angulation is variable between individuals, because each individual&#8217;s anatomy is unique. It has been found previously that the Neutral Horizontal Axis (NHA), Frankfurt horizontal (FH), Krogman-Walker plane (KW plane), and Palatal plane (P plane) demonstrated near parallelism, and these planes averaged -1 to -2 degrees from the true horizontal (HOR, which is a horizontal plane determined as being perpendicular to the earth&#8217;s gravitational force) with subjects in NHP. Methods: Craniofacial planes were measured in an Aboriginal Australian sample and in two contemporary samples obtained from Australian orthodontic practices, and the findings were compared with previous studies. Each sample consisted of 40 individuals (20 males and 20 females) with subjects in NHP. The Aboriginal Australian sample was longitudinal (T1, mean age 10 years; T2, mean age 14 years, and T3, mean age 18 years) enabling NHP to be assessed over approximately 8 years. A soft tissue Ear - nose plane (EN plane) was also investigated. Results: NHP reproducibility over 8 years demonstrated a mean of absolute difference of 2.9 degrees, with a range of differences from -7.9 to 8.2 degrees and a standard deviation of differences equal to 3.6 degrees. The Neutral Horizontal Axis (NHA), Frankfurt horizontal (FH), Krogman-Walker plane (KW plane), and Palatal plane (P plane) demonstrated near parallelism with each other, and averaged between 0 and -3 degrees from HOR. On average, EN plane was horizontal but was variable. Conclusions: NHP is not consistently reproducible at the individual level. For hard tissue images, the combined use of NHA, FH, KW plane, and P plane enables prediction of CHP. Additionally, the rectangular shape of the lower orbit - nasal airway region appears to be useful for correcting head position. In facial soft tissue images, EN plane in combination with other visual factors helps to correct head position. Simple geometry enables this head position correction to be performed from any view of the head where relevant landmarks are seen.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lower anterior cranial base; Neutral horizontal axis; Frankfurt horizontal; Krogman-Walker plane; Palatal plane; Ear-nose plane</field><field name="subject">Face Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Orthodontics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital identity: an emergent legal concept; an analysis of the role and legal nature of digital identity in a transactional context.</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Clare Linda</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the emergent legal concept of digital identity under the United Kingdom National Identity Scheme ('NIS') and its Australian counterpart, the Access Card Scheme('ACS') proposed in 2007. The Identity Cards Act 2006 UK c 15 ('Identity Cards Act&#8217;) and the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill (Cth) 2007 ('Access Card Bill') reveal a remarkably similar concept of identity in terms of its constitution and especially its functions. The United Kingdom scheme is currently being established, whereas the proposed Australian Scheme has been shelved following a change of government late in 2007. The NIS is therefore used as the model for this study but the analysis applies to any such scheme based on digital technology, including the ACS, should it be resurrected. The emergent concept of digital identity which is the subject of this thesis arises from legislation. It is a legal construct which consists of a collection of information that is stored and transmitted in digital form, and which has specific functions under the identity scheme. In this study, the information recorded about an individual for an identity scheme is referred to as an individual's 'database identity.' Database identity consists of information prescribed by legislation. Collectively, that information comprises an individual's registered identity. Under the United Kingdom scheme, it includes an individual's name/s, gender, date and place of birth and date of death, photograph, signature and biometrics, and other information such as citizenship and residential status including residential address/es, nationality, identity card number, passport number, work permit number, driver&#8216;s licence number, and administrative information such as security and verification details. Within database identity is a small subset of information which is an individual&#8216;s transactional identity, that is, an individual&#8216;s identity for transactional purposes. In this study, that subset of database identity is called an individual&#8216;s 'token identity'. Under the NIS, token identity consists of name, gender, date and place of birth, date of death and biometrics. Token identity is the gateway to the other information which makes up database identity and token identity has specific functions at the time of a transaction which give it legal character. In effect, it operates as the individual&#8216;s transactional 'key.' Presentation of the required token identity at the time of the transaction enables the system to recognise, and to deal with, the registered identity. This thesis is therefore not about identity in the deep philosophical sense of 'who am I?' or 'what makes me, me?' It is about a legal concept of individual identity for specific purposes under a national identity scheme. In many ways, though, the concept of digital identity which is the subject of this thesis is just as important in a modern legal context. Under a national identity scheme, the response to the question 'who am I? ' is 'you are who the scheme (and in particular, the National Identity Register ('NIR')) says you are.' As the first conceptual legal analysis of identity in a transactional context, this thesis examines the functions and legal nature of database identity, and particularly token identity. Token identity has specific functions at the time of a transaction which are analysed from a legal perspective to determine whether token identity is a form of legal personality. This thesis also contends that individual personal and proprietary rights necessarily apply as a result of the functions and legal nature of this emergent concept of identity. In addition to the well- recognised right to privacy, this thesis argues that the concept gives rise to the right to identity which has been overlooked in this context. For the first time, identity as a legal concept is distinguished from privacy which is the focus of legal scholarship and jurisprudence in this area. The right to identity is contrasted with the right to privacy and the protection afforded by the right to identity in this context by those human rights in the United Kingdom is considered. The protection afforded to an individual in the United Kingdom is contrasted with the situation in Australia which does not currently have a comprehensive national human rights charter. In view of the limited protection which is currently provided to token identity by the civil law, the protection provided by the criminal law in both the United Kingdom and Australia becomes particularly significant in considering the obligations and rights which arise under the scheme. The adequacy of the criminal law in addressing the nature and consequences of the dishonest use by a person of another person&#8216;s identity information is therefore also examined. Identity theft is defined and distinguished from identity fraud, having regard to the emergent concept of digital identity and the wrong and the harm caused by its misuse. In particular, the nature of token identity is examined and the consequences of its misuse by another person are considered in determining whether token identity is property which is capable of being the subject of theft and criminal damage. The thesis concludes by summarising the major insights provided by chapters 1-6 with a view to the future when national identity schemes like that of the United Kingdom, and indeed international schemes, will be commonplace and token identity routinely required for most commercial transactions. In that environment, being asked to provide one&#8216;s token identity is likely to be as common and as routine as being asked one's name.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">identity; digital; legal; concept; transactional context</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises Computer networks Security measures.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks Security measures.</field><field name="subject">Identification cards.</field><field name="subject">Computer security Law and legislation Great Britain.</field><field name="subject">Computer security Law and legislation Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ascertainment, diagnostic evaluation and gene mapping of South Australian families with possible X-linked mental retardation.</field><field name="creator">Al Raisi, Zahiya Abdul Hameed</field><field name="description">Mental retardation is a disorder that affects the lives of many individuals and their families worldwide. The underlying causes are heterogeneous and despite efforts to reveal them, the aetiology remains unknown for 50% of cases. Estimates of the prevalence of MR have varied between one and three percent in different studies, because of differences in definition, classification and approach to ascertainment. Most studies show that MR is about 30% more prevalent in males than females suggesting that XLMR is an important contributor to MR. Previous studies estimated that XLMR has a prevalence of 1.83 males (Herbst et al., 1980). The aim of the thesis was the ascertainment, diagnostic evaluation and gene mapping of South Australian families with possible XLMR. The South Australian Clinical Genetics Service's database (Kintrak) identified 33 families with possible XLMR of unknown cause. The clinical features and diagnostic evaluation of these families were documented. Six of these families were large enough for linkage mapping but only 2 of them agreed to participate in the current study. For one family the gene was localised between markers DXS8067 and DXS1062. Two candidate genes within the linkage interval, PHF6 and GRIA3 were screened for a mutation but no pathological mutation was found. The linkage mapping of the second family is still in progress. One of the 33 families was suspected to have Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome and was screened for PHF6 but no mutation was found. Tarpey et al. (2007) identified protein truncating mutations in UPF3B in some patients with Lujan Fryns Syndrome (XLMR with Marfanoid body build). Therefore, the South Australian Clinical Genetics Service's database (Kintrak) was searched for males with a diagnosis of MR and Marfanoid body build and 14 individuals were found. They were screened for mutations in UPF3B gene but no pathological mutation was found.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic medicine; XLMR</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of large-scale coherent structures in the near field and transition regions of a mechanically oscillated planar jet.</field><field name="creator">Riese, Michael</field><field name="description">Enhancing the performance of mixing and fluid entrainment by excitation of quasi-steady jets has been a subject of research for more than three decades. During the 1980s a special emphasis was placed on mechanically oscillating planar jets and the possibility to augment thrust of V/STOL aircraft. However, during this time, little attention was paid to the classification of flow regimes, the development of coherent structures or the existence of different regions in the flow within the jet near field. For the present study, a large aspect ratio nozzle was oscillated in the direction transverse to the width of the nozzle in simple harmonic motion. For a constant nozzle height, the stroke length, oscillation frequency and jet velocity were systematically varied. Over 240 flow cases were examined using a novel method of phase-locked flow visualisation. Following an initial analysis of the acquired data, a small subset of flow conditions was selected for further quantitative investigation using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The phase-locked flow visualisation led to the identification and classification of three separate flow regimes, the Base Flow, the Resonant Flow and the Bifurcation Flow Regimes. Each regime is linked to the other regimes by the presence of a small number of repetitive coherent structures in the form of starting and stopping vortices. The analysis revealed a relationship between the stroke-to-nozzle height ratio and the ratio of the forcing frequency to the natural vortex shedding frequency in the planar jet. This directly contradicts the relationship between the Strouhal and Reynolds numbers of the jet that was proposed by previous investigators. Comparison of phase-locked PIV and flow visualisation data confirms both, the validity of the new regime classification and the identification of relevant large-scale structures. Time-averaged vorticity data are also used to further illustrate the differences between the three flow regimes. Investigation of the time-averaged qualitative data for the Base and Resonant Flow Regimes show that three distinct flow regions exist within both regimes. Adjacent to the nozzle is the initial formation region, where all large-scale structures form. This is followed by a coherent near-field region in which the jet exhibits very little spread for both the Base and Resonant Flow Regimes. Within this region no pairing of the large-scale vortices from the opposing sides of the flow can be found. This region is followed by a transition region that is marked by the sudden breakup and dissipation of all visible large-scale coherent structures. The vortex formation distance is then investigated using the available PIV data and compared with the results of previous investigations. The data show that the formation distance depends on the jet velocity, oscillation frequency and the stroke length. The agreement with previous data is poor due to differences in the method of measurement. Quantitative data are also used to investigate the centreline velocity decay in relation to changes of the jet Reynolds number and stroke-to-nozzle height ratio. The results show that the velocity decay rate increases with increasing stroke length as is expected from findings of earlier studies. In addition the centreline velocity decay rates in the mean jet transition region appear to be constant for each stroke length in the cases examined.

It is named for its high affinity for compounds with an imidazoline structure such as the anti-hypertensive drugs, clonidine and moxonidine. The imidazoline receptor antisera-selected protein (IRAS) is the putative clone of the I1-R. IRAS has a unique structure, which does not resemble any other receptor protein. IRAS is present throughout the body with highest levels in the brain. There is a growing body of research examining the physiological roles of IRAS as an I1-R, in cell survival, migration and protein trafficking. However, there is little research into its neuronal functions. IRAS interacts with other membrane receptors: the mouse homologue of IRAS reorganises the actin cytoskeleton through interaction with the &#945;5&#946;1 fibronectin receptor. IRAS also binds insulin receptor substrate 4 and enhances insulin-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) activation. Actin reorganisation and ERK1/2 activation are important for the development of neurites during neuronal differentiation. Therefore, the work described in this thesis aimed to investigate the effects of IRAS on neuronal differentiation. Studies reported in this thesis also aimed to investigate whether IRAS affected ERK1/2 signalling of other receptors involved in neuronal differentiation such as the NGF receptor, TrkA, and lysophospholipid receptors. The above aims were carried out in neuronal model PC12 cells transfected with either IRAS or a vector plasmid. Fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting techniques were used to examine the effect of IRAS on cell morphology and ERK1/2 signalling. The work described in this thesis found that IRAS reorganises the actin cytoskeleton and enhances growth cone development in PC12 cells. This study also shows that IRAS differentially enhances or inhibits NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation depending on the presence or absence of serum in the media. In full-serum conditions, IRAS enhanced neurite outgrowth and this was accompanied by an increase in ERK1/2 activation. In serum-starved cells, IRAS inhibited neurite outgrowth with similar levels of ERK1/2 activation observed in vector- and IRAS-transfected cells. Finally, studies presented in this thesis found that IRAS enhances lysophosphatidic acid-induced ERK1/2 activation and that IRAS interacting with lysophospholipid receptor agonists present in serum is a potential mechanism by which it enhances NGF-induced ERK1/2 activation in full-serum conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Imidazoline receptor antisera-selected protein; IRAS; Nischarin; Nerve growth factor; Imidazoline; ERK1/2; I1-receptor; PC12 cells; Neurite outgrowth; Growth cones; Integrin; Lysophosphatidic acid; Sphingosine-1-phosphate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio of compositions and exegesis: composing for a choral spectrum.</field><field name="creator">Wood, Callie</field><field name="description">This portfolio of compositions and exegesis submitted for the degree of Master of Music in Composition, at the Elder Conservatorium of Music, comprises original creative works supported by a detailed commentary.

The general goal of the present work was to map QTL for economically important traits in beef cattle. Because of the practical limitations of phenotypic selection for meat quality, these traits are ideal candidates for the use of marker - assisted selection. Thus, the thesis specifically focused on carcass and beef quality traits. Six half - sib families were generated by mating six Limousin x Jersey crossbred sires to purebred Jersey or Limousin cows, producing 784 backcross progeny ( 366 and 418 progeny in Australia and New Zealand, respectively ). The six crossbred sires and all the backcross progeny were genotyped for 285 microsatellite markers ( on average 189 informative loci per sire family ) spread across the 29 bovine autosomes. A large number of traits were recorded on backcross progeny. In the first phase of the research, a single - QTL model based on regression interval mapping was used to map QTL for a wide range of economically important traits in the beef industry. Chromosome - wise significant evidence for linkage was found on BTA12 ( P &lt; 0.01 ) and BTA16 ( P &lt; 0.05 ) for age at puberty. Thirteen QTL were found to affect calving ease related traits ( birth weight, pelvic area and gestation length ). BTA11, 14 and 22 were most significant linkage groups affecting calving ease traits. Several genomic regions were linked to the carcass and beef quality traits. The results revealed a major QTL on BTA2 close to the map position of myostatin gene, affecting yield, carcass fatness and beef quality traits. In the second phase, the pleiotropic effects of a myostatin functional SNP on beef traits were studied. There was no association between this myostatin variant and birth weight and growth traits. However, the variant decreased overall fatness, increased muscle mass and improved meat tenderness, thus providing an intermediate and more useful phenotype than the more severe double - muscling phenotype caused by a major deletion in the myostatin gene described by others. In the third phase, a multiple marker analysis approach in the framework of the mixed - effects model was developed, allowing all markers of the entire genome to be included in the analysis simultaneously. Further, exploiting a factor analytic covariance structure for modeling trait by marker or family by marker interaction terms, the approach was extended to the multi - trait and multiple family situations. The simulation study showed that modeling multiple phenotypes and multiple families in a single linkage analysis simultaneously can markedly increase the power to detect QTL, compared to modeling each phenotype or family separately. Finally, the multi - trait multiple QTL approach developed herein was applied to map QTL influencing carcass and meat quality traits. Several pleoitropic QTL and also traitspecific QTL affecting beef traits were mapped, resulting in a useful resource from which fine mapping can be launched for subsequent gene discovery and marker - assisted selection.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meat quality, beef cattle, quantitative genetics</field><field name="subject">Gene mapping.</field><field name="subject">Beef cattle Breeding Economic aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of genes implicated in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease pathogenesis using Danio Rerio as a model organism.</field><field name="creator">Newman, Morgan</field><field name="description">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. There is considerable evidence that AD is caused by accumulating amyloid beta peptides in the brain, as a result of amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage by secretase enzymes. The presenilin proteins are central to the gamma-secretase cleavage of the intramembrane domain of APP. Aberrant splicing and point mutations in the human presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2, have been linked to familial forms of AD, through aberrant APP cleavage resulting in irregular amyloid beta formation. Paper 1 gives a review of the literature on AD research and how animal models are used to elucidate mechanisms of AD pathogenesis. The zebrafish model is used in this thesis to investigate genes with potential relevance to AD initiation and pathogenesis. Paper 2 demonstrates that lowlevel aberrant splicing of exon 8 in psen1 transcripts in zebrafish embryos produces potent dominant negative effects that increased psen1 transcription, cause a dramatic hydrocephalus phenotype, decreased pigmentation and other developmental defects. Similar effects are also observed after low-level interference with splicing of exon 8 in psen2 transcripts. In paper 3, a microarray analysis was performed to analyse global gene expression changes to illuminate the molecular aetiology of the phenotypic effects described in paper 2. Of the 100 genes that showed greatest dysregulation after psen1 or psen2 manipulation, 12 genes were common to both treatments. Five of these have known function and showed increased expression. Cyclin G1 (ccng1) was of particular interest as the human CCNG1 protein shows increased immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of neurons in human AD brains. Phylogenetic and conserved synteny analysis confirmed the orthology of zebrafish ccng1 with human CCNG1. Expression of zebrafish ccng1 in developing embryos at 24 hours post fertilization (hpf) was observed in the eye, tectum and somites. Decreased Ccng1 expression does not lead to any developmental defects and also cannot rescue the hydrocephalus or pigmentation phenotypes of embryos with aberrant splicing of psen1 exon 8. An analysis of zebrafish ccng1 function in paper 4 (thesis chapter in the form of a manuscript) indicates that truncation of Ccng1 appears to cause developmental defects in the brain, notochord and somites, however, it does not decrease the level of normal ccng1 transcript. The CCNG1 paralogue, Cyclin G2, (CCNG2), is also expressed in zebrafiish (ccng2). Decreasing the expression of Ccng2 results in similar effects on embryo development as truncating Ccng1. Therefore, the truncated forms of Ccng1 potentially interfere with Ccng2 function in a dominant negative manner.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease; presenilin; Danio rerio; zebrafish; cyclin G1; cyclin G2; development</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease.</field><field name="subject">Zebra danio</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population fragmentation in the Murray Hardyhead Craterocephalus fluviatilis McCulloch, 1912 (Teleostei: Atherinidae) : ecology, genetics and osmoregulation.</field><field name="creator">Wedderburn, Scotte Douglas</field><field name="description">Population fragmentation is a common symptom of the decline of species, including freshwater fishes. It occurs naturally, but has also proliferated in response to human interventions that increase the prevalence and intensity of isolating barriers and events. In regulated rivers, for example, fish are affected by the loss of connectivity between habitats that is associated with hydrological changes. The process has evolutionary consequences by limiting gene flow, reducing genetic diversity and rendering the isolates vulnerable to local environmental changes. Comparative studies of related species may help to elucidate the causes and consequences of fragmentation. For example, they may identify habitat features that influence the spatial separation of congeneric species. An opportunity for such a study arises with small fishes (Atherinidae) in the intensively-regulated River Murray, southeastern Australia. Whereas the unspecked hardyhead Craterocephalus stercusmuscarum fulvus is widespread and abundant, the Murray hardyhead C. fluviatilis has a patchy distribution and is listed as 'endangered&#8216; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and 'vulnerable&#8216; under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. These two species rarely cohabit, implying that they could be separated by particular habitat characteristics. In the past, several species of Craterocephalus, including C. fluviatilis and the Darling River hardyhead C. amniculus, have been regarded as C. eyresii sensu lato. The taxonomic separation of C. s. fulvus has been confirmed, but some doubt remains about the relationship of C. fluviatilis and C. amniculus. This issue needs resolution to ensure that appropriate targets are set for conservation. This study is a comparative investigation of the aforementioned species. It was designed (1) to identify the habitat characteristics that influence the distribution and abundance of C. fluviatilis and, given that salinity emerged as a key factor, (2) to explore the biological implications of salinity through a comparative study of osmoregulation in C. fluviatilis and C. s. fulvus, (3) to determine whether the osmoregulatory responses of population isolates of C. fluviatilis differ at varying salinities, and (4) to evaluate the genetic population structure of C. fluviatilis, confirm its taxonomic separation from C. amniculus and identify genetic 'management units&#8216; for conservation. Field sampling showed that C. fluviatilis is confined mainly to saline waters (0.4-20&#8240;), whereas C. s. fulvus is absent from salinities &gt;7&#8240;. Comparisons were made of osmoregulation in these two taxa over a salinity range of 0.03-85&#8240;, with additional reference to the small-mouth hardyhead Atherinosoma microstoma, a related estuarine species that tolerates salinities &gt;94&#8240;. The three species all are euryhaline, although the osmoregulatory ability of C. s. fulvus falters above about 35&#8240; salinity. C. fluviatilis is a better osmoregulator than A. microstoma at salinities &lt;1&#8240;, but both species tolerate hypersaline conditions (85&#8240;). Osmoregulation was compared in C. fluviatilis from two isolated populations in different salinity regimes (Wyngate: 0.4-1.5&#8240;, Disher Creek: c. 1.0-45&#8240;) to determine whether they show related phenotypic differences. Fish from both populations remained healthy at salinities from 5-65&#8240;. The Disher Creek population maintained a significantly lower blood osmotic concentration than the Wyngate population at salinities &#8804;1&#8240;, suggesting that there is a physiological difference between them. The genetic population structure of C. fluviatilis and its taxonomic distinction from C. amniculus were investigated using complementary allozyme and mtDNA markers. This confirmed that C. fluviatilis is genetically distinct from its sister taxon, C. amniculus. It also identified several genetically-defined 'management units&#8216; as a framework for future conservation. Further, it revealed that C. fluviatilis in habitats downstream of Lock 1 on the Murray (274 km from the river mouth) displays a genetic signature indicating introgression with C. amniculus. Clearly, these findings have implications for the conservation of C. fluviatilis. For example, isolates can be prioritised for protection, and re-introduction programs can be modified accordingly. The findings may be applied to other freshwater fish, especially populations of closely-related species subject to salinisation or other stressors, and they may also contribute toward understanding of the factors and processes underlying rarity and fragmentation. It is clear that salinity can be a significant factor in population fragmentation, and that closelyrelated species with similar ranges may be segregated by differences in osmoregulatory ability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population fragmentation; conservation; freshwater fish; Murray-Darling Basin; congeneric; osmoregulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the substrate of atrial fibrillation and flutter.</field><field name="creator">Stiles, Martin Kingsland</field><field name="description">Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are the most common sustained arrhythmias, however their underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully characterised. This thesis evaluates the electrophysiological and electroanatomical substrate of the atria in patients with these arrhythmias. Experimental studies of atrial fibrillation have demonstrated effective refractory period shortening and conduction slowing as a result of atrial fibrillation giving rise to the concept that "atrial fibrillation begets atrial fibrillation". However, cardioversion to prevent electrical remodelling does not prevent progression of disease, suggesting a "second factor" drives this process. Chapters 2 and 3 evaluate the atrial substrate in patients with "lone" atrial fibrillation. These studies demonstrate such patients, remote from an arrhythmic event, have prolongation of atrial refractoriness, conduction slowing, impairment of sinus node function, site-specific conduction delay, lower voltage and a greater proportion of complex electrograms compared to reference patients. These abnormalities constitute the "second factor" critical to the development and progression of atrial fibrillation. Atrial flutter has a close inter-relationship with atrial fibrillation and these rhythms frequently co-exist. Atrial fibrillation often occurs in patients with heart disease known to demonstrate abnormal atrial substrate; whether similar substrate exists in patients with atrial flutter to account for the co-existence of both arrhythmias is unknown. Chapters 4 and 5 evaluate the atrial substrate in patients with atrial flutter, remote from arrhythmia, demonstrating structural abnormalities characterised by loss of myocardial voltage, conduction slowing and impaired sinus node function, without reduction in atrial refractoriness. These findings implicate a common substrate as the cause of the close inter-relationship between these arrhythmias. There is a frequent association between atrial arrhythmia and sinus node disease for which several mechanisms have been postulated. In addition, there is a size discrepancy between the anatomical sinus node and the much larger functional sinus node complex. little is known about normal sinus node function or the effects of remodelling due to arrhythmia. Chapter 6 characterises sinus node activation to determine the nature and extent of the functional sinus node complex in patients with and without chronic atrial flutter. The functional sinus node complex demonstrates dynamic shifts in activation with preferential pathways of conduction to atrial myocardium. Patients with atrial flutter demonstrate lesser voltage, longer conduction times along preferential pathways and a smaller functional sinus node complex. These findings provide insights into the function of the human sinus node in health and disease. Sites of complex fractionated atrial electrograms and highest dominant frequency are implicated in maintaining atrial fibrillation. Chapter 7 determines the minimum recording duration that accurately characterises electrogram complexity and activation frequency. An electrogram duration of  5 seconds is required to accurately identify these sites. Chapter 8 evaluates the relationship between sites of fractionation and high frequency activation during atrial fibrillation. Greater fractionation and higher dominant frequency are seen in persistent atrial fibrillation and left atria. Preferential areas of high dominant frequency are observed in paroxysmal but not persistent atrial fibrillation. Areas of complex fractionated atrial electrograms are found adjacent to sites of high dominant frequency.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">atrial fibrillation; atrial flutter; substrate; electrophysiology; sinus node; dominant frequency; fractionated electrograms</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluorescent assay technologies for G-protein interactions.</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Tamara</field><field name="description">Assay technologies for GPCRs and their associated G-proteins are in demand for drug screening and other biotechnology applications such as biosensors for diagnostic purposes or odorant/flavour assessment as well as for elucidating the remaining controversial mechanisms in G-protein mediated signalling. This study aims to make progress towards developing a TR-FRET assay for G-protein interactions that could be used as a generic assay platform for GPCR signalling that would be fluorescent, homogeneous and amenable to miniaturization. The first chapter of this study investigates the use of small molecule labels, CS124-DTPA-EMCH:Tb and Alexa546 in a TR-FRET assay. This TR-FRET pair had previously been applied to G&#945;, G&#946;&#947; and RGS4 proteins and during the characterization of this assay, the protein CrV2 was observed to interact with the G-protein. Using TR-FRET, it was demonstrated that a high affinity interaction appears to occur between G&#945;i1 and CrV2 (Apparent Kd 6.2 nM). CrV2 is encoded by a polydnavirus from endoparasitoid wasps, which is thought to mediate immune suppression, and the interaction with G&#945; could have important implications in the regulation of the immune system of invertebrates. Improvements to the labelling strategy used in this assay are then attempted through the creation of various G-protein subunit fusions with small, genetically encoded lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) or tetracysteine motifs (TCMs) for site-specific labelling with terbium or FlAsH, respectively. The consequence of the fusions on maintaining G-protein subunit integrity and on the affinity of the tags for their labels is characterized, and then the utility of these constructs as TR-FRET partners is demonstrated. TCM:FlAsH complexes could successfully be used as TR-FRET acceptors for CS124-DTPA-EMCH:Tb labelled binding partners. The interaction between G&#946;&#947;2-TCM:FlAsH and G&#945;:Tb could be measured using TR-FRET and generated an apparent Kd of 3.6 nM. Likewise, LBT:Tb complexes could be used as TR-FRET donors to Alexa546 labelled binding partners which was demonstrated using the chimeric, promiscuous G&#945; subunit, LBT2:Tb-G&#945;S25 and G&#946;&#947;:Alexa. Furthermore, the two site-specific labelling strategies can be used together in TR-FRET studies and an interaction between LBT2:Tb-G&#945;[subscript]S25 and G&#946;&#947;&#8322;-TCM:FlAsH was shown to have an apparent Kd of 2.3 nM. The TRFRET assays were further validated using protease treatments and the addition of unlabelled binding partners reduced the TR-FRET signal. Finally, the feasibility of fusing lanthanide binding tags to GPCRs for alternate assay platforms or other applications was investigated. The &#946;&#8322;- adrenergic and M&#8322;-muscarinic receptors were fused to LBTs and the integrity of the receptors determined using ligand binding and [[superscript]35 S]GTP&#947;S signalling assays. Terbium binding to the LBT was then demonstrated. The utility of these constructs in alternative TR-FRET platforms with Gproteins was then explored.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">G-protein; TR-FRET; GPCK</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and demonstration of a new non-equilibrium rate-based process model for the hot potassium carbonate process.</field><field name="creator">Ooi, Su Ming Pamela</field><field name="description">Chemical absorption and desorption processes are two fundamental operations in the process industry. Due to the rate-controlled nature of these processes, classical equilibrium stage models are usually inadequate for describing the behaviour of chemical absorption and desorption processes. A more effective modelling method is the non-equilibrium rate-based approach, which considers the effects of the various driving forces across the vapour-liquid interface. In this thesis, a new non-equilibrium rate-based model for chemical absorption and desorption is developed and applied to the hot potassium carbonate process CO&#8322; Removal Trains at the Santos Moomba Processing Facility. The rate-based process models incorporate rigorous thermodynamic and mass transfer relations for the system and detailed hydrodynamic calculations for the column internals. The enhancement factor approach was used to represent the effects of the chemical reactions. The non-equilibrium rate-based CO&#8322; Removal Train process models were implemented in the Aspen Custom Modeler&#174; simulation environment, which enabled rigorous thermodynamic and physical property calculations via the Aspen Properties&#174; software. Literature data were used to determine the parameters for the Aspen Properties&#174; property models and to develop empirical correlations when the default Aspen Properties&#174; models were inadequate. Preliminary simulations indicated the need for adjustments to the absorber column models, and a sensitivity analysis identified the effective interfacial area as a suitable model parameter for adjustment. Following the application of adjustment factors to the absorber column models, the CO&#8322; Removal Train process models were successfully validated against steady-state plant data. The success of the Aspen Custom Modeler&#174; process models demonstrated the suitability of the non-equilibrium rate-based approach for modelling the hot potassium carbonate process. Unfortunately, the hot potassium carbonate process could not be modelled as such in HYSYS&#174;, Santos&#8217;s preferred simulation environment, due to the absence of electrolyte components and property models and the limitations of the HYSYS&#174; column operations in accommodating chemical reactions and non-equilibrium column behaviour. While importation of the Aspen Custom Modeler&#174; process models into HYSYS&#174; was possible, it was considered impractical due to the significant associated computation time. To overcome this problem, a novel approach involving the HYSYS&#174; column stage efficiencies and hypothetical HYSYS&#174; components was developed. Stage efficiency correlations, relating various operating parameters to the column performance, were derived from parametric studies performed in Aspen Custom Modeler&#174;. Preliminary simulations indicated that the efficiency correlations were only necessary for the absorber columns; the regenerator columns were adequately represented by the default equilibrium stage models. Hypothetical components were created for the hot potassium carbonate system and the standard Peng-Robinson property package model in HYSYS&#174; was modified to include tabular physical property models to accommodate the hot potassium carbonate system. Relevant model parameters were determined from literature data. As for the Aspen Custom Modeler&#174; process models, the HYSYS&#174; CO&#8322; Removal Train process models were successfully validated against steady-state plant data. To demonstrate a potential application of the HYSYS&#174; process models, dynamic simulations of the two most dissimilarly configured trains, CO&#8322; Removal Trains #1 and #7, were performed. Simple first-order plus dead time (FOPDT) process transfer function models, relating the key process variables, were derived to develop a diagonal control structure for each CO&#8322; Removal Train. The FOPDT model is the standard process engineering approximation to higher order systems, and it effectively described most of the process response curves for the two CO&#8322; Removal Trains. Although a few response curves were distinctly underdamped, the quality of the validating data for the CO&#8322; Removal Trains did not justify the use of more complex models than the FOPDT model. While diagonal control structures are a well established form of control for multivariable systems, their application to the hot potassium carbonate process has not been documented in literature. Using a number of controllability analysis methods, the two CO&#8322; Removal Trains were found to share the same optimal diagonal control structure, which suggested that the identified control scheme was independent of the CO&#8322; Removal Train configurations. The optimal diagonal control structure was tested in dynamic simulations using the MATLAB&#174; numerical computing environment and was found to provide effective control. This finding confirmed the results of the controllability analyses and demonstrated how the HYSYS&#174; process model could be used to facilitate the development of a control strategy for the Moomba CO&#8322; Removal Trains. In conclusion, this work addressed the development of a new non-equilibrium rate-based model for the hot potassium carbonate process and its application to the Moomba CO&#8322; Removal Trains. Further work is recommended to extend the model validity over a wider range of operating conditions and to expand the dynamic HYSYS&#174; simulations to incorporate the diagonal control structures and/or more complex control schemes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HYSYS; Hot Potassium Carbonate Process; Rate-based model; Carbon dioxide removal</field><field name="subject">Chemical processes.</field><field name="subject">Chemical engineering.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work stress in Australian professionals : the role of culture, gender and work-family conflict.</field><field name="creator">Mujumdar, Shruti</field><field name="description">Australia is one of the most popular countries for immigrants to settle. Many highly qualified Indians from India have made Australia their home, and they hold important positions in the Australian work-force. The Australian work-force now consists not only of employees from different countries, but also of parents who try to balance their work roles and family roles simultaneously. For dual-earner families this can be difficult and could lead to increased job stress and work family conflict. Due to these cultural and gender differences, experiences in the paid work-force cannot be assumed to be the same for all employees. The purpose of this research was to investigate the role of culture and gender among working professionals in Australia and to study the interactional patterns within dual-earner couples in the Australian work-force. This was exploratory research and was conducted using three studies. All studies were cross-sectional, and qualitative as well as quantitative measures were used for data collection. In the first study data were collected from matched pairs of 10 Australian and 10 Indian born mothers who were employed in the Australian work-force. Interviews were conducted and responses to the interview were recorded. Results suggested some significant differences in job stress, with Australian mothers experiencing more job stress than Indian mothers. Further, interview results indicated that women from both cultures were responsible for most of the household work. Study two of the thesis combined culture and gender to investigate job satisfaction, work stress and work family conflict among Australian men and women working in the Australian work-force (N = 58). A 2 X 2 ANOVA was used for this. There were no cultural differences found among men and women of both cultures on measures of job satisfaction, work-family conflict and family-work conflict. However, cultural differences were observed on the job stress scale with Australian men and women experiencing more job stress than Indian men and women. There were also significant gender differences in job stress, workfamily- conflict and family-work conflict. Australian men and Indian men reported higher family-work conflict. Results of this study revealed significant gender differences and therefore, the third study was designed to investigate these gender differences further. Study three investigated the role of gender and work stress variables through crossover and spillover research. Many gender differences in predictors of fatigue, job stress and dyadic adjustment were found among couples both working in white collar professions. This study too strengthened the traditional gender role with women experiencing higher job stress and family-work conflict. It is suggested that these findings contribute to the work-stress literature in three ways. Findings confirm that gender, rather than culture, are responsible for differences among immigrants in their perception of job satisfaction, work-family conflict and family-work conflict. Findings also confirm the traditional gender role of women, who are responsible for most domestic household work, and also demonstrate that increase in work-family conflict and family-work conflict contributes to an increase in job stress among dual-earner couples. This research has provided an insight into factors contributing to both crossover and spillover among Australian dual earner professionals, an area which has not received much attention.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">work-family conflict; Indian immigrants; crossover; spillover; work stress</field><field name="subject">Work and family Australia.</field><field name="subject">Working mothers Australia.</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of pH on the structure and function of &#945;-crystallin and cyclodextrins as artificial molecular chaperones.</field><field name="creator">Brockwell, Chris Hamilton</field><field name="description">As the major protein of the lens, &#945;-crystallin is a molecular chaperone that stabilises lens proteins to prevent their precipitation into solution. In this role it is vital in maintaining lens transparency. The chaperone ability of &#945;-crystallin and its individual subunits, &#945;&#913;- and &#945;B-crystallin, has been shown to be sensitive to a variety of environmental and intrinsic factors, including temperature, denaturation and post-translational modification. The effect of pH on &#945;-crystallin chaperone ability, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. There is limited evidence to suggest that the chaperone ability of &#945;-crystallin is pH-sensitive such that &#945;- crystallin is a significantly worse chaperone at pH 6.0 than at pH 8.0. This is of physiological significance since in the lens there is a measurable pH gradient of pH 7.2 in outer lens cells, compared to pH 6.7 in the lens nucleus. A loss of &#945;-crystallin chaperone function in the lens nucleus, as a consequence of decreased pH, may compromise lens transparency. Similarly, extra-lenticular fibrillar aggregation of some disease-related target proteins (A&#946;-peptide, for example) is promoted by acidic pH. This study investigates the effect of pH on the chaperone ability of &#945;-crystallin and its subunits. Further, this study characterises the structural changes to &#945;-crystallin accompanying pH variation in an attempt to explain the structural basis for the observed pH sensitivity. In addition, this study examines the chaperone function of cyclodextrins, a class of chemical chaperones that may act in conjunction with &#945;-crystallin as part of a two-step protein refolding pathway. This study demonstrated that the chaperone activity of &#945;-crystallin is pH sensitive between pH 6.0 and 8.0; the ability of &#945;-crystallin to protect against temperature- and reduction-stress induced amorphous aggregation is significantly reduced at pH 6.0 and 6.5 compared to pH 7.0 and above. The decreased chaperone ability of &#945;-crystallin at pH 6.0 and 6.5 was accompanied by partial unfolding of the protein, and a loss of secondary structure, while &#945;-crystallin quaternary structure remained unchanged. Interestingly, &#945;-crystallin was found to have significant chaperone ability below pH 4.0, conditions under which &#945;-crystallin is largely unfolded. The unfolding of &#945;-crystallin at pH 6.0 and 6.5 is comparatively minor, and it is difficult to say whether this unfolding is directly responsible for the observed pH sensitivity of &#945;-crystallin chaperone ability. The thermal stability of &#945;-crystallin was compromised at pH 6.0 and 6.5, which may partially explain its decreased chaperone ability at these pH values in heat-stress assays conducted at temperatures above 50oC. However, &#945;-crystallin chaperone activity remained pH sensitive at 37&#176;C and 45&#176;C, at which temperatures it is thermally stable. Blocking exposed &#945;B-crystallin histidine residues by chemical modification removed, to a large extent, the pH-sensitivity of its chaperone activity. This suggests that the protonation of an exposed histidine residue(s) at pH 6.0 and 6.5 is responsible for the observed pH sensitivity of &#945;-crystallin chaperone ability. Inhibiting the protonation of a specific histidine residue, H83, by site-directed mutagenesis (H83A) did not remove the pH sensitivity of &#945;B-crystallin chaperone activity, and suggests that protonation of this residue alone does not explain the decreased chaperone ability of &#945;-crystallin at mildly acidic pH. This residue lies within the putative chaperone-binding region of &#945;B-crystallin, and is highly conserved between species and between the human small heat shock proteins. It appears that the protonation of several histidine residues, or residues other than H83, is primarily responsible for the influence of pH on &#945;-crystallin chaperone ability observed in this study. The observed decrease in &#945;-crystallin chaperone function below pH 7.0 partially explains the preferential formation of age-related cataract in the lens nucleus, as the chaperone ability of &#945;-crystallin would be compromised under the mildly acidic conditions characteristic of the nucleus. Additionally, the pH sensitivity of &#945;-crystallin chaperone ability may be significant in the ability of extra-lenticular &#945;B-crystallin to inhibit amyloid-related disease at sites of localised acidosis. Cyclodextrins are a family of cyclic oligosaccharides that have been shown to function as chemical chaperones under specific protein aggregation conditions. Cyclodextrins have been demonstrated to facilitate the refolding of chemicallystressed target proteins that have already bound to synthetic nanogels, which act in a manner reminiscent of small heat shock proteins. In this study, cyclodextrins were unable to act in conjunction with &#945;-crystallin to facilitate the refolding of thermallystressed target proteins. &#946;-Cyclodextrin (&#946;CD) demonstrated little or no ability to inhibit the amorphous aggregation of target proteins, but was able to significantly inhibit the fibrillar aggregation of a number of target proteins, including the diseaserelated A53T &#945;-synuclein mutant. Characterisation of the binding of &#946;CD to target proteins during fibrillar aggregation via circular dichroism, intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence and competitive chaperone assays provided a model of the cyclodextrin chaperone mechanism. In this model, cyclodextrins interact with already partially unfolded, pre-fibrillar protein intermediates via the insertion of aromatic residues into the cyclodextrin anulus, and by doing so inhibit intra-fibrillar &#960;-bonding and protofilament assembly. This suggests the potential for cyclodextrins as therapeutic molecular chaperones in vivo that may be able to inhibit the pathogenic aggregation of target proteins.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">a-crystallin; cyclodextrin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of endoglycosidase activities towards dermatan sulphate by tandem mass spectrometry.</field><field name="creator">Nielsen, Timothy Clement</field><field name="description">Dermatan sulphate (DS) is a sulphated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that is widely distributed as proteoglycan throughout the extracellular matrix and at cell surfaces where it plays an important role in many key biological processes. The intra-cellular catabolism of DS commences with endohydrolysis of the polysaccharide chains to oligosaccharides, which are then sequentially degraded from the non-reducing terminus by lysosomal exoenzymes to monosaccharides and inorganic sulphate for transport out of the lysosome and re-utilisation by the cell. Both endo-&#946;-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Hyal-1 hyaluronidase) and endo-&#946;-glucuronidase activities towards DS have been proposed. The present study was undertaken to: 1) determine the substrate specificities and sub-cellular locations of these endoglycosidase activities; and 2) compare endoglycosidase activities and substrate specificities in the mucopolysaccharidoses, where a defect in one of the lysosomal exoenzymes required to degrade DS results in the lysosomal accumulation of partially degraded DS oligosaccharide fragments. To this end, a series of oligosaccharide substrates designed to represent aspects of the physiological substrate was prepared, and an assay was developed to measure endoglycosidase activities and determine their substrate specificities by quantifying specific oligosaccharide products. Assay substrates rich in glucuronic acid (GlcA) or iduronic acid (IdoA) were prepared by limited chondroitinase ABC digestion of chondroitin sulphate A and DS, respectively. The resulting tetra-to hexadecasaccharides were separated by size-exclusion chromatography and characterised by electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). These substrates, which were not susceptible to degradation by lysosomal exoenzymes, were then incubated with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cell homogenate (source of endoglycosidase activity), and the oligosaccharide products generated from the non-reducing end of the substrate were measured by ESI-MS/MS. Endo-&#946;-N-acetylhexosaminidase and endohexuronidase activities were detected towards the oligosaccharide substrates, with both activities preferentially degrading the GlcA-rich substrates and only minor activity observed towards IdoA-rich substrate. The endo-&#946;-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity had a minimum-sized substrate requirement of a hexasaccharide and was observed to sequentially remove tetrasaccharides from the non-reducing end of oligosaccharides, whereas the endohexuronidase activity had a minimum substrate of an octasaccharide, acted randomly and was comparatively low. The activities displayed the same acidic pH optimum and responded in the same manner to changes in buffer composition and substrate concentration, and to the presence of divalent cations, NaCl, detergent and protease inhibitors. Both activities were modestly affected by the hyaluronidase inhibitor, apigenin. Percoll density gradient sub-cellular fractionation confirmed that the activities were primarily in the lysosomes and late endosomes. The endo-&#946;-N-acetylhexosaminidase and endohexuronidase activities detected here in CHO-K1 cells are consistent with the Hyal-1 and endo-&#946;-glucuronidase enzymes described previously. These data suggest that Hyal-1 and endo-&#946;-glucuronidase are predominantly lysosomal enzymes that act in concert to degrade the low-sulphate, GlcA-rich domains of DS, but are less active towards the highly sulphated regions containing IdoA. To test the hypothesis that endoglycosidase activities are altered in the mucopolysaccharidoses, an attempt was made to compare Hyal-1- and endo-&#946;-glucuronidase-like activities and their substrate specificities in mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS)-affected and unaffected control skin fibroblasts. However, no activity was detected towards octa- to hexadecasaccharide substrates in control fibroblast homogenates, and in homogenates of MPS fibroblasts deficient in the lysosomal exoenzymes &#945;-L-iduronidase and N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulphatase, despite the fact that: 1) what appear to be the products of Hyal-1 and endo-&#946;-glucuronidase activities towards endogenous DS could be detected in the lysosomes of the MPS cells by sub-cellular fractionation; and 2) the ESI-MS/MS assay was demonstrated sensitive enough to detect endoglycosidase activities in homogenates of a number of different mouse tissues (including whole skin). We hypothesise that this absence of detectable endoglycosidase activity in skin fibroblasts results from enzyme non-recognition of the exogenous assay substrates tested, and hence that these cells contain heretofore undescribed Hyal-1 and endo-&#946;-glucuronidase isoforms with unique substrate specificities. In conclusion, the development of an ESI-MS/MS assay to measure the products of endoglycosidase activities has enabled the characterisation of these activities towards DS. This strategy may be useful for the future study of endoglycosidase activities towards a variety of other GAGs such as heparan sulphate, where particular oligosaccharide structures have been shown to possess unique biological activities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mass spectrometry; endoglycosidase; mucopolysaccharidoses; dermatian sulphate; HYAL-1; endo-B-glucuronidase</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the effects of soil variability and vegetation on the stability of natural slopes.</field><field name="creator">Chok, Yun Hang</field><field name="description">It is well recognised that the inherent soil variability and the effect of vegetation, in particular the effect of tree root reinforcement, have a significant effect on the stability of a natural slope. However, in practice, these factors are not commonly considered in routine slope stability analysis. This is due mainly to the fact that the effects of soil variability and vegetation are complex and difficult to quantify. Furthermore, the available slope stability analysis computer programs used in practice, which adopt conventional limit equilibrium methods, are unable to consider these factors. To predict the stability of a natural slope more accurately, especially the marginally stable one, the effects of soil variability and vegetation needs to be taken into account. The research presented in this thesis focuses on investigating and quantifying the effects of soil variability and vegetation on the stability of natural slopes. The random finite element method (RFEM), developed by Griffiths and Fenton (2004), is adopted to model the effect of soil variability on slope stability. The soil variability is quantified by the parameters called the coefficient of variation (COV) and scale of fluctuation (SOF), while the safety of a slope is assessed using probability of failure. In this research, extensive parametric studies are conducted, using the RFEM, to investigate the influence of COV and SOF on the probability of failure of a cohesive slope (i.e. undrained clay slope) with different geometries. Probabilistic stability charts are then developed using the results obtained from the parametric studies. These charts can be used for a preliminary assessment of the probability of failure of a spatially random cohesive slope. In addition, the effect of soil variability on c'&#8211;&#981;' slopes is also studied. The available RFEM computer program (i.e. rslope2d) is limited to analysing slopes with single-layered soil profile. Therefore, in this research, this computer program is modified to analyse slopes with two-layered soil profiles. The modified program is then used to investigate the effect of soil variability on two-layered spatially random cohesive slopes. It has been demonstrated that the spatial variability of soil variability has a significant effect on the reliability of both single and two-layered soil slopes. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are a powerful data-mapping tool for determining the relationship between a set of input and output variables, are used in an attempt to predict the probability of failure of a spatially random cohesive slope. The aim is to provide an alternative tool to the RFEM and the developed probabilistic stability charts because the RFEM analyses are computationally intensive and time consuming. The results obtained from the parametric studies of a spatially random cohesive slope are used as the database for the ANN model development. It has been demonstrated that the ANN models developed in this research are capable of predicting the probability of failure of a spatially random cohesive slope with high accuracy. The developed ANN models are then transformed into relatively simple formulae for direct application in practice. The effect of root reinforcement caused by vegetation is modelled as additional cohesion to the soils, known as root cohesion, cr. The areas affected by tree roots (i.e. root zone) are incorporated in the finite element slope stability model. The extent of the root zone is defined by the depth of root zone, hr. Parametric studies are conducted and the results are used to develop a set of stability charts that can be used to assess the contribution of root reinforcement on slope stability. Furthermore, ANN models and formulae are also developed based on the results obtained from the parametric studies. It has been demonstrated that the factor of safety of a slope increase linearly with the values cr and hr, and the contribution of root reinforcement to a marginally stable slope is significant. In addition, probabilistic slope stability analysis considering both the variability of the soils and root cohesion are conducted using the modified RFEM computer program. It has been demonstrated that the spatial variability of root cohesion has a significant effect on the probability of slope failure.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil variability; Vegetation; Root reinforcement; Slope stability; Probabilistic analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemotherapy-induced mucositis : the role of gastrointestinal microflora and mucins in the luminal environment.</field><field name="creator">Stringer, Andrea M.</field><field name="description">Mucositis manifesting as diarrhoea is a common side effect of chemotherapy which remains poorly understood. It is one of a number of manifestations of alimentary mucositis, which affects the entire gastrointestinal tract. The exact number of patients that are affected by diarrhoea as a result of treatment is uncertain, although it is believed that approximately 10% of patients with advanced cancer will be afflicted. Despite advances in the understanding of oral and small intestinal mucositis over recent years, large intestinal mucositis, including diarrhoea, has not been well defined and the underlying mechanisms of the condition are yet to be established. The majority of the literature available concerning diarrhoea is based on clinical observations, with very little basic research existing. However, from the research conducted, it is likely that the intestinal microflora and mucins play a role in the development of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea. This thesis will examine in detail what is known about the mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea (CID). Furthermore it will explore the potentially important relationship between intestinal microflora, the luminal environment and the subsequent development of chemotherapy-induced mucositis and diarrhoea. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a commonly used chemotherapy agent in clinical oncology practice. Two of its major side effects are mucositis and diarrhoea. The structure of mucins offers mucosal protection, and allows maintenance of intestinal flora by providing attachment sites and preventing bacterial overgrowth and/or penetration. Following treatment with 5-FU, we showed decreases in Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and an increase in Escherichia spp. in the jejunum. In the colon, 5-FU caused decreases in Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Real time PCR of faecal samples showed decreasing trends in Lactobacillus spp. and Bacteroides spp., and an increasing trend in E. coli. Significant increases (p&lt;0.05) were seen in Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus spp. at 24 h. Goblet cell numbers decreased significantly in the jejunum from 24-72 h, with a significant increase in the percentage of cavitated goblet cells, suggesting 5-FU treatment causes significant changes in intestinal flora and mucin secretion in rats. These changes could result in systemic effects, and in particular may contribute to the development of chemotherapy-induced mucositis.  Irinotecan causes cholinergic and delayed onset diarrhoea in patients, in which &#946;-glucuronidase produced by gut bacteria is thought to be involved. Diarrhoea was observed in treated rats, as expected, following irinotecan treatment. &#946;-glucuronidase expression increased in the jejunum and colon. Faecal flora changed quantitatively after treatment also, with increases in E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., and Clostridium spp. (all &#946;-glucuronidase producing), and decreases in Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp. (both beneficial bacteria), and Bacteroides spp. (&#946;-glucuronidase producing, major component of intestinal flora), suggesting that irinotecan-induced diarrhoea may be caused by an increase in &#946;-glucuronidase producing bacteria. However, the increase in bacteria may also be caused by irinotecan, further exaggerating the toxicity of the drug, and emphasising the need for these specific bacteria to be therapeutically targeted for successful treatment regimens to be accomplished.  Mucus production appears to be increased after irinotecan treatment, which may contribute to the development of diarrhoea. Goblet cells were demonstrated to decrease significantly after irinotecan treatment. However, mucin secretion increased. Mucin expression changed significantly after treatment. Muc2 and Muc4 decreased significantly in the villi of the jejunum after treatment, Muc2 and Muc4 decreased significantly in the crypts. Muc2 decreased significantly in the colon. This indicates that irinotecan causes an increase in mucin secretion and a net decrease in mucin-producing goblet cells, and the expression of Muc2 and Muc4 in the gastrointestinal tract is altered following treatment. Increased mucin secretion is likely to be related to altered mucin expression, and may contribute to chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea.  To determine if the changes to the intestinal microflora caused by chemotherapy could be translated to the clinic, a pilot clinical study was carried out. Sixteen patients experiencing CID were recruited to the study with two control subjects. A large proportion of patients (75%) demonstrated a reduced anaerobic component of their faecal microflora. A reduced diversity of species was also observed in patients. The majority of patients exhibited decreases in Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp., whilst all patients exhibited decreases in Bacteroides spp. and Enterococcus spp. Patients receiving antibiotics did not exhibit any marked differences to patients not receiving antibiotics. This indicates that the results observed in the animal studies are clinically relevant, and further research into this area should be undertaken. CID is associated with marked changes in the intestinal microflora. These changes may result in diminished bacterial functions within the gut, altering gut function and initiating intestinal damage, resulting in the onset of diarrhoea.  In conclusion, there is clear evidence demonstrating chemotherapy treatment results in changes to the intestinal microflora and mucin secretion, which may be responsible in part for the development of severe mucositis and diarrhoea. Irinotecan toxicity may be compounded by the increase in &#946;-glucuronidase producing bacteria. The intestinal flora of cancer patients experiencing CID is also noticeably different to that of healthy subjects. Irinotecan causes changes to mucin secretion, and the specific expression of Muc2, Muc4 and Klf4, suggesting that secretory control by the enteric nervous system may also be affected by chemotherapy. This research has extended the understanding of chemotherapy-induced mucositis and diarrhoea, complex side effects of chemotherapy.

Visceral hypersensitivity is the most commonly reported symptom of IBS, yet is the least adequately treated. Mechanosensitive information from the colon is relayed to the CNS by extrinsic colonic primary afferent nerves which have their cell bodies within dorsal root ganglia (DRG). This thesis aims to identify the contribution of several putatively mechanosensitive ion channels (ASIC1, 2 and 3, TRPV4 and TRPA1) toward detection of mechanical stimuli in the colon. This involvement is assessed by both molecular and functional means. The abundance of each of these channels was assessed by comparing expression within whole DRG against that in specifically colonic DRG neurons using an in situ hybridization methodology developed as part of this PhD. The functional role TRPV4 and TRPA1 impart toward colonic mechanosensation was investigated by recording responses to mechanical stimuli from colonic primary afferent fibres and comparing the results from mice genetically modified to lack either TRPV4 or TRPA1 with those of their intact littermates. The results from these studies indicate expression patterns within whole DRG do not provide accurate representation of the organ of interest, with abundances of each of the channels investigated differing between colonic DRG cells and the whole DRG. In particular ASIC3 and TRPV4 are preferentially expressed in colonic DRG neurons, unlike ASIC2 and TRPA1. Further, TRPV4 is functionally restricted to detection of noxious mechanical stimuli in the colon, while expression of TRPA1 is more widespread and functionally less restricted. Each of these channels are each potential targets for the treatment of IBS as each affects specific aspects of colonic mechanotransduction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irritable bowel syndrome; Ion channel; Electrophysiology; Molecular biology; Mechanosensation; ASIC; TRP; Sensory biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disciplining recreation in colonial South Australia: constraints, controls and conventions.</field><field name="creator">Molyneux, Denis</field><field name="description">The last four decades of the nineteenth century witnessed a significant growth of leisure hours for a growing number of South Australians, particularly working class males; it was accompanied by an upsurge in both organised and informal recreation activity. The upsurge owed much to major advances in communication during the period &#8211; in transport by rail, steamship and late in the century, the bicycle, to the network of telegraph stations which by the mid 1870s, spanned much of the colony, the country and finally linked the colony to much of the wider world, and to the growth of local and daily newspapers and specialist journals. Industry, government and commerce drove these advances, but recreation benefited from all of them and came to be a major element of commercial activity itself, as some activities generated not only participants, but spectators and audiences. These developments in turn stimulated a demand for facilities, both indoor and outdoor, which came to be met by private groups, public authorities and commercial operators, or combinations of the three. However, not all sections of the South Australian community looked favourably on aspects of these developments. Some social, religious and political forces, both separately and later as an alliance, combined to target elements of the recreation activities which emerged within the new leisure, particularly those of the working classes. They feared a return to public disorder arising from unseemly and licentious behaviour which accompanied many of the activities of the occasional pre-industrial seasonal leisure periods. These forces drew on contemporary programs in America and Britain in their campaign to quell &#8216;social evils&#8217; including intemperance, gambling and what they regarded as inappropriate behaviour on Sundays, the Lord&#8217;s Day. They advocated the uses of statutes to constrain, if not eliminate what many in the community regarded as acceptable recreational activity. Others from the reforming forces determined on &#8216;rationalising&#8217; the recreation of the working classes by introducing programs which they regarded as educational and self-improving, based essentially on their own middle class experience. A further restraint were contemporary conventions which determined matters of dress, conduct and behavioural expectations affecting areas of recreational activities; they were particularly severe on women. Other conventions affected full participation by men in a small number of sporting activities. The thesis examines the origin, nature and conduct of these forces in South Australia each of which sought to discipline aspects of mainly working class recreation of the period. It concludes with an assessment of the outcomes as they appeared at the time of Federation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recreation growth; recreation restraints; recreation conventions</field><field name="subject">Recreation Social aspects.</field><field name="subject">South Australia Social life and customs 1836-1900.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The amateur writes back : new theoretical directions for progressive left politics and social policy.</field><field name="creator">Goodwin-Smith, Ian</field><field name="description">This work develops an opportunity for transgressive resistance to discursively formed structures of material and theoretical power and closure, based on a methodology of amateurism.

These outcomes can result from &#8220;binge-drinking&#8221; (generally defined as &gt;5 standard drinks on a single occasion) or chronic ethanol consumption. Ethanol-induced zinc (Zn) deficiency is one of the mechanisms proposed as a cause of ethanol teratogenicity. We have previously demonstrated in mice that ethanol exposure on gestational day (GD)8 (during organogenesis) can alter Zn homeostasis by inducing the Zn-binding protein metallothionein (MT) in the maternal liver. This causes plasma Zn concentrations to decrease as Zn redistributes into the liver, and consequently decreases the fetal Zn supply and increases the risk of teratogenicity. Subcutaneous Zn treatment with ethanol on GD8 can prevent the deleterious effects of ethanol on the fetus (i.e. physical abnormalities and spatial memory impairments). The main objective of this thesis was to investigate whether a less invasive approach of giving dietary Zn supplementation throughout pregnancy could provide similar protective benefits against a range of adverse outcomes caused by prenatal binge or chronic ethanol exposure. Binge ethanol exposure in early pregnancy (i.e. where mice are injected with 25% ethanol (0.015 ml/g) intraperitoneally at 0 and 4 hours on GD8) significantly increased the incidence of birth abnormalities measured on GD18. These included craniofacial abnormalities (microphthalmia, anophthalmia) and limb defects. Ethanol also increased postnatal mortality between birth and postnatal day (PD)60. In a separate study, offspring from dams given ethanol on GD8 were subjected to a physical and behavioural screening protocol (including tests for vision, olfactory, exploratory, anxiety and motor impairments) and subsequently a cohort of phenotypically-normal offspring were randomly selected for testing in a cross-maze escape task (for spatial learning and memory) and an object recognition test (for short-term non-spatial memory). While ethanol did not affect behaviour measured during screening, it resulted in spatial memory and object recognition memory impairments in adult offspring. The most important finding was that dietary Zn supplementation throughout pregnancy significantly increased plasma Zn concentrations at the time of ethanol exposure (avoiding the &#8220;typical&#8221; ethanol-induced decrease in plasma Zn) and prevented all negative outcomes resulting from early ethanol exposure (birth abnormalities, mortality, spatial and object recognition memory impairments). In the chronic ethanol mouse model (i.e. where mice were fed a liquid diet containing 27 % v/v ethanol-derived calories from GD6-18), ethanol did not affect offspring growth between birth and PD21 or spatial memory in adult offspring, thus, the influence of Zn supplementation could not be examined for these parameters. While ethanol decreased offspring weight at PD50 and increased mortality between birth and PD40, they were not prevented by Zn supplementation throughout pregnancy. The findings from this thesis emphasise that organogenesis is a particularly vulnerable period to ethanol exposure and even a binge of ethanol during this time can result in dysmorphology, mortality and spatial and object memory impairments in adulthood. In addition, dietary Zn supplementation is protective against the deleterious effects of binge ethanol exposure in early pregnancy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethanol; pregnancy; zinc; fetal alcohol syndrome; metallothionein; behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns in correlation matrices arising in wine-tasting and other experiments.</field><field name="creator">Brien, Christopher J.</field><field name="description">There are two distinct areas of research on which the work in this thesis impinges. They are methods for the analysis of patterns in correlation matrices and the analysis of taster performance in wine-tasting experiments in which the wines are scored. For the analysis patterns in correlation matrices, least squares procedures are developed to examine patterns under certain equal correlation hypotheses. The procedures are applied to the z-transforms of the elements of correlation matrices that can be based on either a single group of variables, or variables that can be cross-indexed by two factors such as the multitrait-multimethod matrices given by Campbell and Fiske (1959). The procedures are of the analysis of variance type, being investigative in the sense that, in the event that the correlation matrix is judged to depart from the hypothesised pattern, alternative models to be pursued further are indicated. The associated statistics are calculated directly from closed-form expressions, rather that requiring the iterative solution of some estimation function as is the case with some alternative methods. The procedures are used to analyse the data from a number of wine-tasting and other experiments. The results obtained are shown to be similar, in many instances, to those obtained with maximum likelihood procedures applied to variance-covariance matrices; in other instances, large differences occur between the methods. The test for the hypothesis of equal correlation between all variables developed here is also shown to give similar answers to Lawley&#8217;s (1963) test for the hypothesis, in a number of cases. For the analysis of taster performance in wine-tasting experiments in which the wines are scored, the method of examining patterns in correlation matrices can be applied to multitaster and multitaster-multisession correlation matrices. Certain conditions to be fulfilled by multitaster-multisession matrices are specified; the extent to which they are met in a particular experiment can be ascertained from the results of these analyses. The data from several wine-tasting experiments are analysed and the results provide further substantive evidence of the lack of agreement and differences in reliability that can occur between tasters in such experiments. As the technique is applied to data from a single experiment, it can be used, particularly when session replicates are included, to select tasters on the basis of their performance in the experiment under consideration &#8211; a highly desirable approach. Four duplicate-evaluation wine-tasting experiments, that were aimed at determining the effect of several treatments on wine quality, fit into this category and so are analysed in more detail. A group of less heterogeneous tasters is selected, where possible, for each of the experiments using the results of the analysis of the multitaster-multisession correlation matrices. Compared with other techniques for selecting tasters on the basis of their results in a wine-tasting experiment, the analysis of multitaster-multisession correlation matrices has the advantages that both reliability and agreement are measured and that the measures are correlation coefficients. However, even the subsets of selected tasters do not behave in a manner that would justify a single analysis for mean differences for each subset. Because this is likely to be a common phenomenon, it is recommended that wine-tasting experiments be designed to include session replicates and the scores of each taster be analysed for mean differences separately. The results of the analysis of the multitaster-multisession matrix can then be used to determine the confidence to be attached to the results of individual tasters in drawing inferences from the experiment.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Correlation matrice; Pattern; Wine tasting; Matrix</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the dosimetric characteristics of MOSFETs for use for in vivo dosimetry during external beam radiotherapy.</field><field name="creator">Nelligan, Raelene Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the response to ionising radiation, of p-type Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) (REM Oxford (UK)) and a reader system developed by the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, The University of Wollongong, to determine their feasibility for measurements of dose during radiotherapy treatment (in vivo dosimetry (IVD)). Two types of MOSFET probes were used -"single sensitivity", for measuring low doses, and "dual sensitivity", to measure both high and lose doses. Sensitivity, linearity of response with dose, and response changes with accumulated dose and direction of incident radiation (angular dependence) were investigated. The average sensitivity reduction over the lifetime of the probes was 22.37% with a standard deviation of 0.63%. This reduction in sensitivity can be corrected for by the use of "drift equations". MOSFETs have a limited "lifetime" due to saturation effects with increasing accumulated dose. Saturation occurred at an average of 40 Gray (Gy) accumulated dose, for the high sensitivity probes investigated. The high sensitivity probes were linear within 1.6% for doses between 5 and 140 cGy, and 3.8% for the high sensitivity probes for doses between 50 and 500 cGy. Drift (changes in readings with time since irradiation due to electronic processes) over the long-term (from hours to weeks following irradiation) has been previously well characterised in the literature. This work focuses on shortterm drift, within the first few seconds or minutes following irradiation, being the most clinically relevant for in vivo measurements. Drift is investigated for various reading methods, such as reading frequency, and delays between irradiation and readings. It is shown that sensitivity, and consequently dose determination, is significantly influenced by the reading methodology. During the first five minutes following an irradiation, drift increased inversely with delivered dose, and was greater for probes having accumulated dose of &gt; 20 Gy (2.0 -16.2% compared with 1.2 -7.4% for &lt; 20 Gy probes). During the first five minutes following an irradiation, drift increased inversely with delivered dose, and was greater for probes having accumulated dose of &gt; 20 Gy (2.0 -16.2% compared with 1.2 -7.4% for &lt; 20 Gy probes). When two post-irradiation readings were taken following an irradiation, the difference between them generally increased as the time interval between the two readings increased, by up to 8.8%. Delays in taking pre-and post-irradiation readings resulted in drift of up to 5.7% or 9.3% respectively, compared with readings without a delay. These results emphasise the necessity for consistent methodologies between calibration and measurement in the clinical situation. Greater sensitivity was measured with the epoxy bubble, rather than the substrate side, facing the beam. The greatest variation, for orientations other than the bubble side facing directly towards the beam, was 10%, or 5% uncertainty in dose. The variations with angle were found to be reproducible, so that appropriate correction factors could be applied to correct measurements at angles other than with the sensitive area of the probes facing directly towards the radiation beam.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MOSFET; dosimetry; dosimeter; characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation and functional analysis of a geminiviral DNA &#946; satellite encoded gene.</field><field name="creator">Eini Gandomani, Omid</field><field name="description">Geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) are characterized structurally by twinned (geminate) morphology of virions (ca. 18-30 nm) and genetically by a genome comprising one or two small circular single stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules and they are responsible for major crop losses worldwide. The genus Begomovirus (type member Bean golden yellow mosaic virus) is the largest genus of the family Geminiviridae. The members of this genus have either monopartite or bipartite genomes. They are transmitted by whiteflies and infect only dicotyledonous plants. DNA &#946; molecules are symptom modulating single-stranded sat-DNA molecules which are associated with certain monopartite begomoviruses. These molecules are around half the size (approximately 1350 nt in length) of their helper viruses and rely on the helper begomovirus for movement in plant tissues, replication and plant-to-plant transmission by the whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). They contribute to production of symptoms and enhance helper virus accumulation in certain hosts. DNA &#946; molecules encode a single gene, called &#946;C1, on the complementary strand which is important for pathogenicity and suppression of post transcriptional gene silencing. In this study the regulation of &#946;C1 gene expression, a host factor interacting with &#946;C1 and its role in the pathogenicity of DNA &#946; are described. Transient expression studies using Nicotiana tabacum plants and GUS as a reporter gene, identified the sequences important for transcription of &#946;C1 from DNA &#946; associated with Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMV). A 68 nt fragment (between -139 to -207), which contains a G-box motif was sufficient for DNA &#946; promoter activity. Deletion of this region also led to loss of DNA &#946; replication capacity. Mutation of the G-box, located at 143 nucleotides upstream of the &#946;C1 start codon, resulted in a two to three times reduction in the DNA &#946; promoter activity. This motif was shown to bind specifically to the nuclear factors isolated from tobacco leaf tissues. Histochemical staining of transgenic tobacco plants expressing the gus gene driven by full length DNA &#946; promoter showed phloem specific localisation patterns. It was concluded that a G-box motif is required for binding of host nuclear factors and is necessary for efficient expression of this phloem specific &#946;C1 gene. An ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, called SlUBC, was retrieved from screening of a tomato cDNA library, using &#946;C1 encoded by DNA &#946; associated with CLCuMV as the bait. The SlUBC was shown to complement yeast deficient in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. It is thought that this enzyme is a key factor in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which plays a central role in many eukaryotic cellular processes. The authenticity and specificity of this interaction was confirmed both in vivo, using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, and in vitro. Domain mapping of &#946;C1 showed that a myristoylation-like motif is required for the interaction with SlUBC in the yeast system and induction of DNA &#946; specific symptoms in host plants. Western blot analysis showed that expression of &#946;C1 in transgenic tobacco plants decreased the level of poly-ubiquitinated proteins as compared with wild type plants. However, the level of expression of homologous SlUBC remained stable in these transgenic plants. These results indicated that interaction of &#946;C1 with the SlUBC is required for DNA &#946; specific symptom induction possibly through down-regulation of the host ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Using GFP transgenic N. benthamiana plants, the &#946;C1 encoded by DNA &#946; associated with CLCuMV showed suppression of post transcriptional gene silencing. This protein inhibited both local and systemic silencing. However, the low level of GFP fluorescence and also the results of RNA analysis in patch co-infiltration assay indicated that &#946;C1 is a weak suppressor of local RNA silencing as compared with P19 protein from Tomato bushy stunt virus. A three-way grafting assay and separate patch infiltration assays showed that &#946;C1 interferes with the activity of GFP silencing signal. Mutation of Gly103 in &#946;C1 which was shown to be required for interaction with SlUBC and induction of DNA &#946; specific symptoms in host plants, had no effect on the silencing suppression activity of &#946;C1 protein. This work has provided a new insight into the importance of a G-box motif in expression of &#946;C1 gene of DNA &#946; and also for binding to the host nuclear proteins. In addition, interaction with a host factor, SlUBC, has been shown to be required for induction of DNA &#946; specific symptoms in experimental plants using ToLCV as a helper virus. However, this interaction was not required for silencing suppression activity of &#946;C1. The results of this study can be adapted to determine the mode of pathogenesis and regulation of expression of &#946;C1 in cotton leaf curl disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant virus; geminivirus; satellite DNA; promoter; protein-protein interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative optimism about falling amongst community-dwelling older South Australians: a mixed methods approach.</field><field name="creator">Dollard, Joanne</field><field name="description">People aged &#8805;65 years (older people) have a higher chance of falling than other age groups. However, based on qualitative research, older people do not believe that falls prevention information and strategies have personal relevance. This suggests that older people believe that falls are more likely to happen to other older people than themselves, that is, they might be comparatively optimistic about their chance of falling. It is important to understand comparative optimism about falling as it is a consistent reason given by older people for not participating in falls prevention activity. This thesis used a mixed methods design with a sequential strategy to investigate community-dwelling older people's comparative optimism about falling. Three studies were undertaken, using semi-structured interviews, cognitive interviews and telephone interviews to collect data. The semi-structured interview study, guided by the tenets of grounded theory, aimed to develop an explanation of why older people might be comparatively optimistic. A sampling frame (age, sex and direct and indirect history of falling) was used to guide recruiting respondents. Older people (N = 9) were interviewed about their chance and other older people's chance of falling. Interviews were analysed using the constant comparison method. The cognitive interview study investigated potential problems in survey items in order to refine them for the telephone interview study. Items were developed to measure older people's comparative optimism about falling. Older people (N = 13) were cognitively interviewed, and interviews were content analysed. The telephone interview study aimed to determine whether older people were comparatively optimistic about falling, and whether the direct and indirect experience of falling was associated with comparative optimism. A random sample of older people (N = 389) living in South Australia were telephone interviewed (response rate = 75%). The semi-structured interview study identified that it was a 'threat to identity' for respondents to say they had a chance of falling because of intrinsic risk factors. Respondents used strategies to maintain or protect their identity when discussing their chance of falling in the future or their reasons for falling in the past. In the cognitive interview study, respondents reported difficulty in rating their chance of falling, as they believed falls were unexpected and unpredictable. They reported difficulty in rating other people's chance of falling, as they believed they did not know other people their age, did not have enough information and/or did not know the answer. In the telephone interview study, most respondents believed they had the same chance (42%), or a lower chance (48%) of falling in the next 12 months, than other older people. Having fallen in the last 12 months was significantly associated with a lowered comparative optimism, but knowing other older people who had fallen was not associated with comparative optimism. This is the first quantitative study to report that the majority of a representative sample of community-dwelling older people were comparatively optimistic about their chance of falling. Self-presentation concerns about having a chance of falling support the core category to emerge from the semi-structured interview study. Messages such as 'you can reduce your risk of falls' may be ignored by older people. Alternative messages should promote identities that are relevant to older people, such as being independent, mobile and active, but these messages should be tested in further research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">comparative optimism; perceived chance accidental falls</field><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) in old age South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Older people Wounds and injuries South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Aging Psychological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising the relationship between fowlpox virus and the mammalian immune system.</field><field name="creator">Beukema, Emma Louise</field><field name="description">Fowlpox viruses (FPV) are attractive platform vaccine vector candidates because their capacity for insertion of multiple heterologous genes makes them favourable for genetic modification. They also have strong adjuvant activity in their own right. As FPV does not replicate in mammalian cells, there is significantly less opposition associated with their clinical application, with a number already in use. However, a thorough understanding of the immunological relationship between FPV and the mammalian immune system is still lacking. The aim of this thesis was to construct a series of recombinant FPV vectors that co-expressed the nominal antigen chicken ovalbumin (OVA), (FPV[subscript]OVA), and/or murine interleukin-4 (mIL-4). These constructs were used for the characterisation of the relationship between FPV and the mammalian immune system and how this is altered by the co-expression of mIL-4. Immunisation with FPV[subscript]OVA resulted in rapid and highly localized OVA expression which induced strong CD8&#8314; cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity but only weak CD4&#8314; T helper and antibody responses. In addition, presentation of FPV-derived antigen and the priming of antigen-specific CTL responses required a permissive bone marrow (BM)-derived cell as the antigen presenting cell (APC). Co-administration with FPV[subscript]mIL-4 resulted in a dramatic reduction in CTL activity that remained largely non-functional throughout the infection and a skewing of the T helper (Th) response towards Th2 with a reduction in interferon (IFN)-&#947; production by OVA-specific Th cells. These findings provide a sound basis for further characterization of how FPV interacts with the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, how these can be manipulated via the co-administration of cytokines, and discovering if future rationally designed modifications result in FPV vectored vaccines that induce durable cellular and humoral immunity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fowlpx virus; immune system; vaccine vector</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of substance P in early experimental Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</field><field name="creator">Thornton, Emma</field><field name="description">Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common motor neurodegenerative diseases, affecting 1-2% of the world's population over the age of 65. It is characterised by a loss of dopamine neurons within the substantia nigra, which is an integral part of the basal ganglia (BG) where dopamine is the most important modulating neurotransmitter. As the BG is primarily involved with the execution of movement, the lack of dopamine input results in dysfunctional motor control. The current PD treatment, L-DOPA, improves these motor symptoms, however only provides patients 5 to 10 years of improved quality of life before debilitating side effects, often worse than the original symptoms, begin. The neuropeptide substance P (SP) is found in high concentration in the substantia nigra, and BG in general, where it is involved in dopamine release. In the late stages of PD, SP content within the substantia nigra and BG is decreased, thus implicating SP in the pathophysiology of PD. However, SP production has not been examined in the early stages of PD when dopaminergic degeneration is first initiated. This thesis therefore sought to characterise the role of SP in dopaminergic degeneration in an experimental model of early PD, the 6-hydroxydopamine model in rats. In contrast to the prevailing dogma that a decline in SP is associated with neurodegeneration in PD, this thesis demonstrates that SP is actually increased within the striatum in early PD, particular in perivascular tissue and within surviving dopaminergic neurons during the degenerative process. Increasing exposure of the dopaminergic neurons to SP, either by inhibition of substance P breakdown with Captopril or by direct injection with SP, exacerbated the disease progression as indicated by more profound neurogenic inflammation, functional deficits and increased dopaminergic cell death. However, when SP was inhibited by treatment with a SP NK&#8321; receptor antagonist, dopaminergic neurons were conserved, the inflammatory response was reduced and motor function was returned to near normal levels. We conclude that SP is increased in early PD, and that increased SP plays an important role in the degenerative process, specifically, in the genesis of BBB breakdown and initiation of neurogenic inflammation. Treatment with an NK1 antagonist may thus represent a novel therapeutic approach to early stage Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">substance P; Parkinson's disease; cell death; inflammation; neurogenic inflammation; blood brain barrier</field><field name="subject">Substance P</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Antiparkinsonian agents.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magnesium and diabetes : it&#8217;s implications for the health of indigenous Australians.</field><field name="creator">Longstreet, Diane Alicia</field><field name="description">Diabetes in Indigenous Australians occurs at a younger age and at almost four times the rate of non-Indigenous Australians. While the cause for this health disparity is multi-factorial, recent studies suggest that nutrition, and particularly magnesium intake, may play a role in onset of diabetes and related pathologies. No study has ever examined whether there is any relationship between diabetes and magnesium intake in Indigenous Australians, and the present study therefore sought to establish whether any such interrelationship existed. As part of this study, dietary magnesium intake was estimated in an urban cohort of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander subjects and compared to the average Australian dietary intake. An ecological study then explored environmental correlates, and specifically the magnesium level in drinking water, to diabetes mortality. Finally, total and free serum magnesium concentrations were determined to identify any differences in magnesium status between diabetic and non-diabetic Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and also to compare which of the two parameters was a more sensitive measure of magnesium status and diabetic risk. All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that were recruited for this study were patients of the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Health Services, Townsville, North Queensland, who presented for health monitoring and subsequently required fasting blood tests as part of that routine care. Additional non-Indigenous people were recruited from five GP practices in the Townsville area. Inclusion criteria included persons over the age of 15 (Tanner Stage 5) who had lived in the Townsville area for at least ten days. Exclusion criteria included chronic diarrhoea, alcoholism or binge drinking in the past two weeks, use of diuretics, consumption of magnesium supplements, reduced renal function (urinary albumin to creatinine ratio exceeding &gt; 2.5 mg/mmol in men and &gt; 3.5 mg/mmol in women), severe mental illness, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Our results indicated that 60% of the Indigenous people assessed in this study had a dietary intake of magnesium that was below the estimated average magnesium requirement for half the national population. Additionally, the average magnesium intake in Indigenous Australians was significantly less than the intake of non-Indigenous Australians (p&lt;0 .001). A significant negative correlation was found between the incidence of diabetes related mortality and the concentration of magnesium in drinking water in Queensland, confirming previous reports from the USA that drinking water magnesium may be an important factor in development of diabetes. The needs assessment study confirmed that diabetes in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians was associated with reduced levels of total serum magnesium, and more importantly, that total serum magnesium was lower in Indigenous Australians who did not have diabetes compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts (p=&lt;0.001). In the absence of diabetes, the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia was 17.2% for the non-Indigenous but 36.9% for the Indigenous subjects. Finally, the ionic serum magnesium analysis confirmed the results of the total serum magnesium study, and demonstrated that ionic magnesium was strongly correlated to the total magnesium concentration (r: 0.75. p &lt; 0.001), with the relationship being apparent irrespective of either diabetic (r: 0.66 to 0.81. p&lt;0.001) or ethnicity (r = 0.71 to 0.81. p&lt;0.001)." We conclude that although not causal, the evidence suggests that magnesium may be a significant contributing factor to diabetes in Australia, especially for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and that further investigation of the potential relationship between magnesium and diabetes in the Australian Indigenous populations, and possible corrective interventions, is highly warranted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">magnesium; diabetes; nutrient intake; diet; water; mortality</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Diabetes Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Magnesium.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In situ stress and overpressures of Brunei Darussalam</field><field name="creator">Tingay, Mark Robert Paul</field><field name="description">Title page, contents and abstract only.

It aims at creating learning resources to be used in English classes in Indonesia. The data collection involved observations and interviews. Initial data analysis was conducted at the same time as the data collection, followed by an intensive analysis using a coding process. Some similarities were found. There was a tendency among Indonesian students to sit together, reflecting their collectivist value. This tendency may also be evident among Australian students. Similar patterns of eye gazing, hand movements, sitting posture, body position and body orientation probably demonstrate the universality of communicative behaviour. In both cultures, head nodding indicates paying attention, or in certain situations, may be interpreted as a flattering gesture. However, the flattering meaning may result from a different degree of head nodding display in Indonesian and Australian contexts. Many of these similar behaviours need further investigation using video recording. Many differences were found. In tutorials, Indonesians were more likely to be formal and restrained, in contrast to Australian informality and expressiveness. Different practices in the use of the hand were also identified. Dress code was one of the most significant areas of difference, together with the public display of affective behaviour, and the preference to sit on the floor or to sit and lie on the lawns. Eye contact, gender-mixing in gatherings and some touching behaviours may be problematic for a few Indonesians. Further discussion also shows that smiling to strangers commonly practised by Australians can be unusual in Indonesia. In contrast, head nodding, eye contact and head tossing that have specific cultural meanings in Indonesia appear to be unproblematic in the Australian context. It was concluded that the different behaviours indicate that several issues &#8211; including conflict avoidance, face saving, respect for authority, harmony maintenance, ingroup-outgroup divisions and religious regulations &#8211; are practiced in different ways and valued to differing degrees in Indonesia and Australia. The analysis also revealed a strong indication that in Indonesian culture, nonverbal behaviour has similar emphasis with, and often can be more significant than, verbal behaviour. In Australia, the emphasis would be more likely to be on verbal expression. It seems that some of the differences did not result in negative perception among students. However, certain things may result in problems at various levels - ranging from uncomfortable feelings, and lack of interactions, up to the formation of negative perception about a culture. Having tolerance and willingness to evaluate a matter from different perspectives can be useful to minimize ethnocentrism and avoid any negative stereotypes. As part of this study I conducted a literature review about intercultural learning and created two examples of learning material, both focusing on nonverbal behaviours. The first material is intended to raise the issue of cultural difference, and the second one raises the ethnocentrism issue.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intercultural; Indonesia; Australia; nonverbal behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generation of tolerogenic human DC through Rapamycin conditioning and genetic modification with HLA-G.</field><field name="creator">Fedoric, Boris</field><field name="description">Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen presenting cells involved in the initiation of the alloimmune response and organ transplant rejection. This thesis, has investigated pharmacological and genetic approaches to manipulate DC in order to generate tolerogenic DC which elicit poor allostimulatory activity as potential cell therapy agents to treat allograft rejection. In the first aspect of this study, human monocyte-derived DC were used to study the influence of Rapamycin (RAPA) on DC phenotype and function. This study showed that RAPA when added to monocytes prior to DC differentiation or after DC maturation generated tolerogenic DC as evidenced by the ability of these cells to induce T cell hyporesponsiveness. However, T cell hyporesponsiveness was associated with downregulation of costimulatory molecules only when added prior to differentiation and surprisingly was not influenced by the induction of CD4 &#8314;FoxP3 &#8314; T cells. To assess the effects of RAPA on DC function in the transplant setting an in vivo chimeric model of ovine vascularised skin allograft transplantation was established in immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice as a host. This model was established as a preliminary model to acquire in vivo data prior to testing the effect of pharmacologically modified DC in the preclinical ovine model of renal allograft transplantation, also established in the host laboratory. Firstly, comparison of ovine DC obtained from cannulation of the prefemoral lymphatic vessels in sheep demonstrated that RAPA-modified ovine DC acted as poor stimulators of allogeneic ovine T cells similar to human DC treated with RAPA. Secondly, in NOD/SCID mice engrafted with ovine skin, the infusion of allogeneic ovine T cells together with RAPA-modified ovine DC reduced histological rejection in comparison to control DC. In the second aspect of this study, the effects of genetic manipulation of DC were investigated. In order to investigate the effects of genetic modification of DC, two isoforms of the human HLA-G molecule, HLA-G1 (membrane bound) and HLA-G5 (soluble isoform) were used to generate adenoviral vectors. Unexpectedly, both HLA-G isoforms expressed by human DC transfectants were unable to induce allogeneic T cell hyporesponsiveness in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Surprisingly, in the MLR the allogeneic T cells acquired HLA-G1, but not HLA-G5, indicating that direct cell contact and membrane transfer from DC to T cells occurred (Trogocytosis). In addition to HLA-G1, costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC Class II) were also cotransferred from DC to allogeneic T cells. Accordingly, in secondary proliferation assays T cells immunoselected after co-culture with allogeneic untransfected DC (TUT) demonstrated potent antigen presenting activity when used as stimulators of autologous T cells (analogous to the indirect pathway of antigen presentation). In contrast to TUT, immunoselected T cells that acquired HLA-G1 (THLA-G1) upon co-culture with DCtransfectants showed poor stimulatory capacity. Thus the data reported in this thesis supports the proposed novel concept that HLA-G acquired by T cells through genetically modified DC, functions to autoregulate T cells via T-T cell interaction through the HLA-G receptor ILT2 (negative signalling receptor) expressed on T cells. In conclusion, this thesis has firstly provided supportive evidence that the pharmacological modification of human and ovine DC with RAPA has potential therapeutic effects on allograft rejection. Secondly, the genetic modification of DC to induce expression of HLA-G has specifically allowed the transfer of this molecule to T cells by trogocytosis and the inhibition of alloreactive T cell expansion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dendritic cell; transplantation; ILT3; ILT4; HLA-G; tolerance; T regulatory cells; immunosuppession; Rapamycin; adenovirus; Cyclosporine A</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient data transport in wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Haibo</field><field name="description">Providing efficient data transport is one of the uppermost objectives in the design of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) since the primary role for each sensor is to report the sensed data to the data sink(s). This thesis focuses on designing efficient data transport schemes for WSNs in the dimensions of energy consumption and time respectively. The developed schemes can be directly applied in a number of applications such as intrusion detection, target tracking, environment monitoring, etc., and can be further extended to underwater acoustic sensor networks and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks. With the development of WSN technologies, new challenging research problems such as real-time streaming data gathering and intelligent data communication are emerging. This thesis provides useful foundation for designing next-generation data transport schemes for WSNs. Energy is the most important resource in WSNs because sensor nodes are commonly powered by small batteries, and energy is directly related to the lifetime of nodes and the network. In this thesis, energy-efficient data transport schemes are designed for two major types of WSNs: event-driven sensor networks and time-driven sensor networks. A novel on-line routing scheme called EBGR (Energy-efficient Beaconless Geographic Routing) is designed for event-driven sensor networks characterized by dynamic network topology. The main advantage of EBGR is that it can provide energy-efficient sensor-to-sink routing without any prior neighborhood knowledge. Moreover, the total energy consumption for sensor-to-sink data delivery under EBGR has an upper bound. Time-driven sensor networks, in which all sensors periodically report the sensed data to the sink(s), have been widely used for environment monitoring applications. Unbalanced energy consumption is an inherent problem in time-driven sensor networks. An efficient data gathering scheme, called EBDG (Energy-Balanced Data Gathering), is designed to balance energy consumption for the goal of maximizing network lifetime. Combing all advantages of corona-based network division,mixed-routing and data aggregation, EBDG can prolong network lifetime by an order of magnitude compared with conventional schemes. Time-efficient data transport is another critical issue in WSNs since the data generated by the sensor nodes may become outdated after a certain time interval. This thesis focuses on the problem of providing real-time data gathering in time-driven sensor networks. A novel data gathering scheme based on random access is proposed with the objective to minimize the average duration for completing one round of data gathering. Fully localized solutions have been designed for both linear networks and tree networks. A simple data gathering protocol called RADG (Random Access Data Gathering) is designed. Simulation results show that RADG outperforms CSMA based schemes when the size of the data packets is small.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless sensor networks; data gathering; energy-efficient data transport; time-efficient data gathering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New methods for the construction of novel heterocycles from 1,2-Dioxines.</field><field name="creator">Zvarec, Ondrej John</field><field name="description">Cyclic peroxides are abundant in Nature and synthetic manipulation of the peroxide linkage and alkene portion of 1,2-dioxines has established 1,2-dioxines as important compounds as both chemical building blocks and bioactive compounds. Much of the chemistry performed thus far utilizing 1,2-dioxines involves the initial rearrangement of 1,2-dioxines to &#947;-hydroxyenones allowing for the generation of structural motifs such as cyclopropanes, THF&#8217;s, THP&#8217;s, 1,4-diketones and natural sugars. Herein describes the synthesis of novel 1,2-dioxines with a variety of tethered functionalities and their transformations to afford novel cyclic compounds whilst maintaining the peroxide linkage intact. Chapter two outlines the intramolecular cyclisations of tethered hydroxyl and carboxylic acid moieties onto the olefin of 1,2- dioxines to generate both tetrahydrofurans and dihydrofuran-2(3H)-ones, whilst maintaining the peroxide linkage. This work presents the first examples of syn fused cyclic peroxide furans through intramolecular cyclisation of tethered hydroxyl groups. Improved methods for the oxidation of hydroxyl tethered 1,2-dioxines to carboxylic acid moieties are also reported. In addition, improved methods for intramolecular cyclisation of carboxylic acid moieties where developed to afford syn fused cyclic peroxide lactones. Furthermore, reduction of the peroxide bond enabled generation of functionalized tetrahydrofurans and dihydrofuran-2(3H)-ones which have previously been utilized as synthetic building blocks for several natural products. Chapter three reports the first examples of carbenoid insertion into the peroxide linkage of 1,2-dioxines allowing for the generation of novel bicyclic hemiacetals. Alternatively novel tricyclic cyclopropyl peroxides where generated through insertion into the olefin whilst maintaining the peroxide linage intact. Additionally, the attempted intramolecular cyclisation of diazoketone tethered bicyclic 1,2-dioxines was also probed. Furthermore, the attempted intermolecular insertion of diazoketones onto 1,2-dioxines are presented within this chapter. Finally, Chapter four outlines the intramolecular cyclisations of bromo-alkyl tethered 1,2-dioxines to furnish novel cyclic cyclopentyl peroxides whilst maintaining the peroxide linkage intact. The work presented in this chapter represents the first examples of the synthesis of syn fused cyclic cyclopentyl peroxides. In summary, this thesis outlines methodology towards the synthesis of novel cyclic peroxides from 1,2-dioxines containing tethered functional groups.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heterocycles; 1,2-dioxines; lactones; THF; tetrahydrofuran; carbene; diazoketone</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on business cycle fluctuations.</field><field name="creator">Photphisutthiphong, Nopphawan</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of three essays on business cycle fluctuations that are based on the market-clearing dynamic general equilibrium framework. The first two essays examine the ultimate source of economic fluctuations in Thailand and Australia, respectively. The tool of study is the Business Cycle Accounting (BCA) method developed by Chari et al. (2002; 2007a). The third essay investigates the relation between capital-labour substitution and sectoral externalities in self-fulfilling expectation equilibria. It employs a two-sector competitive model proposed by Benhabib and Farmer (1996). The BCA method examines the transmission mechanisms of shocks within an economy. These transmission mechanisms are called wedges which are responsible for the deviation of aggregate variables from a competitive equilibrium. Four categories of wedges are defined in the BCA: 1) the efficiency wedge represents the input-financing frictions in production; 2) the labour wedge is the frictions between consumption leisure trade-off and marginal product of labour; 3) the investment wedge is the frictions between the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in consumption and the marginal product of capital; and 4) the government consumption wedge indicates the frictions in international borrowing and lending. Chapter 2 applies the BCA method with deterministic wedges to examine the output variations in Thailand between 1971-2003. The efficiency wedge is found to be the most important driving force behind the output variations during episodes of boom and bust in Thailand over the studied period. In particular for the 1997 economic downturn, the evidence shows that the cost of credit intermediation for some firms was relatively high. This altered an acquisition of working capital and labour in these firms when compared to others, which likely caused inefficient reallocation of inputs across the economy. As such, the efficiency wedge appears to fall at aggregate level during the economic downturn. Chapter 3 applies the BCA method with stochastic wedges to examine the variations in output and investment in Australia. Although the efficiency wedge alone can account for these variations, it predicts much more volatility in output than the actual data. Upon allowing for the combination of efficiency and labour wedges, the model can replicate the amplitude of output variations better. The negative cross correlation between these two wedges suggests their interference. Chapter 4 examines the effect of capital-labour substitution on the existence of indeterminacy in two-sector models and check whether the corresponding returns to scale are still empirically plausible. The main finding is that a higher requirement of sectoral externalities for indeterminacy is needed when capital and labour are less substitutable. Intuitively, the low substitutability implies that capital and labour are complementary factors of production. This retards the mobility of factors between the consumption and investment sectors. In the belief driven equilibria, the consumers&#8217; optimistic expectation on returns is fulfilled as long as the rate of returns is sufficiently high such that current consumption is given up for investment. The rate of returns hereby indicates sectoral externalities. In such a production environment, the minimum requirement of externalities for indeterminacy therefore becomes larger so that it can successfully break the tightly coupling factors within sector, and raises the production of investment goods effectively. As a result, the current relative price of investment goods falls. In the next period, consumers enjoy more consumption goods and the relative price of investment good rises. The ascending pricing sequence yields capital gains and the consumers&#8217; belief is finally fulfilled. Based on the logarithmic utility in consumption and the elasticity of substitution of 0.5 as suggested in Klump et al. (2007) and Chirinko (2008), the minimum requirement of returns to scale for indeterminacy is 1.1236, and it still lies within the range in most empirical studies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business cycle fluctuations; Business cycle accounting; indeterminacy; capital-labour substitution; two-sector model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio of compositions and exegesis: conflict and resolution - modelling emergent ensemble dynamics.</field><field name="creator">Harrald, Luke Adrian</field><field name="description">Theory as an approach to generative composition and interactive computer music.

Composition activities and programming activities have formed a symbiotic relationship throughout the creation of the portfolio as each has constantly informed the other. Stylistically, the works presented fall into the experimental genre, although individually they address a wide range of aesthetic goals. The main contribution of this portfolio is a new approach to generative composition based on behavioural models, creating a sense of form bottom-up through modelling the social dynamics of music performance. Through this approach, the direct modelling of musical structures is avoided; instead larger scale forms emerge through the interactions of an ensemble of &#8216;improvising&#8217; agents. This method offers a departure from previous complex systems work in the area of music, creating computer models of specific musical situations.

Various ways of accessing users' tacit knowledge and latent needs have been explored in the field of user-centred design, participatory design, and design for experiencing. User-designer collaboration has been used unconsciously by traditional designers to facilitate the transfer of users' tacit knowledge and to elicit new knowledge. However, what makes user-designer collaboration an effective strategy has rarely been reported on or explored. Therefore, interaction patterns between the users and the designers in three industry-supported user involvement cases were studied. In order to develop a coding system, collaboration was defined as a set of coordinated and joint problem solving activities, measured by the elicitation of new knowledge from collaboration. The analysis of interaction patterns in the user involvement cases revealed that allowing users to challenge or modify their contextual experiences facilitates the transfer of knowledge and new knowledge generation. It was concluded that users can be more effectively integrated into the product development process by employing collaboration strategies to intensify the depth of user involvement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">product development, user-designer collaboration</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/26372/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Membrane associated transporter protein gene (SLC45A2) and the genetic basis of normal human pigmentation variation</field><field name="creator">Graf, Justin T.</field><field name="description">This work is concerned with the genetic basis of normal human pigmentation variation. Specifically, the role of polymorphisms within the solute carrier family 45 member 2 (SLC45A2 or membrane associated transporter protein; MATP) gene were investigated with respect to variation in hair, skin and eye colour &#8213; both between and within populations. SLC45A2 is an important regulator of melanin production and mutations in the gene underly the most recently identified form of oculocutaneous albinism. There is evidence to suggest that non-synonymous polymorphisms in SLC45A2 are associated with normal pigmentation variation between populations. Therefore, the underlying hypothesis of this thesis is that polymorphisms in SLC45A2 will alter the function or regulation of the protein, thereby altering the important role it plays in melanogenesis and providing a mechanism for normal pigmentation variation.
 
 In order to investigate the role that SLC45A2 polymorphisms play in human pigmentation variation, a DNA database was established which collected pigmentation phenotypic information and blood samples of more than 700 individuals. This database was used as the foundation for two association studies outlined in this thesis, the first of which involved genotyping two previously-described non-synonymous polymorphisms, p.Glu272Lys and p.Phe374Leu, in four different population groups. For both polymorphisms, allele frequencies were significantly different between population groups and the 272Lys and 374Leu alleles were strongly associated with black hair, brown eyes and olive skin colour in Caucasians. This was the first report to show that SLC45A2 polymorphisms were associated with normal human intra-population pigmentation variation.
 
 The second association study involved genotyping several SLC45A2 promoter polymorphisms to determine if they also played a role in pigmentation variation. Firstly, the transcription start site (TSS), and hence putative proximal promoter region, was identified using 5' RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE). Two alternate TSSs were identified and the putative promoter region was screened for novel polymorphisms using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC). A novel duplication (c.&#8211;1176_&#8211;1174dupAAT) was identified along with other previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (c.&#8211;1721C&gt;G and c.&#8211;1169G&gt;A). Strong linkage disequilibrium ensured that all three polymorphisms were associated with skin colour such that the &#8211;1721G, +dup and &#8211;1169A alleles were associated with olive skin in Caucasians. No linkage disequilibrium was observed between the promoter and coding region polymorphisms, suggesting independent effects. The association analyses were complemented with functional data, showing that the &#8211;1721G, +dup and &#8211;1169A alleles significantly decreased SLC45A2 transcriptional activity. Based on in silico bioinformatic analysis that showed these alleles remove a microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) binding site, and that MITF is a known regulator of SLC45A2 (Baxter and Pavan, 2002; Du and Fisher, 2002), it was postulated that SLC45A2 promoter polymorphisms could contribute to the regulation of pigmentation by altering MITF binding affinity.
 
 Further characterisation of the SLC45A2 promoter was carried out using luciferase reporter assays to determine the transcriptional activity of different regions of the promoter. Five constructs were designed of increasing length and their promoter activity evaluated. Constitutive promoter activity was observed within the first ~200 bp and promoter activity increased as the construct size increased. The functional impact of the &#8211;1721G, +dup and &#8211;1169A alleles, which removed a MITF consensus binding site, were assessed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and expression analysis of genotyped melanoblast and melanocyte cell lines. EMSA results confirmed that the promoter polymorphisms affected DNA-protein binding. Interestingly, however, the protein/s involved were not MITF, or at least MITF was not the protein directly binding to the DNA. In an effort to more thoroughly characterise the functional consequences of SLC45A2 promoter polymorphisms, the mRNA expression levels of SLC45A2 and MITF were determined in melanocyte/melanoblast cell lines. Based on SLC45A2&#8217;s role in processing and trafficking TYRP1 from the trans-Golgi network to stage 2 melanosmes, the mRNA expression of TYRP1 was also investigated. Expression results suggested a coordinated expression of pigmentation genes.
 
 This thesis has substantially contributed to the field of pigmentation by showing that SLC45A2 polymorphisms not only show allele frequency differences between population groups, but also contribute to normal pigmentation variation within a Caucasian population. In addition, promoter polymorphisms have been shown to have functional consequences for SLC45A2 transcription and the expression of other pigmentation genes. Combined, the data presented in this work supports the notion that SLC45A2 is an important contributor to normal pigmentation variation and should be the target of further research to elucidate its role in determining pigmentation phenotypes. Understanding SLC45A2&#8217;s function may lead to the development of therapeutic interventions for oculocutaneous albinism and other disorders of pigmentation. It may also help in our understanding of skin cancer susceptibility and evolutionary adaptation to different UV environments, and contribute to the forensic application of pigmentation phenotype prediction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">membrane associated transporter protein (MATP), solute carrier family 45 member 2 (SLC45A2), antigen in melanoma (AIM1), underwhite, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), normal human pigmentation variation, promoter, hair, skin and eye colour, genotyping</field><field name="subject">association study</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/25913/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and the Australian parliament</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Mary Catherine</field><field name="description">This dissertation by publication which focuses on gender and the Australian federal parliament has resulted in the submission of three refereed journal articles. Data for the study were obtained from 30 semi-structured interviews undertaken in 2006 with fifteen (15) male and fifteen (15) female members of the Australian parliament. The first of the articles is methodological and has been accepted for publication in the Australian Journal of Political Science. The paper argues that feminist political science is guided by five important principles. These are placing gender at the centre of the research, giving emphasis to women&#8217;s voice, challenging the public/private divide, using research to transform society and taking a reflexive approach to positionality. It is the latter principle, that of the importance of taking a reflexive approach to research which I explore in the paper. Through drawing on my own experiences as a member of the House of Representatives (Forde 1987-1996) I reflexively investigate the intersections between my background and my identity as a researcher. The second of the articles views the data through the lens of Acker&#8217;s (1990) notion of the &#8216;gendered organization&#8217; which posits that there are four dimensions by which organizations are gendered. These are via the division of labour, through symbols, images and ideologies, by workplace interactions and through the gendered components of individual identity. In this paper which has been submitted to the British Journal of Political Science, each of Acker&#8217;s (1990) dimensions is examined in terms of the data from interviews with male and female politicians. The central question investigated is thus to what extent does the Australian parliament conform to Acker&#8217;s (1990) concept of the &#8216;gendered organization&#8217;? The third of the papers focuses specifically on data from interviews with the 15 male politicians and investigates how they view gender equality and the Australian parliament. The article, which has been submitted to the European Journal of Political Science asks to what extent contemporary male politicians view the Australian parliament as gendered? Discourse analysis that is &#8216;ways of viewing&#8217; (Bacchi, 1999, p. 40) is used as an approach to analyse the data. Three discursive frameworks by which male politicians view gender in the Australian parliament are identified. These are: that the parliament is gendered as masculine but this is unavoidable; that the parliament is gendered as feminine and women are actually advantaged; and that the parliament is gender neutral and gender is irrelevant. It is argued that collectively these framing devices operate to mask the many constraints which exist to marginalise women from political participation and undermine attempts to address women&#8217;s political disadvantage as political participants. The article concludes by highlighting the significance of the paper beyond the Australian context and calling for further research which names and critiques political men and their discourses on gender and parliamentary practices and processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender, parliament, Australia, reflexivity, masculinity</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/26409/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation Heuristics for Cryptology</field><field name="creator">Clark, Andrew J.</field><field name="description">The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to investigate the use of various optimisation heuristics in the fields of automated cryptanalysis and automated cryptographic function generation.

We present a complete system which employs a structured light scanner to acquire 3D views of objects from multiple viewpoints. These multiple views, expressed in a sensor-oriented coordinate system, are then registered into a model-centred coordinate system, before being integrated into a single mesh describing the object's geometry.   Line of sight constraints forbid any single view from capturing the entire surface of an object, so multiple scans must be performed. We have developed registration techniques which may register all of the views simultaneously, resulting in a globally optimal solution.  Statistical error modeling of the sensor, and the use of these models in the registration process, forms a key part of the research.  It is motiviated by the observation that all measurements are subject to some degree of random measurement error. The true values of these errors cannot be determined, however their statistical properties may be modeled.  Our registration system utilises these error models to improve registration accuracy, and to allow the accuracy of the registration to be estimated.  The resulting system is a flexible platform for 3D data capture and modeling.  It may be used in conjunction with the structured light scanner, or 3D data acquired from any other source.  We demonstrate this capability with models constructed from sources such as laser range finders and scanning touch probe systems. The contributions of this thesis are as follows:  a novel stereo matching algorithm which permits the estimation of stereo disparity as well as the uncertainty in the disparity, development of a practical 3D vision sensor based on structured light techniques, two novel algorithms for performing simultaneous multiple view point set registration, while supporting individual point error models and estimating the uncertainty in the registration solution, a novel algorithm for efficiently solving the multiple view registration problem, and the implementation of a number of existing surface correspondence and reconstruction techniques, permitting the development of an integrated 3D vision system for capturing and modeling 3D objects.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">registration</field><field name="subject">modeling</field><field name="subject">surface</field><field name="subject">3D</field><field name="subject">least squares</field><field name="subject">errors</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15778/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomechanical Models for the Analysis of Partial Foot Amputee Gait</field><field name="creator">Dillon, Michael Peter</field><field name="description">Partial foot amputation is becoming a more viable and common surgical intervention for the treatment of advanced diabetes, vascular insufficiency and trauma. Statistics describing the incidence of partial foot amputation are scarce. In Australia, it is not known how many people undergo partial foot amputation annually however in the United States upwards of 10,000 partial foot amputations are performed each year. Many of these procedures are likely to be in preference to below-knee amputation under the pretext of improved function associated with preserving the ankle joint and foot length despite common failings including ulceration and equinus contracture which can lead to more proximal amputation.  There is a substantial body of literature, which lends support to the contention that much of clinical practice has not been based on experimental evidence describing the gait of partial foot amputees or the influence of prosthetic and orthotic intervention. This limited scientific underpinning of practice may contribute to the common failures and allow misconceptions, such that preserving foot length and the ankle joint improves function, to perpetuate. The aim of this investigation was to develop accurate mechanical models to analyse the effects of amputation and prosthetic/orthotic intervention on the gait of partial foot amputees. Anthropometric and linked-segment inverse dynamic models were developed to accurately depict the affected lower limb and account for prosthetic/orthotic intervention and footwear. These novel techniques enhance the accuracy of kinetic descriptions, affecting the results obtained for terminal swing phase. These models more accurately portray the requirements of the hamstring and gluteus maximus muscles to decelerate the swinging limb in response to the net increase in mass and inertia of the limb segments due to prosthetic fitting.  With an appreciation of the influence these models have on the estimation of kinetic parameters, the gait of partial foot amputees was investigated. Kinematic abnormalities were primarily limited to the ankle and were characterised by poor control of tibial rotation during the mid-stance phase consistent with reduced eccentric work by the triceps surae muscles. The centre of pressure excursion and anterior progression of the trunk outside the reduced base of support was limited until contralateral initial contact; which could reflect triceps surae weakness and an inability to substantially load the prosthetic forefoot. Reductions in power generation across the affected ankle were the result of reductions in the angular excursion of the ankle and reductions in the ankle moment. Reductions in the ankle moment were consistent with the limited excursion of the centre of pressure commensurate with peak ground reaction forces. During early stance, concentric activity of the hip extensor musculature was observed, bilaterally, to advance the body forward. Results from these investigations focus on restoring power generation across the ankle given that the primary reason for preserving the ankle joint and calf musculature would seem to be the ability to use it functionally. Improvements in triceps surae strength may allow individuals to capitalise on improvements in below ankle prosthetic design and affect significant improvements in ankle power generation. In conjunction with improvements in muscle strength, below ankle prosthetic design needs to incorporate a socket and toe lever capable of comfortably distributing forces caused by loading the prosthetic forefoot. In conjunction with improvements in muscle strength, above ankle prosthetic design needs to incorporate an ankle joint. The development of a suitable joint poses significant design challenges for the engineer and prosthetist. This thesis provides new insights into the gait of partial foot amputees and the influence of prosthetic/orthotic design, which challenge common misconceptions underpinning clinical practice, prosthetic prescription and surgery. Aside from advancing the understanding of partial foot amputee gait and the influence of prosthetic/orthotic fitting, these investigations challenge and aim to improve current prosthetic and rehabilitation practice. Thus reducing the incidence of complications, such as ulceration which have been associated with the need for more proximal below knee amputation and allow partial foot amputees to utilise the intact ankle joint complex.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gait</field><field name="subject">partial foot</field><field name="subject">amputee</field><field name="subject">anthropometry</field><field name="subject">inverse dynamics</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">biomechanics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15779/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modification of Atrium Design to Improve Thermal and Daylighting Performance</field><field name="creator">Mabb, John Ashley</field><field name="description">The inclusion of a central court or atrium within a building is a popular design due to its aesthetic, open appearance. The greater penetration of natural light aids in the reduction in use of artificial lighting during the day. Care must be taken to balance the solar heat gain against the daylight penetration. This balance is critical for the reduction of the electrical energy load of the building, whilst maintaining a high level of comfort for the occupants. In the tropics modifications to atrium building designs are necessary to diminish high elevation direct solar heat gain. Traditionally, shading the window apertures or lowering the transmission through the glazing was used. These solutions limit the view and reduce the light level. The use of angular selective glazing upon atria allows the rejection of high elevation direct sunlight whilst redirecting and therefore improving low elevation skylight penetration. Tilted angular selective glazing used upon adjoining spaces to atria help vertical light in the atrium well to be redirected horizontally deep into the space. These effects reduce overheating which would normally restrict the use of atria in warmer environments as well as improve illumination penetration into adjoining spaces. The research showed that under clear sky conditions the modified glazing gave a lower temperature in the middle of the day within the atrium well. A more even distribution of illuminance across the course of the day was found and a higher level of illuminance was achieved within the well and its adjoining spaces under clear skies. These effects were simulated using computer algorithms. The algorithms were verified by field data collected from the QUT Daylighting Research Test Building located at the Brisbane Airport Bureau of Meteorology site where two simultaneously monitored model (1:10 scale) atriums were studied for several months.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atrium</field><field name="subject">Daylighting</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15780/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical Effects of Degeneration in Lumbar Intervertebral Discs</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Rosemary Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Lower  back  injuries  are  an  illness  which  plague  our society.          Although  almost  everyone  will  experience some form of lower back          pain  in  his  or  her  lifetime,  it  is  a sickness that is poorly          understood,  calling  for new and innovative research.  Much of this          back  pain  is  attributed  to  mechanical  factors.   Hence,  it is          important   to  understand  the  mechanics  of  the  spine  and  the          mechanical  effects  of  degenerative  changes that may lead to back          pain.              The  spine  is  a  complex  three-dimensional  structure  and  it is          therefore  necessary to study its mechanics with in vitro tests that          replicate   physiological   movements   as   closely   as  possible.          Traditional spinal testing machines have been unable to simulate the          kinematic  behaviour  of  intervertebral joints as they have limited          degrees of freedom and cannot produce dynamic motion.              The  first  aim of this research was to commission a robotic testing          facility   to   overcome  the  limitations  of  traditional  testing          machines.   This facility incorporated a six degree-of-freedom (DOF)          robot  arm  with  a  six  DOF  force  transducer.   Mechanical tests          performed    on   this   facility   could   simulate   the   dynamic          three-dimensional kinematics of the lumbar spine.              In addition, this research aimed to assess the existence of a region          of  laxity  during  spinal joint motion defined as the Neutral Zone,          and  to determine the effect of specific lesions introduced into the          intervertebral disc.  To investigate these aims, in vitro mechanical          tests  on  spinal specimens were performed using the robotic testing          facility.              To  ensure  these  tests  produced  experimental  results  that were          indicative of the mechanics of the spine in life, the intervertebral          disc  height had to be representative of the disc height in life.  A          set  of experiments was performed to determine a method for ensuring          this.   The  post-mortem  disc height change due to a period of time          exposed to a moist environment, freezing, defrosting and application          of  a  constant  compressive load was documented in a group of sheep          spines.   Specimens  that  were frozen immediately upon removal from          the  body  produced  the  most predictable results.  These specimens          required  no  preloading to ensure the disc height during mechanical          testing  was  similar  to  that  in  life.   In accordance with this          result,  specimens  used in the ensuing mechanical tests were frozen          immediately  on  removal  from  the  body  and  stored  frozen until          required for testing.              Tests  performed  on sheep spines with the robotic facility verified          the  existence  of  a Neutral Zone.  A criterion was determined that          defined  the  Neutral  Zone  as  the region of spinal joint rotation          where  the  gradient  of the load/deformation curve is within +/-0.5          dNm/degree  from  zero.   This  definition was used to determine the          extent  of  the  Neutral  Zone  in  spinal  motion  during different          movements.   A  Neutral Zone of approximately four degrees was found          in  intact  spinal  motion  segments during flexion/extension.  Only          spinal  musculature  can  stabilise  the  spine  in  this  region of          rotation.   The  removal  of  the zygapophysial joints increased the          Neutral  Zone  in flexion/extension by approximately two degrees and          caused  the  appearance  of  a  Neutral  Zone  in  axial rotation of          approximately  one degree.  This suggests that during these motions,          the zygapophysial joints are the main passive stabilisers.              The  mechanical effects of intervertebral disc lesions were examined          by  experimentally  introducing  three  types of tears (rim lesions,          radial  tears  and concentric tears) into sheep intervertebral discs          and  comparing  the  mechanical response of the injured joint to the          joint's response prior to the creation of the lesions.  Radial tears          and  concentric  tears had no effect on the maximum moments resisted          by the intervertebral disc or the hysteresis of the joint's response          to  motion.   An  anterior  rim lesion increased the Neutral Zone by          approximately 1.5 degrees and reduced the maximum moment resisted by          the  intervertebral  disc  by  approximately 20% during extension in          L1/L2  specimens.  Rim lesions were also found to reduce the maximum          moment  resisted  by  the intervertebral disc in lateral bending and          axial   rotation  for  all  levels  by  approximately  15%  and  25%          respectively.    Rim  lesions  did  not  affect  the  hysteresis  of          intervertebral disc motion.              In  summary,  this  research commissioned a robotic testing facility          capable  of  simulating the dynamic, three-dimensional kinematics of          the   lumbar   spine   and   provided  a  unique  insight  into  the          three-dimensional  mechanics  of intervertebral joints.  Testing was          performed  on  sheep joints, however the outcomes provide an insight          into  the  mechanical response of the human spine.  The Neutral Zone          was shown to exist but only in flexion/extension.  This implies that          damage  to  the  spinal  muscles  may  produce an unstable structure          during  flexion/extension  within  this  Neutral  Zone.  Rim lesions          reduce the ability of the intervertebral disc to resist all modes of          motion.  This suggests that the presence of rim lesions will produce          overloading  of  other  spinal  elements  and  instigate progressive          degenerative changes.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lumbar spine</field><field name="subject">mechanics</field><field name="subject">neutral zone</field><field name="subject">degeneration</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15781/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and Simulation of GPS Multipath Propagation</field><field name="creator">Hannah, Bruce M.</field><field name="description">Multipath remains a dominant error source in Global Positioning System (GPS) applications that require high accuracy. With the use of differential techniques it is possible to remove many of the common-mode error sources, but the error effects of multipath have proven much more difficult to mitigate. The research aim of this work is to enhance the understanding of multipath propagation and its effects in GPS terrestrial applications, through the modelling of signal propagation behaviour and the resultant error effects. Multipath propagation occurs when environmental features cause combinations of reflected and/or diffracted replica signals to arrive at the receiving antenna. These signals, in combination with the original line-of-sight (LOS) signal, can cause distortion of the receiver correlation function and ultimately the discrimination function and hence errors in range estimation. To date, a completely satisfactory mitigation strategy has yet to be developed. In the search for such a mitigation strategy, it is imperative that a comprehensive understanding of the multipath propagation environment and the resultant error effects exists. The work presented here, provides a comprehensive understanding through the use of new modelling and simulation techniques specific to GPS multipath. This dissertation unites the existing theory of radio frequency propagation for the GPS L1 signal into a coherent treatment of GPS propagation in the terrestrial environment. To further enhance the understanding of the multipath propagation environment and the resultant error effects, this dissertation also describes the design and development of a new parabolic equation (PE) based propagation model for analysis of GPS multipath propagation behaviour. The propagation model improves on previous PE-based models by incorporating terrain features, including boundary impedance properties, backscatter and time-domain decomposition of the field into a multipath impulse response. The results provide visualisation as well as the defining parameters necessary to fully describe the multipath propagation behaviour. These resultant parameters provide the input for a correlation and discrimination model for visualisation and the generation of resultant receiver error measurements. Results for a variety of propagation environments are presented and the technique is shown to provide a deterministic methodology against real GPS data. The unique and novel combined modelling of multipath propagation and reception, presented in this dissertation, provides an effective set of tools that have enhanced the understanding of the behaviour and effect of multipath in GPS applications, and ultimately should aid in providing a solution to the GPS multipath mitigation problem.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="subject">GPS</field><field name="subject">Multipath</field><field name="subject">Radio Frequency</field><field name="subject">RF</field><field name="subject">Propagation</field><field name="subject">Parabolic Equation</field><field name="subject">PE</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Correlation</field><field name="subject">DLL</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">Range Error</field><field name="subject">Mitigation</field><field name="subject">Reflection</field><field name="subject">Diffraction</field><field name="subject">Fresnel Zone</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15782/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Year 3 Students' Place-Value Understanding: Representations and Concepts</field><field name="creator">Price, Peter Stanley</field><field name="description">Understanding base-ten numbers is one of the most important mathematics topics taught in the primary school, and yet also one of the most difficult to teach and to learn. Research shows that many children have inaccurate or faulty number conceptions, and use rote-learned procedures with little regard for quantities represented by mathematical symbols. Base-ten blocks are widely used to teach place-value concepts, but children often do not perceive the links between numbers, symbols, and models. Software has also been suggested as a means of improving children's development of these links but there is little research on its efficacy.  Sixteen Queensland Year 3 students worked cooperatively with the researcher for 10 daily sessions, in 4 groups of 4 students of either high or low mathematical achievement level, on tasks introducing the hundreds place. Two groups used physical base-ten blocks and two used place-value software incorporating electronic base-ten blocks. Individual interviews assessed participants' place-value understanding before and after teaching sessions. Data sources were videotapes of interviews and teaching sessions, field notes, workbooks, and software audit trails, analysed using a grounded theory method.  There was little difference evident in learning by students using either physical or electronic blocks. Many errors related to the "face-value" construct, counting and handling errors, and a lack of knowledge of base-ten rules were evident. Several students trusted the counting of blocks to reveal number relationships. The study failed to confirm several reported schemes describing children's conceptual structures for multidigit numbers. Many participants demonstrated a preference for grouping or counting approaches, but not stable mental models characterising their thinking about numbers generally. The independent-place construct is proposed to explain evidence in both the study and the literature that shows students making single-dimensional associations between a place, a set of number words, and a digit, rather than taking account of groups of 10. Feedback received in the two conditions differed greatly. Electronic feedback was more positive and accurate than feedback from blocks, and reduced the need for human-based feedback. Primary teachers are urged to monitor students' use of base-ten blocks closely, and to challenge faulty number conceptions by asking appropriate questions.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Place value</field><field name="subject">base-ten blocks</field><field name="subject">Year 3</field><field name="subject">mathematical understanding</field><field name="subject">place-value software</field><field name="subject">representations of number</field><field name="subject">conceptions of number</field><field name="subject">electronic base-ten blocks</field><field name="subject">conceptual structures for multidigit numbers</field><field name="subject">feedback</field><field name="subject">misconceptions of number</field><field name="subject">independent-place construct</field><field name="subject">face-value construct</field><field name="subject">mathematics teaching with technology</field><field name="subject">number models</field><field name="subject">Payne-Rathmell model for teaching number topics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15783/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Sociobiological, Psychosocial and Sociocultural Approach to Ethics Education</field><field name="creator">Catchpoole, Valerie Margaret</field><field name="description">Critical and enduring questions for teachers are whose ethics or what ethics they should be teaching in schools and how, given the pluralism of the wider society. The focus of this study is to establish whether it is possible to identify a common, non-relativist basis for what should be taught in Ethics Education and then to consider how such an approach might best be undertaken. This task involves finding some basis for ethics that we all have reason to accept and requires an understanding of the nature of moral development and learning. An interdisciplinary approach has been undertaken to investigate whether it is possible to find a common basis for ethics and to determine what constitutes the nature of moral development and learning. In the first instance, this interdisciplinary approach has been used to investigate whether there is justification for believing that as human beings we share certain characteristics and patterns of behaviour, or a common humanity, the features of which might suggest a common basis for ethics that we all have reason to accept. This investigation examines empirical findings and theoretical conclusions relating to the sociobiological, psychosocial and sociocultural dimensions of human beings to support the notion that we share a common humanity which is characterised by a number of features. These features include the deeply reciprocal nature of our relationships with one another and the sociocultural nature of our moral learnings. Moreover, we are a highly interdependent social species whose survival and well-being are dependent not only on cooperation with one another but also with sustaining a satisfactory ecological balance with other forms of life within dynamic, natural systems. This interdependence suggests that the norm of having care for one another and our world is one that we all have reason to accept. This norm, in turn, suggests a telos, or set of goals for ethics, that involve the creation of a just and caring society. However, in order to realise such a telos for ethics it is necessary to provide some specific theoretical and practical guidelines related to deciding what constitutes the nature and scope of care within specific contexts. Accordingly, the study undertakes a brief review of contemporary approaches to ethics to evaluate the extent to which these provide a means for realising the ethical form of life based in the norm of having care for one another and our world. This review suggests that feminist theories of care provide the most promising basis for delineating what it is to care for one another and our world. However, it is also acknowledged that there are a number of limitations with existing theories of care. This study, therefore, undertakes a conceptual analysis of the nature and scope of care and outlines an extended ethic of care. This theorising recognises that care for others is characterised by the dimensions of responsiveness, the exercise of responsible action and is refined and amended by critical reflection. It is acknowledged that justice is intrinsic to the nature of care as is the exercise of a range of virtues. The scope of our caring responsibilities is seen to extend to all others in the global community, as well as all other species, while also requiring care for self, and care for particular others for whom we may have special familial or work-related responsibilities. The evaluation of what constitutes caring practice is also discussed and it is acknowledged that caring practices must meet minimum requirements in terms of respect for basic human rights and should contribute to the welfare and well-being of the recipients of care. This specification of the nature and scope of care, in conjunction with a consideration of the nature of moral learning and development, provides a basis from which to develop a philosophical foundation as well as a set of aims and objectives for Ethics Education. It is acknowledged that students need to develop a wide range of cognitive, emotional and social competencies in order to understand what it means to care for self and others within specific socio-cultural contexts and also to develop the sense of empathetic connection and affiliation to others that translates moral decisions into responsible moral action. It is hoped that the study provides the basis for beginning a dialogue in schools that involves students, teachers, families and members of the wider community about what it means to live the ethical form of life and how education itself might promote broadly such a form of life.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethics education</field><field name="subject">moral education</field><field name="subject">sociobiological</field><field name="subject">psychosocial</field><field name="subject">sociocultural factors</field><field name="subject">moral development</field><field name="subject">cognitive aspects</field><field name="subject">emotional aspects</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">moral learning</field><field name="subject">cognitive competencies</field><field name="subject">emotional competencies</field><field name="subject">social competencies</field><field name="subject">an ethic of care</field><field name="subject">an extended ethic of care</field><field name="subject">epistemological aspects</field><field name="subject">a common humanity</field><field name="subject">adaptive moral process</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15784/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Culture: the translation and transfer of Australianness in contemporary fiction</field><field name="creator">Cain, Lara Anne</field><field name="description">The dual usage of &amp;171;reading&amp;171; in the title evokes the nature of this study. This thesis will analyse the ways in which people &amp;171;reading&amp;171; (make sense of/produce) images of culture as they approach translated novels. Part of this analysis is the examination of what informs the &amp;171;reading culture&amp;171; of a given community; that is, the conditions in which readers and texts exist, or the ways in which readers are able to access texts. Understanding of the depictions of culture found in a novel is influenced by publicity and promotion, educational institutions, book stores, funding bodies and other links between the reading public and the production and sale of books. All of these parties act as &amp;171;translators&amp;171; of the text, making it available and comprehensible to readers. This thesis will make use of a set of contemporary Australian novels, each of which makes extensive use of Australianness and Australianisms throughout its narrative. The movement of these texts from their cultures of origin towards wider Australia, the United Kingdom and France will provide the major case studies. The thesis will assert that no text is accessed without some form of translation and that the reading positions established by translators are a powerful influence on the interpretations arrived at by readers. More than ever, in the contemporary reading environment, the influence of the press and other &amp;171;translators&amp;171; is significant to the ways in which texts are read, and to perceptions held by readers of the culture from which a novel originates.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">translation</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">belonging</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">publishing</field><field name="subject">myth</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">United Kingdom.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15785/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetic behaviour of ion intercalation electrodes at elevated temperatures</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Jeremy P.</field><field name="description">Electrochromic films undergo a colour change when small ions and electrons are inserted into them, under the influence of an applied electric field.  These films are also known as ion-intercalation electrodes, and may be incorporated into glazing structures more commonly known as 'smart windows'.  Smart windows are that which may be used to control the amount of heat and light entering a building and may therefore be used to minimise the energy consumption associated with heating, cooling and lighting.  The commercial success of smart windows, requires that they operate reproducibly at temperatures up to approximately 70&#186;C, for many tens of thousands of colouring and bleaching cycles.  An understanding of the underlying kinetic processes over a wide temperature range is therefore needed, in order to determine suitable control strategies and switching conditions capable of fulfilling these requirements.  The research detailed in this thesis has involved an investigation into the kinetic behaviour of ion-intercalation electrodes, and simulation of the electrical response as a means of developing a tool for predicting and then optimising electrochromic switching.  More specifically, the electrical and optical properties of electrochromic thin films of WO3/TiO2 have been studied over a wide temperature range, appropriate for the operation of electrochromic windows.  The magnitude of the voltages required for coloration and bleaching significantly reduces as temperature increases.  Some irreversibility was observed at high temperature, as well as a reduction in coloration efficiency.  Further investigation revealed that self-bleaching and irreversibility effects were caused by the presence of water, and this problem was exacerbated at high temperature.  Post-experiment chemical analysis of a film sample revealed that some trapping of the inserted ions had occurred, however the amount of ions remaining in the film was much smaller than expected.  The results suggested that a large quantity of the lithium ions injected into the film were lost to the electrolyte after many cycles, possibly accompanied by some film dissolution.  Experimental work carried out in a dry-box showed that films may be cycled reversibly in a very dry environment, and the optical properties were independent of temperature under these conditions.  Unfortunately, the conditions which led to reversible cycling and good electrochromic memory, also resulted in very long response times for film bleaching.  This result implies that a good electrochromic memory and a fast response are mutually competitive aims.  Data from high temperature experiments was simulated with a mathematical model and the mobility of lithium ions inside the electrochromic films was estimated in the process.  The estimated diffusion coefficients agreed well with published values, and exhibited an Arrhenius dependence on temperature.  Activation energies for diffusion were calculated and the results were very reasonable.  Some deviation from ideal Arrhenius behaviour was observed for the estimated diffusion coefficients at high temperature.  It is likely that the rate limiting mechanism changes from diffusive motion of ions at low temperature, to charge transfer at high temperature.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrochromic thin films</field><field name="subject">temperature effects</field><field name="subject">reversibility</field><field name="subject">kinetic behaviour</field><field name="subject">self-bleaching</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15786/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconciling a Policy of Neutrality with the Prospect of Integration : Ireland, the European Economic Community, and Ireland's United Nations Policy, 1965-1972</field><field name="creator">Spelman, Greg Thomas</field><field name="description">The decade of the 1960s was a period of significant evolution in the foreign policy priorities of the Republic of Ireland.  On 31 July 1961, Ireland applied for membership of the European Community.  That application was vetoed in January 1963 by the French President, Charles de Gaulle.  Nevertheless, it was an indication of the growing "Europeanisation" of Irish foreign policy, which was secured in May 1967 in a renewed and ultimately successful application by Ireland for membership of the Common Market.  Because of the overlapping interests of the European Community and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), however, these initiatives towards integration with Western Europe posed a dilemma for the decision-makers in Dublin given that, in the Irish context, foreign policy was predicated on neutrality.  Since Ireland's admission to the United Nations (UN) in 1955 and especially from the reinstatement of Frank Aiken as Minister for External Affairs in 1957, the diplomatic component of Ireland's neutrality was defined largely by its UN policy.  Ireland's continued attachment to neutrality, despite its application for European Community membership, caused significant frustration to the governments of the member-states, especially France under de Gaulle, and was seen to be an obstacle to Ireland's accession.  These concerns were communicated explicitly to Dublin, along with the view that Ireland needed to demonstrate a greater propensity to support Western interests on major international issues.  Pressure of this kind had dissuaded other European neutrals (Austria, Finland, Malta and Sweden) from pursuing membership of the European Community until 1995 - after the Cold War had ended - but it did not deter the Irish.  Despite the pressure from the European Community, Irish policy continued to be characterised by neutrality and, almost invariably, conflict with French UN policy.  This included, amongst other matters, policy in relation to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the financing of peacekeeping, the Vietnam War, representation of China at the UN, and various decolonization problems in Southern Africa.  This insulation of Ireland's foreign policy from the imperatives of the application for membership of the European Community was largely the product of the fragmentation of decision-making in the formulation of Irish diplomacy.  This research project takes a unique perspective on the topic by focusing, in particular, on the period 1965 to 1972 and, also, breaks further new ground in utilizing documentary material only recently released by the National Archives in Dublin, the University College Dublin Archives, the Public Record Office, London, and the UN Archives in New York, along with published diplomatic records and secondary sources.  Consequently, it offers an original contribution to our understanding of Irish foreign policy in this crucial period of its development and the capacity of the Irish Government to reconcile the two fundamental and apparently conflicting pillars of its foreign policy - neutrality and membership of the European Community.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ireland</field><field name="subject">European Community</field><field name="subject">United Nations</field><field name="subject">Neutrality</field><field name="subject">Integration</field><field name="subject">Diplomatic History</field><field name="subject">International Relations</field><field name="subject">Foreign Policy</field><field name="subject">Disarmament</field><field name="subject">Non-Proliferation</field><field name="subject">Cold War</field><field name="subject">Decolonisation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15787/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Automated Rule Refinement System</field><field name="creator">Andrews, Robert</field><field name="description">Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are essentially a 'black box' technology. The lack of an explanation component prevents the full and complete exploitation of this form of machine learning.    During the mid 1990's the field of 'rule extraction' emerged. Rule extraction techniques attempt to derive a human comprehensible explanation structure from a trained ANN. Andrews et.al. (1995) proposed the following reasons for extending the ANN paradigm to include a rule extraction facility:    * provision of a user explanation capability  * extension of the ANN paradigm to 'safety critical' problem domains  * software verification and debugging of ANN components in software systems  * improving the generalization of ANN solutions  * data exploration and induction of scientific theories  * knowledge acquisition for symbolic AI systems    An allied area of research is that of 'rule refinement'. In rule refinement an initial rule base, (i.e. what may be termed `prior knowledge') is inserted into an ANN by prestructuring some or all of the network architecture, weights, activation functions, learning rates, etc. The rule refinement process then proceeds in the same way as normal rule extraction viz (1) train the network on the available data set(s); and (2) extract the `refined' rules.    Very few ANN techniques have the capability to act as a true rule refinement system. Existing techniques, such as KBANN, (Towell &amp; Shavlik, (1993), are limited in that the rule base used to initialize the network must be a nearly complete, and the refinement process is limited to modifying antecedents.    The limitations of existing techniques severely limit their applicability to real world problem domains. Ideally, a rule refinement technique should be able to deal with  incomplete initial rule bases, modify antecedents, remove inaccurate rules, and add new knowledge by generating new rules. The motivation for this research project was to develop such a rule refinement system and to investigate its efficacy when applied to both nearly complete and incomplete problem domains.    The premise behind rule refinement is that the refined rules better represent the actual domain theory than the initial domain theory used to initialize the network. The hypotheses tested in this research include:    * that the utilization of prior domain knowledge will speed up network training,  * produce smaller trained networks,  * produce more accurate trained networks, and  * bias the learning phase towards a solution that 'makes sense' in the problem domain.    In 1998 Geva, Malmstrom, &amp; Sitte, (1998) described the Local Cluster (LC) Neural Net. Geva et.al. (1998) showed that the LC network was able to learn / approximate complex functions to a high degree of accuracy. The hidden layer of the LC network is comprised of basis functions, (the local cluster units), that are composed of sigmoid based 'ridge' functions. In the General form of the LC network the ridge functions can be oriented in any direction.    We describe RULEX, a technique designed to provide an explanation component for its underlying Local Cluster ANN through the extraction of symbolic rules from the weights of the local cluster units of the trained ANN.    RULEX exploits a feature, ie, axis parallel ridge functions, of the Restricted Local Cluster (Geva , Andrews &amp; Geva 2002), that allow hyper-rectangular rules of the form    IF &#8704; 1 &#8804; i &#8804; n : xi &#8712; [ xi lower , xi upper ]  THEN pattern belongs to the target class      to be easily extracted from local functions that comprise the hidden layer of the LC network.    RULEX is tested on 14 applications available in the public domain. RULEX results are compared with a leading machine learning technique, See5, with RULEX generally performing as well as See5 and in some cases outperforming See5 in predictive accuracy.    We describe RULEIN, a rule refinement technique that allows symbolic rules to be converted into the parameters that define local cluster functions. RULEIN allows existing domain knowledge to be captured in the architecture of a LC ANN thus facilitating the first phase of the rule refinement paradigm.    RULEIN is tested on a variety of artificial and real world problems. Experimental results indicate that RULEIN is able to satisfy the first requirement of a rule refinement technique by correctly translating a set of symbolic rules into a LC ANN that has the same predictive bahaviour as the set of rules from which it was constructed.    Experimental results also show that in the cases where a strong domain theory exists, initializing an LC network using RULEIN generally speeds up network training, produces smaller, more accurate trained networks, with the trained network properly representing the underlying domain theory. In cases where a weak domain theory exists the same results are not always apparent.    Experiments with the RULEIN / LC / RULEX rule refinement method show that the method is able to remove inaccurate rules from the initial knowledge base, modify rules in the initial knowledge base that are only partially correct, and learn new rules not present in the initial knowledge base.    The combination of RULEIN / LC / RULEX thus is shown to be an effective rule refinement technique for use with a Restricted Local Cluster network.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">ANNs</field><field name="subject">rule extraction</field><field name="subject">rule refinement</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15788/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Belief Revision for Adaptive Information Agents</field><field name="creator">Lau, Raymond Yiu Keung</field><field name="description">As the richness and diversity of information available to us in our everyday lives has expanded, so the need to manage this information grows. The lack of effective information management tools has given rise to what is colloquially known as the information overload problem. Intelligent agent technologies have been explored to develop personalised tools for autonomous information retrieval (IR). However, these so-called adaptive information agents are still primitive in terms of their learning autonomy, inference power, and explanatory capabilities. For instance, users often need to provide large amounts of direct relevance feedback to train the agents before these agents can acquire the users' specific information requirements. Existing information agents are also weak in dealing with the serendipity issue in IR because they cannot infer document relevance with respect to the possibly related IR contexts.    This thesis exploits the theories and technologies from the fields of Information Retrieval (IR), Symbolic Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Agents for the development of the next generation of adaptive information agents to alleviate the problem of information overload. In particular, the fundamental issues such as representation, learning, and classjfication (e.g., classifying documents as relevant or not) pertaining to these agents are examined. The design of the adaptive information agent model stems from a basic intuition in IR. By way of illustration, given the retrieval context involving a science student, and a query "Java", what information items should an intelligent information agent recommend to its user? The agent should recommend documents about "Computer Programming" if it believes that its user is a computer science student and every computer science student needs to learn programming. However, if the agent later discovers that its user is studying "volcanology", and the agent also believes that volcanists are interested in the volcanos in Java, the agent may recommend documents about "Merapi" (a volcano in Java with a recent eruption in 1994). This scenario illustrates that a retrieval context is not only about a set of terms and their frequencies but also the relationships among terms (e.g., java &#923; science &#8594; computer, computer &#8594; programming, java &#923; science &#923; volcanology &#8594; merapi, etc.) In addition, retrieval contexts represented in information agents should be revised in accordance with the changing information requirements of the users. Therefore, to enhance the adaptive and proactive IR behaviour of information agents, an expressive representation language is needed to represent complex retrieval contexts and an effective learning mechanism is required to revise the agents' beliefs about the changing retrieval contexts. Moreover, a sound reasoning mechanism is essential for information agents to infer document relevance with respect to some retrieval contexts to enhance their proactiveness and learning autonomy.    The theory of belief revision advocated by Alchourr&#243;n, G&#228;rdenfors, and Makinson (AGM) provides a rigorous formal foundation to model evolving retrieval contexts in terms of changing epistemic states in adaptive information agents. The expressive power of the AGM framework allows sufficient details of retrieval contexts to be captured. Moreover, the AGM framework enforces the principles of minimal and consistent belief changes. These principles coincide with the requirements of modelling changing information retrieval contexts. The AGM belief revision logic has a close connection with the Logical Uncertainty Principle which describes the fundamental approach for logic-based IR models. Accordingly, the AGM belief functions are applied to develop the learning components of adaptive information agents. Expectationinference which is characterised by axioms leading to conservatively monotonic IR behaviour plays a significant role in developing the agents' classification components.  Because of the direct connection between the AGM belief functions and the expectation inference relations, seamless integration of the information agents' learning and classification components is made possible. Essentially, the learning functions and the classification functions of adaptive information agents are conceptualised by and q d respectively. This conceptualisation can be interpreted as: (1) learning is the process of revising the representation K of a retrieval context with respect to a user's relevance feedback q which can be seen as a refined query; (2) classification is the process of determining the degree of relevance of a document d with respect to the refined query q given the agent's expectation (i.e., beliefs) K about the retrieval context.    At the computational level, how to induce epistemic entrenchment which defines the AGM belief functions, and how to implement the AGM belief functions by means of an effective and efficient computational algorithm are among the core research issues addressed. Automated methods of discovering context sensitive term associations such as (computer &#8594; programming) and preclusion relations such as (volcanology  &#8260;&#8594; programming) are explored. In addition, an effective classification method which is underpinned by expectation inference is developed for adaptive information agents. Last but not least, quantitative evaluations, which are based on well-known IR bench-marking processes, are applied to examine the performance of the prototype agent system. The performance of the belief revision based information agent system is compared with that of a vector space based agent system and other adaptive information filtering systems participated in TREC-7. As a whole, encouraging results are obtained from our initial experiments.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adaptive Information Agents</field><field name="subject">Information Retrieval</field><field name="subject">Information Filtering</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15789/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance, metabolic and hormonal alterations during overreaching</field><field name="creator">Halson, Shona L.</field><field name="description">Many athletes incorporate high training volumes and limited recovery periods into their training regimes. This may disrupt the fragile balance and the accumulation of exercise stress may exceed an athlete's finite capacity of resistance.

This is commonly known as overreaching and if increased training and limited recovery is continued, it is believed that the more serious state of overtraining may develop. This is relatively commonly experienced in athletes, however little scientific investigation has been conducted to determine the characteristics and underlying mechanisms. The overall aim of this thesis was to gain a greater understanding of the state of overreaching and to specifically provide new information on potential markers of this state as well as possible mechanisms. To study the cumulative effects of exercise stress and subsequent recovery on performance changes, fatigue indicators and possible mechanisms, the training of endurance cyclists was systematically controlled and monitored in two separate investigations. A number of variables were assessed including performance, physiological, biochemical, psychological, immunological and hormonal variables. In addition heart rate variability and serotonergic responsiveness were also assessed. Some of the more pertinent effects of overreaching included an increase in heart rate variability, a reduction in carbohydrate oxidation, an increase in serotonergic responsiveness and a reduction in stress hormone concentrations. These results suggest that autonomic imbalance in combination with decreased hormonal release appears to be related to the decline in performance and elevated fatigue apparent in overreached athletes. Additionally it also appears that alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis may occur in overreached athletes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buspirone challenge test</field><field name="subject">Carbohydrate supplementation</field><field name="subject">Central fatigue hypothesis</field><field name="subject">Cortisol</field><field name="subject">Cycling performance</field><field name="subject">Cytokine hypothesis</field><field name="subject">Glutamate</field><field name="subject">Glutamine</field><field name="subject">Glycogen</field><field name="subject">depletion</field><field name="subject">Growth hormone</field><field name="subject">Heart rate variability</field><field name="subject">Immune function</field><field name="subject">Intensified training</field><field name="subject">Mood state</field><field name="subject">Overreaching</field><field name="subject">Overtraining</field><field name="subject">Power output</field><field name="subject">Prolactin</field><field name="subject">Time course</field><field name="subject">Time</field><field name="subject">domain analysis</field><field name="subject">Time trial</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15790/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's Only Rock 'n' Roll But I Like It : A history of the early days of rock 'n' roll in Brisbane... as told by some of the people who were there</field><field name="creator">Walden, Geoffrey Alan</field><field name="description">The music history that is generally presented to students in Queensland secondary schools as the history of music is underpinned by traditions associated with the social and cultural elite of colonialist Europe. On the other hand, contemporary popular music is the style with which most in this community identify and its mass consumption by teenagers in Brisbane was heralded with the arrival of rock 'n' roll in the mid-1950s.    This project proposes that the involvement of the music education system in, and the application of digital technology to, the collection and storage of musical memories and memorabilia with historical potential is an important first step on the journey to a music history that is built on the democratic principles of twenty-first century, culturally and socially diverse Australia rather than on the autocratic principles of colonialist Europe. In taking a first step, this project focused on collecting memories and memorabilia from people who were involved in an aspect of the coming of rock 'n' roll to Brisbane. Memories were collected in the form of recorded conversations and these recordings, along with other audio and visual material were transferred to digital format for distribution.    As an oral history focusing its attention on those who were involved with the coming of rock 'n' roll to Brisbane in the mid to late 1950s and the early 1960s, this project is intended as a starting point for that journey. Even as a starting point however, some interesting findings emerged. For example:    * Early Brisbane rock 'n' roll was a suburban affair.  * Dancers were just as important in bringing rock 'n' roll to Brisbane as were the musicians.  * Musicians not only had to learn new music on new instruments, they had to, in many cases, make their own instruments.  * The rock 'n' roll story as promoted by the newspapers of the day was very different to how it is remembered by the participants.  * Community institutions such as family, school and church played a vital support role in the lives of young rock 'n' roll musicians.  * Brisbane's rock 'n' roll musicians generally reflected the conservative nature of their community.  * Brisbane's very early rock 'n' roll musicians were strongly influenced by country and western music.  * Once the commercial viability of rock 'n' roll became evident, it became more accepted as an entertainment format.    Of the many thousands of people who lived in Brisbane during the 1950s and who had an interest in or were affected by the coming of rock 'n' roll, only a very small percentage were involved in this project. This would indicate that there is a significant body of untold memories and stories waiting to respond to the interest of Queensland music students.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brisbane</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">rock 'n' roll</field><field name="subject">oral history</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15791/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination of the Efficacy of  Specific Nursing Interventions to the Management of Pain in Cancer Patients</field><field name="creator">Costello, Verona</field><field name="description">Aim of the Study  The aim of this study was to determine if the nursing interventions of patient education and multidisciplinary coordination of care were able to improve pain control in the cancer patient in an acute hospital setting.    Background of the Study    The role of the nurse in cancer pain management has been defined as being that of an educator, coordinator of care and advocate. A nurse with adequate knowledge of pain and its application to the cancer population and functioning in the role as defined is believed to be able to overcome many of the barriers that exist in implementing adequate analgesia and improve pain management in cancer patients.    Design of the Study    A randomized experimental control group design was utilized. The study comprised 3 experimental groups and one control group incorporating pre and post testing.    The Intervention of the Study    Experimental group one: subjects received education regarding their pain management which was tailored to meet their specific needs.  Experimental group two: subjects underwent a pain assessment and construction of a care plan which was communicated verbally to the treating medical and nursing team and followed up with a written report which was documented in the history and sent to the treating medical physician.  Experimental group three: subjects received the combined interventions administered to groups one and two.  Control group four: subjects were assessed and all information was record in the same manner as for the experimental groups. The control group received their usual care during the study and their pain scores were measured at the same time intervals as the three experimental groups.    Instrumentation    The Wisconsin Brief Pain Questionnaire was used for the assessment of all subjects.  The McGill Pain Questionnaire was used as the outcome measure following intervention.    Data Analysis    A one-way analysis of variance was used to detect the differences between the intervention groups and the control group. T-Tests were used to detect the differences between the groups incorporating a Bonferroni adjustment for frequent T tests.    Results    The main effect demonstrated a significant difference between the treatment groups and control at a significance level of 0.002.  T-Tests showed no significant difference between control and communication groups and no significant difference between education and combined groups. A significant difference was detected between education and control and between combined and control.    Conclusions    Nursing interventions of patient education, coordination of care and advocacy can significantly improve cancer pain management. Intervention was tailored to meet the specific patient needs based on findings from the assessment and was dependent upon an adequate knowledge base. The nursing intervention of education was the most powerful of the three intervention types and its success was in tailoring to each individual. However, it is believed that with further recognition of the role of the nurse as coordinator of care will lead to greater improvements in cancer pain management.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing intervention</field><field name="subject">patient education</field><field name="subject">cancer pain management</field><field name="subject">Wisconsin Brief Pain Questionnaire</field><field name="subject">McGill Pain Questionnaire</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15792/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dromoecology: ecological meaning in the age of hypercapitalism</field><field name="creator">Pace, John</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the mediation of ecological values, showing that we come to understand, interact, and value the ecologies in which we are bound, through experience of commodified and technologised abstractions of ecological life.

A consistent theory of a new type of Bragg scattering of bulk and guided optical modes in thick uniform and non-uniform, dissipative and non-dissipative, slanted periodic gratings has been developed. This type of scattering is
 
 called extremely asymmetrical scattering (EAS).
 
 One of the main distinctive features of EAS is the strong resonant increase of the scattered wave amplitude compared to the amplitude of the incident wave. Several unique combinations of strong resonances shaping a complex multi-resonant pattern of EAS in different types of gratings have been predicted and investigated theoretically and numerically. This includes the prediction of a new resonant wave effect in non-uniform gratings with varying phase &#8211; double-resonant EAS, the discovery of several sharp and strong resonances with respect to scattering angle in gratings with the scattered wave
 
 propagating almost parallel to the grating boundaries (grazing-angle scattering (GAS)) for the case of second-order scattering, and the prediction of a new type of eigenmode in gratings with second-order scattering (especially in gratings with large amplitude). In addition, several other important practical problems that may be crucial for the experimental observation and application of EAS and GAS have been solved. These are the determination of the tolerance of EAS to small grating imperfections, e.g., fluctuations of the grating amplitude, prediction
 
 of unusually high sensitivity of second-order EAS to small variations of mean structural parameters, determination of the effect of weak dissipation on EAS, etc. Physical reasons for the predicted resonances and effects are explained. In particular, the crucial role of the diffractional divergence for EAS and GAS has been revealed, especially for non-uniform gratings.
 
 Methods of analysis involve the approximate and rigorous approaches. The approximate method is based on understanding the role of the diffractional divergence in the geometry of EAS and the two-wave approximation (valid for any types of waves). The rigorous approach is based on the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) and, in particular, the known enhanced T-matrix
 
 algorithm (by Moharam, et al.) that is numerically stable for narrow and wide gratings with arbitrary amplitude (valid only for bulk electromagnetic waves).</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bragg scattering</field><field name="subject">coupled-wave analysis</field><field name="subject">diffraction</field><field name="subject">diffractional divergence</field><field name="subject">diffraction grating</field><field name="subject">diffractive optics</field><field name="subject">electromagnetic waves</field><field name="subject">extremely asymmetrical scattering</field><field name="subject">Fourier analysis</field><field name="subject">grating</field><field name="subject">grazing-angle scattering</field><field name="subject">guided waves</field><field name="subject">guided modes</field><field name="subject">non-uniform periodic gratings</field><field name="subject">optics</field><field name="subject">physical optics</field><field name="subject">periodic array</field><field name="subject">physics</field><field name="subject">rigorous coupled-wave analysis</field><field name="subject">scattering</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15794/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EEG Data acquisition and automatic seizure detection  using wavelet transforms in the newborn EEG.</field><field name="creator">Zarjam, Pega</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the problem of newborn seizre detection from the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The ultimate goal is to design an automated seizure detection system to assist the medical personnel in timely seizure detection. Seizure detection is vital as neurological diseases or dysfunctions in newborn infants are often first manifested by seizure and prolonged seizures can result in impaired neuro-development or even fatality.    The EEG has proved superior to clinical examination of newborns in early detection and prognostication of brain dysfunctions. However, long-term newborn EEG signals acquisition is considerably more difficult than that of adults and children. This is because, the number of the electrodes attached to the skin is limited by the size of the head, the newborns EEGs vary from day to day, and the newborns are reluctant of being in the recording situation. Also, the movement of the newborn can create artifact in the recording and as a result strongly affect the electrical seizure recognition.    Most of the existing methods for neonates are either time or frequency based, and, therefore, do not consider the non-stationarity nature of the EEG signal. Thus, notwithstanding the plethora of existing methods, this thesis applies the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to account for the non-stationarity of the EEG signals. First, two methods for seizure detection in neonates are proposed. The detection schemes are based on observing the changing behaviour of a number of statistical quantities of the wavelet coefficients (WC) of the EEG signal at different scales. In the first method, the variance and mean of the WC are considered as a feature set to dassify the EEG data into seizure and non-seizure. The test results give an average seizure detection rate (SDR) of 97.4%. In the second method, the number of zero-crossings, and the average distance between adjacent extrema of the WC of certain scales are extracted to form a feature set. The test obtains an average SDR of 95.2%. The proposed feature sets are both simple to implement, have high detection rate and low false alarm rate.    Then, in order to reduce the complexity of the proposed schemes, two optimising methods are used to reduce the number of selected features. First, the mutual information feature selection (MIFS) algorithm is applied to select the optimum feature subset. The results show that an optimal subset of 9 features, provides SDR of 94%. Compared to that of the full feature set, it is clear that the optimal feature set can significantly reduce the system complexity. The drawback of the MIFS algorithm is that it ignores the interaction between features.    To overcome this drawback, an alternative algorithm, the mutual information evaluation function (MIEF) is then used. The MIEF evaluates a set of candidate features extracted from the WC to select an informative feature subset. This function is based on the measurement of the information gain and takes into consideration the interaction between features. The performance of the proposed features is evaluated and compared to that of the features obtained using the MIFS algorithm. The MIEF algorithm selected the optimal 10 features resulting an average SDR of 96.3%. It is also shown, an average SDR of 93.5% can be obtained with only 4 features when the MIEF algorithm is used.    In comparison with results of the first two methods, it is shown that the optimal feature subsets improve the system performance and significantly reduce the system complexity for implementation purpose.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">seizure</field><field name="subject">newborn</field><field name="subject">detection</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">frequency</field><field name="subject">scale</field><field name="subject">signals</field><field name="subject">automatic</field><field name="subject">discrete</field><field name="subject">wavelet</field><field name="subject">seizure detection rate</field><field name="subject">false alarm rate</field><field name="subject">non-seizure detection rate</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">mutual information</field><field name="subject">mutual information evaluation function</field><field name="subject">mutual information feature selection</field><field name="subject">decomposition</field><field name="subject">level</field><field name="subject">wavelet coefficients</field><field name="subject">detail components</field><field name="subject">approximate components</field><field name="subject">classifier</field><field name="subject">feature extraction</field><field name="subject">Daubechies</field><field name="subject">artificial neural network</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15795/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic Modelling of Random Variables with an Application in Financial Risk Management.</field><field name="creator">Moldovan, Max</field><field name="description">The problem of determining whether or not a theoretical model is an accurate representation of an empirically observed phenomenon is one of the most challenging in the empirical scientific investigation.

Isadora Duncan, the founder of modern dance, was an intensely creative, free-spirited woman. Her life experiences early last century were as fascinating and tragic as her achievements.
 
 
 
 In New York in 1985, Isadora's last surviving pupil and adopted daughter, ninety-year old Anna Duncan, is searching for a way to fulfill a long held promise. Isadora wished to control the way she was remembered and had made Anna promise that any remaining film of her dancing would be destroyed. But one film survives and Anna is running out of time to find it. 
 
 
 
 A young Australian journalist, Tamsin Doyle, attends a dance class at the Isadora Duncan Studio and meets Anna, unknowingly becoming part of the quest. 
 
 
 
	Initially the stories of Isadora and Tamsin run parallel, then as Tamsin gets to know Anna, she becomes immersed in a dream world of dramatic incidents from Isadora's life. The dreams become waking experiences and she fears her will is gradually being taken over. She ends up in places - in fact other countries - that she had no intention of being, pursuing an agenda that is not her own. 
 
 
 
	In the second part of the book, she finds herself in Russia, where Isadora lived after the Revolution. She meets and falls in love with Vladimir, the grandson of Isadora's former dance collaborator. Unable to prevent herself being possessed while visiting the school Isadora founded, Tamsin is arrested by the authorities. A Russian KGB officer has his own plans and abducts her, keeping her prisoner in a dacha outside Moscow. He shows her a film of herself dancing and then the surviving film of Isadora. The two are almost identical and a dramatic climax ensues.

Additionally, QUT has integrated information technology planning and management with physical infrastructure planning and management via the Asset Management Plan. To complete the approach, QUT has instigated a top-level governance committee for IT to ensure alignment with organisational goals and strategies. This is an unusual development for IT planning and management at an Australian university and attracted attention from the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) as well as other universities in the Australian tertiary education sector and led to the research study.    This research studies the redevelopment of the information technology planning and management approach. The survey research determines the level of integration of IT and university planning, and the correlation of this integration to effectiveness of IT planning. The case study documents the changes, highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the new approach and provides a model for change in IT management at other Australian universities.    It is evident from current literature on information technology management and strategic planning that these developments are validated as steps toward achieving best practice in information technology planning and management. Through rigorous conduct of interviews, observations and review of documentation and through application of a survey questionnaire to a defined population, the research reviews the developments and ongoing implementation of the planning and management infrastructure. Among the outcomes from the new approach are better alignment of information technology investment with QUT goals and objectives, better benefits realisation from information technology investment, better project management of information technology development and innovation, and increased flexibility and accountability in information technology expenditure.    Finally, a comparison to other information technology planning and management methods in place at Australian universities demonstrates the uniqueness of the QUT approach. The thesis reports the benefits and difficulties associated with this approach, and provides a context for future development of IT planning, management and governance at QUT.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asset management</field><field name="subject">Asset planning</field><field name="subject">Benefits realisation</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Information technology governance</field><field name="subject">Information technology infrastructure</field><field name="subject">Information technology management</field><field name="subject">Information technology planning</field><field name="subject">Information technology project management</field><field name="subject">Integration</field><field name="subject">Physical infrastructure</field><field name="subject">Queensland University of Technology</field><field name="subject">QUT</field><field name="subject">Return on investment</field><field name="subject">Strategic alignment</field><field name="subject">Strategic governance</field><field name="subject">Strategic management</field><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15798/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perception of the Experience of Domestic Violence By Women with a Physical Disability</field><field name="creator">Mays, Jenny</field><field name="description">The disability movement drew attention to the struggle against the oppression of people of disability. The rise of disability activism contributed to increased awareness of the need for a social theory of disability, in order to account for the historical, social and economic basis of oppression. Emerging studies of disability issues by disability theorists, such as Sobsey (1994), highlighted the higher prevalence and nature of violence against people with a disability, in comparison to the general population. However, the limited research concerning women with a physical impairment experiencing domestic violence contributes to this social problem being underestimated in the community. Contemporary theoretical conceptualisations of both domestic violence and disability fail to explain the causal framework that leads to women who have a disability experiencing violent situations. Similarly, by explaining domestic violence as a solely socially constructed gender inequality and power differential, feminism provides insufficient recognition of the structural dimension of disability.    As a preliminary inquiry, this study draws on the premises of historical materialism, and feminism to explain disability and investigates disabilism as a means to examine the experience of domestic violence by women with a physical impairment. The research design incorporated the use of qualitative methods for data collection and encapsulated critical social science and interpretivist epistemology. This study provided the basis for generating an understanding of the nature of domestic violence against women with a physical impairment within this sample group. From this investigation, causal hypotheses can be advanced for subsequent extended research. This study revealed that disabilism together with the interacting structural dimensions of disability, gender and class operated to marginalise and alienate these women with a physical impairment in a violent relationship. This tended to reinforce and entrench violence against women with a physical impairment. The study provides insight into the way social conditions and disabilism interrelate to maintain this group of women with an impairment in a violent relationship and contribute to the experience of poverty and lower social status upon leaving the relationship.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">domestic violence</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">disability activism</field><field name="subject">Sobsey</field><field name="subject">marxism</field><field name="subject">historical materialism</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15799/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of arcing faults on distribution lines for protection and monitoring</field><field name="creator">van Rensburg, Karel Jensen</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an investigation into the influences of arcing and conductor deflection due to magnetic forces on the accuracy of fault locator algorithms in electrical distribution networks. The work also explores the possibilities of using the properties of an arc to identify two specific types of faults that may occur on an overhead distribution line.  A new technique using the convolution operator is introduced for deriving differential equation algorithms. The first algorithm was derived by estimating the voltage as an array of impulse functions while the second algorithm was derived  using a piecewise linear voltage signal. These algorithms were tested on a simulated single-phase circuit using a PI-model line. It was shown that the second algorithm gave identical results as the existing dynamic integration operator type algorithm.    The first algorithm used a transformation to a three-phase circuit that did not require  any matrix calculations as an equivalent sequence component circuit is utilised for a single-phase to ground fault. A simulated arc was used to test the influence of the non-linearity of an arc on the accuracy of this algorithm. The simulations showed that the variation in the resistance due to arcing causes large oscillations of the  algorithm output and a 40th order mean filter was used to increase the accuracy and stability of the algorithm. The same tests were performed on a previously developed fault locator algorithm that includes a square-wave power frequency  proximation of the fault arc. This algorithm gave more accurate and stable results even with large  arc length variations. During phase-to-phase fault conditions, two opposing magnetic fields force the conductors outwards away from each other and this movement causes a change in the  total inductance of the line. A three dimensional finite element line model based on standard wave equations but incorporating magnetic forces was used to evaluate this phenomenon. The results show that appreciable errors in the distance estimations can be expected especially on poorly tensioned di stribution lines.New techniques were also explored that are based on identification of the fault arc. Two methods were successfully tested on simulated networks to identify a  breakingconductor. The methods are based on the rate of increase in arc length during the breaking of the conductor. The first method uses arc voltage increase as the basis of the detection while the second method make use of the increase in the non-linearity of the network resistance to identify a breaking conductor. An unsuccessful attempt was made to identifying conductor clashing caused by high winds: it was found that too many parameters influence the separation speed of the two conductors. No  unique characteristic could be found to identify the conductor clashing using the speed of conductor separation. The existing algorithm was also used to estimate the voltage in a distribution network during a fault for power quality monitoring purposes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arcing</field><field name="subject">breaking conductor</field><field name="subject">conductor dynamics</field><field name="subject">conductor swing</field><field name="subject">distance protection</field><field name="subject">downed conductor</field><field name="subject">fault locator</field><field name="subject">fault identification</field><field name="subject">fault voltage</field><field name="subject">high impedance faults</field><field name="subject">overhead line monitoring</field><field name="subject">overhead line protection</field><field name="subject">power quality</field><field name="subject">voltage dips</field><field name="subject">voltage sags</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15800/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operation Belladonna</field><field name="creator">Woodhouse, Jennifer May</field><field name="description">Did not come with Thesis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">novel</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">witches</field><field name="subject">tarot</field><field name="subject">cornish folk-lore</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15801/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blurring Representation: the Writings of  Thomas King and Mudrooroo</field><field name="creator">Archer-Lean, Clare</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the issues of representation and identity through an examination of the writings of Thomas King and Mudrooroo. The particular focus of the dissertation is on the similar yet distinctive ways these authors explore past and present possibilities for representing Indigenous peoples in fiction. This discussion has a largely Canadian-Australian cross-cultural comparison because of the national  milieux in which each author writes. The research question, then, addresses the authors' common approaches to Indigenous, colonial and postcolonial themes and the similar textual attitudes to the act of representation of identity in writing. In order to explore these ideas the chapters in the thesis do not each focus on a particular author or even on a specific text. Each chapter examines the writings of both authors comparatively, and reads the novels of both Thomas King and Mudrooroo thematically. The themes unifying each chapter occur in four major movements. Firstly, the Preface and Chapter One are primarily concerned with the methodology of the thesis. This methodology can be summarised as a combination of  general postcolonial assumptions about the impact of colonial texts on representations  of Indigenous peoples; ideas of reading practice coming from North American and Australian Indigenous writing communities and cultural studies theories on race. A movement in argument then occurs in Chapters Two and Three, which focus upon how the authors interact with colonising narratives from the past. Chapter Four shifts from this focus on past images and explores how the authors commonly re-imagine  the present. In Chapters Five and Six the dissertation progresses from charting the  authors' common responses to colonising narratives -- past and present -- and engages in the writings in terms of the authors' explications of Indigenous themes and  their celebrations of Indigenous presence. These chapters analyse the ways in which  King and Mudrooroo similarly re-envisage narrative process, time and space. Overall,  the thesis is not interested in authorisations of Thomas King and Mudrooroo as 'Indigenous writers'. Rather, it argues that these authors on either side of the world use very similar techniques to reject previous representations of Indigenous people, and, importantly, attempt to change the meaning of and approach to representation. In so doing this thesis finds that the novels of both authors respond to  colonising semiotic fields, as well as reducing the importance of such fields by incorporating them within a larger framework of repeated and multiple evocations of Indigenous identity. The writings of both Thomas King and Mudrooroo share a selfconscious textuality. The same tales and emblems are repeated within each author's  entire oeuvre in order to reinforce their thematic trope of re-presentation as a  constantly evolving process. Finally, the thesis concludes that a significant common effect of this similar approach to re-presentation is an emphasis on the community over the individual, and a community that can be best described as pan-Indigenous rather than specific.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australian literature</field><field name="subject">Australian-Canadian crosscultural studies</field><field name="subject">Mudrooroo</field><field name="subject">Thomas King</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">native canadian literature</field><field name="subject">post colonial literature.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15802/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autonomic Imbalance - a Precursor to Myopia Development?</field><field name="creator">Chen, Jennifer C.</field><field name="description">While prolonged nearwork is considered to be an environmental risk factor associated with myopia development, an underlying genetic susceptibility to nearwork-induced accommodative adaptation may be one possible mechanism for human myopia development. As the control of accommodation by the autonomic system may be one such genetically predetermined system, this research sought to investigate whether an anomaly of the autonomic control of accommodation may be responsible for myopia development and progression.      The emphasis of this work was determining the effect of altering the sympathetic input to the ciliary muscle on accommodation responses such as tonic accommodation and nearwork-induced accommodative adaptation in myopes and non-myopes. The first study of the thesis was based on observations of Gilmartin and Winfield (1995) which suggested that a deficit in the sympathetic inputs to the ciliary muscle may be associated with a propensity for myopia development. The effect of &#223;-antagonism with timolol application on accommodation characteristics was studied in different refractive error groups. Our results support the previous findings that a deficit of sympathetic facility during nearwork was not a feature of late-onset myopia. However it was found that classifying myopes according to stability of their myopia and their ethnic background was important and this allowed differentiation between accommodation responses and characteristics of the ciliary muscle autonomic inputs, with the greatest difference observed between Caucasian stable myopes and Asian progressing myopes.    Progressing myopes, particularly those with an Asian background, demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to nearwork-induced accommodative adaptation and this was suggested to result from a possible parasympathetic dominance and a relative sympathetic deficit to the ciliary muscle. In contrast, stable myopes, particularly those with an Asian background, demonstrated minimal accommodation changes following nearwork (counter-adaptation in some cases), and increased accommodative adaptation with &#223;-antagonism, suggesting sympathetic dominance as the possible autonomic accommodation control profile.    As ethnic background was found to be an important factor, a similar study was also conducted in a group of Hong Kong Chinese children to investigate if enhanced susceptibility to nearwork-induced changes in accommodation may explain in part the high prevalence of myopia in Hong Kong. Despite some minor differences in methodology between the two studies, the Hong Kong stable myopic children demonstrated counter-adaptive changes and greater accommodative adaptation with timolol, findings that were consistent with those of the adult Asian stable myopes. Both Asian progressing myopic children and adults also showed greater accommodative adaptation than the stable myopes and similar response profiles following &#223;-adrenergic antagonism. Thus a combination of genetically predetermined accommodation profiles that confer high susceptibility and extreme environmental pressures is a likely explanation for the increase in myopia over the past decades in Asian countries.    The hypothesis that a sympathetic deficit is linked to myopia was also investigated by comparing the effect of &#226;-stimulation with salbutamol, a &#223;-agonist, on accommodation with that of &#223;-antagonism using timolol. It was hypothesized that salbutamol would have the opposite effect of timolol, and that it would have a greater effect on subjects who demonstrated greater accommodative adaptation effects, i.e. the progressing myopes, compared to those who showed minimal changes in accommodation following nearwork. Consistent with the hypothesis, the effect of sympathetic stimulation with salbutamol application was only evident in the progressing myopes whom we hypothesized may have a parasympathetic dominance and a relative sympathetic deficit type of autonomic imbalance while it did not further enhance the rapid accommodative regression profile demonstrated by the stable myopes.    Characteristics of the convergence system and the interaction between accommodation and convergence were also investigated in the Hong Kong children. No significant differences in response AC/A ratios between the emmetropic, stable and progressing myopic children were found and it was concluded that elevated AC/A ratios were not associated with higher myopic progression rate in this sample of Hong Kong children. However, &#223;-adrenergic antagonism with timolol application produced a greater effect on accommodative convergence (AC) in stable myopic children who presumably have a more adequate, robust sympathetic input to the ciliary muscle, but had little effect on AC of progressing myopic children. This finding again points to the possibility that the autonomic control of the accommodation and convergence systems may be different between stable and progressing myopia.    The primary contribution of this study to the understanding of myopia development is that differences in the autonomic control of the ciliary muscle may be responsible for producing anomalous accommodation responses. This could have significant impact on retinal image quality and thus results in myopia development. This knowledge may be incorporated into computer models of accommodation and myopia development and provides scope for further investigation of the therapeutic benefits of autonomic agents for myopia control.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myopia</field><field name="subject">Retinal defocus</field><field name="subject">Accommodation</field><field name="subject">Convergence</field><field name="subject">Autonomic innervation</field><field name="subject">Accommodative adaptation</field><field name="subject">Nearwork-induced transient myopia</field><field name="subject">Ciliary muscle</field><field name="subject">Sympathetic innervation</field><field name="subject">Parasympathetic innervation</field><field name="subject">Tonic accommodation</field><field name="subject">Refractive error</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15803/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated Public Services : The Role of Networked Arrangements</field><field name="creator">Keast, Robyn Leigh</field><field name="description">Networked arrangements have moved from the periphery to the centre of public policy making and now occupy a position alongside of government as key mechanisms for social and organisational integration. Despite the current prominence of networked arrangements, little is known about how networks are actually formed and what explains their structure, operation and management strategies. Moreover, despite the pivotal position as the architects, administrators and facilitators of the network reform process, the role of central agencies of government in networked environments has yet to be fully determined.    The purpose of this thesis was to examine the variation in networked arrangements and its effect on design and management and, in doing so, uncover the emergent role of central agencies of government. Using a mixed research design of case study and network analysis, this thesis 'unpacked' three exemplars of cross-sector networked arrangements within the Queensland human services arena.  The research produced a number of findings. First, it provided empirical evidence to support the previously largely descriptive proposition that networked arrangements are differentiated. Second, through the synthesis of two parallel integration literatures, a framework to guide the design of networked arrangements was produced. Third, it identified a set of network management strategies and demonstrated that these horizontally oriented strategies were different to those currently utilised within government.  Finally, the research developed a set of general and specific roles to guide central agencies' operation within the current networked environment.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Networked arrangements</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15804/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian laws ascribing criminal responsibility to children: The implications of an internal critique, postmodern insights, and a deconstructive exploration.</field><field name="creator">Mathews, Ben</field><field name="description">Derived from centuries-old English laws, Australian laws ascribe criminal responsibility to children according to their age and their assumed level of understanding of the rightness and wrongness of certain acts.

An important part of developing strategies to optimisise grain yield is the understanding of PA technology. This covers major aspects of PA which includes all the components of Site-  Specific Crop Management System (SSCM). These components are 1. Spatial referencing, 2. Crop, soil and climate monitoring, 3. Attribute mapping, 4. Decision suppport systems and 5. Differential action. Understanding how all five components fit into PA significantly aids the development of data analysis methods. The development of PA is dependent on the collection, analysis and interpretation of information. A preliminary data analysis step is described which covers both non-spatial and spatial data analysis methods. The non-spatial analysis involves plotting methods (maps, histograms), standard distribution and statistical summary (mean, standard deviation). The spatial analysis covers both undirected and directional variogram analyses. In addition to the data analysis, a theoretical investigation into GPS error is given. GPS plays a major role in the development of PA.  A number of sources of errors affect the GPS and therefore effect the positioning measurements. Therefore, an understanding of the distribution of the errors and how they are related to each other over time is needed to complement the understanding of the nature of the data. Understanding the error distribution and the data give useful insights for model assumptions in regard to position measurement errors. A review of filtering methods is given and new methods are developed, namely, strip analysis and a double harvesting algoritm. These methods are designed specifically for controlled traffic and normal traffic respectively but can be applied to all kinds of yield monitoring data. The data resulting from the strip analysis and double harvesting algorithm are used in investigating the relationship between on-the-go yield and protein. The strategy is to use protein and yield in determining decisions with respect to nitrogen managements. The agronomic assumption is that protein and yield have a significant relationship based on plot trials. We investigate whether there is any significant relationship between protein and yield at the local level to warrent this kind of assumption. Understanding PA technology and being aware of the sources of errors that exist in data collection and data analysis are all very important in the steps of developing management decision strategies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">precision agriculture</field><field name="subject">combine harvesters</field><field name="subject">yield maps</field><field name="subject">grain protein</field><field name="subject">protein/yield relationship</field><field name="subject">local neighbourhoods</field><field name="subject">weighted regression</field><field name="subject">controlled trafiic</field><field name="subject">haphazard harveasting</field><field name="subject">GPS errors</field><field name="subject">filtering methods</field><field name="subject">exploratory data analysis</field><field name="subject">data cleaning</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15806/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile Velocity Estimation Using a Time-Frequency Approach</field><field name="creator">Azemi, Ghasem</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the problem of estimating the velocity of a mobile station (MS)in a mobile communication system using the instantaneous frequency (IF) of the received signal at the MS antenna. This estimate is essential for satisfactory handover performance, effective dynamic channel assignment, and optimisation of  adaptive multiple access wireless receivers.    Conventional methods for estimating the MS velocity are based either on the statistics of the envelope or quadrature components of the received signal. In chapter 4 of the thesis, we show that their performance deteriorates in the presence of shadowing.  Other velocity estimators have also been proposed which require prior estimation of the channel or the average received power. These are generally difficult to obtain due  to the non-stationary nature of the received signal. An appropriate window which depends on the unknown MS velocity must first be applied in order to accurately estimate the required quantities.    Using the statistics of the IF of the received signal at the MS antenna given in chapter 3, new velocity estimators are proposed in chapter 4 of this thesis. The proposed estimators are based on the moments, zero-crossing rate, and covariance of  the received IF. Since the IF of the received signal is not affected by any amplitude distortion, the proposed IF-based estimators are robust to shadowing and propagation path-loss. The estimators for the MS velocity in a macro- and micro-cellular system are presented separately. A macro-cell system can be considered as a special case of a micro-cell in which there is no line-of-sight component at the receiver  antenna. It follows that those estimators which are derived for micro-cells can be used in a macro-cell as well. In chapter 4, we analyse the performance of the proposed velocity estimators in the presence of additive noise, non-isotropic scattering, and shadowing. We also prove analytically that the proposed velocity estimators  outperform the existing methods in the presence of shadowing and additive noise.    The proposed IF-based estimators need prior estimation of both the IF of the received signal and Ricean K-factor. The IF estimation in a typical wireless environment, can be considered as a special case of a general problem of IF estimation in the presence of multiplicative and additive noise. In chapter 5, we show that current time-frequency approaches to this problem which are based on the peak of a time-frequency distribution (TFD) of the signal, fail because of the special shape of the power spectral density of the multiplicative noise in a wireless environment. To overcome this drawback, the use of the first-order moment of a TFD is studied in  chapter 5. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that the IF estimator based on the first-order moment of a TFD exhibits negligible bias when the signal-to-additive noise ratio is more than 10 dB.    The Ricean K-factor is not only necessary for velocity estimation in micro-cells, but also is a measure of the severity of fading and a good indicator of the channel quality. Two new methods for estimating the Ricean K-factor based on the first two moments of the envelope of the received signal, are proposed in chapter 6.  Performance analysis presented in chapter 6, prove that the proposed K estimators are robust to non-isotropic scattering.    Theoretical analysis and simulations which are presented in chapters 4 and 7 of this thesis, prove that the proposed velocity and K estimators outperform existing estimators in the presence of shadowing and additive noise.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">velocity estimation</field><field name="subject">mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">instantaneous frequency</field><field name="subject">time-frequency signal processing</field><field name="subject">micro-cellular systems</field><field name="subject">multi-tier systems</field><field name="subject">Rice factor</field><field name="subject">Ricean K-factor</field><field name="subject">multiplicative noise</field><field name="subject">handover</field><field name="subject">handoff</field><field name="subject">first-order moment</field><field name="subject">bias</field><field name="subject">variance</field><field name="subject">estimation</field><field name="subject">Cramer-Rao bounds</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15807/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibration Signal Features for the Quantification of Prosthetic Loosening in Total Hip Arthroplasties</field><field name="creator">Stevenson, Nathan</field><field name="description">This project attempts to quantify the integrity of the fixation of total hip arthro- T plasties (THAs) by observing vibration signal features. The aim of this thesis is, therefore, to find the signal differences between firm and loose prosthesis. These difference will be expressed in different transformed domains with the expectation that a certain domain will provide superior results. Once the signal differences have been determined they will be examined for their ability to quantify the looseness.  Initially, a new definition of progressive, femoral component loosening was created,  based on the application of mechanical fit, involving four general conditions. In order of  increasing looseness the conditions (with their equivalent engineering associations) are  listed as, firm (adherence), firm  (interference), micro-loose (transition) and macro-loose (clearance). These conditions were then used to aid in the development and evaluation of a simple mathematical model based on an ordinary differential equation. Several possible parameters well suited to quantification such as gap displacement, cement/interface stiffness and apparent mass were the identified from the model.  In addition, the development of this model provided a solution to the problem of  unifying early and late loosening mentioned in the literature by Li et al. in 1995 and  1996. This unification permitted early (micro loose) and late (macro loose) loosening  to be quantified, if necessary, with the same parameter.    The quantification problem was posed as a detection problem by utilising a varying  amplitude input. A set of detection techniques were developed to detect the quantity of  a critical value, in this case a force. The detection techniques include deviation measures  of the instantaneous frequency of the impulse response of the system (accuracy of 100%),  linearity of the systems response to Gaussian input (total accuracy of 97.9% over all  realisations) and observed resonant frequency linearity with respect to displacement  magnitude (accuracy of 100%). Note, that as these techniques were developed with the  model in mind their simulated performance was, therefore, considerably high. This critical value found by the detector was then fed into the model and a quantified output was calculated. The quantification techniques using the critical value approach include, ramped amplitude input resonant analysis (experimental accuracy of 94%) and ramped amplitude input stochastic analysis (experimental accuracy of 90%). These techniques were based on analysing the response of the system in the time-frequency  domain and with respect to its short-time statistical moments to a ramping amplitude  input force, respectively. In addition, other mechanically sound forms of analysis, were then applied to the output of the nonlinear model with the aim of quantifying the looseness or the integrity of fixation of the THA. The cement/interface stiffness and apparent mass techniques, inspired by the work of Chung et.al. in 1979, attempt to assess the integrity of fixation of the THA  by tracking the mechanical behaviour of the components of the THA, using the frequency and magnitude of the raw transducer data. This technique has been developed fron the theory of Chung etal but with a differing perspective and provides accuracies of 82% in experimentation and 71% in simulation  for the apparent mass and interface stiffness techniques, respectively. Theses techniques do not quantify all forms of clinical loosening, as clinical loosening can exist in many different forms, but they do quantify mechanical loosening or the mechanical functionality of the femoral component through related parameters that observe reduction in mechanical mass, stiffness and the amount of rattle generated by a select ghap betweent he bone/cement or prosthesis/cement interface. This form of mechanical loosening in currently extremely difficult to detect using radiographs. It is envisaged that a vibration test be used in conjunction with radiographs to provide a more complete picture of the integrity of fixation of the THA.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Total Hip Arthroplasty</field><field name="subject">Total hip replacement</field><field name="subject">Total hip joint replacement</field><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">nonlinear dynamics</field><field name="subject">nonlinear differential equations</field><field name="subject">time-frequency distributions</field><field name="subject">mechanical dynamics higher order statistics</field><field name="subject">goodness -of-fit tests</field><field name="subject">BT production</field><field name="subject">detection</field><field name="subject">endoprosthesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15808/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiotic analysis of clinical chemistry: for " knowledge work " in the medical sciences</field><field name="creator">Carberry, Helen</field><field name="description">Abstract    In this thesis a socio-cultural perspective of medical science education is adopted to argue the position that undergraduate medical scientists must be enculturated into the profession as knowledge workers and symbolic analysts who can interact with computers in complex analytical procedures, quality assurance and quality management. The cue for this position is taken from the transformations  taking place in the pathology industry due to advances in automation, robotics and  informatics. The rise of Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine (EBLM) is also noted  and the observation by higher education researchers, that knowledge systems are  transforming in such a way that disciplines can no longer act in isolation. They must  now collaborate with disparate fields in transdisciplinary knowledge systems such as  EBLM, for which new skills must be cultivated in undergraduate medical scientists.  This thesis aims to describe a theoretical basis for knowledge work by taking a semiotic perspective. This is because, semiotics, a theory of signs and representations, can be applied to the structure of transdisciplinary scientific knowledge, the logic of scientific practice and the rhetoric of scientific  communications. For this purpose, a semiotic framework is first derived from a wide  range of semiotic theories existent in the literature. Then the application of this  semiotic framework to clinical chemistry knowledge, context, logic, and rhetoric is  demonstrated. This is achieved by interpreting various clinical chemistry data  sources, for example, course materials, laboratory spatial arrangements, instruments,  printouts, and students' practical reports, collected from a teaching laboratory  situation.  The results of semiotic analysis indicate that the clinical chemist working in the computerised laboratory environment performs knowledge work, and the term is synonymous with symbolic analysis. It is shown that knowledge work entails the application of a systematic structure for clinical chemistry knowledge derived in terms of the validation procedures applied to laboratory, data, results and tests; the application of logic in the classification and selection of instruments, their rulegoverned-  use, and in troubleshooting errors; pragmatic decisions based on availability of space, services and budgets; discrimination among values in laboratory test evaluations in EBLM, for the cost-effectiveness and relevance of  pathology services; and the recognition of rhetorical strategies used to communicate  laboratory test information in graphs, charts, and statistics. The role of the laboratory  context is also explained through semiotics, in terms of its spatial arrangements and  designs of laboratory instruments, as a place that constrains the knowledge work  experience. This contextual analysis provides insights into the oppositional trend  brought to wide attention by analysts of computerised professional work, that more  skills are needed, but that there are fewer highly skilled positions available.  The curriculum implications of these findings are considered in terms of the need to cultivate knowledge workers for highly complex symbolic analysis in computerised laboratories; and also the need to prepare medical science graduates for  the transdisciplinary knowledge system of EBLM, and related venues of employment such as biomedical research and clinical medicine. In meeting the aims to define and demonstrate knowledge work from the semiotic perspective, this thesis makes an original contribution to knowledge by the application of semiotics to a field in which it has probably never been tested. It contributes to the scholarship of  teaching in higher education by formulating a structure for transdisciplinary medical  science knowledge, which integrates scientific with other forms of knowledge, and with real world practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical science</field><field name="subject">clinical chemistry</field><field name="subject">Mode 1 disciplinary</field><field name="subject">Mode 2 transdisciplinary knowledge systems</field><field name="subject">knowledge work</field><field name="subject">symbolic analysis</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">cultural analysis</field><field name="subject">competence</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">semiotics</field><field name="subject">semiology</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">logic</field><field name="subject">rhetoric</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="subject">signs</field><field name="subject">representations</field><field name="subject">inscriptions</field><field name="subject">contexts</field><field name="subject">systems</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15809/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multimedia Analysis Over 3G Wireless Interface</field><field name="creator">Tay, Jeremy Yee Chiat</field><field name="description">Recent  rapid advancements in mobile communication and emerging demands for complicated multimedia  content  and  services  over mobile  systems  have caused a dramatic increase  in  research  interest  in  this  area.   Among  the  topics  covering multimedia  service performance  over  the wireless  interface,  the  quality  of  received multimedia  content  is  an important  issue.    With  the  increase  of  visual  media  in  mobile  services,  user  opinion acquired  through  perception  of  received  image  quality will  play  an  increasingly  important role in determining the effectiveness of such services.    The work documented in this thesis is motivated by the general lack of published work on software  test  beds  for  Third  Generation  Mobile  Network  (3G)  and  in  particular  for investigating  mobile  environment  multimedia  quality  degradation.      A  3G  multimedia quality  analysis  system  is  presented,  subjecting  the  input  multimedia  stream  to  the simulated 3G  radio activities and measuring  its degradation  in  terms of human perception.  This  approach  takes  a  new  and  different model  of multimedia  quality measurement  in  a wireless communication domain,  showing  the possibility of a more effective approach that can  be  applied  in many  cases  for  assisting  service  quality  assurance  research  across  this area.    The  development  of  this  software  system  is  covered  in  detail  together  with  in-depth analysis  of  multimedia  image  quality  over  a  simulated  3G  radio  interface.    Universal Mobile  Telecommunications  System  (UMTS)  is  the  3G  standard  chosen  for  study  in  this work.    The  suggested  test  bed  simulates  a  single  Frequency  Division  Duplex  (FDD) downlink  UMTS  Territorial  Radio  Access  (UTRA)  channel,  where  the  received media's image  analysis  is  performed  using  a  Human  Vision  System  (HVS)  based  image  quality metric.   The  system  aims  to  provide  a multipurpose  and  versatile multimedia  3G  test  bed for  use  in  testing  of  various  solutions  for  protecting multimedia  data  across  a  3G  radio interface.    Furthermore,  it  produces  effective  human  vision  oriented  feedback  on  visual media  degradation,  providing  a  new  and  efficient  method  to  address  effectiveness  of solutions in multimedia delivery over a mobile environment.    This  thesis  shows  the  ability  of HVS-based  image  quality metric  in  analyzing  degradation of  visual media  over  a  noisy mobile  environment.   This  presents  a  novel  direction  in  the area  of  telecommunication  service multimedia  quality  analysis, with  potential  user  quality perception being considered on top of data or signal-based error measurements.  With such a  new  approach,  development  of  multimedia  protection  solutions  can  be  made  more effective.    Effective  feedback  provided  by  considering  quality  measurement  with  strong correlation  to  human  perception  allows  close  analysis  of  user  visual  discrimination  across an  image.    An  example  of  the  usefulness  of  this  information  is  especially  visible  if considering  development  of  a  content-based  multimedia  data  protective  system  that provides different levels of protection, depending on the importance of visual media.  An  apparent  potential  application  of  this  thesis  is  in  the  testing  of  a  multimedia/image protection  protocol  in  a  downlink  channel.   Future work might  aim  to  extend  the current system  by  adding  network  level  traffic  simulations  and  further  addition  of  dynamic network control components, further considering network traffic conditions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multimedia analysis</field><field name="subject">3G</field><field name="subject">wireless interface</field><field name="subject">third generation mobile network</field><field name="subject">acquisition indicator channel</field><field name="subject">media gateway function</field><field name="subject">integrated service digital network</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15810/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecologically sustainable coastal management: A legal blueprint</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Roslyn</field><field name="description">The theme of this thesis is that ecologically sustainable coastal management (ESCM) is achievable through the application of law. Once the legal principles and the administrative structures that that law supports have been put into place a framework is created within which the goal of ecologically sustainable development - 'Development that improves the total quality of life, both now and in the future, in a way that maintains the ecological processes on which life depends' can be realised. This thesis approaches the task by analysing the components of ecologically sustainable development (ESD), synthesising them into a set of principles for achieving ESCM and then, by using a comparative approach, devising a number of recommendations, which, if followed, will enable ESCM to be achieved. While the focus is on ESCM, the recommendations could be applied with minimal adaptation, to most, if not all, natural resource management. The thesis is divided into five Parts. Part A looks at the function of law in ESCM and proposes a theoretical model for a legal and administrative regime to be tested in the remaining Parts. Part B considers the context for ESCM and the policies and approaches followed by the different jurisdictions compared throughout this thesis, in addressing sustainable development, with emphasis in chapter four on devising the principles for ESCM. These principles are then developed and analysed in the remaining Parts of the thesis. Part C looks at the current constitutional legal regime for the coastal zone in each jurisdiction and then moves on to consider the first two of the principles for ESCM, international responsibilities and integrated coastal zone management, linked together in this part by the direct dependence on law as the agent for management Part D is about the four remaining principles of ESCM - the practical instruments for achieving ESCM. These are environmental impact assessment, public participation, coastal planning and economic instruments. In the last Part, Part E, the suggested principles for ESCM are brought together and, by a comparison of the various legal and administrative mechanisms used in the jurisdictions reviewed in this thesis, recommendations for achieving ESCM are drawn up.

It now involves a greater consideration of issues concerning the global community. This thesis develops a practical methodology for the determination of sovereignty over maritime natural resources. Customary international law regarding the use of resources within the maritime zones of islands on the high seas is rapidly developing. Traditional tests, such as the discovery and occupation of islands, are no longer the primary focus of the determination of sovereignty. The methodology expressed in this thesis is an application and adaptation of the current state of the international laws regarding islands within the high seas. This argument has its foundation in the new international treaties, recent decisions of the International Court of Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. It unifies the latest determinations and theoretical legal perspectives of these bodies to produce a single methodology. This work provides an original and substantial contribution to the knowledge and understanding of sovereignty issues within International Law.    The Chapters of this thesis and their sub-headings progressively illuminate the individual elements of a distinctive formula for determining the sovereignty of islands within the high seas. The Chapters form a template for this methodology, which is applied to the Falkland Islands. Thus, each chapter is a step towards the determination of sovereignty. This modus operandi can be applied to new disputes in this realm, such as those filed with the International Court of Justice. Since 1982, the definitive ownership of the Falkland Islands proper has been determined, if not by International Law, then by warfare. However, conflict over the use of natural resources in the maritime zones continues.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sovereignty</field><field name="subject">islands</field><field name="subject">maritime resources</field><field name="subject">Falkland Islands</field><field name="subject">customary international law</field><field name="subject">maritime zones</field><field name="subject">delimitation</field><field name="subject">law of the sea</field><field name="subject">UNCLOS</field><field name="subject">boundaries</field><field name="subject">resources</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15812/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation and Adaptation of Web Services</field><field name="creator">Iyer, Anand</field><field name="description">One of the main aims of Component adaptation [Szy97] is to help application developers reuse components so that they can plug-in third party components into their application. This research concentrates on this type of adaptation  but in the context of Web Services. Web Services are becoming increasingly popular. Web Services often &#64257;t the requirements of being a component, and can be reused in a very similar manner. Hence there is a requirement for adaptation  of Web Services just as there is the need for adaptation of software components.    There are now quite a few adaptation techniques, but few of them have identi&#64257;ed adaptation techniques for Web Services. This approach to adaptation allows for the modi&#64257;cation of data and behaviour of existing Web Services. The approach to adaptation uses eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) transformation applied  to the message passed between Web Services. These messages are commonly in XML format, hence XSL can be used to modify them. The application of the transformation is guided by a speci&#64257;cation written in XML. The adaptation is  executed by a generic runtime system that uses these speci&#64257;cations which are referred to as Guiding Speci&#64257;cations. This has been demonstrated by way of a motivating real world example implemented on the .Net platform.  It is shown how an adapter can be speci&#64257;ed using a simplistic Guiding Speci&#64257;cation and related XSLT documents. This allows the implementation to work more efficiently than hand coding each adapter. It is the underlying generic  runtime support that provides much of this bene&#64257;t.    Component based software engineering (CBSE) constructs applications by assembling components together, CBSE has been of great help to application developers due to the very fact that tailor made components can be purchased  from third party vendors and can be plugged-in to a system to form a working application. But in practice 'as-is' reuse is very unlikely to occur, and most components need to be changed in some way to match the requirements of the  application architecture and other components. The process of changing thecomponent for use in a particular application is often referred to as Component Adaptation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microsoft .Net</field><field name="subject">Web Services</field><field name="subject">XML/XSLT</field><field name="subject">SOAP</field><field name="subject">Adaptation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15813/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Coding of High Quality Audio Signals</field><field name="creator">Ning, Daryl</field><field name="description">Digital audio is increasingly becoming more and more a part of our daily lives.  Unfortunately, the excessive bitrate associated with the raw digital signal makes it an extremely expensive representation.  Applications such as digital audio broadcasting, high definition television, and internet audio, require high quality audio at low bitrates.  The field of audio coding addresses this important issue of reducing the bitrate of digital audio, while maintaining a high perceptual quality.  Developing an efficient audio coder requires a detailed analysis of the audio signals themselves.  It is important to find a representation that can concisely model any general audio signal.  In this thesis, we propose two new high quality audio coders based on two different audio representations - the sinusoidal-wavelet representation, and the warped linear predictive coding (WLPC)-wavelet representation.  In addition to high quality coding, it is also important for audio coders to be flexible in their application.  With the increasing popularity of internet audio, it is advantageous for audio coders to address issues related to real-time audio delivery.  The issue of bitstream scalability has been targeted in this thesis, and therefore, a third audio coder capable of bitstream scalability is also proposed.  The performance of each of the proposed coders was evaluated by comparisons with the MPEG layer III coder.  The first coder proposed is based on a hybrid sinusoidal-wavelet representation.  This assumes that each frame of audio can be modelled as a sum of sinusoids plus a noisy residual.  The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to decompose the residual into subbands that approximate the critical bands of human hearing.  A perceptually derived bit allocation algorithm is then used to minimise the audible distortions introduced from quantising the DWT coefficients.  Listening tests showed that the coder delivers near-transparent quality for a range of critical audio signals at G4 kbps.  It also outperforms the MPEG layer III coder operating at this same bitrate.  This coder, however, is only useful for high quality coding, and is difficult to scale to operate at lower rates.  The second coder proposed is based on a hybrid WLPC-wavelet representation.  In this approach, the spectrum of the audio signal is estimated by an all pole filter using warped linear prediction (WLP).  WLP operates on a warped frequency domain, where the resolution can be adjusted to approximate that of the human auditory system.  This makes the inherent noise shaping of the synthesis filter even more suited to audio coding.  The excitation to this filter is transformed using the DWT and perceptually encoded.  Listening tests showed that near-transparent coding is achieved at G4 kbps.  The coder was also found to be slightly superior to the MPEG layer III coder operating at this same bitrate.  The third proposed coder is similar to the previous WLPC-wavelet coder, but modified to achieve bitstream scalability.  A noise model for high frequency components is included to keep the overall bitrate low, and a two stage quantisation scheme for the DWT coefficients is implemented.  The first stage uses fixed rate scalar and vector quantisation to provide a coarse approximation of the coefficients.  This allows for low bitrate, low quality versions of the input signal to be embedded in the overall bitstream.  The second stage of quantisation adds detail to the coefficients, and hence, enhances the quality of the output signal.  Listening tests showed that signal quality gracefully improves as the bitrate increases from 16 kbps to SO kbps.  This coder has a performance that is comparable to the MPEG layer III coder operating at a similar (but fixed) bitrate.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">audio coding</field><field name="subject">audio compression</field><field name="subject">psychoacoustics</field><field name="subject">wavelet transform</field><field name="subject">sinusoidal analysis</field><field name="subject">warped linear prediction</field><field name="subject">scalability</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15814/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teenagers' perceptions of advertising in the online social networking environment : an exploratory study</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Louise</field><field name="description">This study explores teenager perceptions towards advertising in the online social networking environment.  The future of online social networking sites is dependant upon the continued support of advertisers in this new medium, which is linked to the acceptance of advertising on these sites by their targeted audience.  This exploratory study used the qualitative research methods of focus groups and in-depth personal interviews to gain insights from the teenager participants.  The literature review in Chapter Two examined the previous research into advertising theories, consumer attitudes and issues such as advertising avoidance, advertising as a service and trust and privacy in the online social networking environment.  The teenage consumer was also examined as were the influences of social identity theory. From this literature review eleven propositions were formed which provided a structure to the analysis of the research.  Chapter Three outlined the multi-method research approach of using focus groups and in-depth interviews.  The key findings were outlined in Chapter Four and Chapter Five provides discussion regarding these findings and the implications for theory and advertising practice.  The main findings from this study suggest that teenagers have very high levels of advertising avoidance and are sceptical towards advertising on their online social networking sites.  They have an inherent distrust of commercial messages in the online social networking environment; however they are extremely trusting with the information that they disclose online.  They believe that if their site is classified as private, then the information disclosed on this site is not accessible to anyone.  The study explores the reasons behind these views.  This research has resulted in the identification of seven motivations behind online social networking use.  A new model of advertising avoidance in the online social networking environment is also presented and discussed.  This model makes a contribution towards filling the gap in available research on online social networking sites and advertising perception. The findings of this study have also resulted in the identification of the characteristics of online social networking sites as an advertising medium.  The newness of online social networking sites coupled with the enthusiastic adoption of online social networking by the teenage demographic means that this exploratory study will be of interest to both academics and practitioners alike.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">advertising, avoidance, online social networking, perceptions, privacy, teenagers, trust</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/26966/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship Between Unsignalised  Intersection Geometry and Accident Rates</field><field name="creator">Arndt, Owen Kingsley</field><field name="description">The aim of this research is to determine the effect of unsignalised intersection  geometry on the rates of the various types of accidents occurring at unsignalised  intersections.

A structured pre-transfer educational method of patient transfer was introduced and evaluated.  Background of the study:  Many studies have documented the needs of family members whilst in intensive care units (ICU) but few have evaluated interventions to support meeting these needs. No studies have documented 'uncertainty in illness' levels of family members around transfer from ICU or the relationship between uncertainty and anxiety.  Method:  The study used a quasi-experimental pre-test, post-test non-equivalent control group design based on the General System Theory (von Bertalanffy, 1972). There were four phases to the study with the intervention grounded in Knowles' Adult Learning Theory (1980).  Family members of patients in an ICU were purposively allocated to a control(n = 80) and intervention group (n = 82). A pre-test, post-test strategy was used with data from the control group collected first and once completed, the intervention was introduced into the ICU. The intervention group data were then collected using the same data collection tools. The intervention group experienced a transfer method designed to improve communication with the bedside nurse in ICU whereas the control group received existing ad hoc transfer methods.  Participants were surveyed before and after transfer using Spielberger et al.'s state anxiety inventory and Mishel's 'uncertainty in illness' scale. Demographic data were collected for both patients and family members together with family members' satisfaction with the transfer process they experienced. At the completion of the study, intensive care nurses (n = 40) were surveyed to assess their perception of the efficacy of the intervention.  Results:  Three factors were found to significantly affect levels of 'uncertainty in illness' and these included state anxiety scores (F = 50.9, p &lt; .000), the relationship of the family member to the patient (F = 2.9, p = .022), and the unexpected nature of the admission (F = 23.09, p &lt; .000). These factors accounted for 33% of the variance of 'uncertainty in illness' scores.  State anxiety levels were significantly affected by the degree of family social support (F = 10.0, p = .002) and uncertainty as previously mentioned. State anxiety reduced significantly following transfer for both groups and 'uncertainty in illness' reduced significantly for the intervention group (t = 2.21, p = .03).When controlled for pre-transfer levels, however, there was no significant reduction in the intervention group when compared with the control group.'  Uncertainty in illness' for the intervention group reduced, however, whereas scores for the control group did not.  The intervention group experienced significantly higher levels of satisfaction with transfer (Z = -2.43, p = .015) and felt significantly better prepared for transfer(Z = -3.26, p = .001) than did the control group. The vast majority of ICU nurses(90.6%) thought the intervention provided a useful framework for discussing the patient's condition with family members and 94% thought it should be introduced for all transfers from ICU.  Conclusions:  Uncertainty is significantly related to state anxiety in this sample. Previous research suggests that individual's coping ability is affected by both anxiety and' uncertainty in illness' which limit their adaptation to the new ward situation.  This results in relationship disturbances and psychological distress (Mishel, 1981)at a time when patients rely on family support. The intervention reduced uncertainty and improved family members' satisfaction with the transfer process by improved communication between family members and ICU nurses. The intervention was fully endorsed and supported by ICU nurses who recommended its introduction for all future transfers.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family members</field><field name="subject">Intensive Care</field><field name="subject">Transfer</field><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty in illness</field><field name="subject">Satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Pre-transfer education</field><field name="subject">General System Theory</field><field name="subject">Adult Learning Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15816/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovery following an acute myocardial infarction : impact on the quality of life of patients and their parnters</field><field name="creator">McDowell, Janis Kathleen</field><field name="description">Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the industrialised world, and places a heavy burden on society in terms of personal disability and health care costs.   The first signs of CHD often present acutely as a myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack.   Survivors of a heart attack remain vulnerable to poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL), further cardiac events, and increased morbidity due to a progression of CHD.   Thus, the implementation of interventions to reduce these risks is an important public health strategy.   To date, secondary prevention and rehabilitation efforts post-AMI focus primarily on the patient.   However, it is argued that recovery from AMI occurs within a social context, and that risk reduction strategies are likely to be enhanced if interventions take into account the impact of the event on the quality of life of patients and their partners.   Evidence from a review of couple relationship literature indicates that a significant proportion of couples experiences poor HRQOL (i.e., physical and emotional wellbeing) when coping with stressful life events, and that interactive aspects of a couple relationship (i.e., dyadic functioning and behaviour) are associated with individual well-being at such a time.   Information from studies of couples dealing with recovery from heart attack is sparse, but tends to reflect the findings from the broader literature.   Further research is required with post-AMI couples, though, as there are a number of shortcomings associated with the existing evidence.   For instance, it is derived from studies conducted with, mostly small, samples of convenience; many different instruments are used to collect the data; and no studies specifically measure HRQOL.   Analytically, most evidence is obtained with univariate and bivariate statistics, and data are analysed as groups of patients or partners, as opposed to dyads.   Where multivariable analyses are undertaken a number of bivariate relationships are no longer significant after accounting for covariates such as age and gender; and few researchers investigate predictive associations between dyadic functioning/behaviour and HRQOL outcomes.   Finally, there is a paucity of information from comparative analyses.   Thus, it is not known whether the well-being of post-AMI couples over time is better than, similar to, or worse than, for example, that in the general population.  The research program underpinning this thesis, the QUT-AMI Project, comprised two studies designed to address these methodological issues.  The first was an observational, cross-sectional, pilot study conducted in 1998 with 26 post-AMI couples.  The main investigation was a prospective cohort study of 93 post-AMI couples undertaken in 1999-2000.  In both studies the samples comprised a consecutive series of adult males younger than 75 years who had experienced a first AMI, and their female partners.  The average couple in both studies was middle-aged, had been married for many years, and both members of the dyad were working at the time of the heart attack.  Prospective participants were identified in major clinical centres that admit cardiac patients, and couples were recruited to the project soon after the patient's heart attack.  Clinical data were collected in hospital.  Further data were collected with self-administered questionnaires during a home visit at 1 month (pilot and main study), and by mailed questionnaire or during a home visit at 6 months(main study) after the heart attack.  The pilot study was undertaken to test recruitment and data collection procedures in preparation for the second (main) study, measure couples' HRQOL at 1 month after the event using the SF-36, and qualitatively investigate life issues for couples coping with recovery from AMI.  In the main study couples' HRQOL outcomes were measured at 1 and 6 months post-AMI using the SF-36, and examined for changes over that time.  The outcomes were also compared with those from matched population norms to estimate the impact of a heart attack on couples' HRQOL during the early and later recovery period.  Additionally, the following relationships were investigated to determine the extent to which:* patients' dyadic functioning (e.g.  happiness/satisfaction with relationship, measured with the Marital Adjustment Scale) and use of dyadic behaviour (e.g., hiding concerns and negative feelings from the other member of the dyad, measured with the Protective Buffering Scale) at 1 month predicted patients' emotional well-being at 6 months post-AMI;* partners' dyadic functioning and behaviour at 1 month predicted partners' emotional well-being at 6 months post-AMI;* patients' and partners' dyadic functioning at 1 month predicted patients' or partners' emotional well-being at 6 months post-AMI; and* patients' and partners' dyadic behaviour at 1 month predicted patients' or partners' emotional well-being at 6 months post-AMI.  Exploratory analyses were also undertaken to determine the effect of dyadic discrepancies in functioning and behaviour, at 1 month after the heart attack, on patients' and partners' emotional well-being at 6 months after the event.  Important findings were as follows:* At 1 month after an AMI the HRQOL of couples is impaired.  The major impact is on physical well-being for patients, and emotional well-being for their partners.* In general, couples' HRQOL improves between 1 and 6 months after an AMI.* At 6 months after an AMI, the HRQOL of average couples is similar to that of their peers in the normal population.* There are subgroup variations in the quality of life of post-AMI couples, and these are associated with age, clinically poor physical health, and depression.* The combination of patients' and partners' use of dyadic behaviour at 1 month after an AMI explains 7% of the variation in patients' emotional well-being at 6months after the event, after adjustment for patients' concurrent physical wellbeing and prior levels of emotional well-being, as well as duration of couple relationships.* The combination of partners' perceptions of dyadic functioning and use of dyadic behaviour at 1 month after an AMI explains 5% of the variation in partners' emotional well-being at 6 months after the event, after adjustment for partners' concurrent physical well-being and prior levels of emotional well-being, as well as duration of couples' relationships.* Patients have poorer emotional well-being at 6 months after an AMI if partners use dyadic behaviour infrequently at 1 month after the event.* Partners have poorer emotional well-being at 6 months after an AMI if they are not satisfied/unhappy with the functioning of their relationships at 1 month after the event.  Adjusted exploratory analyses, undertaken to determine the extent to which dyadic discrepancies in perceptions of functioning or use of protective buffering behaviour, predict emotional well-being, show that patients who are less satisfied/unhappier with functioning than their partners at 1 month after an AMI have poor emotional wellbeing at 6 months after the event; patients who use the behaviour more frequently than their partners at 1 month after an AMI have poor emotional well-being at 6months after the event; and partners who are less satisfied/unhappier with functioning than their patients at 1 month after an AMI have poor emotional well-being at 6months after the event.  The evidence from the QUT-AMI Project supports the proposition that the interaction that occurs within a couple relationship, combined with individual characteristics of members of a dyad, influences the extent to which a heart attack impacts on couples' HRQOL.  It is argued that it is not enough to merely focus on implementing secondary prevention strategies with post-AMI patients.  Given that poor emotional well-being is known to predict adverse cardiac events, and premature mortality due to cardiac disease, it is recommended that a couple-focused intervention designed to meet specific needs should be implemented with at-risk couples as a public health strategy to improve not only the patients' quality of life but also that of his partner.  Further research is recommended to determine the extent to which such an intervention improves post-AMI couples' quality of life.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acute myocardial infarction</field><field name="subject">AMI</field><field name="subject">coronary heart disease</field><field name="subject">couple</field><field name="subject">couple relationships</field><field name="subject">dyad</field><field name="subject">dyadic behaviour</field><field name="subject">dyadic functioning</field><field name="subject">health-related quality of life</field><field name="subject">heart attack</field><field name="subject">prospective cohort study</field><field name="subject">protective buffering</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="subject">secondary prevention</field><field name="subject">SF-36.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15817/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tears of Glass A fin de siecle soap opera in three acts or a musical idea in process.</field><field name="creator">Svendsen, Mark</field><field name="description">This work takes as its central "conceit" a specific cultural site, namely a small town choir-- The Emu Park and District Amateur Choral Society Inc., which operates in Central Queensland, circa 1965.

A history of the regulation of midwifery practice in Queensland 1859-1912.</field><field name="creator">Davies, Rita Ann</field><field name="description">The role of midwife has been an integral part of the culture of childbirth in Queensland  throughout its history, but it is a role that has
 
 been modified and reshaped over time. This thesis explores the factors that underpinned a crucial aspect of that modification and reshaping. Specifically, the thesis examines the factors that contributed to the statutory regulation of midwives that began in 1912 and argues that it was that event that etched the development of midwifery practice for the
 
 remainder of the twentieth century.
 
 
 
 In 1859, when Queensland seceded from New South Wales, childbirth was very much a private event that took place predominantly in the home attended by a woman who acted as midwife. In the fifty-threeyears that followed, childbirth became a medical event that was the subject of scrutiny by the medical profession and the state. The thesis argues that, the year 1912 marks the point at which the practice of midwifery by midwives in Queensland began a transition from lay practice in the home to qualified status in the hospital.
 
 In 1912, through the combined efforts of the medical profession, senior nurses and the state, midwives in Queensland were brought under
 
 the jurisdiction of the Nurses' Registration Board as "midwifery nurses".
 
 
 
 The Nurses' Registration Board was established as part of the Health Act Amendment Act of 1911. The inclusion of midwives within a regulatory
 
 authority for nurses represented the beginning of the end of midwifery  practice as a discrete occupational role and marked its redefinition as a nursing specialty. It was a redefinition that suited the three major stakeholders.
 
 The medical profession perceived lay midwives to be a disjointed and uncoordinated body of women whose practice contributed to needless loss of life in childbirth. Further, lay midwives inhibited the generalist medical practitioners' access to family practice. Trained nurses
 
 looked upon midwifery as an extension of nursing and one which offered them an area in which they might specialise in order to enhance their
 
 occupational status and career prospects. The state was keen to improve birth rates and to reduce infant mortality. It was prepared to accept that the regulation of midwives under the auspices of nursing was a reasonable and proper strategy and one that might assist it to meet its
 
 objectives. It was these separate, but complementary, agendas that prompted the medical profession and the state to debate the culture of
 
 childbirth, to examine the role of midwives within it, and to support the amalgamation of nursing and midwifery practice.
 
 
 
 This thesis argues that the medical profession was the most active and persistent protagonist in the moves to limit the scope of midwives and
 
 to claim midwifery practice as a medical specialty. Through a campaign to defame midwives and to reduce their credibility as birth attendants, the medical profession enlisted the help of senior nurses and the state in
 
 order to redefine midwifery practice as a nursing role and to cultivate the notion of the midwife as a subordinate to the medical practitioner.
 
 
 
 While this thesis contests the intervention of the medical profession in the reproductive lives of women and the occupational territory of
 
 midwives, it concedes that there was a need to initiate change. Drawing on evidence submitted at Inquests into deaths associated with childbirth, the thesis illuminates a childbirth culture that was characterised by anguish and suffering and it depicts the lay midwife as a further peril to an already hazardous event that helps to explain medical intervention in
 
 childbirth and, in part, to excuse it.
 
 The strategies developed by the medical profession and the state to bring about the occupational transition of midwives from lay to qualified were based upon a conceptual unity between the work of midwives and nurses. That conceptualisation was reinforced by a practical training  schedule that deployed midwives within the institution of the lying-in hospital in order to receive the formal instruction that underpinned their entitlement to inclusion on the Register of Midwifery Nurses held by the
 
 Nurses' Registration Board.
 
 
 
 The structure that was put in place in Queensland in 1912 to control and monitor the practice of midwives was consistent with the
 
 policies of other Australian states at that time. It was an arrangement that
 
 gained acceptance and strength over time so that by the end of the twentieth century, throughout Australia, the practice of midwifery by
 
 midwives was, generally, consequent upon prior qualification as a Registered Nurse. In Queensland, in the opening years of the twenty-first century, the role of midwife remains tied to that of the nurse but the balance of power has shifted from the medical profession to the nursing profession. At this time, with the exception of a small number of midwives
 
 who have acquired their qualification in midwifery from an overseas country that recognises midwifery practice as a discipline independent of nursing, the vast majority of midwives practising in Queensland do so on
 
 the basis of their registration as a nurse.
 
 
 
 Methodology This thesis explores the factors that influenced the decision to regulate midwifery practice in Queensland in 1912 and the means by which that regulation was achieved. The historical approach underpins this research. The historical approach is an inductive process that is an appropriate method to employ for several reasons. First, it assists in identifying the origins of midwifery as a social role performed by women. Second, it presents a systematic way of analysing the evidence concerning the development of the midwifery role and the
 
 status of the midwife in society.
 
 Third, it highlights the political, social and economic influences which have impacted on midwifery in the past and which have had a
 
 bearing on subsequent midwifery practice in Queensland. Fourth, the historical approach exposes important chronological elements
 
 pertaining to the research question. Finally, it assists the exposure of themes in the sources that demonstrate the behaviour of key individuals
 
 and governing authorities and their connection to the transition of midwifery from lay to qualified. Consequently, through analysing the
 
 sources and collating the emerging evidence, a cogent account of interpretations of midwifery history in Queensland may be constructed.
 
 Data collection and analysis The data collection began with secondary source material in the
 
 formative stages of the research and this provided direction for the primary sources that were later accessed. The primary source material
 
 that is employed includes testimonies submitted at Inquests into maternal and neonatal deaths; parliamentary records; legislation,
 
 government gazettes, and medical journals. The data has been analysed through  an inductive process and its presentation has
 
 combined exploration and narration to produce an accurate and plausible account. The story that unfolds is complex and confusing. Its
 
 primary focus lies in ascertaining why and how midwifery practice was regulated in Queensland. The thesis therefore explores the factors that
 
 influenced the decision to regulate midwifery practice in Queensland in 1912 and the means by which that regulation was achieved.
 
 
 
 Limitations of the study The limitations of the study relate to the documentary evidence
 
 and to the cultural group that form the basis of the study. It is acknowledged that historical accounts rely upon the integrity of the
 
 historian to select and interpret the data in a fair and plausible manner. In the case of this thesis, one of its limitations is that midwives did not speak for themselves but were, instead, spoken for by medical practitioners and
 
 parliamentarians. As a consequence, the coronial and magisterial testimonies that are employed constitute a limitation in that while they
 
 reveal the ways in which lay midwifery occurred, they relate only to those childbirth events that resulted in death. Thus, they may be said to
 
 represent the minority of cases involving the lay midwife rather than to offer a broader and perhaps more balanced picture. 
 
 
 
 A second limitation is that the accounts are recorded by an official such as a member of the police or of the Coroner's Office and are
 
 sanctioned by the witness with a signature or, more often, a cross. It is therefore possible that the recorder has guided these accounts and that they are not the spontaneous evidence of the witness. Those witnesses and the culture they represent are drawn predominantly from non-
 
 Indigenous working class. Thus, a third limitation is that the principal ethnic group featured in this thesis has been women of European descent who were born in Queensland or other parts of Australia. This focus has
 
 originated from the data itself and has not been contrived. However, it does impose a restriction to the scope of the study.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deaths in children</field><field name="subject">early twentieth century</field><field name="subject">infant death</field><field name="subject">lay midwives</field><field name="subject">lying-in institutions</field><field name="subject">medical dominance in childbirth</field><field name="subject">midwifery history</field><field name="subject">midwifery regulation</field><field name="subject">midwifery nursing medical legislation</field><field name="subject">nineteenth century</field><field name="subject">nursing history</field><field name="subject">population decline</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">The ascendancy  of the medical profession in childbirth</field><field name="subject">The emergence of obstetrics as a medical discipline</field><field name="subject">the language of obstetrics</field><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15819/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choreographing newmedia dance through the creation of the dance project,Ada.</field><field name="creator">Neville, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">As a choreographer working with new media technologies, I recognised a need to develop choreography informed by the digital age.

A mixed-methods (i.e. questionnaires, interviews and documentary evidence), single case study approach involving a series of three studies, was utilised, involving employees and ex-employees from the Queensland University of Technology.  Using questionnaire data (N = 283), Study One explored the predictive value of seven structural (age of youngest child, education, childcare costs, wages, partner's income, number of children and social security payments) and four attitudinal (attitudes towards working mothers, sex-role attitudes, attitudes towards exclusive maternal care and career salience) factors, in a hierarchical logistic regression model using full-time / part-time work status as the dependent variable. Associations between these factors and hours worked, were also tested for a sub-sample of women with under school aged children (N = 112).  Results showed that the factors leading to greater LFP for both samples were having older children, less access to social security payments and more liberal attitudes towards working mothers.  Lower levels of partner's income also predicted full-time status for the larger sample and more liberal attitudes towards exclusive maternal care was associated with hours worked for women with under school aged children.  Study Two explored the way in which women with under school aged children describe the influences, benefits and trade-offs associated with their LFP decisions.  Analysis of data from interviews with a sub-sample of women from Study One, indicated four major categories of issues influenced LFP decisions and/or contributed to benefits or trade-offs following on from those decisions.  These categories included financial issues, personal independence, work-related issues and value of maternal care.  The salience of this issues varied across groups of at-home, part-time and full-time working mothers.  The most important consideration for at-home women was the emphasis on caring for their children themselves, as opposed to using familial or formal childcare.  Part-time women appeared to be the most satisfied with their work and parenting arrangements, because they could fulfil their roles as wives and mothers, but also benefit from spending autonomy and competence, by engaging in paid work.  Full-time women reported greater opportunities in the workplace than part-time women, although they experienced substantial ambivalence about their full-time status.  This conflict was ameliorated by the availability of flexible work and when partner's had reduced working hours.  Based on the salience of work-related factors reported in Study Two, Study Three explored the degree of consistency between the espoused values evident in organisational work-family policy documentation and women's reported experiences of these policies (N = 24).  For example, options such as flexible work arrangements and part-time work appear to promote values related to balance and integration of the work and family spheres.  However, interview data suggests women's experiences of part-time work were inconsistent with assumptions about job commitment and career progression.  The research extends the current understanding of the range of variables that influence maternal LFP and the processes by which LFP decisions are made.  The findings are interpreted in light of a number of existing theoretical perspectives, as well as suggesting a preliminary model of decision-making that could be tested in other groups of women in future studies.  The current research may also inform public policy on issues such as childcare and social security allowances and organisational human resource policy in terms of the implementation of work-family options.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maternal labour force participation</field><field name="subject">motherhood and work</field><field name="subject">work-family policy</field><field name="subject">part-time work</field><field name="subject">flexible work arrangements</field><field name="subject">espoused values</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15821/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the Effect of Suspended Bodies on Cavitation Bubbles near a Ridgid Boundary using a Boundary Integral Approach</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Peter Stanley</field><field name="description">Cavitation is the spontaneous vaporisation of a liquid to its gaseous state due to the local absolute pressure falling to the liquid's vapour pressure (Douglas, Gasiorek et al. 1995).  Cavitation is present in a wide range of mechanical systems ranging from ship screws to journal bearing.  Generally, cavitation is unavoidable and may cause considerable damage and efficiency losses to these systems. This thesis considers hydraulic systems specifically, and uses a modified Greens equation to develop a boundary integral method to simulate the effect that suspended solid bodies have on a single cavitation bubble.  Because of the limitations of accurately modelling cavitation bubbles beyond touchdown, results are only presented for cases up to touchdown.  The aim of the model is to draw insight into the reasons there is a measurable change in cavitation erosion rate with increasing oil-in-water emulsion percentage.  This principle was extended to include the effect that ingested particulates may have on cavitation in hydraulic machinery.  Two particular situations are modelled; the first consists of stationary rigid particles in varying proximity to a cavitation bubble near a rigid boundary.  The second case is similar; however the suspended particle is allowed to move under the influence of the pressure differential caused by the expanding/contracting cavitation bubble.  Numerous characteristics of the domain are considered, including domain pressures and fluid field motion, and individual boundary surface characteristics. The conclusion of the thesis is that solid bodies, either stationary or moving, have little effect on the cavity from an energy perspective.  Regardless of size or density, all energy transferred from the cavity to the solid body is returned indicating that there is no net change.  As this energy is ultimately responsible for the peak pressure experienced by the domain (and hence responsible for eroding the rigid boundary) as the cavity rebounds, it then serves that a cavity with a solid body will rebound at the same pressure as a cavity without a suspended body present.  If this is coupled with the observation that the cavity centroid at touchdown is largely unaffected by the presence of a suspension, then it would appear that the bubble near a solid would rebound at a very similar position as a cavity without a solid.  Consequently, the damage potential of a cavity is unaffected by a suspension. However, there is one point of contention as the profile of the re-entrant jet of the cavity is altered by the presence of a suspension.  As energy is radiated away from the cavity during penetration, it is possible that the shape of the jet may alter the rate that energy is radiated away during penetration.  However, this requires further research to be definitive.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boundary Element Method</field><field name="subject">Boundary Integral Method</field><field name="subject">Cavitation</field><field name="subject">Suspensions</field><field name="subject">Emulsions</field><field name="subject">Suspended Solids</field><field name="subject">Suspended Bodies</field><field name="subject">Contaminated Lubricants</field><field name="subject">Contaminated Hydraulic Fluids</field><field name="subject">Multi-Phase Flow</field><field name="subject">Computational Fluid Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15822/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Debt to Pleasure: Ecstasy + Knowledge + Performance</field><field name="creator">Macklin, Simon James-Ian</field><field name="description">This performance-as-research project documents, both through linguistic and non-linguistic texts, an investigation of the materiality of performative knowledges and analyses Music Theatre as an ecstatic and hyper-erotic creator of these knowledges.

I draw on Habermas's (1976, 1979, 1984 &amp; 1987) work to synthesise marxist and weberian ideas, and to derive a socio -cultural or cultural Marxist perspective on Capitalism. From this position I highlight the limitations of social action in theories of organisation and work. Moreover, I theoretically derive a model of work participation that acknowledges broader orientations to work. I interrogate that model of work participation in a study of four dominant forms of industrial organisation. Those organisations are SEQEB the South East Queensland Energy Board, Eagle Boy Pizzas in Queensland, the New South Sugar Milling Cooperative Ltd, and Budge -Ellis Staff Co-operative. Gathering data for this study involved both primary and secondary research. I used a comparative and longitudinal field research approach, unstructured interviews with an interview guide, and the collection of documents recommended by interviewees. I interviewed people working in the organisations and relevant government agencies. My research involved travel in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Ultimately, I produce a sociologically informed model for the establishment of 'willing and social' work participation. I conclude work participation exists within the context of capitalism, and social relations - either formally free or free; that work participation is directly influenced by rational configurations of the world of work comprising economic, political and social worldviews; and I argue the dominance of a worldview depends on whether the political action premises of buffering and shoring successfully neutralise competing worldviews; and whether the moral dictums or espoused values of work are prescribed or invoked and result in the exploitation or deployment of internal values. My thesis points in the direction of further work on co-operative forms of organisation and work and their commonweal ideologies. In particular, my findings demonstrate a crowding out of co-operative forms and ideologies, not only by capitalist forms but also by trade union collectives. The type of research I suggest has the potential to increase the legitimation of co-operative forms of organisation. Although, the Australian co-operative movement has many achievements there remains the problem of establishing a socially progressive rationality that makes practical or operational sense to people at work. The emancipator ideal of willing and social work participation is intended to epitomise the goals of the enlightenment project, and to lead in that direction.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Socio-cultural</field><field name="subject">rationalism</field><field name="subject">Capitalism</field><field name="subject">Expropriation</field><field name="subject">ownership</field><field name="subject">means of production</field><field name="subject">capitalist</field><field name="subject">Appropriation</field><field name="subject">status rights</field><field name="subject">economic advantage</field><field name="subject">Socially integrating principles</field><field name="subject">social orientations</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="subject">social order</field><field name="subject">Social relation</field><field name="subject">plurality</field><field name="subject">actors</field><field name="subject">Formallyfree</field><field name="subject">free social relations</field><field name="subject">restrictions</field><field name="subject">return of profit</field><field name="subject">individuals</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15824/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computers in Physics Instruction: Students' Interactions in a Constructivist Microcomputer-Based Laboratory</field><field name="creator">Russell, David William Alan</field><field name="description">This study aimed to increase understanding of students' interactions in a physics microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) specifically designed to be consistent with a constructivist theory of learning.

The teacher-researcher conducted the study with two of his Year 11 physics classes, comprising 15 students studying thermal physics and 29 students studying kinematics. Dyads of students worked at tasks using a predict-observe-explain (POE) format as part of the normal class program. Data included video and audio recordings during four 70-minute sessions for each class, students' written notes, semi-structured student interviews, and the teacher's reflections on each session. The study describes the actors and network relationships during task activities. An analysis of students' discourse identified features common to both domains of physics, while the findings about studentdisplay- teacher interactions are presented as a series of eight assertions.

Generally speaking, sensitive and responsive interactions between a mother and infant during the first year of life tend to be linked with improved child developmental outcomes (Barnard, 1996; Wyly, 1997).  Research has examined the influence of infant and family risk factors on parent-infant interaction.  Family risk factors including maternal depression can reduce a mother's sensitivity and responsiveness to her infant.  Evidence is mounting that mothers of preterm infants experience higher rates of depression than mothers of fullterm infants (e.g. Miles et al., 1999).  Although all infants may be vulnerable to the effects of maternal depression, the premature infant is at greater risk due to his/her decreased responsiveness and increased need for appropriate stimulation (Field, 1995). The purpose of this study was to examine maternal reports of depressive symptomatology and associated variables at two time points following a very preterm birth: at one-month postpartum (Phase 1); and 3 months after infant hospital discharge (Phase 2).  Observational data were collected at Phase 2 to explore whether maternal depressive symptoms and associated factors influenced maternal-infant interaction.  A two-phase prospective follow-up design involved surveying mothers of very premature infants (&amp;It; 32weeks) who were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).  Multiple measurements were collected at Phase 1 and Phase 2.  Mother-infant observational data were collected at Phase 2.  The subject population comprised all eligible mothers of very premature infants who were admitted to a 60 bed tertiary referral NICU of a major metropolitan hospital (n=62).    Mothers completed a survey at Phase 1 and Phase 2.  The questionnaire contained a number of validated instruments measuring depression, stress, social support and coping.  Maternal and infant demographic data were collated from the hospital records.  Observational data were collected and coded using the Nursing Child Assessment Feeding Scale (Barnard et al., 1989).  Results indicated that 40% of women reported clinically significant depressive symptomatology at one month postpartum.  High maternal stress and low maternal education and support from nursing staff were major factors explaining depression scores.  At Phase 2, 17% of women continued to report clinically significant depressive symptomatology.  Depression at Phase 1 and maternal stress at Phase 2 were important factors explaining  Phase 2 depression scores.  An exploratory analysis of the relationship between mother-infant interaction and Phase 1 and Phase 2 variables revealed that the mothers' coping strategies, both in hospital and at home, were important factors in explaining mother-infant interaction.  The results support previous findings that many women suffer stress and depressive symptoms after very premature birth.  The results indicate that maternal depression, at one month postnatally, can be predictive of maternal depression at three months after infant hospital discharge and that very premature infants are less responsive interactive partners.  These findings highlight possible parenting difficulties particularly during the first year.   This study has contributed to family centered research by highlighting the importance of early postnatal experiences to the longer-term psychological health of mothers and to the mother-infant relationship.  Screening mothers of very premature infants for postpartum depression will enable early identification of symptoms and appropriate referral for treatment.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infant</field><field name="subject">premature</field><field name="subject">preterm</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">postpartum</field><field name="subject">postnatal</field><field name="subject">Maternal Stress</field><field name="subject">Mother-infant interaction</field><field name="subject">Mother child relations</field><field name="subject">Neonatal Intensive Care (NICU)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15826/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Description of the Relationship Between the Crisis Life Cycle and Mass Media Content</field><field name="creator">Howell, Gwyneth</field><field name="description">Crises are unpredictable events which impact on organisational issues such as viability, credibility and reputation. In recent years, few topics have generated more interest within the discipline of public relations. Today, crises are a prominent feature of the business environment, and every organisation has the potential to experience one. The manner in which mass media frame crises can alter an organisation's reputation, affect organisational profitability, and ultimately the survival of the organisation. This thesis explores the application of Fink's (1986) Crisis Life Cycle model to mass media content. Further, it recommends the implementation crisis public relations strategies that address each stage of the model. The study demonstrated the relevance and importance of the extension of Fink's (1986) Crisis Life Cycle theoretical model to understanding mass media content during a crisis. The extended model provides a model to better understand a crisis and its life cycle from a public relations perspective. Further this expanded model provides the framework for public relations professionals to identify and comprehend the dynamic and multidimensional set of relationships that occur during the Crisis Life Cycle in a rapidly changing and challenging operational environment.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crisis Life Cycle</field><field name="subject">Mass Media Content</field><field name="subject">Public Relations</field><field name="subject">Business Environment</field><field name="subject">Fink</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15827/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Affine Equivalent Boolean Functions for Cryptography</field><field name="creator">Fuller, Joanne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Boolean functions are an important area of study for cryptography. These functions, consisting merely of one's and zero's, are the heart of numerous cryptographic systems and their ability to provide secure communication. Boolean functions have application in a variety of such systems, including block ciphers, stream ciphers and hash functions. The continued study of Boolean functions for cryptography is therefore fundamental to the provision of secure communication in the future. This thesis presents an investigation into the analysis of Boolean functions and in particular, analysis of affine transformations with respect to both the design and application of Boolean functions for cryptography. Past research has often been limited by the difficulties arising from the magnitude of the search space. The research presented in this thesis will be shown to provide an important step towards overcoming such restrictions and hence forms the basis for a new analysis methodology. The new perspective allows a reduced view of the Boolean space in which all Boolean functions are grouped into connected equivalence classes so that only one function from each class need be established. This approach is a significant development in Boolean function research with many applications, including class distinguishing, class structures, self mapping analysis and finite field based s-box analysis. The thesis will begin with a brief overview of Boolean function theory; including an introduction to the main theme of the research, namely the affine transformation. This will be followed by the presentation of a fundamental new theorem describing the connectivity that exists between equivalence classes. The theorem of connectivity will form the foundation for the remainder of the research presented in this thesis. A discussion of efficient algorithms for the manipulation of Boolean functions will then be presented. The ability of Boolean function research to achieve new levels of analysis and understanding is centered on the availability of computer based programs that can perform various manipulations. The development and optimisation of efficient algorithms specifically for execution on a computer will be shown to have a considerable advantage compared to those constructed using a more traditional approach to algorithm optimisation. The theorem of connectivety will be shown to be fundamental in the provision many avenues of new analysis and application. These applications include the first non-exhaustive test for determining equivalent Boolean functions, a visual representation of the connected equivalence class structure to aid in the understanding of the Boolean space and a self mapping constant that enables enumeration of the functions in each equivalence class. A detailed survey of the classes with six inputs is also presented, providing valuable insight into their range and structure. This theme is then continued in the application Boolean function construction. Two important new methodologies are presented; the first to yield bent functions and the second to yield the best currently known balanced functions of eight inputs with respect to nonlinearity. The implementation of these constructions is extremely efficient. The first construction yields bent functions of a variety of algebraic order and inputs sizes. The second construction provides better results than previously proposed heuristic techniques. Each construction is then analysed with respect to its ability to produce functions from a variety of equivalence classes. Finally, in a further application of affine equivalence analysis, the impact to both s-box design and construction will be considered. The effect of linear redundancy in finite field based s-boxes will be examined and in particular it will be shown that the AES s-box possesses complete linear redundancy. The effect of such analysis will be discussed and an alternative construction to s-box design that ensures removal of all linear redundancy will be presented in addition to the best known example of such an s-box.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boolean functions</field><field name="subject">affine transformation</field><field name="subject">equivalence class</field><field name="subject">local connectivity</field><field name="subject">nonlinearity</field><field name="subject">algebraic order</field><field name="subject">autocorrelation</field><field name="subject">S-boxes</field><field name="subject">Advanced Encryption Standard</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15828/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Future of Community Broadcasting: Civil Society and Communications Policy</field><field name="creator">Rennie, Elinor Mary</field><field name="description">Will community television one day be lamented in the same way as the Glenn Valley Bridge Club in Pennsylvania, where no one remains 'who can tell us precisely when or why the group broke up' (Putnam, 2000: 15)? Robert Putnam's bestseller Bowling Alone proposed that people 'need to reconnect with one another' and rebuild their communities for the good of society. Although he may not have succeeded in instigating a revival of lawn bowls and bridge, Putnam did spark a debate about the meaning of "community" today and its role in bringing about positive social change. At a time when the communications landscape is set to transform with the introduction of digital broadcasting technology, this thesis looks at the status of community broadcasting and its role within civil society. Taking Australia's community television sector as its starting point, it aims to define the pressures, public philosophies and policy decisions that make community broadcasting what it is. This thesis is structured thematically and geographically. The introductory chapters establish the research question in relation to Australia's community broadcasting sector. As well as tracing the intellectual path of community media studies, it sets out to locate community broadcasting within broader intellectual debates around notions of community, governance and the media. These are brought back to the "on-the-ground" reality throughout the thesis by means of policy analysis, interviews and anecdotal evidence. Chapters Three to Five map out the themes of access, the public interest and development by reference to community broadcasting in different regions. In North America I explore notions of free speech and first-come-first served models of access. In Europe, notions of "quality", public service broadcasting and the difficult relationship that community broadcasting has with public interest values. Through the Third World and the Third Way I examine how community broadcasting is implicated within development discourse and ideas of social change. The final chapter of the thesis moves into the virtual region of the Internet, looking at changing notions of access and the relevance of new communications rationales to the community broadcasting project. At the intersection of the various themes and models discussed throughout the thesis exists a strong rationale for the future of community broadcasting. Although new technologies may be interpreted as the beginning of the end of community broadcasting, I have argued that in fact it is an idea whose time has come.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">access</field><field name="subject">civil society</field><field name="subject">communitarianism</field><field name="subject">community broadcasting</field><field name="subject">communications policy</field><field name="subject">cultural policy</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">digital television</field><field name="subject">free speech</field><field name="subject">new media policies</field><field name="subject">non-commercialism</field><field name="subject">quality</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15829/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining the Judicial Juristiction in the Transnational Cyberspace</field><field name="creator">Raut, Bimal Kumar</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the traditional notion of jurisdiction in the light of Internet based activities which are inherently decentralised and ubiquitous. It is clear that the unique nature of the Internet has undermined the very foundation of the traditional notion of jurisdiction and the territorially based concepts of law and their application.   Which court should hear disputes arising out of Internet activities? On what grounds may a court assert or decline the jurisdiction? These are perplexing questions currently facing courts worldwide because of the trans-national nature of the Internet by which people can transcend borders readily and rapidly. One simple and straightforward factor confronting lawmakers is that while most laws have a territorial nexus, the Internet defies the notion of territoriality. Traditionally, judicial jurisdiction has been exercised on a number of bases, such as where the defendant resides, whether the defendant is present within the forum and whether the defendant has property in the forum or not.  These elements have been made largely irrelevant by the Internet. The Internet does not respect traditional boundaries and territories and it can even enable people to cross borders without any physical mobility. For instance, people are able to interact and even do business without revealing their identity. In the absence of any definite international law on Internet jurisdiction, how have the courts responded to this challenge? This thesis has examined the recent case law in Australia, United States of America and France. In examining the case authorities, the only conclusion that can be reached is that current court approaches are unworkable. This thesis has also examined some international proposals on the matter and found them to be deficient.    Now, the dilemma before us is this: on the one hand, the present court approaches on Internet jurisdiction are unworkable. On the other hand, there is no clear international guidance to govern the jurisdictional issue. I believe this book makes a small contribution towards this perplexing question by proposing a new transnational principle which could be achieved through a "trans-national judicial dialogue". Trans-national judicial dialogue can play a significant role in the creation, recognition, and enforcement of global norms.  There are a number of benefits to be gained if this approach is adopted in Internet jurisdiction cases.  Ideally, trans-national judicial dialogue would reduce the conflicts among courts and foster a consensual approach, thus providing a stable and predictable paradigm for the crucial issue of jurisdiction. Moreover, the parties involved in a case would be prevented from forum shopping in search of a forum with a greater likelihood of a favourable decision. Also, courts would not be able to decline jurisdiction merely because of foreign elements involved.  This may be the most appropriate global approach which is urgently required to address an increasingly global problem.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jurisdiction</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="subject">Court</field><field name="subject">trans-national</field><field name="subject">territoriality</field><field name="subject">international law</field><field name="subject">Internet Jurisdiction</field><field name="subject">case law</field><field name="subject">Trans-national judicial dialogue.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15830/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the Formation of Atmospheric Aerosol From Gaseous Organic Precursors</field><field name="creator">Lack, Daniel Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the investigation of three aspects of the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA): * Aerosol formation from mixed precursors * Global modelling of SOA formation * Modelling of dynamics of SOA formation based on empirical data collected from smog chamber experiments. The formation and growth processes of secondary organic aerosol were investigated using smog chamber experimentation and modelling techniques to gain a better understanding of the application of SOA yield values in modelling both SOA mass and dynamics. Published SOA yields from a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are used to model SOA mass on a local, regional or global scale, based on the assumption that the SOA yield of a mixture is the sum of the yields of the components. Experimental investigations into SOA yield from mixtures of VOC revealed potential uncertainties that would result from applying these yields to systems containing multiple VOCs. SOA formation in systems of toluene or m-xylene, compared with systems of these VOCs and propene, have shown that the introduction of propene (which has a zero SOA yield) to smog chamber photo-oxidations of toluene or m-xylene delays the formation and suppresses the overall yield of SOA from 450 to 90 &#181;g m-3 ppm-1 for the toluene system and from 325 to 125 &#181;g m-3 ppm-1 for the mvxylene system compared with systems of individual species without propene. The SOA partitioning yield data also indicates that partitioning of species to existing aerosol is suppressed in the mixed systems. Gas-phase modelling of these experiments showed that potential SOA species were expected to be formed sooner due to the increased system reactivity provided by propene. The observed delay in SOA nucleation, similar consumption rates of toluene and m-xylene in both the single and mixed systems and the gas-phase modelling results suggest that the addition of propene to hydrocarbon SOA systems modifies the gas-phase chemistry leading to the formation of potential SOA species from toluene and m-xylene. This result calls into question the bulk and partitioning yield values that have been published for pure substances as well as the validity of applying individual VOC yields to VOC mixture. Application of SOA yields to the global scale provides estimates of annual global SOA formation, global contributions from various VOCs and regional SOA distributions. Two SOA modules, using bulk and partitioning yield methods, were added to a global atmospheric chemical transport model, MOZART-2. The bulk yield method, representing the maximum possible global SOA burden, gave an annual production of 24.5 Tg of SOA, which is slightly lower than previous estimates (30 - 270 Tg yr-1). The partitioning method, which gives a more realistic estimate of SOA formation, produced 15.3 Tg yr-1; the biogenic fraction (13.6 Tg yr-1) compares to a previous estimate of biogenic SOA of 18.5 Tg yr-1 and 2.5 to 44 Tg yr- 1 using the partitioning method. Anthropogenic SOA contributions of 1.1 Tg yr-1 from MOZART-2 compared to recent estimates of 0.05 -2.62 Tg yr-1. SOA production was found to be dependent on oxidant availability and VOC emissions in South America and Asia. The partitioning method produced significantly less SOA due to limited availability of OC. Thepartitioning method also produced a peak SOA concentration of 10 &#181;g m-3 over South America in September and showed that SOA is at maximum production for most of the year in Asia and Europe. The two SOA formation methods also provides data to analyse the restrictions to SOA formation in particular regions, based on the maximum amount of SOA able to form (bulk yield method) and the more realistic partitioning estimate from the same region. Limitations to SOA formation in a particular region can be attributed to deficiencies in OC availability or VOC oxidant concentrations. Comparisons to limited observational and modelled data suggest that the MOZART-2 SOA model provides a good representation of global averaged SOA. SOA mass concentrations, predicted by models such as MOZART-2, can be used in part to model the dynamics of an SOA population (e.g. size of particles, number concentrations etc.). Aerosol properties such as size and number concentration can then be used to estimate their effect on climate and health. The explicit representation of the processes that affect aerosol dynamics, such as nucleation, condensation, evaporation and coagulation can be complex and use significant computational resources. Simplification of the discrete coagulation equation and empirical coagulation coefficients for continuum and non-continuum regime diffusion kinetics provided a simplified method of coagulation capable of predicting the evolution of inert sodium chloride aerosol in chamber experiments. A variable coagulation coefficient (linked to the mean particle number concentration of each experiment) was developed. This method is an empirical surrogate for the standard coefficient corrections applied to Brownian based diffusion in the continuum regime to account for the different kinetic effects within the transition and free molecular diffusion regimes. This method removes the need for calculating individual coefficients for each particle interaction. Estimates of modeluncertainty show that within uncertainty limits the model provides a good representation of experimental data. Correlation and index of agreement (IOA) calculations revealed good statistical agreement between modelled and experimental. Some experiments showed degrees of coagulation under prediction using the variable coefficient technique. Investigations into the effect of aerosol type and size, temperature and humidity may be necessary to refine the variable coefficient calculation technique. The model showed little sensitivity to model time step and is capable of high resolution representation of the aerosol. Mass concentration is conserved within the model whereas some error due to numerical diffusion within the number concentrations results from the bin sectioning technique used. The simplicity of this sectioning method over other methods and the minimal effect of numerical diffusion establishes a simplified method of modelling relative to the high resolution of the aerosol distribution the model achieves. It is suggested that the efficiency improvements introduced by the approaches used in developing this model provide an efficient ultra-fine coagulation modelling for atmospheric models. A semi-empirical model for SOA dynamics (SPLAT) incorporating coagulation, nucleation, condensation and evaporation was developed. The aim of the model and the development process was to predict, with high resolution and minimal computational expense, the formation and growth of SOA given a SOA mass input as a function of time. The average size distribution profile from chamber experimental data was used as part of the nucleation module. This technique provided an alternative method of representing the particle distribution compared to those models that assume a single diameter of nucleated particle or a fixed log-normal mode for the entire evolution of SOA. All SPLAT simulations assume organic nucleation events within the experiments modelled, although it is stilluncertain whether they occur in the atmosphere. The modelled nucleation events have produced a single nucleation burst, a result of immediate domination of condensation as soon as nucleation occurs. This deficiency is likely to be a result of the assumption of free molecular diffusion for condensation. The rate of condensation, calculated at every time step, is based on the aerosol size distributed surface area and the particle-size-dependent saturation mass concentrations. The SPLAT coagulation module was a version of the model developed in Chapter 6. Comparisons between experimental and modelled data showed good agreement. These comparisons revealed the shortcomings in the nucleation module while a statistical analysis of the modelled and experimental data has shown SPLAT to be effective in modelling a range of SOA systems. The complexity introduced in modelling aerosol dynamics in high resolution is offset in SPLAT by efficiency improvements due to the insensitivity of the model to time step size and simplified methods of bin sectioning, nucleation, coagulation, condensation and evaporation. Published SOA yields can be applied to predict SOA mass at local, regional or global scales. Although previously unreported uncertainties in these yields have been shown to exist, the MOZART-2 global chemical transport model has shown that SOA mass concentration can be predicted with reasonable quality, considering the scale of the model and limited observational data. These global scale SOA mass predictions can be used purely for global burden and occurrence, or as the input for modelling the dynamics of an aerosol population, which is significant for estimating an aerosol population's effect on climate change and health. SOA mass concentrations from chamber experiments were used as input to a SOA dynamics model. This model (SPLAT) then predicted the evolution of particle number concentrations and size within these experiments based on this mass input. Application of the dynamics model to the output of the MOZART-2 model could then provide a comprehensive global scale SOA modelling package.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerosol Dynamics</field><field name="subject">Aerosol yield</field><field name="subject">Atmospheric Chemistry</field><field name="subject">Coagulation</field><field name="subject">Condensation</field><field name="subject">Empirical</field><field name="subject">Gas to Particle Partitioning</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">National Centre for Atmospheric Research</field><field name="subject">Nucleation</field><field name="subject">Propene</field><field name="subject">Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA)</field><field name="subject">Smog Chamber</field><field name="subject">Toluene</field><field name="subject">Volatile Organic Compound (VOC)</field><field name="subject">m-Xylene.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15831/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Doing serious work or just playing?" : computer games in subject English</field><field name="creator">McGrath, Donna Lynette</field><field name="description">The central focus of this study is to look at the legitimacy of using computer games for textual study in subject English and to understand the value that non-traditional forms of narrative text can have in enhancing student learning and enjoyment.

 Narrative computer games are appropriately placed within the realm of popular cultural texts, therefore, this study is also located within a cultural studies field of inquiry.  A range of theoretical lenses which are appropriate to this field, such as critical theory, poststructuralism, reader response theories and narratology, are drawn upon in order to provide different perspectives on knowledge, relationships of power, and elements of story.  These multiple perspectives are combined to construct a methodological framework for my research that brings a richness to data analysis.  In locating my study within this multi-dimensional methodological framework, it is possible to achieve a layering and interpretation of the many different responses to the binaries of &#8220;work&#8221; versus &#8220;play&#8221; inherent in my title.
 
 
 
 The study focuses on a junior secondary English class at a school in South-east Queensland.  The students undertook a curriculum unit which used a critical literacy framework to study the narratives and cultural identifications inherent in a number of computer games.  The participants&#8217; responses to &#8220;play&#8221; within the classroom forms one facet of the study; the depth of narrative experience enabled by computer games forms another facet; and the final facet examines the cultural responses to newer forms of literacies. 
 
 
 
 The study concludes that using narrative computer games as a form of text for study in subject English allows for an examination of new forms of literacies that are student-friendly.  A hybridised form of communication and pedagogy is also suggested.  Narrative computer games allow for pleasure and play in the classroom, albeit in a less traditional way, and a hybridised communication can allow students and teachers access to a dialogue that values the learning experiences associated with this textual medium.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Serious work</field><field name="subject">playing</field><field name="subject">computer games</field><field name="subject">subject english</field><field name="subject">textual study</field><field name="subject">non-traditional</field><field name="subject">narrative text</field><field name="subject">junior secondary english</field><field name="subject">pedagogy.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15832/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Culture of the Olympic Games from Australian Athletes' Perspectives</field><field name="creator">Schuler, Margaret Louise</field><field name="description">Specifically, this study is about the effects of culture, organisational culture and postmodernism on the Olympic Games and the perceptions of Australian Olympic athletes, both past and present and their understanding of the culture of the Olympic Games.  The focus of this research examines the culture of the Olympic Games and provides insights into the background of the Games from Australian athlete's perspective.  The study explores this theme further in order to understand those areas of culture which Australian athletes rarely get the opportunity to talk about and thereby offers the occasion to open new avenues for research into the culture of organisations, such as the International Olympic Committee.  Furthermore, the thesis probes into the culture of the Olympic Games using the theoretical structures of Organisational Culture and Postmodernism to provide a better understanding and knowledge base for the discipline.  Also, the research reports upon the athlete's perspectives in the light of the two previous theoretical structures.  In spite of these previous points, little is known regarding the cultural aspects of the Olympic Games and even less is known of the culture of the Olympic Games from the athletes' perspective.    Participants in an Olympic Games - athletes, officials, dignitaries, press, technicians and support personnel all experience the cultural mix of individuals at the Games first hand. However, it would certainly be of importance to understand how athletes communicate and relate to each other and how all participants within the Olympic Games organisation relate and communicate with each other.    However, there is a need to acknowledge that politics exists within the Olympic Games and that its existence should be brought out of the background and placed on the agenda so that political action within the Games can be avoided in order that they might function more effectively and at a higher standard.  A knowledge of culture and politics and the pitfalls and problems associated with change in the Olympic Games would support the building between individual athletes rather than allow conflict and competition to occur.  This implies that, if individuals can work together without having to consider politics, then the system will benefit.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">olympic games</field><field name="subject">Australian Athletes</field><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="subject">postmodernism</field><field name="subject">International Olympic Committee</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">competition.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15833/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parameters Selection for Optimising Time-Frequency Distributions and Measurements of Time-Frequency Characteristics of Nonstationary Signals</field><field name="creator">Sucic, Victor</field><field name="description">The quadratic class of time-frequency distributions (TFDs) forms a set of tools which allow to effectively extract important information from a nonstationary signal. To determine which TFD best represents the given signal, it is a common practice to visually compare different TFDs' time-frequency plots, and select as best the TFD with the most appealing plot. This visual comparison is not only subjective, but also difficult and unreliable especially when signal components are closely-spaced in the time-frequency plane. To objectively compare TFDs, a quantitative performance measure should be used. Several measures of concentration/complexity have been proposed in the literature. However, those measures by being derived with certain theoretical assumptions about TFDs are generally not suitable for the TFD selection problem encountered in practical applications. The non-existence of practically-valuable measures for TFDs' resolution comparison, and hence the non-existence of methodologies for the signal optimal TFD selection, has significantly limited the use of time-frequency tools in practice. In this thesis, by extending and complementing the concept of spectral resolution to the case of nonstationary signals, and by redefining the set of TFDs' properties desirable for practical applications, we define an objective measure to quantify the quality of TFDs. This local measure of TFDs' resolution performance combines all important signal time-varying parameters, along with TFDs' characteristics that influence their resolution. Methodologies for automatically selecting a TFD which best suits a given signal, including real-life signals, are also developed. The optimisation of the resolution performances of TFDs, by modifying their kernel filter parameters to enhance the TFDs' resolution capabilities, is an important prerequisite in satisfying any additional application-specific requirements by the TFDs. The resolution performance measure and the accompanying TFDs' comparison criteria allow to improve procedures for designing high-resolution quadratic TFDs for practical time-frequency analysis. The separable kernel TFDs, designed in this way, are shown to best resolve closely-spaced components for various classes of synthetic and real-life signals that we have analysed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Time-frequency distribution</field><field name="subject">Quadratic Class of time-frequency distributions</field><field name="subject">nonstationary signal</field><field name="subject">monocomponent signal</field><field name="subject">multicomponent signal</field><field name="subject">frequency modulated (FM) signal</field><field name="subject">linear FM signal</field><field name="subject">non-linear FM signal</field><field name="subject">kernel filter</field><field name="subject">separable kernel</field><field name="subject">Fourier transform</field><field name="subject">crossterms</field><field name="subject">autoterms</field><field name="subject">concentration</field><field name="subject">resolution</field><field name="subject">mainlobe amplitude</field><field name="subject">sidelobe amplitude</field><field name="subject">instantaneous frequency</field><field name="subject">instantaneous bandwidth</field><field name="subject">crossterms amplitude</field><field name="subject">comparison criteria</field><field name="subject">performance measure</field><field name="subject">parameter optimisation</field><field name="subject">optimal time-frequency distribution</field><field name="subject">design requirements</field><field name="subject">additive white Gaussian noise</field><field name="subject">real-life signal</field><field name="subject">Modified B distribution</field><field name="subject">Smoothed windowed Wigner-Ville distribution</field><field name="subject">separable kernel TFD.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15834/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Multicultural Policy and Television Drama in Comparative Contexts</field><field name="creator">May, Harvey Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis examines changes which have occurred since the late 1980s and early 1990s with respect to the representation of cultural diversity on Australian popular drama programming. The thesis finds that a significant number of  actors of diverse cultural and linguistic background have negotiated the television industry employment process to obtain acting roles in a lead capacity. The majority of these actors are from the second generation of immigrants, who increasingly make up a significant component of Australia's multicultural population. The way in which these actors are portrayed on-screen has also shifted from one of a 'performed' ethnicity, to an 'everyday' portrayal. The thesis develops an analysis which connects the development and broad political support for multicultural policy as expressed in the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia to the changes in both employment and representation practices in popular television programming in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The thesis addresses multicultural debates by arguing for a mainstreaming position. The thesis makes detailed comparison of cultural diversity and television in the jurisdictions of the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand to support the broad argument that cultural diversity policy measures produce observable outcomes in television programming.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Cultural Diversity</field><field name="subject">Television</field><field name="subject">Drama</field><field name="subject">Casting</field><field name="subject">Minorities</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">United Kingdom</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15835/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fault Lines: Queer Skinheads and Gay Male Subjectivity in the Film Praxis of Bruce LaBruce</field><field name="creator">Da Silva, Jose</field><field name="description">Fault Lines positions a theory of gay male subjectivity as it relates to the Queer skinhead and its dissemination in gay male pornography.

PND is a serious condition that affects up to 10%-15% of women (O'Hara &amp; Swain, 1996). Many previous studies have reported an improvement of depressive symptomatology following a pram walking intervention. However, no published research exists which assesses postnatal women who report experiencing PND. A randomised controlled trial was used, where pre-test data were compared to post-test effects. Two studies were conducted. In study 1 (n= 20) a multi-intervention group (exercise and social support) was compared to a control group who received no intervention. Study 2 (n= 19) was conducted 20 months later on a different group of women and involved a pram walking intervention group and a comparison social support group. Structured questionnaires assessing depressive symptomatology, general health and levels of social support were administered at pre-test phase, week 6 and 12. A sub-maximal fitness test was conducted the week before the program started and at week 12. The chief investigator was present at all sessions to guide the participants. Study 1 (S1): The multi-intervention group attended 3 pram walking sessions per week. After the exercise session the group met for refreshments in a local hall. The control group was only required to perform the fitness tests and answer the questionnaires. A 6-week alternative program of exercise and social support was offered to all the women at the completion of the intervention period. Study 2 (S2): The pram walking group met for 2 exercise sessions and were required to make up the third session independently. The comparison social support group met once per week for morning tea with the children. The samples for both studies were drawn from the Gold Coast region in Australia. Women of childbearing age who were experiencing depressive symptoms were recruited. For S1 their child had to be less than or equal to 12 months and for S2 the age cut off was increased to less than or equal to 18 months. The participants were screened to ensure that they did not have a medical condition that would prevent regular aerobic exercise and they were also excluded if they had a previous history of mental illness or could not speak English. Demographic data were obtained from each participant and details such as height, weight and age were collected for use in analysing fitness levels. The data for each study were collected across three time points (pre, week 6 and week 12) using widely tested instruments. Some additional questions relating to the participants experiences were collected at the completion of the study from the women allocated to the intervention groups. Data were also collected on fitness levels (pre and week 12) and the instrument was tested for its reliability. Both pram walking intervention groups were required to complete a weekly exercise diary. For each study, to test for the effect of the intervention over time, a two-way analysis of variance was conducted on the major outcome variables. Group (intervention versus control) was the between subject factor and time (pre-test, week 6, week 12) was the within subject factor or repeated measures factor. Due to the small sample size, further tests were conducted to check the assumptions of the statistical test to be used. The results showed that using Mauchly's Test, the Sphericity assumptions of repeated measures for ANOVA were met. Further, tests of homogeneity of variance assumptions also confirmed that this assumption was met. Data analysis was conducted using the software package SPSS for Windows Release 10.0. (Norusis, 2000). Overall, the findings from both S1 and S2 showed that the groups who received the pram walking intervention improved their depressive symptomatology and fitness levels when compared to those of the control (S1) and social support group (S2). Social support levels did not alter for either group from both studies. These results are encouraging and suggest that a pram walking program is an effective form of intervention for postnatal women experiencing depressive symptomatology.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Postnatal Depression</field><field name="subject">Social Support</field><field name="subject">Motherhood and Exercise</field><field name="subject">Interventions</field><field name="subject">Postnatal</field><field name="subject">Well-Being</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15837/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elliptic Curve Cryptography for Lightweight Applications.</field><field name="creator">Hitchcock, Yvonne Roslyn</field><field name="description">Elliptic curves were first proposed as a basis for public key cryptography in the mid 1980's. They provide public key cryptosystems based on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) , which is so called because of its similarity to the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) over the integers modulo a large prime. One benefit of elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECCs) is that they can use a much shorter key length than other public key cryptosystems to provide an equivalent level of security. For example, 160 bit ECCs are believed to provide about the same level of security as 1024 bit RSA. Also, the level of security provided by an ECC increases faster with key size than for integer based discrete logarithm (dl) or RSA cryptosystems. ECCs can also provide a faster implementation than RSA or dl systems, and use less bandwidth and power. These issues can be crucial in lightweight applications such as smart cards. In the last few years, ECCs have been included or proposed for inclusion in internationally recognized standards. Thus elliptic curve cryptography is set to become an integral part of lightweight applications in the immediate future. This thesis presents an analysis of several important issues for ECCs on lightweight devices. It begins with an introduction to elliptic curves and the algorithms required to implement an ECC. It then gives an analysis of the speed, code size and memory usage of various possible implementation options. Enough details are presented to enable an implementer to choose for implementation those algorithms which give the greatest speed whilst conforming to the code size and ram restrictions of a particular lightweight device. Recommendations are made for new functions to be included on coprocessors for lightweight devices to support ECC implementations Another issue of concern for implementers is the side-channel attacks that have recently been proposed. They obtain information about the cryptosystem by measuring side-channel information such as power consumption and processing time and the information is then used to break implementations that have not incorporated appropriate defences. A new method of defence to protect an implementation from the simple power analysis (spa) method of attack is presented in this thesis. It requires 44% fewer additions and 11% more doublings than the commonly recommended defence of performing a point addition in every loop of the binary scalar multiplication algorithm. The algorithm forms a contribution to the current range of possible spa defences which has a good speed but low memory usage. Another topic of paramount importance to ECCs for lightweight applications is whether the security of fixed curves is equivalent to that of random curves. Because of the inability of lightweight devices to generate secure random curves, fixed curves are used in such devices. These curves provide the additional advantage of requiring less bandwidth, code size and processing time. However, it is intuitively obvious that a large precomputation to aid in the breaking of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) can be made for a fixed curve which would be unavailable for a random curve. Therefore, it would appear that fixed curves are less secure than random curves, but quantifying the loss of security is much more difficult. The thesis performs an examination of fixed curve security taking this observation into account, and includes a definition of equivalent security and an analysis of a variation of Pollard's rho method where computations from solutions of previous ECDLPs can be used to solve subsequent ECDLPs on the same curve. A lower bound on the expected time to solve such ECDLPs using this method is presented, as well as an approximation of the expected time remaining to solve an ECDLP when a given size of precomputation is available. It is concluded that adding a total of 11 bits to the size of a fixed curve provides an equivalent level of security compared to random curves. The final part of the thesis deals with proofs of security of key exchange protocols in the Canetti-Krawczyk proof model. This model has been used since it offers the advantage of a modular proof with reusable components. Firstly a password-based authentication mechanism and its security proof are discussed, followed by an analysis of the use of the authentication mechanism in key exchange protocols. The Canetti-Krawczyk model is then used to examine secure tripartite (three party) key exchange protocols. Tripartite key exchange protocols are particularly suited to ECCs because of the availability of bilinear mappings on elliptic curves, which allow more efficient tripartite key exchange protocols.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elliptic curve (EC)</field><field name="subject">elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC)</field><field name="subject">discrete logarithm problem (DLP)</field><field name="subject">elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP)</field><field name="subject">speed</field><field name="subject">code size</field><field name="subject">memory usage</field><field name="subject">ram usage</field><field name="subject">fixed curve</field><field name="subject">random curve</field><field name="subject">elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)</field><field name="subject">Pollard's rho method</field><field name="subject">Shanks's baby-step giant-step method (BSGS)</field><field name="subject">Canetti-Krawczyk proof model</field><field name="subject">key exchange protocols</field><field name="subject">security proof</field><field name="subject">tripartite key exchange</field><field name="subject">pairings</field><field name="subject">password-based authentication</field><field name="subject">point addition</field><field name="subject">projective coordinates</field><field name="subject">Jacobian coordinates</field><field name="subject">Chudnovsky Jacobian coordinates</field><field name="subject">modified Jacobian coordinates</field><field name="subject">binary method</field><field name="subject">simultaneous multiple exponentiation</field><field name="subject">two-in-one scalar multiplication</field><field name="subject">coprocessor</field><field name="subject">smart card</field><field name="subject">lightweight device</field><field name="subject">simple power analysis (spa)</field><field name="subject">side channel attack</field><field name="subject">equivalent security.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15838/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a community based survey methodology for use with children with oral communication impairment</field><field name="creator">Keating, Diane Patrice</field><field name="description">BACKGROUND: Oral communication impairments (OCIs) are a common childhood problem with often long-term negative outcomes for both the child and society.  Despite the growing body of knowledge about the epidemiology of this problem, the shift from traditional treatment approaches to population based approaches to management has been slow.  One suggested reason for this is a lack of community based population data on such problems with which to plan services more broadly. AIM: The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the population knowledge of children with OCIs by developing and trialing a data collection method at a community level. LITERATURE REVIEW: One of the major issues in understanding OCIs from a population perspective is the disparate and often incongruent nature of epidemiological data reported in the literature.  Five areas of epidemiological research were reviewed in order to critically evaluate the existing evidence base and identify gaps for further research.  The five areas reviewed were: Prevalence (Regardless of the methodology used to collect prevalence data, OCIs have been described as a common childhood problem), Life Course (Children with OCIs often have ongoing communication problems and are at risk for poorer life outcomes in social, educational and occupational domains), Comorbidities (OCIs rarely occur in isolation and most children will have other developmental or health issues), Risk factors (There is no one easily definable cause of OCIs, however, genetic and environmental factors appear to increase the risk of OCI in the general population), and Service use (Only around half of children with recognised OCIs will access specialist intervention services).The review concluded that local community data measuring the 'burden', or impact, of the problem, comorbidities and service use in children with and without OCIs would assist in service planning.  Therefore a methodology would need to be developed which addressed these issues.A further review of the literature considered this methodology development with specific reference to the issues of study design, sampling and identification of OCIs.  The review concluded that a cross-sectional survey design of a community sample could provide the necessary data.  Parent and teacher report was suggested as a method for identifying OCIs in surveys, however, a tool needed to be developed and trialed to ensure this method was effective, valid and reliable. PILOT STUDY: A survey tool for parents was designed which included the Child Health Questionnaire (PF - 28), questions relating to socio-demographic features, health and development conditions, service use and specifically developed questions regarding OCIs.  The survey methodology was trialed in one school and one childcare centre.  The results of the study were reviewed and suggestions made for methodological changes before a community trial was carried out.  The reliability and validity of the questions designed to identify OCIs was assessed in a number of ways.  Test-retest reliability of parent completed questionnaires proved to be good.  Interrater reliability was examined by comparing parent and teacher responses.  Parents and teachers agreed on identification of OCI in over 75% of cases for each of the OCIs studied.  Criterion validity was assessed by comparing parent report to speech pathologist evaluation in a clinical sample and by comparing parent and teacher report to screening assessments of communication skills in a school sample.  Both parents and teachers tended to over-identify children, however, when parent and teacher reports were considered together the validity approached that of the 'gold standard'.  Construct validity was assessed by comparing reported OCIs with reports of other developmental conditions known to be commonly comorbid with OCIs.  Once again using both parent and teacher report proved to be the most valid method of identifying OCIs using the developed tool. COMMUNITY STUDY: A targeted community survey of 3 to 7 year old children was conducted in a regional centre in Queensland, Australia.  Children were sampled through schools and childcare centres.  Information letters were distributed to the parents of 898 eligible children.  Completed questionnaires were received for 397 children.  Teachers completed questionnaires on 375 children which was 42% of the population sampled.  Parents and teachers identified OCIs in 16% of the children.  However, only 3% of the population were rated by parents or teachers as having severe problems.  Over 70% of parents and teachers of children with a reported OCI rated the problem as having an impact on the child's life.  Ratings of impact were not related to parent/teacher ratings of severity.  Children with OCIs were reported to have significantly more health, developmental and behaviour problems than their peers.  Children with OCIs were rated lower by their parents on most aspects of the Child Health Questionnaire (PF-28).  In particular, parents reported impacts on their own time and family activities due to the child's problems.  No significant differences were found between children with and without reported OCIs on any of the socio-demographic variables studied.  Children with reported OCIs used more health and educational services than their peers.  Around 60% of children with reported OCIs had seen a speech pathologist, but many parents had also sought advice from a range of other health and educational professionals.  Those with two or more OCI conditions were more likely to have seen a professional, however socio-demographic variables did not generally predict service use.  Parents reported that the type of service they chose was most commonly influenced by advice from a doctor or teacher.  The limitations of this methodology for collecting this type of data are discussed.  However despite these limitations data were collected which has major implications for the provision of population based services for children with OCI. CONCLUSION: This thesis has contributed to the understanding of children with OCIs by researching the development of a methodology to study this problem in a defined community sample.  The information gained from the literature review and the community study were considered within two models of service provision.  The models encompass service delivery from individualised to more population based approaches to the management of OCIs in children.  From these models, specific suggestions for the community involved in the study were discussed.  This thesis, therefore, provided a survey methodology that is resource efficient in the collection of community data useful in suggesting improved services for children with oral communication impairments.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oral Communication Impairment</field><field name="subject">Speech and Language Impairment</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Survey</field><field name="subject">Community study</field><field name="subject">Developmental disabilities</field><field name="subject">Cross sectional study</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Parent concerns.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15839/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proximity-to-Separation Based Energy Function Control Strategy for Power System Stability</field><field name="creator">Chan, Teck-Wai</field><field name="description">The issue of angle instability has been widely discussed in the power engineering literature. Many control techniques have been proposed to provide the complementary synchronizing and damping torques through generators and/or network connected power apparatus such as FACTs, braking resistors and DC links. The synchronizing torque component keeps all generators in synchronism while damping torque reduces oscillations and returns the power system to its pre-fault operating condition. One of the main factors limiting the transfer capacity of the electrical transmission network is the separation of the power system at weak links which can be understood by analogy with a large spring-mass system. However, this weak-links related problem is not dealt with in existing control designs because it is non-trivial during transient period to determine credible weak links in a large power system which may consist of hundreds of strong and weak links. The difficulty of identifying weak links has limited the performance of existing controls when it comes to the synchronization of generators and damping of oscillations. Such circumstances also restrict the operation of power systems close to its transient stability limits. These considerations have led to the primary research question in this thesis, "To what extent can the synchronization of generators and damping of oscillations be maximized to fully extend the transient stability limits of power systems and to improve the transfer capacity of the network?" With the recent advances in power electronics technology, the extension of transfer capacity is becoming more readily achievable. Complementary to the use of power electronics technology to improve transfer capacity, this research develops an improved control strategy by examining the dynamics of the modes of separation associated with the strong and weak links of the reduced transmission network. The theoretical framework of the control strategy is based on Energy Decomposition and Unstable Equilibrium Points. This thesis recognizes that under extreme loadings of the transmission network containing strong and weak links, weak-links are most likely to dictate the transient stability limits of the power system. We conclude that in order to fully extend the transient stability limits of power system while maximizing the value of control resources, it is crucial for the control strategy to aim its control effort at the energy component that is most likely to cause a separation. The improvement in the synchronization amongst generators remains the most important step in the improvement of the transfer capacity of the power system network.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lyapunov</field><field name="subject">power system</field><field name="subject">stability</field><field name="subject">switching</field><field name="subject">energy function-based control</field><field name="subject">bang-bang control</field><field name="subject">saturation function</field><field name="subject">energy in phase portrait</field><field name="subject">partly stable region</field><field name="subject">energy weighting</field><field name="subject">cutset</field><field name="subject">energy decomposition</field><field name="subject">cutest energy</field><field name="subject">proximity-to-critical cutset energy</field><field name="subject">proximity-to-partly stable region</field><field name="subject">cutset energy-based control</field><field name="subject">quantified transient stability limits and transfer capacity.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15840/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multimedia: Perceptions and Use in Preservice Teacher Education</field><field name="creator">Tennent, Leanne Janene</field><field name="description">Across the period in which this research was conducted, there has been an increasing emphasis in government and university policies on the promotion of technology integration in higher education. This emphasis has also become evident in Commonwealth and State government policies relating to preservice teacher education because of the need to ensure that teachers enter the profession with the types of technological skills and competencies that can enhance teaching and learning.  The research reported in this thesis describes the experiences and perceptions of computer-based technologies from the perspective of academic staff and graduates from two preservice teacher education courses in a Queensland university. The research was conducted in two phases using a repeated cross-sectional longitudinal design. In Phase 1 of the research conducted in 1997, and in Phase 2 in 2002, questionnaires were used to gather data. In Phase 1 of the research, participants comprised 43 academic staff members involved in two preservice teacher education courses and 72 first or second year graduate teachers from these courses. Items in the academic staff and graduate teacher questionnaires elicited information on a range of issues related to the technologies including knowledge and confidence levels, acquisition of knowledge, current and future usage in teaching, advantages and disadvantages of teaching with the technologies, the importance of the technologies to higher and preservice education and the adequacy of preservice teacher education to prepare new teachers to use technologies. Graduate teachers were also questioned about barriers to their classroom use of technologies. Further questions for academic staff investigated the existence of factors that facilitate usage of technologies and the degree to which the presence or absence of these factors constituted barriers or incentives to technology use. A number of questions also explored attitudes surrounding the valuing of teaching, research and publishing.  Results from the first phase of research revealed that both academic staff and new teachers made little use of technologies in their teaching. The most salient barriers to academic staff technology use included lack of technical advice and support, time, and lack of evidence of improved student learning and interest. There was also a widely held perception among academic staff that teaching was not valued by their university and that, in particular, innovation in teaching deserved greater recognition. For graduate teachers, barriers to technology use included lack of computers and resources, lack of school funding, and lack of knowledge and training. In Phase 2 of the research, participants comprised 40 academic staff members and 123 graduate teachers from the same two preservice teacher education courses. Participants were again questioned about knowledge and confidence levels, acquisition of knowledge, current and future usage in teaching, and the adequacy of preservice teacher education to prepare new teachers to use technologies. In light of new research and building on findings from the first phase of data collection, several new questions were added. These questions related primarily to the nature and availability of training and how preservice teacher preparation in technology use could be improved.  Results from the second phase of research indicated that, among academic staff and graduate teachers, there had been considerable increases in knowledge and confidence levels in relation to the technologies, along with increased levels of usage. Both groups were also significantly more likely than their earlier counterparts to report that preservice teachers were adequately or well prepared in the use of technologies.   For graduate teachers, lack of equipment and resources were ongoing barriers to technology use. Training in technology use appeared to be less of an issue for graduate teachers than academic staff with most reporting access to, and satisfaction with, inservice training opportunities. Encouraging too, was the finding that these graduate teachers were significantly more likely than their 1997 counterparts to attribute their knowledge of the technologies to preservice teacher education.  While positive change in technology use was evident across this period, continued efforts to support and integrate technology in preservice teacher education remains important, as does support for the innovative use of technology to promote learning in schools.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer-based technologies</field><field name="subject">multimedia</field><field name="subject">flexible delivery</field><field name="subject">computer-assisted instruction (CAI)</field><field name="subject">the Internet</field><field name="subject">email</field><field name="subject">online teaching</field><field name="subject">audiographics</field><field name="subject">video conferencing</field><field name="subject">teleconferencing</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">preservice teacher education.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15841/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kallikrein Gene Regulation in Hormone-Dependent Cancer Cell Lines</field><field name="creator">Myers, Stephen Anthony</field><field name="description">Hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), such as those of the prostate, ovary, breast and endometrium, share characteristics that indicate similar underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Through steroid hormone signalling on "down-stream" target genes, the growth, development and progression of HDCs are regulated. One such family of target genes, highly expressed in HDCs and regulated by steroid hormones, are the tissue kallikreins (KLKs). The KLKs are a multigene family of serine proteases involved in physiological processes such as blood pressure regulation, inflammation, and tumour development and progression via the hydrolysis of specific substrates. Although the KLK gene family is clearly implicated in tumourigenesis, the precise roles played by these genes are largely unknown. Additionally, except for the androgen-responsive genes, KLK2 and KLK3, the mechanisms underlying their hormonal regulation in HDCs are yet to be identified. The initial focus of this thesis was to examine the regulation of the kallikreins, KLK1 and KLK4, by estradiol and progesterone in endometrial and breast cancer cell lines. From these studies, progesterone clearly regulated KLK4 expression in T47D cells and therefore, the focus of the remaining studies was to further examine this regulation at the transcriptional level. An overview of the results obtained is detailed below. Human K1 and hK4 protein levels were increased by 10 nmol/L estradiol benzoate, progesterone, or a combination of the two, over 48 hours in the endometrial cancer cell line, KLE. However, these same treatments resulted in no change in KLK1 gene or hK1 protein levels in the endometrial cancer cell lines, HEC1A or HEC1B (only hK1 analysed). Progesterone treatment (0-100 nmol/L) over 24 hours resulted in a clear increase in KLK4 mRNA at the 10 nmol/L dose in the breast cancer cell line, T47D. Additionally, treatment of T47D cells with 10 nmol/L progesterone over 0-48 hr, resulted in the rapid expression of the hK4 protein at 2 hr which was sustained for 24 hr. Further analysis of this latter progesterone regulation with the antiprogesterone, RU486, over 24 hours, resulted in an observable decrease in hK4 levels at 1 &#181;mol/L RU486. Although the estrogen and progesterone regulation of the hK1 protein was not further analysed, the data obtained for hK4 regulation in T47D cell lines, supported the premise that this gene was progesterone-responsive. The rapid expression of hK4 protein by progesterone at two hours suggests that KLK4 transcription is directly coupled to progesterone regulation, perhaps through progesterone receptor (PR) binding to progesterone-responsive regions within the KLK4 promoter or far "up-stream" regions. Thus, the following further studies were performed. To test this hypothesis, the transcription initiation site (TIS) and 5' flanking regions of the KLK4 gene in T47D cells were interrogated. Primer extension and 5' RACE identified the TIS 78 bp 5' of the putative ATG site for translation as identified by Korkmaz et al. (2001). This KLK4 gene transcript consists of only four exons, and thus excludes the pre/pro signal peptide. Although a TATA-box is not present within -25 to -30 bp 5' of the identified TIS, a number of consensus binding motifs for Sp1 and estrogen receptor half-sites were identified. It is possible that the Sp1 sites are involved in the basal levels of transcription for this gene. Additionally, a putative progesterone response element (PRE) was identified in the far "up-stream" regions of the KLK4 gene. Basal levels of transcription were observed within the KLK4 proximal promoter region when coupled to a luciferase reporter gene and transfected into T47D cell lines. Additionally, the KLK4 proximal promoter region did not induce the luciferase reporter gene expression when progesterone was added to the system, however, estradiol was inhibitory for luciferase gene expression. This suggests that the proximal promoter region of the KLK4 gene could contain functional EREs but not PREs. In keeping with this hypothesis, some ER half-sites were identified, but PR sites were not obvious within this region. The identified PRE in the far "up-stream" region of the KLK4 gene assembled the progesterone receptor in vitro, and in vivo, as assessed by electromobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (EMSAs and ChIPs), respectively. The binding of the PR to the KLK4 PRE was successfully competed out by a PR antibody and not by an androgen receptor antibody, and thus confirms the specificity of the KLK4 PRE-PR complex. Additionally, the PR was recruited and assembled onto and off the progesterone-responsive KLK4 region in a cyclic fashion. Thus, these data strongly suggest that the PR represents one of the core components of a transcription complex for the KLK4 gene, and presumably also contributes to the expression of this gene. Moreover, these data suggest a functional coordination between the PR and the KLK4 progesterone-responsive region in T47D cells, and thus, provide a model system to further study these events in vivo.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kallikreins (KLKs)</field><field name="subject">Kallikrein 1 and 4 genes (KLK1</field><field name="subject">KLK4)</field><field name="subject">Human Kallikrein 1 and 4 protein (hK1</field><field name="subject">hK4)</field><field name="subject">Hormonal Regulation</field><field name="subject">Estrogen</field><field name="subject">Progesterone</field><field name="subject">Progesterone Receptor (PR)</field><field name="subject">Promoter</field><field name="subject">Transcription Initiation Site (TIS)</field><field name="subject">Hormone Response Elements (HREs)</field><field name="subject">Progesterone Response Elements (PREs)</field><field name="subject">Reporter Gene Assays</field><field name="subject">Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)</field><field name="subject">Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15842/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethical Decision Making in Negotiation: A Sino-Australian Study of the Influence of Culture</field><field name="creator">Rivers, Cheryl Janet</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of three studies that extend understanding of ethical decision making in negotiation.  First, by comparing how Chinese and Australian negotiators think about contextual variables in an interpretive study, an extended model of ethical decision making in negotiation is offered.  This study suggested differences in how codes of ethics and perception of the other party were understood as well as a shared understanding of the influence of the legal environment across the two cultures.  Importance of organisational goals and personal and business reputation also emerged as important variables in negotiators' ethical decision making.  The next study began testing the extended model with an investigation of the interaction between culture and closeness of the relationship with the other party using the SINS scale (Robinson, Lewicki, &amp; Donahue, 2000).  It was found that Chinese negotiators generally rated ethically ambiguous negotiation tactics as more appropriate than Australians, and that Chinese differentiated more in their ratings of appropriateness according to the social context.  In the test for metric equivalence of the SINS scale, this study found that the existing approach of inductively deriving types of ethically ambiguous negotiation tactics based on ratings of perceived appropriateness is flawed since patterns of ratings are likely to vary across groups of negotiators.  In light of this, a new typology of ethically ambiguous negotiation tactics is offered based on an a priori identification of conceptually distinct types of tactics.  This new inventory of items represents the first step in the process of producing a cross-culturally generalisable scale of ethically ambiguous negotiation tactics.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Negotiation</field><field name="subject">Ethically ambiguous negotiation tactics</field><field name="subject">Ethical decision making</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Contextual variables</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15843/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International Market Entry: Determinants of Australian Exports and Direct Investment to the United Kingdom.</field><field name="creator">Robson, Sally Jane</field><field name="description">Australia and the UK are both prominent economies in the international arena and share a strong trade and investment relationship.  Interestingly, the UK while being a significant destination for Australian exports is an even more significant destination for Australian direct investment, a case anomalous to international trends.  Analysis of this case elicits the question as to what factors differentiate between the firms that export and those that FDI.  It is imperative to understand the differentiating factors between exports and direct investment as market entry decisions are decisive to the success of firms in international markets.  A number of theories of international market entry have developed over the last quarter century, the ownership, location, and internationalisation model (OLI) is used in this study.  The importance of the variables developed in this model are identified, and assessed as to their relevance to entry of Australian firms into the UK market through FDI or Exports.  Qualitative information is used to support initial quantitative profiling.  Results of the investigation indicate that while some variables were at times decisive, they were not predictive at all in other situations.  The full interaction of the variables in the model was therefore concluded to be essential to fully differentiate between exports and FDI in all cases.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Eclectic Paradigm</field><field name="subject">Exports</field><field name="subject">Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</field><field name="subject">Market Entry</field><field name="subject">Multinational Corporations</field><field name="subject">OLI Model</field><field name="subject">Transaction Cost Economics</field><field name="subject">United Kingdom</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15844/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of Digital Reinstatement Methods Within Private Cadastral Organisations</field><field name="creator">Steggall, Stephen William</field><field name="description">Cadastral reinstatement methods within Queensland involve the use of modern digital surveying techniques in combination with traditional non-digital methods of recording and reporting information.  This leads to the need to manually enter and re-enter data into a digital format at different stages of a survey.  The requirement to lodge survey information with government organisations in a non-digital survey plan format also forces a break in digital data flow throughout the cadastral surveying system, which can only be updated by changes in the lodgement regulations.    The private cadastral organisations are predominantly responsible for carrying out the cadastral surveys and the government agencies are primarily responsible for the examination, verification and administration of the cadastral data. These organisations will have no communication link for digital cadastral data until the introduction of digital data lodgement.  The digital system within the private cadastral surveying organisations can therefore be considered to be an independent system with consideration needed to be given to the future introduction of a digital lodgement system at some undefined time in the future.    Cadastral surveyors hold large amounts of digital information that is suitable for digital reinstatement systems.  This information, if appropriately archived and distributed, has the capacity to meet the needs of reinstatement systems including as an alternative source of digital information that will eventually be obtained from digital lodgement systems.  The existing technology and the private organisation structures are capable of supporting continuous digital data flow and automated systems.    This research proposes a process of development for private cadastral organisations to advance from traditional systems to continuous digital data flow and automated processes within their cadastral reinstatement systems.  The development process is linked to existing legislation and technology taking into consideration likely future directions.  The current legislative and technological environments within Queensland allow for development towards automated digital systems that will enhance most current cadastral reinstatement systems.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surveying</field><field name="subject">cadastral surveying</field><field name="subject">reinstatement</field><field name="subject">digital</field><field name="subject">digital lodgment</field><field name="subject">land information systems</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">total station</field><field name="subject">electronic data recorder</field><field name="subject">reinstatement calculations</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15845/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early Indicators of Executive Function and Attention in Preterm and Full-term Infants</field><field name="creator">Sun, Jing (Jenny)</field><field name="description">This study investigated executive function and sustained attention in preterm and full-term infants at 8 months after expected date of delivery and at 10-11 months chronological age. Executive function and sustained attention emerge in infancy and continues to develop throughout childhood. Executive function and sustained attention is believed to underlie some learning problems in children at school age. Although numerous studies have reported that the overall development of preterm infants is comparable to that of full-term infants at the same corrected age, it is unclear to what extent the development of specific cognitive abilities is affected by prematurity and/or other factors such as medical complications. As preterm infants have a high rate of learning difficulties, it is possible that factors associated with prematurity specifically affect the development of some regions of the brain associated with the regulation of executive function and sustained attention.    Thirty-seven preterm infants without identified disabilities, and 74 due date and gender matched healthy bull-term infants, participated in the present study. The preterm infants were all less that 32 weeks gestation and less that 1500 grams birth weight.    The current study aimed to examine the effects of maturation and length of exposure to extrauterine environmental stimuli on the development of executive function and sustained attention, by comparing the development of preterm infants with that of full-term infants at both the same corrected age and the same chronological age. All infants were therefore assessed on executive function and sustained attention tasks at 8 months after the expected date of delivery (when preterm infants were actually 10-11 months chronological age). The full-term infants in the study were then reassessed at an age equivalent to the chronological age of their matched preterm infants at the time of the first assessment.    The findings of the study showed that preterm infants performed significantly more poorly than full-term infants at both 8 months after the expected date of delivery and 10-11 months chronological age on all measures of executive function and sustained attention. However the difference between preterm and full-term infants at 8 months after expected date of delivery was much less that at 10-11 months chronological age. The results suggested that the effects of maturation are greater that the effects of exposure to extrauterine environmental stimuli on the development of executive function and sustained attention.    However, as the performance of the preterm infants was below that of the term infants at the same corrected age, it was necessary to consider whether other factors associated with preterm birth were contributing to this difference. Confounding factors including cognitive abilities and psychomotor skills on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, infant temperament, maternal education, family socioeconomic status and maternal psychological wellbeing were examined. Statistical analysis of the effects of these factors on the difference between preterm ad full-term infants found that only psychomotor sills significantly affected the differences between preterm and full-term infants of the same corrected age on executive function measures, although not on sustained attention measures. The differences between preterm and full-term infants of the same corrected age remained even when psychomotor skills were taken into consideration; therefore psychomotor skills were not sufficient to fully explain the differences between preterm and full-term infants in the performance of executive function.    Consequently, the preterm infants were divided into two subgroups on the basis of (a) low or high medical risk factors, (b) birth weight of less that 1000g versus 1000-1500g, and (c) gestation age of less that 28 weeks versus 28-32 weeks, in order to assess the effects of these variables on the performance of executive function and sustained attention. Medical risk, lower birth weight and lower gestation age were all found to adversely affect performance on executive function, but did not affect the performance on sustained attention tasks. It is argued that these factors may influence the development of specific areas of the brain which govern executive function, and that as the prefrontal regions are particularly immature they may be especially vulnerable to damage or disruption. The fact that these perinatal factors did not contribute to the difference between preterm and full-term infants' performance on sustained attention tasks. This suggests that the deficits of sustained attention in preterm infants may be associated with birth prematurity per se, and that additional complications may not have any further detrimental effect.    The three components of executive function (i.e., working memory, inhibition, and planning) did not correlate with each other when only infants with Bayley psychomotor ability scores greater that 85 were included, suggesting that the components of executive function may be discrete abilities which are governed by different parts of the prefrontal cortex. Sustained attention correlated with planning, supporting the suggestion that it may be a cognitive dimension which overlaps with executive function, depending upon the task requirement. Neither executive functio nor sustained attention correlated with the Bayley mental ability and Bayley psychomotor ability scores when infants with scores of less than 85 were excluded. This suggests that executive function and sustained attention measures are independent of general development.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Preterm Infants</field><field name="subject">Full-term Infants</field><field name="subject">Executive Function</field><field name="subject">Prefrontal Cortex</field><field name="subject">Working Memory</field><field name="subject">Inhibition</field><field name="subject">Planning</field><field name="subject">Sustained Attention</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15846/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ECC Video: An Active Second Error Control Approach for Error Resilience in Video Coding</field><field name="creator">Du, Bing Bing</field><field name="description">To support video communication over mobile environments has been one of the objectives of many engineers of telecommunication networks and it has become a basic requirement of a third generation of mobile communication systems.  This dissertation explores the possibility of optimizing the utilization of shared scarce radio channels for live video transmission over a GSM (Global System for Mobile telecommunications) network and realizing error resilient video communication in unfavorable channel conditions, especially in mobile radio channels.  The main contribution describes the adoption of a SEC (Second Error Correction) approach using ECC (Error Correction Coding) based on a Punctured Convolutional Coding scheme, to cope with residual errors at the application layer and enhance the error resilience of a compressed video bitstream.  The approach is developed further for improved performance in different circumstances, with some additional enhancements involving Intra Frame Relay and Interleaving, and the combination of the approach with Packetization. Simulation results of applying the various techniques to test video sequences Akiyo and Salesman are presented and analyzed for performance comparisons with conventional video coding standard.  The proposed approach shows consistent improvements under these conditions.  For instance, to cope with random residual errors, the simulation results show that when the residual BER (Bit Error Rate) reaches 10-4, the video output reconstructed from a video bitstream protected using the standard resynchronization approach is of unacceptable quality, while the proposed scheme can deliver a video output which is absolutely error free in a more efficient way.  When the residual BER reaches 10-3, the standard approach fails to deliver a recognizable video output, while the SEC scheme can still correct all the residual errors with modest bit rate increase.   In bursty residual error conditions, the proposed scheme also outperforms the resynchronization approach.  Future works to extend the scope and applicability of the research are suggested in the last chapter of the thesis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ECC video</field><field name="subject">active second error control</field><field name="subject">error resilience</field><field name="subject">video coding</field><field name="subject">video communication</field><field name="subject">mobile environments</field><field name="subject">GSM</field><field name="subject">movile radio channels</field><field name="subject">second error correction</field><field name="subject">error correction coding</field><field name="subject">punctured convolutional</field><field name="subject">bit error rate</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15847/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Design of Secure Sealed-Bid Auction</field><field name="creator">Peng, Kun</field><field name="description">Auctions have a long history and are an effective method to distributed resources.

Cryptology seems to be the only security solution for electronic sealed-bid auction. On the other hand, a practical electronic sealed-bid auction scheme must be efficient. So efficient application of cryptographic tools to electronic sealed-bid auction is the focus of this thesis. Firstly, security requirements of sealed-bid auctions are surveyed. The auction result must be determined correctly according to the submitted bids and the pre-defined auction rule. The bidders must compete with each other in a fair play and none of them can take advantage of others. The auction must be publicly verifiable, so that the auction result is acceptable by everyone. Usually, a losing bidder hopes to keep his bid secret, so the losing bids should be kept secret. In different applications, different auction rules may be applied. So, to avoid a tie, a large number of biddable prices must be accepted in some applications. Secondly, the currently known sealed-bid auction schemes are classified. In recent years, many sealed-bid auction schemes based on various cryptographic primitives have been proposed. Nearly all of them can be classified into five models. In the Model 1, each bid is known to the auctioneers, who can find the winning bid and winner very efficiently. Bid privacy is not implemented in Model 1. In Model 2 homomorphic bid opening is employed, so that the winning bid and winner can be found while the losing bids are kept secret. In Model 3 very strong bid privacy is achieved through a Dutch-style bid opening, which is highly inefficient. In Model 4, the link between the bids and bidders instead of confidentiality of the bids is kept secret. This kind of confidentiality is weaker than normal bid privacy and called relative bid privacy in this thesis. (Complete confidentiality of the bids in the end of the auction is called absolute bid privacy.) Implementation of relative bid privacy can be very efficient if an efficient anonymous channel can be constructed. Model 5 uses secure evaluation to open the bids and find the auction result and makes it possible to achieve absolute bid privacy efficiently. Three main cryptographic primitives are explored and employed to design new auction schemes in four auction models. The first tool is batch verification, which can improve computational efficiency in auction schemes. The second is mix network, which can be used to implement anonymous channels in Model 4 and Model 5. Two new efficient mix networks are designed and used in Model 2, Model 4 and Model 5. The third is secure evaluation, which is employed in two new auction schemes in Model 5 to achieve strong bid privacy efficiently. Other cryptographic primitives employed in the auction schemes include efficient 1-out-of-w oblivious transfer in Model 2 and key chain in Model 3. Five new auction schemes are proposed. The first scheme in Model 2 batch verifies bid validity to improve efficiency. The second scheme optimises the key chain used in Model 3 to obtain a more advanced auction scheme. The third scheme implements a concrete anonymous channel in Model 4 for the first time and achieves relative bid privacy and high efficiency convincingly. The last two employ new secure evaluation techniques to achieve absolute bid privacy and high efficiency. With these five new auction schemes, better solutions are achieved in various auction applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic Sealed-Bid Auction</field><field name="subject">Bid Privacy</field><field name="subject">Relative Bid Privacy</field><field name="subject">Batch Verification</field><field name="subject">Mix Network</field><field name="subject">Secure Evaluation</field><field name="subject">High Efficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15848/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aberrance, Agency and Social Constructions of Women Offenders</field><field name="creator">Quadrelli, Carol A.</field><field name="description">Traditionally offending women are framed through essentialist discourses of pathologisation and the family. Hence, good women are constructed as passive, compliant, vulnerable to victimisation, and nurturers. Offending women are constructed within criminal justice processes as disordered, physiologically and psychologically flawed. Censure or sympathy dispensed to women within the system is contingent on a number of key factors: the type of offence, the category of women involved, and the way in which women interact and negotiate the discourses used to construct their aberrance. 
 
 
 
 The focus of this thesis is offending women and how they are socially constructed through legal and penal discourses within the court and the prison. However this thesis rejects the essentialist framework which positions women as passive recipients of an omnipotent patriarchal criminal justice system and thus having no agency. Nor is this thesis about creating a new entity to encompass all offending women. Instead an anti- essentialist approach is adopted that allows the body, power, and women's agency to be theorised. This approach provides a more complex and detailed account of women's aberrance that acknowledges the diverse range of women, their experiences and negotiations of criminal justice processes. The combination of real women's lived experiences and an alternative theoretical framework provides a very different perspective in which to understand female offending.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aberrance</field><field name="subject">agency</field><field name="subject">essentialism</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">criminal justice system</field><field name="subject">female offenders</field><field name="subject">women&#146;s prisons</field><field name="subject">women&#146;s experiences of the criminal justice system</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15849/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Skeletal Muscle Interstitium and Blood pH at Rest and During Exercise in Humans</field><field name="creator">Street, Darrin</field><field name="description">The aims of this thesis were to:  1) develop a new method for the determination of interstitial pH at rest and during exercise in vivo, 2) systematically explore the effects of different ingestion regimes of 300 mg.kg-1 sodium citrate on blood and urine pH at rest, and 3) to combine the new interstitial pH technique with the findings of the second investigation in an attempt to provide a greater understanding of H+ movement between the extracellular compartments. The purpose of the first study was to develop a method for the continuous measurement of interstitial pH in vastus lateralis was successfully developed using microdialysis and 2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF).  To avoid the presence of an artificial alkalosis during exercise, it was necessary to add 25 mM HCO3- to the perfusate.  The outlet of the probe was cut less than 10 mm from the skin and connected to a stainless steel tube completing the circuit to a microflow-through cuvette (8 f&#221;l) within a fluorescence spectrophotometer.  This prevented the loss of carbon dioxide from the dialysate and any subsequent pH artefact.  Interstitial pH was collected from six subjects before, during and after five minutes of knee-extensor exercise at three intensities 30, 50, and 70 W.  Mean,,bSEM interstitial pH at rest was 7.38,,b0.02.  Exercise reduced interstitial pH in an almost linear fashion. The nadir value for interstitial pH at 30, 50 and 70 W exercise was 7.27, 7.16 and 7.04, respectively.  The lowest pH was obtained 1 min after exercise, irrespective of workload, after which the interstitial pH recovered in a nearly exponential manner.  The mean half time of interstitial recovery was 5.2 min.  The changes in interstitial pH exceeded the changes in venous blood pH.  This study demonstrated that interstitial pH can be measured using microdialysis and that it is continuously decreased during muscle activity.  The purpose of the second study was to establish an optimal ingestion regime for the ingestion of 300 mg.kg-1 of sodium citrate and maximise the alkalotic effect while minimising any side effects.  Increasing the effectiveness of alkali ingestion may lead to further increases in muscle performance.  Ingesting 300 mg.kg-1 sodium citrate at a rate of 300 mg.min-1 was identified as the optimal ingestion regime to maximise alkalosis at rest, which occurred 3.5 h post-ingestion.  This was determined by monitoring eight human subjects ingesting 300 mg.kg-1 sodium citrate at five different rates, control (no ingestant), bolus, 300, 600 and 900 mg.kg.min-1 on five days separated by at least 48 hours.  Sodium citrate was ingested in capsule form with water ad libitum, with the exception of bolus, which was combined with 400 ml less than 25 percent orange juice and consumed in less than 1 min.  Arterialised blood (mean 71.3,,b3.5 mmHg) acid-base and electrolyte status was assessed via the withdrawal of ~5 ml of blood every 30 min across an eight hour duration, placed on ice and analysed within five minutes.  No alkalotic difference was found between ingestion rates (mean 7.445,,b0.004, 7.438,,b0.004 and 7.442,,b0.004 for 300, 600 and 900 mg.min-1, respectively).  All experimental ingestion regimes were associated with elevations in [HCO3-] (29.6, 29.7, 29.8, 29.9 and 26.3 mmol.l-1 for bolus, 300, 600, 900 and control, respectively).  The 300 ingestion regime had the greatest impact on [H+], a 0.66 meq.l-1,,e10-8 change.  Bolus ingestion (3.93,,b0.08 mmol.l-1) of sodium citrate had no effect on control (4.06,,b0.08 mmol.l-1) blood [K+], however, 300 mg.min-1 decreased blood [K+] (p less than 0.05).  There was no effect of sodium citrate on blood [Cl-], but after 2.5 h blood [Cl-] was lower than pre-ingestion values (p less than0.05).  All ingestion rates of sodium citrate increased (p less than 0.05) urine pH above control.  This is the first study to investigate the effect of varying ingestion rates on acid-base status at rest in humans.  The results suggest that ingesting sodium citrate in small doses in quick succession induce a greater blood alkalosis than the commonly practised bolus protocol.  Using the interstitial pH technique described above and the optimal ingestion regime (300 mg.min-1) identified above, the final experiment was designed to assess the influence of sodium citrate ingestion on interstitial pH at both rest and during exercise.  Five subjects ingested 300 mg.kg-1 sodium citrate at 300 mg.min-1 again in capsule form with water ad libitum.  Prior to ingestion, each subject had a cannula placed into their cephalic vein and one microdialysis probe (CMA-60) inserted into their left thigh, orientated along the fibres of vastus lateralus.  This probe was used for the measurement of pH as described above.  At the end of this period, an exercise protocol required five subjects to perform light exercise (10 W) for 10 min, before starting an intense exercise period (~90-95% leg VO2peak) to exhaustion followed by a 15 min recovery period.  Dialysate and blood samples were collected across all periods.  Mean,,bSEM interstitial pH for placebo and alkalosis were 7.38,,b0.12 and 7.24,,b0.16, respectively.  Sodium citrate ingestion was not associated with an interstitial alkalosis.  An exercise induced acidosis was observed in the interstitium during placebo but not during alkalosis (p less than 0.05).  Mean,,bSEM venous pH were 7.362,,b0.003 and 7.398,,b0.003 for placebo and alkalosis, respectively.  Sodium citrate ingestion was not associated with a venous alkalosis.  Sodium citrate ingestion was associated with an increase in mean,,bSEM venous [HCO3-] (placebo 25.5,,b0.2, alkalosis 28.1,,b0.2).  This increase in the blood bicarbonate buffer system was not associated with an increase in time to exhaustion (placebo 352,,b71, alkalosis 415,,b171).  This was the first study to investigate the effects of sodium citrate ingestion on interstitial pH.  The results of this study demonstrated that an interstitial alkalosis does not ensue after alkali ingestion, however, it was associated with the lack of an exercise induced acidosis suggesting an improved pH regulation during exercise.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alkali ingestion rate</field><field name="subject">Alkalosis</field><field name="subject">Bicarbonate perfusate</field><field name="subject">Blood pH</field><field name="subject">Dialysate pH</field><field name="subject">Ergogenesis</field><field name="subject">Interstitial pH</field><field name="subject">Knee-extensor exercise</field><field name="subject">Microdialysis</field><field name="subject">pH</field><field name="subject">Proton</field><field name="subject">Skeletal muscle</field><field name="subject">Sodium citrate</field><field name="subject">Urine pH</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15850/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of Damping Contribution from Power System Controllers</field><field name="creator">Banejad, Mahdi</field><field name="description">With the growth of power system interconnections, the economic drivers encourage the electric companies to load the transmission lines near their limits, therefore it is critical to know those limits well. One important limiting issue is the damping of inter-area oscillation (IAO) between groups of synchronous machines. In this Ph.D. thesis, the contribution of power system components such as load and static var compensators (SVC) that affect the IAO of the power system, are analysed. The original contributions of this thesis are as follows: 1-Identification of eigenvalues and mode shapes of the IAO: In the first contribution of this thesis, the eigenvalues of the IAO are identified using a correlation based method. Then, the mode shape at each identified resonant frequency is determined to show how the synchronous generators swing against each other at the specific resonant frequencies. 2-Load modelling and load contribution to damping: The first part of this contribution lies in identification of the load model using cross-correlation and autocorrelation functions . The second aspect is the quantification of the load contribution to damping and sensitivity of system eigenvalues with respect to the load. 3- SVC contribution to damping: In this contribution the criteria for SVC controller redesign based on complete testing is developed. Then the effect of the SVC reactive power on the measured power is investigated. All of the contributions of this thesis are validated by simulation on test systems. In addition, there are some specific application of the developed methods to real data to find a.) the mode shape of the Australian electricity network, b.) the contribution of the Brisbane feeder load to damping and c.) the effect of the SVC reactive power of the Blackwall substations on the active power supplying Brisbane.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Power system eigenvalue</field><field name="subject">load modelling</field><field name="subject">resonant frequency</field><field name="subject">inter-machine oscillations</field><field name="subject">inter-area oscillations</field><field name="subject">cross-correlation</field><field name="subject">autocorrelation</field><field name="subject">damping contribution</field><field name="subject">sensitivity analysis</field><field name="subject">static var compensator</field><field name="subject">synchronous generator</field><field name="subject">induction motor</field><field name="subject">rotor angle.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15851/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomechanics of Dysfunction and Injury Management for the Cervical Spine</field><field name="creator">Sim, Darryl Frederick</field><field name="description">The research described in this thesis focuses on the biomechanics of cervical spine injury diagnosis and rehabilitation management. This research is particularly relevant to the diagnosis of minor neck injuries that typically arise from motor vehicle accidents and are classified as "whiplash injuries". The diagnosis and treatment of these chronic neck problems has been particularly difficult and frustrating and these difficulties prompted calls for the objective evaluation of the techniques and procedures used in the measurement and assessment of neck dysfunction. The biomechanical aspects of the clinical diagnosis of minor cervical spine injuries were investigated in this work by reconfiguring an existing detailed biomechanical model of the human neck to simulate injuries to particular structures, and to model abnormal muscle activation. The investigation focused on the range of motion assessment and the methods of testing and rehabilitating the function of the deep neck muscles because the model could be applied to provide further insight into these facets of neck injury diagnosis and management.  The de Jager detailed head-neck model, available as a research tool from TNO (The Netherlands), was chosen for this study because it incorporated sufficient anatomical detail, but the model required adaptation because it had been developed for impact and crash test dummy simulations. This adaptation significantly broadened the model's field of application to encompass the clinical domain.  The facets of the clinical diagnosis of neck dysfunction investigated in this research were range of motion and deep muscle control testing. Range of motion testing was simulated by applying a force to the head to generate the primary motions of flexion/extension, lateral flexion and axial twisting and parametric changes were made to particular structures to determine the effect on the head-neck movement. The main finding from this study of cervical range of motion testing was that while motion can be accurately measured in three dimensions, consideration of the three dimensional nature of the motion can add little to the clinical diagnosis of neck dysfunctions. Given the non-discriminatory nature of range of motion testing, the scientific collection and interpretation of the three dimensional motion patterns cannot be justified clinically. The de Jager head-neck model was then further adapted to model the cranio-cervical flexion test, which is used clinically to test the function of the deep muscle groups of the neck. This simulation provided confirmation of the efficacy of using a pressure bio-feedback unit to provide visual indication of the activation of the deep flexor muscles in the neck. However, investigation of the properties of the pressure bio-feedback unit identified significant differences in the stiffness of the bag for the different levels of inflation that must be accounted for if comparisons are to be made between subjects. Following the identification of the calibration anomalies associated with the pressure bio-feedback unit, the motion of the point of pressure of the head on the headrest and the force at this point of contact during the activation of the deep flexor muscle group were investigated as an alternative source of feedback. This output, however, was found to be subject specific, depending on the posterior shape of the skull that determined the point of contact during the head rolling action. Clinically, an important outcome of the alternative feedback assessment was that the prescribed action to target the deep flexor muscle group will feel different for each individual, ranging from a slide to a roll of the head on the headrest, and this must be accounted for when explaining the action and during rehabilitation management.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">cervical spine</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">injury</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">pressure bio-feedback</field><field name="subject">range of motion</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">whiplash</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15852/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time-Frequency Based Detection of Newborn EEG Seizure</field><field name="creator">Hassanpour, Hamid</field><field name="description">Neurological diseases in newborns are usually first revealed by seizures, which are characterised by a synchronous discharge of a large number of neurons. Failure to control seizures may lead to brain damage or even death.    The importance of this problem prompted many researchers to look for accurate automatic methods for seizure detection. Nonstationarity and multicomponent behaviour of newborn EEG signals made this task very challenging. The significant overlap in the characteristic of background and seizure activities in newborn EEG signals added to the difficulty of seizure detection.    This research uses time-frequency based methods for automatic seizure detection. Since time-frequency signal analysis methods use joint representation in both time and frequency domains, they proved to be very suitable for analysis and processing of nonstationary and multicomponent signals such as newborn EEG.    Before using any seizure detector, the EEG data is pre-processed in order to reduce the noise effects using a time-frequency based technique. The proposed method is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique applied to the matrix representing the time-frequency distribution (TFD) of the EEG signal. It has been shown that by appropriately filtering the singular vectors associated with the TFD, one can effectively enhance the desired information embedded in the signal.    Neonatal EEG seizures can have signatures in both low frequency (lower than 10 Hz) and high frequency (higher than 70 Hz) areas. The seizure detection techniques proposed in the literature concentrated on using either low frequency or high frequency signatures but not both simultaneously. These methods tend to miss the seizures that reveal themselves only in one of the two frequency areas. In this research, we propose a detection method that uses seizure features in both low and high frequency areas.    To detect EEG seizures using the low frequency signatures, an SVD-based technique is employed. The technique uses the estimated distribution function of the singular vectors associated with the time-frequency distribution of EEG epochs to discriminate between seizure and nonseizure patterns.    The high frequency signatures of seizures are mostly the result of spike events in the EEG signals. To detect these spike events, the signal is mapped into the TF domain. The high instantaneous energy of spikes is reflected as a localised energy in the high frequency area of the TF domain. Consequently, a spike can be seen as a ridge in this area of the TF domain. It has been shown that during seizure activity there is regularity in the distribution of the interspike intervals. This feature has been used as the basis for discriminating between seizure and nonseizure patterns.    The performance results obtained by applying the proposed methods on EEG signals extracted from a number of newborns show the superiority of these methods over the existing ones.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electroencephalogram</field><field name="subject">seizure</field><field name="subject">time-frequency signal processing</field><field name="subject">spike</field><field name="subject">detection</field><field name="subject">enhancement</field><field name="subject">singular value decomposition</field><field name="subject">singular vector</field><field name="subject">density function</field><field name="subject">histogram</field><field name="subject">Jensen function</field><field name="subject">filtering</field><field name="subject">seizure migration</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15853/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Information Requirements of Users of Australian Public Sector Financial Reports</field><field name="creator">Mack, Janet</field><field name="description">The emergence of new public management has been implicated in the changes that have occurred in the public sectors of western democracies. One outcome of these changes is that the public sector is expected to operate in a more commercial manner and that it be accountable not only for the money that it spends but also for the effectiveness with which it spends those funds. In response to these expectations, changes have occurred in both the accounting technologies and reporting mechanisms for the public sector.    The Treasuries and Departments of Finance for each jurisdiction in Australia set accounting and financial reporting policy for the public sector. However, since the establishment of the Public Sector Accounting Standards Board in 1983, the commonwealth and state governments have shown a willingness to adopt standards issued by the accounting profession. The adoption of three specific public sector accounting standards developed by the accounting profession in accordance with the conceptual framework, mean that a financial reporting model, based on the private sector 'decision-useful model', has been adopted in the Australian public sector. The 'decision-useful model' incorporates dependent users who are reliant on general purpose financial reports to make economic decisions. The decision to adopt this model for all public sector reporting entities, did not receive unanimous support. The complexities of the public sector formed the foundation for critics to question the applicability of this model to the public sector. In addition, critics argued that the model lacked empirical substantiation.  The purpose of this research is to determine the applicability of the 'decision-useful model' to the public sector by empirically identifying users of public sector general purpose financial reports and their information requirements. Prior empirical research has been piecemeal in terms of both scope and research method. As a result, it has not been cumulative. This research will refine and extend the work of previous studies in two ways. First, in terms of scope, it will encompass all public sector entity types and will address all three elements of the 'decision-useful model' - the identity of users, what information they use and their purposes for requiring information. Second, this research will adopt a method which directly accesses users across public sector entity types. As a consequence, an assessment is able to be made of the applicability of the 'decision-useful model' in general and its application to specific public sector entity types. The findings of this research indicate that the 'decision-useful model' is misspecified in the public sector and that there are significant differences among public sector entity types in terms of users and their information requirements. First, the classification of users as normatively determined is not exhaustive and includes a large representation of non-dependant users. Second, all users preferred performance information and narrative information was preferred over general purpose financial reports. Further, users considered that general purpose financial information was more useful for accountability purposes than for decision making. These results should be useful to policymakers and accounting standard setters in the future prescription of the contents of financial reports for public sector entities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public sector</field><field name="subject">financial reporting</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15854/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Hypothetical as an intervention tool for organisation communication, using the case study of Centrelink as the basis for the exploration</field><field name="creator">Berry, Michael James</field><field name="description">This study is an exploration of a change management intervention tool described here as the Hypothetical'. This tool is not described in organisation literature, but many of its functions and features can be found in theories relating to, for example, organisational communication, change management, leadership and team dynamics. The Hypothetical does, however, appear as a discussion forum in the popular media. In the 1980s and 1990s, the high profile television program, Hypotheticals, hosted by Geoffrey Robertson QC, dramatised decision making processes, and teased out some of the moral dilemmas inherent in social and political problems, utilising high profile panelists from the social, political and business elites. In the 1990s, the Hypothetical made a transition from the television screen to the management meeting room and the executive suite. The researcher of this study has similarly used the Hypothetical in his capacity as a communications consultant for a number of public and private client organisations. With this background, this study was undertaken to explore the Hypothetical and to identify those functions and features that define its appropriateness as an intervention for organisational communication and change. The findings from this study are founded on two aspects a review of relevant organisation literature, and data from the presentation of a specific Hypothetical intervention to the public organisation Centrelink Queensland. The Hypothetical tool, as identified in this study, is a one-off, 90 minute performance involving a facilitator, audience, and members of a panel who represent the organisation in which semi-fictitious storylines are meant to symbolise elements in the cultural life of the organisation. The study also identifies a Hypothetical process in which research methods that are applied, before and after the intervention performance, help to identify the functions and features of the intervention. The features of the Hypothetical, as an intervention are viewed through the lens of Goffman's 1959) classic theoretical framework of symbolic interactionism, where the organisation is conceptualised as 'theatre', and the motivations and actions of its members are interpreted through the symbolism of theatrical performance and interaction. The study also draws on symbolic convergence theory to explain what happens inside an organisation through the language, conflicts and shared cultural experiences of its members. The Centrelink Hypothetical in this study reflects aspects of the shared organisational culture, and presents its fictitious storylines in the context of dialogues between its panelists. The panelists are representatives of their organisation and are heard reflecting the values of that organisation's culture. Consequently, the analysis of text through the Hypothetical transcript the deciphering of shared narratives, mindsets, motivations and visions of the future, and so forth forms a significant aspect of the study for conceptualising Centrelink organisational culture, and for identifying how problems of communication and change have become embedded in that culture. More specifically, it is through the Centrelink Hypothetical that this study seeks to identify the functions of the Hypothetical and to determine how they may contribute solutions to Centrelink's management problems. The literature consulted for this study reveals that the Hypothetical is closely allied, as an intervention process, with the relatively new management practice of scenario planning. It scenario planning that attempts to build a generative learning capability within organisations a continuously looping process of deep learning that takes place within each organisation's unique strategic conversation. This study draws on scenario planing to identify similar performance features within the Hypothetical process stimulating the organisation to be responsive to, and to embrace, change; finding appropriate methods of communication; identifying and modifying mental models. This study also highlights a significant difference between the scenario planning process and the Hypothetical. Emerging literature in management psychology asserts the importance of the emotionally intelligent team, which demonstrates its social skills and empathy. However, the driving force behind scenario planning is 'the business idea', or the organisation's mental model and what drives it, and there is little or no attention paid to the importance of emotional capabilities in the scenario planning literature. Findings from the Centrelink case demonstrate that a significant dimension of the Hypothetical experience is the impact of symbolically convergent scripted roles and the related capacity to utilise emotional intelligence. Consequently, this study recommends that suitable emotional frameworks be employed throughout the Hypothetical process to help discern appropriate members' behaviours and suggest how the combination of such behaviours may be used to enhance the organisation's future generative learning process.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hypothetical</field><field name="subject">intervention tool</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">Centrelink</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">organisational communication</field><field name="subject">change management</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">team dynamics</field><field name="subject">public</field><field name="subject">symbolic interactionism</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">shared cultural experiences</field><field name="subject">scenario planning</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15855/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of nutrition intervention for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer in a fish oil supplement trial - does it make a difference?</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Wendy Louise</field><field name="description">Severe and progressive weight loss is a feature of pancreatic cancer but it has been unclear whether dietetic intervention can improve patient outcomes. This study is a post hoc analysis of the extensive data available from the multicentre BH80 Cancer Cachexia trial to examine how patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer respond to intensive dietetic intervention. The BH80 study compared an n-3 fatty acid enriched oral supplement with an isonitrogenous, isocaloric supplement given over an eight week period. Additional qualitative data was also collected and examined for the patients recruited by the Australian sites. The aims were to determine whether achieving weight stabilisation is an appropriate goal of nutrition intervention for people with unresectable pancreatic cancer; to identify determinants of weight stabilisation; and to describe nutrition-related features of patients recruited by the Australian sites, prior to and during intensive nutrition intervention. Data from 107 patients for whom weight change data over an eight week nutrition intervention period was available, was divided into weight losing (less than 1kg lost) and weight stable (less than or equal to 1 kg lost) patients. Group survival duration (Kaplan Meier log rank test) and global quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life) were compared. Variables including energy intake, BMI, presence of pain, nausea and vomiting, and appetite loss, C reactive protein and stage of disease were also compared to determine predictors of weight stability using logistic regression analysis. This study demonstrates that weight stabilisation is not only achievable for some patients in the short term, but it is also associated with improved outcomes. Those patients who were able to stabilise their weight after eight weeks of oral nutrition support lived longer from baseline and reported better quality of life than those who continued to lose weight. Weight stabilisation is therefore a reasonable and worthwhile goal for this patient group.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">carcinoma of the pancreas</field><field name="subject">pancreatic neoplasms</field><field name="subject">weight loss</field><field name="subject">cachexia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15856/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Improved Method to Identify Critical Processes</field><field name="creator">Huxley, Craig</field><field name="description">Nearly 70% of process improvement projects are failing to provide the expected benefits (Grant 2002).

This thesis aims to make explicit the selection of processes to improve and to provide the link between process objectives and organisational goals (Davenport 1993; Hammer and Champy 1993). Published literature, coupled with the experience of the research team, has resulted in the development of a targeting methodology for defining and ranking critical processes, and then selecting which of those critical processes to improve first. Although the research team believes that the methodology is applicable to many industries, the research was undertaken in the application hosting centre (AHC) and application service provision (ASP) industry. A focus group and follow on Delphi study was used to ensure that the processes and functional area focused upon was of importance to the participants of the research. This research project was funded by the Australian Research Council's Linkage projects and undertaken with support by REALTECH. The participants included the top three information systems outsourcing companies in Australia and another in the top ten of this industry. The study commenced with identifying critical processes in the ASP environment. This involved both a focus group session and a Delphi study. The Delphi study was followed by four action learning cycles using case studies (action, observe, reflect and revise). These action learning cycles using case studies have revealed that the methodology (which includes the steps to implement the methodology) meets the needs of organisations to identify and select 'critical' processes for improvement. It provides business and researchers with a logical and explicit method to reduce the 'squeaky wheel' and 'latest fad' approaches to process improvement projects. These prior approaches improve processes not necessarily critical for achieving organisational goals consuming limited resources for little gain. The targeting method makes the alignment of process objectives with goals by explicitly linking processes to organisational goals possible. The limitations of this research project are that it does not intend to verify the achievement of business benefit, document the change to an organisation due to its use of the targeting methodology or determine the long term benefits to an organisation using the targeting methodology. These questions might be answered in a longer and larger study as this project is limited to an eighteen month time frame. As for generalisability, the study has focused on the AHC and ASP industries, and the participants, while operating within this industry, are quite different. For the different phases of this project the participants come from in-house providers, multinational outsourcing providers, commercialised government providers, specialist niche product providers, and enterprise system suppliers.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business Process Improvement</field><field name="subject">Business Process Improvement Targeting</field><field name="subject">Balanced Scorecard</field><field name="subject">Delphi Study</field><field name="subject">Focus Group</field><field name="subject">Implementation</field><field name="subject">Multiple Case Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15857/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petrogenesis of I- and S-type Granites in the Cape River - Lolworth area, northeastern Queensland - Their contribution to an understanding of the Early Palaeozoic Geological History of  northeastern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Hutton, Laurie James</field><field name="description">The geological history of the Early Palaeozoic in eastern Australia is not known precisely. The eastern margin of the outcropping Precambrian Craton 'Tasman Line' is poorly understood. The Thomson Orogen, which underlies much of eastern Queensland, lies to the east of the Tasman Line. Basement to the Tasman Orogenic Zone is poorly understood, but knowledge of this basement is critical to our understanding to the processes that formed the eastern margin of the Precambrian craton.    The Lolworth-Ravenswood Province lies to the east of the Tasman Line in northeast Queensland. A study of basement terranes in the Lolworth-Ravenswood Province will therefore provide some insights as to the nature of crust beneath this area, and therefore to the basement to the Thomson Orogen.    The Fat Hen Creek Complex comprises para-authchthonous bodies of granitoid within middle to upper amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks. Data contained herein demonstrate that the composition and geochemistry of the granitoid are compatible with the generation of the granitoid by partial anatexis of the metamorphic rocks that are part of the Cape River Metamorphics. Temperature and pressure of anatexis is determined to be between 800-850OC and 5-9kb. Under these conditions, experimental data indicate that meta-pelite and meta-greywacke will produce between 5-10% melt coexisting with biotite, cordierite, garnet and plagioclase. The mineralogy of the granitoid bodies in the Fat Hen Creek Complex is consistent with partial anatexis of meta-greywacke at these temperatures and pressures. 5-10% melt is generally insufficient to allow efficient separation of melt and restite. The granitoids of the Fat Hen Creek Complex are interpreted as being a closed system with melt generated during high-grade metamorphism not separating from the residium.    U/Pb dating of zircon from the Fat Hen Creek Complex indicate two distinct periods of zircon growth. The older episode occurred during the Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician. A second episode is dated as Middle Ordovician. This younger age coincides with the onset of regional compression, and may be related to exhumation of a mid-crustal layer during thrusting.    The Lolworth Batholith is one of three granite batholiths in the Lolworth-Ravenswood Province. It comprises mainly muscovite-biotite granite, with smaller areas of hornblende-biotite granite to granodiorite. Sills and dykes of muscovite and garnet-muscovite leucogranite extensively intrude both of these types. The hornblende-biotite granite to granodiorite is metaluminous, with petrographic and geochemical characteristics similar to the adjacent Ravenswood Batholith. U-Pb SHRIMP ages also overlap with those from the Ravenswood Batholith. ENd(tc) values of ~-3 suggest a significant crustal contribution in the magma. Zircon populations determined using the SHRIMP suggest some inheritance from a Neoproterozoic source.    The two-mica granites make up over 80% of the batholith and show little variation throughout. Aluminium Saturation indices range dominantly from 1-1.1, in keeping with the muscovite-bearing nature of the granites. U-Pb ages are significantly younger than the hornblende-biotite granitoids. ENd(tc) is ~-10, suggesting a greater role for crustal material in these granites than in the hornblende-bearing varieties. Previously, these granites were interpreted as S-types, mainly on the basis of the presence of muscovite. Low Na/Ca and Na greater than K are both considered as indicators of source compositions and both are characteristic of a mafic igneous rather than a meta-sedimentary source. Anatexis of mafic igneous rocks at temperatures less than~1000OC are found experimentally to produce peraluminous melts similar to those which produced the two-mica granites.    The third major rock-type in the Lolworth Batholith is muscovite leucogranite, which occurs as sills and dykes intruding older granites and basement. The age of the leucogranite was not determined, but it has sharp contacts with the two-mica granite suggesting that the latter had cooled prior to intrusion of the former. The leucogranite is strongly peraluminous and is deemed to have been derived from anatexis of a supra-crustal (meta-sedimentary) source. The batholith is therefore deemed to comprise three different elements. The hornblende-biotite granitoids are the western extension of the adjacent Ravenswood Batholith. The two-mica granite and muscovite leucogranite are derived from different sources, but may be part of the same crustal anatexis event. During the Early Palaeozoic, the Lolworth-Ravenswood Province saw the intrusion of three granite batholiths into a basement of Late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian meta-sedimentary rocks. Also, Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician and Middle Ordovician high-grade metamorphism accompanied by partial anatexis is recorded at several sites across northeast Queensland. Although this metamorphism is restricted to these sites, they are widespread across the area suggestive of a widespread metamorphic event at these times. Similar metamorphism is recorded in the Arunta Inlier in Central Australia increasing the possible extent of this event.    The geochemistry, isotopic characteristics and zircon populations of granites in the Lolworth-Ravenswood Province are used to characterise their source rocks; and thus the basement to the Province. Precambrian basement is indicated to underlie the entire province. However, the source rocks for the eastern part of the Province (Ravenswood and into the Lolworth Batholiths) are different to source rocks for the western part of the Province. Georgetown-type crust extends eastwards from the outcropping area, extending under the western Lolworth-Ravenswood Province.    Late Mesoproterozoic rocks are recorded from the Cape River area adjacent to the Lolworth Batholith. They are also indicated as source-rocks for granites in the Ravenswood Batholith. Rocks of this age are characteristic of Grenvillian-age mobile belts in the United States. Their presence in north Qeensland has implications for the breakup of Rodinia, the Mesoproterozoic-age super continent that broke up during the Neoproterozoic.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regional geology</field><field name="subject">metamorphic geology</field><field name="subject">igneous geology</field><field name="subject">plutonic rocks</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">geochronology</field><field name="subject">isotopic geology</field><field name="subject">tectonics</field><field name="subject">Rodinia</field><field name="subject">Cape River Metamorphics</field><field name="subject">Lolworth Batholith</field><field name="subject">Ravenswood Batholith</field><field name="subject">Reedy Springs Batholith</field><field name="subject">Lolworth-Ravenswood Province</field><field name="subject">Georgetown Province</field><field name="subject">Fat Hen Creek Complex</field><field name="subject">Mesoproterozoic</field><field name="subject">Neoproterozoic</field><field name="subject">Cambrian</field><field name="subject">Ordovician</field><field name="subject">Silurian</field><field name="subject">Devonian</field><field name="subject">Cape River area</field><field name="subject">Pentland</field><field name="subject">SF5501</field><field name="subject">SF5502</field><field name="subject">7957</field><field name="subject">7956</field><field name="subject">8057</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15858/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of culture on instrumental music teaching: A Participant-Observation case study of Karnatic and Queensland Instrumental music teachers in context.</field><field name="creator">Barton, Georgina</field><field name="description">This thesis aimed to investigate the unique relationship that exists between music and  culture. More specifically, the purpose of the research was to determine to what extent culture is reflected in music teaching and learning. Understanding the effect that culture has on music knowledge transmission processes will assist in developing a framework for current music education practices to address the cultural diversity that is present in contemporary teaching and learning environments. An exploration of how music teachers teach, and how the cultural and social surrounds influence  these practices in various contexts provided important information in developing such a framework.      As such, a participant observation case study of ten music teachers who taught either the South Indian music tradition known as Karnatic music in Tamil Nadu, India, or Queensland, Australia, or who taught predominantly Western music in the  Queensland instrumental music context, was carried out. Through a comparative study of these teachers it was observed that there were more similarities than differences in the methods of teaching used by the teachers. Both aural/oral and written modes of communication were used in each context albeit at varying levels. It was also discovered that the surrounding cultural rules and rituals, that were  practised, significantly influenced the meaning attributed to the music teaching process for each of the teachers.    In the main, for teachers of Karnatic music a strong spiritual attachment to both the gods and goddesses associated with the Hindu religion and the teachers' own teacher/guru was evident. Conversely, in the Queensland instrumental music  teaching context, powerful economic forces affected the approach that these teachers  implemented. It is argued that with an awareness of these findings, music teaching and learning practices may more effectively meet the needs of students (a concern consistently raised in the literature) in the contemporary music education context.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music and culture</field><field name="subject">Karnatic music</field><field name="subject">music teachers</field><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="subject">context</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15859/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Open learning technology and the rural school:  The effects on classroom practice</field><field name="creator">Richardson, Lesley</field><field name="description">New developments in information and communications technologies have rapidly made  their way into the forefront of educational concerns. With exciting possibilities for  global communication, access to vast amounts of information and new approaches to teaching and learning practices, a small number of schools have integrated the technology into the school environment. However, the majority of schools are just feeling their way and this is particularly so in small rural schools which are removed from the high technology communications networks of the capital cities.    This study placed open learning technology into three rural schools where the teachers  had control over its use. Using qualitative multi-site case study techniques, the effect of  the technology on the planning and teaching strategies of the teachers, classroom  organisation and management, changes in teacher-student interactions, student motivation, curriculum enhancement and/or extension, the role of the teacher, and professional development issues was investigated.    It was found that the use of the technology had a positive effect on encouraging open  learning and student-centred approaches to lesson delivery. The Internet and e-mail  were accepted by the teachers and the wider school community and became part of  normal classroom activities. Staff development opportunities figured largely in the  outcomes of this study being revealed as a necessity for teacher adoption of the  innovation. The leadership role of the principals emerged as an important theoretical  construct influencing the implementation of the innovation. Finally, the introduction of  the technology was found to contribute to breaking down the barriers of distance that  are a characteristic of rural and isolated schools.  By providing teachers in rural schools with access to open learning technology that can  be readily integrated into teaching activities, it is likely that lasting change in attitude to  the legitimacy of information gained through the technology, and a greater level of  independent student classroom activity, will occur.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication and Information Technologies (CIT)</field><field name="subject">Open Learning Technology</field><field name="subject">Learning Environments (technology rich)</field><field name="subject">Open learning</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Rural Schools</field><field name="subject">Educational Change</field><field name="subject">Organisational Change</field><field name="subject">Educational Leadership.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15860/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling inground decay of wood poles for optimal maintenance decisions</field><field name="creator">Rahmin, Anisur</field><field name="description">Wood poles are popular and widely used in the Power Supply Industries in all over the world because of their high strength per unit weight, low installation and maintenance costs and excellent durability. Reliability of these components depends on a complex combination of age, usage, component durability, inspection, maintenance actions and environmental factors influencing decay and failure of components. Breakdown or failure of any one or more of these components can lead to outage and cause a huge  loss to any organisation. Therefore, it is extremely important to predict the next failure  to prevent it or reduce its effect by appropriate maintenance and contingency plans.      In Australia, more than 5.3 million wooden poles are in use. This represents an investment of around AU$ 12 billion with a replacement cost varying between AU$1500-2500 per pole. Well-planned inspection and maintenance strategies  considering the effect of environmental and human factors can extend the reliability  and safety of these components. Maintenance and sophisticated inspection is worthwhile if the additional costs are less than the savings from the reduced cost of failures.  Objectives of this research are to:  * Investigate decay patterns of timber components based on age and environmental  factors (e.g. clay composition) for power supply wood pole in the Queensland  region.  * Develop models for optimizing inspection schedules and Maintenance plans.  Deterioration of wood poles in Queensland is found mostly due to inground soil  condition. It is found that the moisture content, pH value (Acidity/ alkalinity), bulk  density, salinity and electrical conductivity have influence over the deterioration  process. Presence of Kaolin or Quartz has some indirect effect on the degradation  process. It allows more water to be trapped inside the soil that cause algae, moss and  mould to grow and attack the wood poles. On the other hand, by virtue of permeability, soils with high quartz content allows more water to infiltrate, preventing the growth of micro-organism. This research has increased fundamental understanding of inground wood decay  process, developed testing methods for soil factors and proposed integrated models for  performance improvement through optimal inspection, repair and replacement strategies considering durability, environmental and human factors in maintenance decisions. A computer program is also developed to analyse "what if" scenario for managerial decisions.    This research has enhanced knowledge on the wood decay process in diverse environmental conditions. The outcomes of this research are important, not only to users of timber components with ingrond decay but also to the wood industry in general (the housing sector, railways for wooden sleepers and other structural  applications such as timber bridges). Three refereed conference papers have already  come out of this research and two more papers for refereed journal publication are in  the process.    This research can be extended to develop models for:  * Qualitative as well as quantitative research database on lab/field wood decay  process;  * Assessment of the residual life of timber infrastructure;  * Optimal condition monitoring and maintenance plans for timber components  showing inground decay;  And  * Cost effective decisions for prevention of timber components and mitigation.  Findings of this research can be applied to other equipment or assets showing time  dependent failure rate and can be extended further to consider age/usage replacement  policies, downtime and liability costs.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reliability</field><field name="subject">maintenance models</field><field name="subject">inground decay</field><field name="subject">wood poles</field><field name="subject">environmental and human factors.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15861/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Truth-telling in aged care: a qualitative study</field><field name="creator">Tuckett, Anthony Gerrard</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that truth-telling in high level (nursing home) aged care is a undamentally important aspect of care that ought to reside equally alongside instrumental care. The health of the resident in a nursing home, as with individuals in other care contexts, is directly linked to care provision that allows the resident to be self determining about their care and thus allows them to make reasonable choices and decisions.    This qualitative study explores the meaning of truth-telling in the care providerresident  dyad in high level (nursing home) aged care. Grounded within the epistemology of social constructionism and the theoretical stance of symbolic interactionism, this study relied on oral and written text from care providers  (personal care assistants and registered nurses) and residents. Thematic analysis of data relied on practices within grounded theory to determine their understanding and the conditions and consequences of their understanding about truth-telling in the nursing home.    Through an understanding of the relationship-role-residency trinity, truth-telling in high level (nursing home) care comes to be understood. It has been determined that  the link between truth-telling and the nature of the care provider-resident (and residents' families) relationship is that both personal carers and nurses in this study premise their understanding of truth disclosure on knowing a resident's (and resident's family's) capacity for coping with the truth and therefore catering for the resident's or family's best interests. The breadth and depth of this knowing and how  the relationship is perceived and described determine what care providers will or will  not tell. That is, the perceptions both personal carers and nurses have about the relationship - how they describe themselves as 'family  like', 'friend' and 'stranger', has implications for the way disclosure operates and is described.  Additionally, how care providers perceive and understand their role determines what care providers will or will not tell. That is, the perceptions both carers and nurses have about their own and each other's role - how they describe themselves for example as 'hands-on' carer and 'happy good nurse' has implications for the way disclosure operates and is described.    Furthermore, care providers' meaning and understanding of truth-telling in aged care is not possible in the absence of an appreciation of how the care providers give meaning to and come to understand the care circumstance - residency, the aged care facility, the nursing home. That is, the perceptions both personal carers and nurses have about the aged care facility - how they describe residency as 'Home  away from Home' (and what this means), as a place of little time and a plethora of situations have implications for the operation of truth-telling as a whole.    Recommendations from the study include the implementation of a telling audit to better serve the truth-telling preferences of residents and the reorientation of care practices to emphasise affective care (talk rather than tasks). Furthermore, it is recommended that changes occur to the care provider roles, that care providers define themselves as facilitators rather than protectors, and education be ongoing to improve communication with and care of residents with dementia and those dying.  Finally, the language of residency as 'home' needs to capture an alternate philosophy and attendant practices for improved open communication.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Truth-telling</field><field name="subject">aged care</field><field name="subject">nursing home</field><field name="subject">meaning</field><field name="subject">harm</field><field name="subject">autonomy</field><field name="subject">perspectives</field><field name="subject">caring</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">social constructionism</field><field name="subject">symbolic interactionism</field><field name="subject">personal care assistants</field><field name="subject">registered nurses</field><field name="subject">residents</field><field name="subject">thematic analysis</field><field name="subject">grounded theory</field><field name="subject">personal journal</field><field name="subject">group discussion</field><field name="subject">interview</field><field name="subject">researcher field notes</field><field name="subject">rigour</field><field name="subject">atypical case</field><field name="subject">member checking</field><field name="subject">triangulation</field><field name="subject">thick description</field><field name="subject">peer review</field><field name="subject">relationship</field><field name="subject">role</field><field name="subject">residency</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15862/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Wis Wei Youpla Health?' A case study of the nature and extent of community participation in health education decision-making for Torres Strait Islander girls at Bluewater High.</field><field name="creator">Whatman, Susan Leigh</field><field name="description">This dissertation seeks to investigate the nature and extent of community participation in health education decision making for Torres Strait Islander girls at one Queensland high school. As such, the study is concerned with identifying stakeholders in health education for girls, describing the ways in which stakeholders participate in health education decision-making, and identifying the factors that promote or inhibit community participation in health education decision-making. The question presupposes several standpoints: firstly, that Indigenous communities want to participate in education decision-making and, secondly, that community participation would be desirable in producing good outcomes for Indigenous students. Thus, the literature review is concerned with critiquing discourses of community participation in Indigenous education, the effects on educational outcomes of Indigenous students when community participation is enabled, and reviewing previous research on educational decision-making in health education in Australia.    Given the necessity for emancipatory research methodology in Indigenous research contexts, a critical ethnographic case study approach was chosen to investigate the research questions at a high school in the Torres Strait; building a critical case record from field notes, interview data, and documents. Using Carspecken's (1996) stages of data analysis, primary records were reconstructed and dialogically negotiated with participants, to describe system relations. Such an approach allows for power and control relations between researchers and research participants to be explicated, giving voice to usually marginalised groups, such as Indigenous students. This approach was also congruent with specific Torres Strait Islander research protocols, informed by Ailan Kastom, which were necessary to sensitively and successfully undertake the research.    Data analysis was informed by a framework of Indigenous community participation theory, derived from Soliman (1995), Heslop (1998 ), Ministerial Advisory Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education (1999) and Stewart (1999), together with curriculum theory, from Bernstein (1976; 1990; 2000). This approach constituted a unique adaptation of Bernstein's pedagogic discourse theory to a Torres Strait Islander educational setting.   The findings indicated that there was strong desire by community members, including students, to participate in health education decision-making at Bluewater High. However, the ability of different stakeholder groups to participate in health education varied, with teachers exercising the most power, and students the least. An in-depth, contextual analysis, in which pedagogic decision-making occurred, enabled a number of immediate and long-term recommendations to be developed. It is envisaged that these recommendations will enable greater community participation in health education decision-making for girls at Bluewater High, and more generally in other Indigenous educational settings.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous education</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait Islander education</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait Islander girls</field><field name="subject">Indigenous community participation</field><field name="subject">educational decision-making</field><field name="subject">health education</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">culturally appropriate education.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15863/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of rail grinding and lubrication strategies for controlling  rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and rail wear.</field><field name="creator">Reddy, Venkatarami</field><field name="description">Rails play a significant role in transport of goods and passengers. In Australia railway transport industry contributes 1.6% of GDP with goods and services worth $AUD 8 billion each year which includes $ AUD 0.5 billion per year in exports (Australasian Railway Authority Inc, 2002).    Rail track maintenance plays an important role in reliability and safety. The Office for Research and Experiments (ORE) of the Union International des Chemins de Fer (UIC) has noted that maintenance costs vary directly (60-65 per cent) with change in train speed and axle load. It was also found that the increase in these costs with increased speed and axle load was greater when the quality of the track was lower  (ORR, 1999). Failures during operation are costly to rail players due to loss of service, property and loss of lives. Maintenance and servicing keep rail tracks in operating, reliable and safe condition. Therefore, technical and economical analysis is needed by rail players to reduce maintenance cost and improve reliability and safety of rail networks.    Over the past few years, there have been major advances in terms of increased speed, axle loads, longer trains, along with increased traffic density in corridors. This has led to increased risks in rail operation due to rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and rail wear. The infrastructure providers have less incentive to maintain a given infrastructure standard if its access charges are rigid and rolling stock standard is not achieved. It has been estimated that between 40 to 50 per cent of wagon maintenance costs and 25 per cent of locomotive maintenance costs are related to wheel  maintenance (Railway Gazette International, 2003). The economic analysis of Malmbanan indicates that about 50% of the total cost for maintenance and renewal were related to traffic on rails and 50% not related to traffic, such as signaling, electricity and snow-clearance. The results from the analysis have made it possible  for the mining company LKAB to start up the 30 Tonnes traffic with new wagons and locomotives on the Malmbanan line in year 2001 (&#197;hr&#233;n et al 2003). The rail infrastructure providers have challenges to maintain infrastructure due to government control on access charges and limited control on rail operations. The aim of the research is to:  &#183; Develop a maintenance cost model for optimal rail grinding for various operating conditions; and  &#183; Develop integrated rail grinding and lubrication strategies for optimal  maintenance decisions.    In this research real life data has been  collected, new models have been developed  and analysed for managerial decisions. Simulation approach is used to look into the  impact on various costs such as rail grinding, operating risk, down time, inspection,  replacement, and lubrication. The results of the models for costs and the effect of rail grinding and lubrication strategies are provided in this thesis.    In this research rail track degradation, rail failures and various factors that influence  rail degradation are analysed. An integrated approach for modelling rail track degradation, rail wear, rail grinding and lubrication is developed. Simulation model and cost models for rail grinding are developed and analysed. It has been found through this research that rail grinding at 12 MGT interval is economic decision for enhancing rail life. It was also found that lubrication is most effective compared to  stop/start and no lubrication strategies in steep curves.    Rail grinding strategies developed in this research have been considered by Swedish National Rail for analysing the effectiveness of their existing policies on grinding intervals. Optimal grinding and lubrication decisions have huge potential for savings in maintenance costs, improving reliability and safety and enhancing rail life.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rolling contact fatigue</field><field name="subject">wear</field><field name="subject">rail grinding</field><field name="subject">lubrication and rail degradation.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15864/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation of a Real-Time Granular Synthesis Instrument for Live Performance</field><field name="creator">Opie, Timothy Tristram</field><field name="description">This thesis explores how granular synthesis can be used in live performances.

In addition, supervisor attributions to subordinate performance was assessed to test the relationship with subordinate responses to performance evaluation.  One hundred and forty-four participants including forty-five matched supervisor-subordinate pairs in a large Queensland health care organisation were surveyed.  The measures included perceptions of job control, supervisor attributions to subordinate performance and the effects of subordinate reactions to performance evaluation.  The results indicated that there were no differences in the perceptions the supervisor held of their employee's job control and the perceptions the subordinate held in relation to their own levels of job control.  In addition, it was found that job control significantly contributed to positive reactions to performance evaluation and when there was a close match between supervisor and subordinate perceptions of level of control, there was a resulting positive reaction to performance evaluation.

The current method is based on the matching the visible reflectance spectrum to standard spectral libraries.  In this study, the amount of dye on various wool and wool-blend fabric was measured using vibrational-spectroscopic techniques.  FT-IR PAS and FT-Raman spectroscopy was used to analyse the following set of samples: woollen fabrics (supplied by CSIRO- Geelong, Australia), dyed with Lanasol dyes (Red 6G, Blue 3G and Yellow 4G) and wool/polyester fabrics (supplied by Ceiba-Geigy, Switzerland), dyed with Forosyn dyes (grey, yellow, green, brown, orange, red). A minimum of six spectra was recorded for each sample. The spectra recorded were consistent with those reported previously. FT-IR PA spectral data were block normalised with Y-mean centring and examined using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS).    Although PCA separates the woollen fabrics dyed with a combination of two colours, it does not do equally well for samples dyed with three colours. The dyed wool/ polyester blend samples appeared in a totally random fashion on the PCA plot.  The PLS analysis of PA spectra of various ratios of dyes on woollen fabrics as well as wool/polyester blend was found to be a viable procedure and should be investigated further, perhaps with a broader set of data.  FT-Raman spectra were examined using PCA and PLS. The best pre treatment for FT-Raman spectral data was found to be normalising followed by Y-mean centring.   The PCA plots demonstrate that woollen samples are separated according to the dye ratios and that the presence or absence of some of the peaks is influenced by individual dyes. For example, the presence of the peak at 1430cm 1 is inversely related to the presence of blue dye on the fabric. The PLS resulted in SEE and SEP values of around 1 and 2 respectively indicating that the prediction of the dye ratios have not been very successful and suggesting that there was some problem with the measured values of the calibration set.  PCA plots of wool/polyester fabrics dyed with a single colour indicate that PC1 separates the samples according to how close the shades are together, while PC2 and PC3 separate samples according to their individual colours. PC4, although explaining only a small percentage of variance, suggests that the samples are not homogeneously dyed. PCA plots of the samples dyed with various combinations of the three main dyes display each cluster of samples in their right position on the colour card.   Calculated SEE and SEP values (Yellow: ~0.30, ~0.55, Brown: ~0.30, ~0.79, Red: 0.16, 0.49 and Grey: ~0.2, ~0.40, respectively) indicate that FT-Raman spectroscopy and chemometrics may offer promising methods for measuring the ratio of various dyes on wool/polyester fabrics.  FT-Raman spectroscopy and chemometrics were also used to investigate the change in the ratio of dyes on UV-treated dyed woollen samples. Samples were weathered for 7 and 21 days, using accelerated weathering instrument. The substrate subtracted spectral data were normalised to 100% substrate of the first derivative (9 points and 7 degrees) followed by double centring of the matrix in the spectral region of 1500-500cm-1. PCA effectively separated non-irradiated from the irradiated sample but did not separate the irradiated samples further according to the number of days of irradiation. The pre-treatment used for PLS was first derivative of substrate subtracted spectral data normalised to 100% substrate, and then Y-mean centred.  PLS failed to predict the ratio of the irradiated dyes very well. This may be because degradation products are not modelled by PLS or because the total amount of dye has reduced without changing the dye ratios.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dyed Wool</field><field name="subject">Vibrational Spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">dyed fabric</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15867/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of critical thinking in saudi nurses: an ethnographical approach</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Elaine</field><field name="description">Introduction
 
 Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Middle East occupying the majority of the Arabia Peninsula. In 1934 the exploration of oil propelled this country from one of the poorest to one of the highest in per capita income. Islamic law forms the basis of Saudi Arabia's constitution, its civil and penal codes and guides the Saudis in their daily and family lifestyles, governing morals, dress, eating habits and business dealings. Between 1970 and 1980, there was a sharp increase in the rate of population. Currently the population is estimated at 20.8 million with a projected increase to 44.8 million by the year 2025, with approximately 49% under the age of 20. This rise in population has implications for the health care industry, of which expatriates make up more that 85% of the country's health care system.
 
 
 
 Purpose
 
 The purpose of the study was to examine the social and cultural experiences associated with living and working as a registered nurse in a major teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia and to identify and understand how to develop critical thinking skills in Saudi nurses during a nursing education/intervention program in Saudi Arabia.
 
 
 
 Methodology
 
 The researcher reviewed the literature on critical thinking, which allowed the construction of a conceptual model (Appendix 1) to guide teaching and evaluation of critical thinking skills and maintained the focus on dialogue to stimulate interaction and participation in order to promote critical thinking abilities in Saudi nurses. This study adopted ethnography as a methodology and utilised Spradley's (1979)ethnographic research cyclical tasks for data collection and analysis, which are explained in the exploratory, descriptive and explanatory phases of the research. The researcher was a participant observer and collected ethnographic data in the social situation. A variety of data collection methods were employed, which included observation of students and clinical instructors, evaluation of clinical instructors teaching techniques in utilising critical thinking strategies, evaluation of students' responses in the use of critical thinking strategies, focus group interviews of students and clinical instructors and informal interviews conducted within the hospital setting with relevant informants. The use of multi-methods provided the opportunity to examine more fully the richness and complexities of the culture, by gathering data from various sources to validate the consistency of information to reflect the multiple realities of this cultural group. Cultural domains were identified after examining field notes and interviews for terms and clues repeatedly verbalised by informants, in particular students. The researcher organised the domains to formulate taxonomies, leading to cultural themes, which are answered within the research questions in Chapter 8.  The research questions for this study are as follows:
 
 
 
 Research questions
 
 1. What are the issues related to the implementation of critical thinking in a Professional Development Program to improve critical thinking in Saudi nurses?
 
 2. What major elements are involved in creating and sustaining the Saudi Arabian nursing profession?
 
 3. How might Saudi culture be used to support the development of professional nursing identity?
 
 
 
 Implications for the study
 
 This study has the potential to make a significant contribution to nursing education in Saudi Arabia in promoting critical thinking in nurses and in curriculum development for the following reasons. First, didactic instruction was replaced with an interactive approach by utilising critical thinking strategies and devices to facilitate the development of critical thinking abilities. Second, working with a conceptual framework or model made it easier to manage complex multifaceted concepts, such as critical thinking. The model maintained the focus on dialogue and experiential learning thereby assisting students and staff to integrate theory and practice. This model was effective for the program and if duplicated by other programs, could create a learning environment that would allow the effective development and evaluation of critical thinking. The model is reflected in Appendix 1.
 
 
 
 Recommendations for the nursing profession in Saudi Arabia
 
 * To establish the Nursing Practice Act which subsequently leads to the formation of a National Nursing Registration Board.
 
 * To transfer nursing into the higher education sectors, to be on par with their Western counterparts. To foster career incentives for men to meet the cultural needs of the people, increase Saudi nurses in the workforce and to raise the image of nursing.
 
 * To enact Saudiisation policy.
 
 * To incorporate Islamic nursing history into diploma nursing and other nursing educational programs and implemented into the workplace, government policy and the media.
 
 * To construct separate male and female hospitals to solve the gender issues.
 
 * To systematically collect, collate and analyse nursing data.
 
 * To develop continuing education programs to meet educational needs of nurses.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical thinking skills</field><field name="subject">Critical thinking strategies &#150;role-play</field><field name="subject">debate</field><field name="subject">questioning</field><field name="subject">small group activity</field><field name="subject">journaling</field><field name="subject">Saudi Arabia</field><field name="subject">Saudi nurses</field><field name="subject">Nursing education</field><field name="subject">Critical thinking model</field><field name="subject">Clinical instructors</field><field name="subject">Ethnography</field><field name="subject">Fieldwork</field><field name="subject">Participant observation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15868/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exercise intolerance in peripheral arterial disease</field><field name="creator">Askew, Christopher D.</field><field name="description">Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease have a reduced capacity for exercise, the exact causes of which are poorly understood. This thesis investigated alternative testing procedures that aim to provide a more complete and precise description of the exercise capacities of these patients. Furthermore, the potential roles of gastrocnemius muscle fibre morphometry, capillary supply and glycogen stores in the exercise tolerance of PAD patients were studied.
 
 
 
 Study one aimed to determine the effect of test repetition on maximal exercise performance and test-to-test variability in PAD patients using an incremental treadmill walking test (T) (n=5), an incremental cycle test (C) (n=5), and incremental endurance (PF-endurance) and maximal strength (PF-strength) plantar flexion tests (n=5). Tests were conducted once per week for eight weeks. Performance was stable on the T (~530 s) and C (~500 s) tests across the eight weeks. Test-to-test variance on T decreased from 16%CV (CV: coefficient of variation) to 6%CV (p=.21,NS), and from ~8%CV to 2%CV on C (p&lt;.05) over the eight week period. Variance of peak gas exchange variables tended to decrease with performance variance on both tests; however, other physiological variables, and the associated variance levels, were stable throughout the study. PF strength (635-712N) gradually increased over the initial 2-3 weeks (p&lt;.05) which was accompanied by a reduction in variance from ~8%CV to ~3%CV (p&lt;.05). Similarly, PF endurance increased over the first two weeks (~32,000 to 41500 N.s-1) while variance of this measure fell from ~21%CV to ~10%CV (p&lt;.05) over the study duration. It is concluded that the implementation of familiarisation sessions leads to a reduction in whole body and local calf muscular performance variance in patients with PAD.
 
 
 
 Using a randomised crossover design, study two aimed to compare performance and the physiological and symptomatic responses between a T test and a C test in 16 patients with PAD. Peak exercise time on C (690 s) was greater than that on T (495 s); however the two were significantly correlated (n=16, r=.69, p&lt;.05). Peak HR (120 bpm), VO2 (~1.22 l.min-1) and rate pressure product (~20') did not differ between the two tests, nor did the post exercise ankle pressure (T: 56; C: 61 mmHg). In two subjects with lower back pain during C, the ankle pressure of their "worst" limbs failed to fall by &gt;10mmHg. Performance on both the T and C tests was closely related to the onset of leg symptoms; however the site of pain during C was much more variable than during T. Incremental cycle testing would overcome some of the limitations of treadmill testing (e.g. measurement of mechanical work), and it appears to be an acceptable alternative for measuring the exercise capacity and physiological exercise responses in known claudicants. Use of cycle ergometry for the diagnosis of PAD requires testing in the general population.
 
 
 
 Study three aimed to compare whole body (T test and C test) and local calf muscular (PF strength and endurance) exercise performance between 16 PAD patients (age: 63 &#177; 2; BMI: 25.9 &#177; 1.1) and 13 healthy, sedentary control (CON) subjects (age: 62 &#177; 1; BMI: 25.9 &#177; 0.4), and to describe relationships between the whole body and local calf muscular exercise capacities within the two groups. Furthermore, this study aimed to compare several histochemical characteristics of the medial gastrocnemius muscle fibres between PAD and CON, and to establish whether these factors were related to the exercise capacities of both groups. Maximal performance on T was 59% lower in the PAD group compared with the CON group, as was performance on C (50%), PF strength (25%), and PF endurance (58%). Compared with CON, PAD patients had a lower estimated calf muscle mass and a slight reduction (10%) in muscle fibre size (p=.14, NS). They also had a lower proportion of type I fibres (PAD: 49%; CON: 62%) that was offset by a greater proportion of type IIA fibres (PAD: 27%; CON: 16%), and a reduction in the capillary contacts per muscle fibre (PAD: 1.63; CON: 2.12) compared with CON. When expressed relative to fibre area there were no differences in capillarisation between PAD and CON; however this index was significantly related to resting and post exercise ABI in the PAD patients. There were no differences in the mixed muscle [glycogen], nor the optical density of glycogen in the individual fibres, between the two groups. PF endurance was poorly predictive of walking performance, and did not correlate with any of the morphological variables in both groups. Calf muscle mass correlated with PF strength (r=.59 - .62), and strength was correlated with T performance (r= .61 - .63) in both groups. In the PAD patients, T performance was correlated with the cross sectional area (n=12, r=.72, p&lt;.05), capillary contacts (n=10, r=.81, p&lt;.05) and glycogen density (n=9, r=.81, p&lt;.05) of type I fibres. This study confirms that a reduction in calf strength, which appears to be mediated through muscle atrophy, plays some role in the reduced exercise capacity of claudicants. While both fibre area and capillary supply seem to be of relevance to the exercise capacity of PAD patients, these two factors are closely linked and further research is required to establish the determinants, and relative importance of both. An important, and possibly limiting role of carbohydrate oxidisation in PAD patients is supported by the strong relationship between type I glycogen stores and whole body exercise capacity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Capillary density</field><field name="subject">Claudication</field><field name="subject">Diagnosis (of Peripheral Arterial Disease)</field><field name="subject">Exercise testing</field><field name="subject">Muscle glycogen</field><field name="subject">Intermittent claudication</field><field name="subject">Peripheral Arterial Disease</field><field name="subject">Skeletal muscle fibre types</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15869/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading performance with stand magnifiers in age-related macular degeration</field><field name="creator">Cheong, Allen Ming Yan</field><field name="description">This research was designed to address important issues for the effective prescription of, and training in the use of, magnifiers for reading patients with visual impairment. The emphasis was on the development of simple methods of assessment and training that could be easily implemented, at no great cost, by low vision practitioners in clinical practice. To ensure that the results would be widely applicable, the research focused on subjects with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using stand magnifiers (being the most common cause of low vision and the most commonly prescribed magnifiers respectively). From this research, modifications to the current methods of reading rehabilitation are suggested to more effectively improve low vision reading for the millions of people with low vision around the world. The magnification and reading performance achieved with the magnifier determined by the fixed acuity reserve method was as valid as that achieved with the magnifier determined by the individual acuity reserve method. The fixed acuity reserve is a simpler method to calculate the required magnification, as it requires only near visual acuity and the patient's goal reading task. This method was primarily used to select the appropriate illuminated stand magnifiers for the subjects participating in the subsequent studies and is recommended for use as the starting point in clinical low vision practice.
 
 
 
 The main study of this thesis was a longitudinal investigation of the benefit of large print reading practice on reading performance with stand magnifiers. Instead of the intensive training programs on magnifier use which have been suggested by previous studies, this study aimed to investigate the effect of simple large print reading practice, under either full or restricted field of view (the latter simulated by a practice stand), on reading rate with stand magnifiers for subjects with AMD. The experimental hypothesis was that reading practice prior to the prescription of stand magnifiers would improve reading performance with the stand magnifiers for subjects with AMD. As previous studies have shown, reading rate reduced when a stand magnifier was first introduced. One week of reading practice on large print, with or without a reduced field of view, gave an improvement in reading rate with the stand magnifier for passages of text (such that the reading rates with and without magnifiers were not significantly different). There was a suggestion that this practice may give a more rapid improvement in reading rate than that achieved by the control subjects who did not do any large print reading practice, but this did not reach statistical significance. Even very brief reading with the stand magnifiers by the control subjects gave some improvement in reading rate. Therefore, home or in-office reading practice on large print or with magnifiers is recommended for patients with AMD before magnifiers are prescribed.
 
 
 
 Subjects who had neither reading practice nor exposure to the magnifier prior to its prescription required two weeks practice using their stand magnifiers to achieve their maximum reading rate. This suggests that home practice in using stand magnifiers is beneficial and a follow up visit is recommended two weeks after the provision of a magnifier to assess any change in reading rate. If no improvement in the magnifier reading rate is found or the rate is less than the reading rate on large print without a magnifier, further investigations of the patients' vision and/or their magnifier manipulation strategy are necessary.
 
 
 
 In the last study, a simple method aimed at alleviating difficulties with magnifier manipulation and navigation, the attachment of a line guide to the base of the stand magnifier, was investigated using both objective methods (recording magnifier movements and reading rate measures) and subjective methods (simple questionnaire). Although there was no improvement in the objective measures of reading or navigation performance with the line guide, more than half of the subjects with low vision preferred to have the line guide on their stand magnifiers. This suggests that the objective measures might not be sensitive enough to predict the subjective response, or that other factors that were not measured in this study influenced subjects' preferences in selecting the line guide (e.g., psychological support provided by the line guide in reading orientation). Clinically, the subjective response of patients to the use of low vision aids as well as their motivation are important criteria for success in low vision rehabilitation. There was a tendency for less experienced users to prefer the line guide to assist their use of the stand magnifier for reading. Therefore, a line guide could be offered as a preliminary training aid when stand magnifiers are first prescribed for AMD patients. Possible improvements to the design of the line guide were identified. Further research is required to assess the benefits of this or similar devices for new magnifier users and to understand the difficulties that people with visual impairment have with page navigation in order to determine improved methods of training navigation strategies.
 
 
 
 The unique contribution of this study to the field of low vision rehabilitation is that the benefit of short-term reading practice, on large print or with magnifiers, as simple, cheap methods of enhancing reading performance with stand magnifiers was demonstrated. The results of this study have led to the development of recommendations for assessing and training AMD patients who are prescribed stand magnifiers.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)</field><field name="subject">Low vision</field><field name="subject">Low vision aids</field><field name="subject">Low vision rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Magnification</field><field name="subject">Magnifiers</field><field name="subject">Reading</field><field name="subject">Training</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15870/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Socioeconomic position, dietary intakes, perceptions of health and diet among Australian adolescents and adults</field><field name="creator">Giskes, Katrina</field><field name="description">In Australia, and other Western countries, there are marked socioeconomic inequalities in mortality from chronic, diet-related diseases. Research in these countries has shown that adults from low socioeconomic backgrounds experience greater morbidity and mortality from these conditions compared to their higher-status counterparts. In recent decades, much research has focused on factors that may contribute to these inequalities. Dietary intakes are thought to account for a large proportion of the socioeconomic variability in health, and there is some evidence suggesting that the psychosocial foundations laid down in adolescence are important influences on these dietary intakes.
 
 
 
 In Australia, however, existing research examining socioeconomic differences in dietary intakes is limited. Most previous research has looked at dietary intakes in adulthood, and have not considered examining for socioeconomic differences in adolescence. Furthermore, not much is known about the health and nutrition-related beliefs, attitudes and perceptions of adolescents that may contribute to socioeconomic differences in dietary intakes. This study examined these issues by analysing for socioeconomic differences in food and nutrient intakes among both adolescents and adults. It also investigated some health and nutrition-related beliefs, attitudes and perceptions of adolescents from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
 
 
 
 Data from a national cross-sectional survey, the 1995 Australian National Nutrition Survey, were analysed to determine socioeconomic differences in food and nutrient intakes. Qualitative interviews were undertaken with adolescents to investigate their health and nutrition-related beliefs, attitudes and perceptions.
 
 
 
 The results show that compared to adults, there is less socioeconomic inequality in food and nutrient intakes among adolescents. Intakes of some anti-oxidant vitamins and folate were directly related with socioeconomic position among adults. Adults from low socioeconomic backgrounds were less likely to consume fruits or vegetables. They consumed a lower variety of fruits and vegetables and were less likely to choose fruits and vegetables high in vitamin A, folate and vitamin C. The results showed that these differences may be due to adults from low socioeconomic backgrounds being less likely to want to increase their fruit and vegetable intakes, and perceiving price and storage as barriers to doing so.
 
 
 
 There were a small number of socioeconomic differences in adolescents' beliefs, attitudes and perceptions about nutrition and health that may contribute to dietary intake inequalities in adulthood. Adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were less likely to see health as being important for achieving goals, and identified nutrients and sleep as influencing their health less frequently. These adolescents also referred to dietary recommendations, nutrient intakes, dairy foods and avoiding school canteen foods less frequently when describing a healthy diet.
 
 
 
 A number of recommendations about the design and targeting of nutrition-promotion campaigns and interventions are discussed, as well as future directions for research on socioeconomic differences in dietary intakes.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">socioeconomic position</field><field name="subject">nutrient intakes</field><field name="subject">fruit and vegetable intakes</field><field name="subject">variety</field><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">health and nutrition beliefs</field><field name="subject">nutrition perceptions</field><field name="subject">barriers</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15871/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attention and memory bias for body image and health related information using an Emotional Stroop task in a non-clinical sample</field><field name="creator">Mulgrew, Kate Elizabeth</field><field name="description">It has been proposed that body image disturbance is a form of cognitive bias wherein schemas for self-relevant information guide the selective processing of appearancerelated information in the environment. This threatening information receives disproportionately more attention and memory, as measured by an Emotional Stroop and incidental recall task. The aim of this thesis was to expand the literature on cognitive processing biases in non-clinical males and females by incorporating a number of significant methodological refinements. To achieve this aim, three phases of research were conducted. The initial two phases of research provided preliminary data to inform the development of the main study. Phase One was a qualitative exploration of body image concerns amongst males and females recruited through the general community and from a university. Seventeen participants (eight male; nine female) provided information on their body image and what factors they saw as positively and negatively impacting on their self evaluations. The importance of self esteem, mood, health and fitness, and recognition of the social ideal were identified as key themes. These themes were incorporated as psycho-social measures and Stroop word stimuli in subsequent phases of the research. Phase Two involved the selection and testing of stimuli to be used in the Emotional Stroop task. Six experimental categories of words were developed that reflected a broad range of health and body image concerns for males and females. These categories were high and low calorie food words, positive and negative appearance words, negative emotion words, and physical activity words. Phase Three addressed the central aim of the project by examining cognitive biases for body image information in empirically defined sub-groups. A National sample of males (N = 55) and females (N = 144), recruited from the general community and universities, completed an Emotional Stroop task, incidental memory test, and a collection of psycho-social questionnaires. Sub-groups of body image disturbance were sought using a cluster analysis, which identified three sub-groups in males (Normal, Dissatisfied, and Athletic) and four sub-groups in females (Normal, Health Conscious, Dissatisfied, and Symptomatic). No differences were noted between the groups in selective attention, although time taken to colour name the words was associated with some of the psycho-social variables. Memory biases found across the whole sample for negative emotion, low calorie food, and negative appearance words were interpreted as reflecting the current focus on health and stigma against being unattractive. Collectively these results have expanded our understanding of processing biases in the general community by demonstrating that the processing biases are found within non-clinical samples and that not all processing biases are associated with negative functionality</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">body image, Emotional Stroop, attention, memory, cluster analysis, classification</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/26964/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlation of Heterogenous IDS Alerts for Attack Detection</field><field name="creator">Carey, Nathan</field><field name="description">With the increasing use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) as a core component of network security, a vast array of competing products have appeared to fulfil the role of reliably detecting potential breaches of security in a network. The domain of detecting intrusions is large. This leads to products which are better at detecting some intrusions than others, and so to the use of multiple different types of IDS within a network. This typical usage, combined with the common practice of using IDS at multiple points in the network, requires sophisticated management of heterogenous alerts from multiple sources. This management should enable correlation of alerts with the goal of better detecting attacks, and reducing the monitoring workload on administrators. This thesis presents an architecture utilising commodity components and the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) to enable this type of alert management. A signature scheme for the specification of patterns of alerts that indicate multi-step attacks is given, and a methodology for analysing alerts using the architecture that was developed. The final outcomes are a signature system and collection of tools integrated in a GUI management interface to aid in the detection of attacks, and the results of utilising these tools on a series of experiments in attack detection.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intrusion Detection</field><field name="subject">Correlation</field><field name="subject">Alert Analysis</field><field name="subject">Attack Signatures</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15872/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generic Attributes of Australian Information Systems Graduates: an Empirical Study</field><field name="creator">Snoke, Robert Lee</field><field name="description">The need to provide currency in education in terms of the qualities and skills of graduates is a continuous requirement of higher education institutions. Industry expects that graduates from courses of study at universities have the necessary skills and attributes to be able to work in the modern work environment.    The generic attribute agenda permeates all areas and sectors of education. Some of the areas of the generic attribute agenda include teaching, learning, assessment and the development of the generic attributes in students. This thesis specifically deals with a singular discipline, Information Systems, and the identification of the generic attributes applicable to this discipline. It does not attempt to enter the debate on the broader issues of how generic attributes are taught, assessed and developed in the educational sphere. The areas of teaching, learning, assessment and development of generic attributes in higher education are outside the scope of this thesis.    This thesis presents an investigation of the extent of coverage of the identified generic attributes within the unit objectives. The generic attributes required from the Information Systems (IS) industry for graduates from IS courses of study were identified and validated using an extensive three round Delphi questionnaire of academics and industry representatives. Academic participants were from several Australian universities that offer IS undergraduate courses of study. Industry representatives were from the Australian Computer Society (ACS) and the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA) and local Australian IS industry employers that employ the graduates from the participating universities also took part in the survey. The validation process involved two surveys, one in Queensland and a second involving the other Australian states. The significant finding from this survey was that the attribute of working as part of a team in a productive and cooperative manner was rated as the most important. Other significant findings    included the high correlation between the Queensland study and the national study in terms of the relative importance of the attributes. Another important finding is that the attribute relating to discipline knowledge was rated as relatively unimportant being ranked 13th out of 29 attributes.    The extent of treatment of the attributes within a course of study was identified by means of mapping each of the unit objectives within a course of study against the generic attributes and then plotting this data on a Kiviat chart. The universities used in this study included Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Southern Cross University (SCU), Bond University and Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology(RMIT). A similar mapping was performed for the major curriculum documents IS'97 Model Curriculum and Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Courses in Information Systems (IS'97), Information Systems-Centric Curriculum (ISCC'99) and the Australian Computer Society Core Body of Knowledge. Comparisons were then made between the curriculum documents and the courses of study in terms of the extent of treatment of the generic attributes.    Statistical analysis of the combined data from both the Queensland and Australian studies identified eight underlying factors. These included Team Communications, Information Use, Individual Competencies, IS Knowledge, Professionalism, Project Management, Professional Development and Diversity.  Team Communications are associated with the attributes of working as part of a team, oral communications, written communications, interpersonal skills, time management and define problems. Information Use is associated with the attributes of: retrieval, evaluation and use of information, and sensitivity to gender customs and cultures. Individual Competencies are associated with the attributes of: self-motivation, ability to learn independently, reflection on strengths and weaknesses and work independently. IS Knowledge is associated with the attributes of: programming language ability, IS knowledge, reference discipline knowledge and technical competence. Professionalism is associated with the attributes of: ethics, curiosity about technology, continuous learning and intellectual development, embracing change, and professional development. Project Management is associated with the attributes of: analyse and evaluate solutions, understand the    profit motive of business, knowledge of business operations and its orientation, quality of solutions and project management skills. Professional Development is associated with the attributes of: research skills and related discipline knowledge. Diversity is associated with the attribute of operate in a diverse environment.    An important finding from the mapping processes were that all the documents displayed a similar coverage of the generic attributes. All the graphs showed a strong treatment of IS discipline knowledge. IS'97 showed the strongest coverage of written and oral communications as compared to the other curriculum documents or the courses of study examined.    A number of limitations were identified during the study. Some of the more important ones are:    * This study identified a significant shortfall in the manner in which the objectives of the units of study that comprise IS courses of study at the tertiary level are written. The study found that the curriculum documents from the USA were often written with a specific number of objectives that often related to the length of the course or the number of times class was held during a week. In Australia the traditional unit has approximately 6-8 objectives. The objectives are often related to the content of the unit rather than what the student should be able to do at the end of the unit, in terms of the attributes identified by the university as being obtained by the students when they complete the course of study.    * The lack of direct access to the large mailing list of the industry representative body.    * The currency of the unit outline.    * The fact that many course unit outlines are written when a course of study is accredited. This means that by the time the course of study is due for re-accreditation, that a long period of time has elapsed. This time period is often five years or more. In the IS discipline this is an extremely long period for any course of study to be accredited;    * The emerging and constantly changing employer and IS professional desired attributes of graduates. This is a reflection of the changing nature of the IS    environment. The fact that employers and IS professionals judge the quality of a university course based on what the graduates can actually do in the workplace;    * There is a large difference between the percentage coverage of the model curriculum documents within the courses offered in the USA where they constitute approximately 30 percent of the total course content. In the Australian context the model curriculum coverage represents approximately 83 percent of the course content;    * The study used curriculum documentation and there was no validation from a student perspective of what they learnt or what generic attributes were developed in units they studied; and,    * The courses of study used in this research are restricted to the tertiary sector and the current educational offerings of universities in the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, in Australia. While this may represent the views of the eastern part of the country, they may not be totally representative of the offerings for the country as a whole.    One of the most important outputs from this research has been the development of a replicable methodology for determining the extent of coverage of the generic attributes within units and courses in other disciplines. The process would be to identify the relevant curriculum documents for the discipline and the Core Body of Knowledge from the associated professional association. The generic attributes that may have a specific context within the discipline need to be validated using a similar method such as the Delphi technique. Mapping of the generic attributes would then be done and a set of similar graphs produced. This research process meets the third research objective of producing a replicable methodology for mapping the unit objectives against the generic attributes.    This study is unique in that it sought the views of both industry and academics of the required generic attribute of graduates from IS courses of study. The study then mapped the generic attributes against the unit objectives to give an indication of the extent of treatment or development during a student's course.    In an attempt to increase the response rate to the Delphi study email was used as a medium for data collection. This provided the necessary data for the identification and validation of the importance of the generic attributes in a relatively short period of time as compared to the time that a traditional Delphi study would have taken. The email medium also allowed for the easy follow up of any questions raised during the course of the questionnaires. Delphi studies may now be conducted in a relatively short time frame. This will give the researchers the ability to publish their findings more quickly than other methods of conducting studies using the Delphi method. Individually addressed email, where this was possible, enhanced the response rate and provided the researcher with added anecdotal evidence from comments made in the reply to the survey instrument.    The generic attributes need to be developed within the courses of study at the institutions examined in this study. Specifically the wording of objectives needs to reflect not only the content of the material to be covered but also the process through which the student gains that knowledge or competency.    The elicitation of the generic attributes is required as part of the unit outline and should clearly demonstrate to students what skills they will be developing within a particular unit. This information is then able to form part of the accreditation submission for institutions seeking accreditation from professional bodies such as the ACS.    From the process of gathering information for this study it became clear that the writers of the unit outlines need to have professional development in the writing of the unit objectives to address the inclusion of the generic attributes.    The identification of generic attributes needs to be continually reviewed and a follow-up study is suggested to identify any longitudinal trends that may be evolving since this study commenced in 1998. This follow-up is needed because of significant changes in society may suggest that there are new and additional attributes that are now considered to be generic skills.    The relationship between the generic attributes identified in this study and the multi-literacies (Millard Sheets Library, 2003. -http://www.otis.edu/library/infolit.htm, Accessed 12 January, 2004) that are now the focus of educators will provide the platform for a follow-up study of the generic attributes agenda.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">generic attributes</field><field name="subject">competencies</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">curriculum development</field><field name="subject">IS education and research</field><field name="subject">IS curriculum</field><field name="subject">IS skill requirements</field><field name="subject">IS professional societies</field><field name="subject">curriculum evaluation</field><field name="subject">industry requirements</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15873/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE WRONG CROWD : An online documentary and Analytical contextualisation</field><field name="creator">Beattie, Debra</field><field name="description">This doctoral study comprises two parts. 75 per cent of the total weight of the submission consists of the creative component, the writing, directing and producing of a moving-image documentary in an online environment (supplementary material includes the script). Cutting edge technology (QTVR 'movies' and Live Stage Professional software) was used to create an immersive cinematic experience on the net.    The Wrong Crowd can be viewed either online at www.abc.net.au/wrongcrowd or offline via a CD Rom (the latter includes the radio play 'Death of a Prostitute' which was excised from the version published via ABC Online because of legal concerns on the part of the ABC lawyers).    The second part of the doctorate is the analytical contextualisation, comprising 25 per cent of the submission. This part examines the critical literature on the nature of the documentary form, documentary as history, cultural memory and the autobiography as history. Documentary exists as a truth-claim. History also embraces the search for evidence. The history documentary has a television form from which the online version is derived. The nature of the internet as a delivery platform for the moving image is discussed with reference to he truth claim as founded in the visible evidence - the news coverage - the 'this really happened'. The evidence however is open to interpretation for the historical record and is retold to suit the present power relations (the funding bodies, the commissioning editors, etc). In a CD Rom and more so online, this tendency towards individual interpretation is amplified to the point where the viewer can participate in the construction of the argument via a navigable database. Visually, the change from the temporal montage of the linear television documentary to spatial montage of the windows interface has led us to reconnect with computer-based moving images as a form of animated painting. Conventional screen theories of engagement and reception are invoked to aid in the discussion of modified cinematic conventions of editing and framing within the online form.    The case-study of one of the inaugural Australian Film Commission funded online documentaries, The Wrong Crowd: Inside the Family Outside the Law, is a personal history narrative that intersects with Queensland police history from the 1950s to the late 1970s at the moments of inquiries into issues of police brutality and corruption.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online documentary</field><field name="subject">analytical contextualisation</field><field name="subject">Queensland police</field><field name="subject">police corruption</field><field name="subject">Queensland history</field><field name="subject">personal history narrative</field><field name="subject">QTVR</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15874/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour and Design of Profiled Steel Cladding Systems Subject to Pull-through Failures</field><field name="creator">Mahaarachchi, Dhammika</field><field name="description">The common profiled steel cladding systems used in Australia and its neighboring countries are made of very thin (0.42 mm) high strength steel (G550 with a minimum yield stress of 550 MPa) and are crest-fixed. However, these claddings often suffer from local pull-through failures at their screw connections during high wind events such as storms and cyclones. Past experience and researches have shown that the loss of steel roofs has often occurred due to local pull-through failures of their screw connections under uplift or suction loading. Loss of claddings always led to a progressive collapse of the entire building. This situation is continuing because of the lower priority given to the design of roof and wall cladding systems. At present, steel design codes do not provide guidelines for the design of crest-fixed steel roof or wall claddings. Past research has shown that European and American recommendations for steel claddings cannot be used for Australian crest-fixed cladding systems as they were developed mainly for valley-fixed claddings subjected to gravity loading instead of crest-fixed claddings subjected to wind uplift/suction loading. Therefore at present the design of thin steel cladding systems is based on laboratory tests and is expensive. These situations inhibit the innovative design and advances in the steel cladding industry.    Since the local pull-through failures in the less ductile G550 steel claddings are initiated by transverse splitting at the fastener hole, analytical studies have not been able to determine the pull-through failure loads accurately. Therefore in the first stage of this research an appropriate fracture/splitting criterion was developed using a series of large scale and small scale experiments of crest-fixed steel claddings. A shell finite element model of crest-fixed steel cladding was then developed that included the new fracture/splitting criterion and advanced features such as hyperelastic material modelling, contact simulations, residual stresses and geometric imperfections. The improved finite element analyses were able to model the pull-through failures associated with splitting as evident from the comparison of their results with the corresponding full-scale experimental results. An extensive series of parametric studies considering the effects of material properties and geometric parameters of the two commonly used trapezoidal cladding profiles was undertaken using finite element analysis.  Appropriate design formulae for the pull-through and dimpling failure load of trapezoidal profiles were then derived for optimization purposes and to simplify the current design method. This will then lead to modification and optimisation of cladding profiles to satisfy the requirements of both strength (safety during cyclones and storms) and economy. This thesis presents the details of large scale experimental studies undertaken and the results including the criterion for the splitting/fracture failure of high strength steel cladding systems. It describes the many advances made in the finite element modelling of crest-fixed steel cladding systems including the effects of localised pull-through and dimpling failures. Finally, it presents a simple design method for trapezoidal steel cladding systems under wind uplift or suction loading.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Roofs</field><field name="subject">steel</field><field name="subject">Testing</field><field name="subject">Screws</field><field name="subject">Steel claddings</field><field name="subject">Splitting</field><field name="subject">Fracture</field><field name="subject">Pull-through failures</field><field name="subject">Local dimpling</field><field name="subject">Finite element analyses</field><field name="subject">Imperfections</field><field name="subject">Residual stresses</field><field name="subject">Hyperelastic</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15875/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medical Image Registration and Stereo Vision Using Mutual Information</field><field name="creator">Fookes, Clinton Brian</field><field name="description">Image registration is a fundamental problem that can be found in a diverse range of fields within the research community. It is used in areas such as engineering, science, medicine, robotics, computer vision and image processing, which often require the process of developing a spatial mapping between sets of data. Registration plays a crucial role in the medical imaging field where continual advances in imaging modalities, including MRI, CT and PET, allow the generation of 3D images that explicitly outline detailed in vivo information of not only human anatomy, but also human function.    Mutual Information (MI) is a popular entropy-based similarity measure which has found use in a large number of image registration applications. Stemming from information theory, this measure generally outperforms most other intensity-based measures in multimodal applications as it does not assume the existence of any specific relationship between image intensities. It only assumes a statistical dependence. The basic concept behind any approach using MI is to find a transformation, which when applied to an image, will maximise the MI between two images. This thesis presents research using MI in three major topics encompassed by the computer vision and medical imaging field: rigid image registration, stereo vision, and non-rigid image registration.    In the rigid domain, a novel gradient-based registration algorithm (MIGH) is proposed that uses Parzen windows to estimate image density functions and Gauss-Hermite quadrature to estimate the image entropies. The use of this quadrature technique provides an effective and efficient way of estimating entropy while bypassing the need to draw a second sample of image intensities (a procedure required in previous Parzen-based MI registration approaches). It is possible to achieve identical results with the MIGH algorithm when compared to current state of the art MI-based techniques. These results are achieved using half the previously required sample sizes, thus doubling the statistical power of the registration algorithm. Furthermore, the MIGH technique improves algorithm complexity by up to an order of N, where N represents the number of samples extracted from the images.    In stereo vision, a popular passive method of depth perception, new extensions have been pro- posed in order to increase the robustness of MI-based stereo matching algorithms. Firstly, prior probabilities are incorporated into the MI measure to considerably increase the statistical power of the matching windows. The statistical power, directly related to the number of samples, can become too low when small matching windows are utilised. These priors, which are calculated from the global joint histogram, are tuned to a two level hierarchical approach. A 2D match surface, in which the match score is computed for every possible combination of template and matching windows, is also utilised to enforce left-right consistency and uniqueness constraints. These additions to MI-based stereo matching significantly enhance the algorithms ability to detect correct matches while decreasing computation time and improving the accuracy, particularly when matching across multi-spectra stereo pairs.    MI has also recently found use in the non-rigid domain due to a need to compute multimodal non-rigid transformations. The viscous fluid algorithm is perhaps the best method for re- covering large local mis-registrations between two images. However, this model can only be used on images from the same modality as it assumes similar intensity values between images. Consequently, a hybrid MI-Fluid algorithm is proposed to compute a multimodal non-rigid registration technique. MI is incorporated via the use of a block matching procedure to generate a sparse deformation field which drives the viscous fluid algorithm, This algorithm is also compared to two other popular local registration techniques, namely Gaussian convolution and the thin-plate spline warp, and is shown to produce comparable results. An improved block matching procedure is also proposed whereby a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) sampler is used to optimally locate grid points of interest. These grid points have a larger concentration in regions of high information and a lower concentration in regions of small information. Previous methods utilise only a uniform distribution of grid points throughout the image.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Vision</field><field name="subject">Image Registration</field><field name="subject">Mutual Information</field><field name="subject">Medical Imaging</field><field name="subject">Stereo Vision</field><field name="subject">Stereo Matching</field><field name="subject">Entropy</field><field name="subject">Rigid</field><field name="subject">Non-Rigid</field><field name="subject">Transformations</field><field name="subject">Deformation</field><field name="subject">Correspondence</field><field name="subject">Disparity map</field><field name="subject">Gauss-Hermite Quadrature</field><field name="subject">Parametric Framework</field><field name="subject">Statistical Power</field><field name="subject">Block Matching</field><field name="subject">Viscous Fluid</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15876/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refining Topographic Line Maps for Use with Ground Based Night Vision Systems</field><field name="creator">Sapparth, David James</field><field name="description">This study aims to refine the current cartographic standards and specifications used by the Australian Defence Force to produce the 1:50 000 scale Topographic Line Map (TLM) so that TLMs can be read with both normal chromatic vision and with achromatic NVG vision.    The proliferation and integration of Night Vision Goggles (NVG) into the Australian Army has increased the operating capacity of forces at night. The Australian Army has incorporated NVG into standard operating procedures and training to the effect that Australian military personnel do not operate, at night, without NVG. The increased use of NVG in the Australian Army has required existing systems to be modified or redesigned to be effective within the limitations of NVG. The inability to read TLMs effectively with NVG is an identified problem within the Australian Army. This research has investigated the problems associated with using NVG and the information, which cannot be read on TLMs with NVG. This information was compared to a survey of features on a TLM that are critical for successful military operations. The combined information determined which features on a TLM were to be refined to enable effective reading with NVG.    The scope of this research limited refinements to current or previous cartographic standards and specifications used by the Australian Army to produce TLMs. Refinements were limited to symbology, size, and colour and three critical information features of contours, watercourses and vegetation. The problems of cartographic design for a dual vision system (chromatic/achromatic) were investigated and it was determined that the common factor of value contrast exhibits the greatest effect on the refinement process.    Prototype TLMs were produced and tested with normal and NVG vision to determine the best cartographic portrayal of the critical information features, without compromising the Figure/ground relationship, balance and cognitive meanings of the TLM. A final product was produced from the prototype experiment results providing a TLM for use with both normal and NVG vision. The refined TLM has changed contours from brown to black without changes to symbology or size and watercourses from 0.1mm width to 0.2mm width without changing colour or symbology. Vegetation was retained at the current standard and specification.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Night Vision Goggles</field><field name="subject">NVG</field><field name="subject">Topographic Line Map</field><field name="subject">TLM</field><field name="subject">military operations</field><field name="subject">cartography</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">contrast</field><field name="subject">map design</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15877/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human Action Recognition In Video Data For Surveillance Applications</field><field name="creator">Gurrapu, Chaitanya</field><field name="description">Detecting human actions using a camera has many possible applications in the security industry. When a human performs an action, his/her body goes through a signature sequence of poses. To detect these pose changes and hence the activities performed, a pattern recogniser needs to be built into the video system. Due to the temporal nature of the patterns, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), used extensively in speech recognition, were investigated. Initially a gesture recognition system was built using novel features. These features were obtained by approximating the contour of the foreground object with a polygon and extracting the polygon's vertices. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was fit to the vertices obtained from a few frames and the parameters of the GMM itself were used as features for the HMM.    A more practical activity detection system using a more sophisticated foreground segmentation algorithm immune to varying lighting conditions and permanent changes to the foreground was then built. The foreground segmentation algorithm models each of the pixel values using clusters and continually uses incoming pixels to update the cluster parameters. Cast shadows were identified and removed by assuming that shadow regions were less likely to produce strong edges in the image than real objects and that this likelihood further decreases after colour segmentation. Colour segmentation itself was performed by clustering together pixel values in the feature space using a gradient ascent algorithm called mean shift. More robust features in the form of mesh features were also obtained by dividing the bounding box of the binarised object into grid elements and calculating the ratio of foreground to background pixels in each of the grid elements. These features were vector quantized to reduce their dimensionality and the resulting symbols presented as features to the HMM to achieve a recognition rate of 62% for an event involving a person writing on a white board. The recognition rate increased to 80% for the &amp;quotseen" person sequences, i.e. the sequences of the person used to train the models. With a fixed lighting position, the lack of a shadow removal subsystem improved the detection rate. This is because of the consistent profile of the shadows in both the training and testing sequences due to the fixed lighting positions. Even with a lower recognition rate, the shadow removal subsystem was considered an indispensable part of a practical, generic surveillance system.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Event Detection</field><field name="subject">Hidden Markov Models</field><field name="subject">Gesture Recognition</field><field name="subject">Shadow Elimination</field><field name="subject">Gaussian Mixture Models</field><field name="subject">GMM Front End</field><field name="subject">Vertex Features</field><field name="subject">High Curvatures Points</field><field name="subject">Contour Information</field><field name="subject">Human Body Spatial Distribution Metrics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15878/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences Of Socioeconomic Status, Dietary Factors And Physical Activity On Overweight And Obesity Of Australian  Children And Adolescents</field><field name="creator">Wang, Zaimin</field><field name="description">The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in young people is a major global public health concern, especially in developed countries. In Australia, studies in 2001 have suggested that 20% of boys and 21.5% of girls aged 7-15 years were overweight or obese, while in 1985 the figures were 10.7% and 11.8%, respectively.  In the short-term, overweight and obese children and adolescents suffer from both adverse physical and psychological consequences. The most significant long-term consequence of childhood obesity is its persistence into adulthood, along with numerous associated health risks. A number of studies have shown that there is an association between being an overweight child and subsequent adulthood obesity. In general, childhood overweight and obesity is a multifactorial disease and its development is due to multiple interactions between genes and environment. A number of risk factors such as socioeconomic status, dietary patterns, and physical activity have been frequently identified as contributors to its development. However, the results of recent studies provide conflicting evidence. The statistical limitations also make it difficult to compare the studies on childhood obesity between countries. In addition, existing research in Australia that examines the contribution of different risk factors to childhood obesity is limited. There are no published data on the relationship between overweight/obesity, dietary patterns, and physical activity/inactivity in Australian children and adolescents. This study examined the influences of household income, dietary factors, physical activity/inactivity and ethnicity on overweight and obesity among Australian children and adolescents. It also explored the relationship between self-reported weight and height to actual weight and height in older Australian adolescents in order to clarify the accuracy of self-reported data among Australian youth.    Data from the two national cross-sectional surveys, the 1995 Australian National Health Survey (NHS) and the 1995 National Nutrition Survey (NNS) were analysed to explore the influences of household income, intake of energy and fat and percentage of energy from fat on childhood obesity. The study focused on 1585 children and adolescents aged 7-15 years. These data were also used to examine the relationship of self-reported weight and height to measured weight and height in older adolescents. Additionally, another cross-sectional survey among a group of Australian primary school children from a multi-cultural school in southern Brisbane was undertaken as well as providing indicative data on the relationship of overweight/obesity to physical activity levels and ethnicity, and to provide a protocol on the methodology and practicality of measuring physical activity level in such a school setting.    The results suggested that boys from households with low incomes were more likely to be overweight or obese compared with those from households with higher incomes. Having parents, especially mothers, who were overweight or obese increased the risk of children being overweight or obese. The results do not provide evidence that there are statistically significantly differences in the average intake of energy and fat and percentage of energy from fat between non-overweight and overweight or obese boys and girls. The correct classification of weight or obesity from self-reported height and weight by Australian older adolescents was about 70%, bias in reporting weight and height is higher among overweight or obese older adolescents than non-overweight counterparts. In addition, preliminary, indicative data from the pilot study on the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and physical activity in 10-12 year old Australian school children from a multi-cultural school revealed that the average daily physical activity level (PAL) was 2.3 Metabolic Equivalents (METs) when the PAL was measured using self-reported activity diary. The proportion of light, moderate and heavy PAL was 2.9%, 20.4% and 76.7% in children, respectively. Additionally no ethnic differences in the prevalence of overweight /obesity was found. There was no statistically significant difference in average daily TV view times between non-overweight and overweight or obese boys and girls. The average daily number of steps measured using pedometer in the weekdays was 16,505 in boys and 12766 in girls. Most of boys (94.0%) have a medium and over level of steps taken daily while nearly one-third of the girls had not reached the minimum level in the number of steps for optimal health. However it must be noted this school-based study was a small cross-sectional survey in a single school. The results should be viewed as indicative, not generalisable. The study does not provide any longitudinal data on physical activity patterns and the trends in relationship to body mass index.  In spite of the limitations of this study, it did provide some preliminary data on PAL and its relationship to overweight/ obesity among young Australian schoolchildren from diverse cultural backgrounds. Most importantly, this pilot study has provided a protocol on the methodology and practicality of measuring physical activity levels of children using self-reported activity diaries and pedometers in a  multicultural school setting. A number of strategies for the prevention and treatment of childhood overweight and obesity are discussed. In future studies, a population-based and randomly selected sample would  ensure findings that are more representative of general Australian children, and the longitudinal studies would help to define the association between the risk factors and childhood obesity, as well as enabling conclusions on causality to be drawn.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Body Mass Index</field><field name="subject">Overweight</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Socio-Economic Status</field><field name="subject">Diet</field><field name="subject">Physical Activity</field><field name="subject">Inactivity</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Adolescents</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15879/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge transfer across countries and cultures an international theory-building case study</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Tracy</field><field name="description">While the importance of knowledge creation and management has been widely recognised as vital to an organisation's ongoing competitiveness and success since the 1990s, there has been little systematic study of knowledge creation and transfer processes in organisations. Much of what has been reported in the literature is anecdotal in nature.  
 
 Particularly lacking is research within an international context, exploring issues related to the transfer of knowledge across countries and culture. It is proposed that there is a need for theory building research in the area of knowledge transfer.
 
 Given the complex and social nature of knowledge, a qualitative approach to undertaking this research was adopted. The study is an inductive, theory-building case study in relation to a multinational company. 
 
 In summary, this study evaluated the effectiveness of a best practice knowledge management program in achieving knowledge transfer in sales and marketing practices throughout the markets of Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America. It considered the methods by which knowledge was transferred and their relative effectiveness, and those factors which may have mediated or limited the knowledge transfer processes. 
 
 The research was undertaken by the company's Knowledge Manager who had created the best-practice knowledge transfer program. The implications of this situation on the study's validity and reliability are discussed, and were taken into account in the design of the questionnaire and in the analysis of all findings.  
 
 The case study site was a European-based, global travel technology company. The principal data-gathering method was a structured interview conducted by telephone with senior staff from within 28 European and Latin American markets. In total, 31 interviews were undertaken. This broad-ranging interview method gathered information and feedback on the processes used for identifying and distributing best practices in sales and marketing. The interview data were supplemented by feedback questionnaires from best practice forums, intranet usage statistics, observations from best practice forums and from interviews with staff in the central organisation.
 
 While there was evidence that knowledge transfer had occurred, the results of the study highlighted the difficulties in effectively measuring the knowledge transfer process.  It is the researcher's view that clear and visible measures of knowledge transfer are not universal or even generic, but rather are to be discerned in a range of indicators across actions, behaviours, attitudes and outcomes in culture-specific settings.  A time based knowledge measurement model was developed to assist in this regard.  
 
 Other major outcomes from the research included:
 
 *	The confirmation of the critical importance of face-to-face communication  mechanisms for knowledge transfer to result in knowledge uptake.
 
 *	The identification of the role of technology as an enabler of communication and distribution of knowledge, but not as a driver for action or knowledge uptake.
 
 *	The recognition of the relationship between the broad factors impacting on knowledge transfer such as organisational factors, external environment and individual characteristics, in a complex and non-linear manner, suggesting that knowledge transfer is a multi-factorial process involving interacting variables to an extent greater than generally accepted hitherto.  A tool for use within organisational settings has been developed in this regard.
 
 *	The identification of the interplay between different individual specific characteristics or factors such as personal experience of change, experience of working in a different cultural context, ego/personality, and credibility of the person transmitting the practice which influence the decision to adopt or not adopt a practice from another market.
 
 *	The identification of the need for cultural similarity and high levels of homogeneity, in terms of market maturity, market size and competitive position for practices to transfer more often between countries.
 
 *	The recognition that many factors operate to influence and shape the knowledge or indeed to block the transfer of practices between countries, with resistance to other practices possibly relating to an individual's need for the application of creativity, personal ownership and control.  
 
 Additionally, the researcher observed that much of the language within the existing literature describing those factors which block or limit knowledge transfer is negatively framed.  The researcher believes that a change in attitude about the positive influence of an individual's filtering processes, together with a change in organisational language describing resistance to knowledge transfer, would yield a positive impact on individuals' attitudes and behaviour with regard to knowledge transfer.
 
 Several areas for further research as a result of the study were identified and include individual factors such as cultural characteristics, motivation, personality and adult learning styles.  Additionally, a more detailed examination and understanding of the impact of organisational factors such as leadership and generational gaps on knowledge transfer would be of significant value to the body of knowledge.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge management, organisational learning, Knowledge transfer? knowledge measurement, barriers to knowledge transfer, tacit knowledge, culture, indicators of knowledge transfer, knowledge filters</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15880/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ask Dance Theatre: Christian Worldview And The Creative Process</field><field name="creator">Pratt, Angela</field><field name="description">Professional dance companies which reflect a Christian worldview are slowly emerging within the dance community, but this is territory which is generally uncharted academically, especially in Australia.

The effect of ocular microfluctuations on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of corneal topography was investigated. A technique was developed to measure tilt, displacement, and cyclotorsion in multiple videokeratographs from the same cornea. This information was used to reposition each videokeratograph according to the average position of a sample of multiple measurements. The corneal topography of ten subjects was measured 20 times each, using videokeratoscopy. The RMSE calculated from difference between single videokeratographs and the average videokeratograph decreased by an average of 24.6 % for the ten subjects' data. The method can improve the precision performance of videokeratoscopy in multiple measurements of corneal topography.    A study was undertaken, to investigate whether there are significant changes in corneal topography during accommodation in normal corneas and corneas that are pathologically thinner due to keratoconus. This was done to eliminate the possibility that changes in corneal aberrations associated with near work could be at least partly due to corneal changes caused by the effects of accommodation. A videokeratoscope was modified to present an accommodation stimulus that was coaxial with the instrument's measurement axis. Six subjects with normal corneas and four subjects with keratoconus were studied. In the initial analysis it was found that a number of the subjects showed significant changes in corneal topography as accommodation changed. However further analysis showed a significant group mean excyclotorsion of the topography maps for both accommodation stimuli compared with the 0 D stimulus. When the excyclotorsion was accounted for, no clear evidence of statistically significant changes in corneal topography as a result of accommodation were found. A small ocular excyclotorsion typically accompanies accommodation and this changes the relative orientation of the topography of the cornea.  To investigate the effects of eyelid pressure on corneal shape and corneal aberrations during reading, twenty young subjects with normal ocular health were recruited. Cornea1 topography of one eye was measured with a videokeratoscope prior to reading and then again after a 60 minute reading task. Twelve of the twenty corneas showed significant changes in central topography immediately following reading. The location of the changes corresponded closely to the position and angle of the subject's eyelids during reading. Within the central region of the cornea there were significant changes in corneal wavefront Zernike coefficients, the root-mean-square error, overall refractive power and astigmatism. The changes observed in corneal topography appear to be directly related to the force exerted by the eyelids during reading. These findings may have important implications for the definition of refractive status and may also aid in the understanding of the relationship between reading and the development of refractive errors.    To study whether corneal distortions after reading significantly differ between refractive error groups, corneal aberrations were measured before and after a period of reading, for a group of ten young progressing myopes and a group of ten young stable emmetropes. The major difference between the two groups was the location and magnitude of the corneal distortions, which had a significantly larger effect on central corneal optics in the myopic group compared to the emmetropic group. A significantly smaller palpebral aperture for the myopic group in the reading gaze position was the cause of this difference.    The experiments described in this thesis have shown that numerous corneal characteristics can change due to eyelid forces during near work. The eye was shown to undergo a small cyclotorsion during higher levels of accommodation. There was a shift in direction of against the rule astigmatism of the cornea following reading and a change was found for primary vertical coma and trefoil. The changes in corneal shape following reading appear to be different in myope versus emmetropic refractive error groups. These findings are important for our understanding of the stability of the refractive error of the eye and could have important implications for refractive error development.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Videokeratoscope</field><field name="subject">Cornea</field><field name="subject">Corneal topography</field><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="subject">lid forces</field><field name="subject">aberrations</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15882/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Ethics of Art - An Exploration of the Role and Significance of Art/Artists in Health Care Settings</field><field name="creator">Woodhams, Elizabeth Jean Deshon Smith</field><field name="description">The presence of art and artists in health care settings raise many questions of an ethical nature.

In this research, factors that influence policies and practices of asset management within electricity transmission enterprises have been identified, in order to examine their interaction and how they impact the policies, practices and performance of transmission businesses.  It has been found that, while there is extensive literature on the economics of transmission regulation and pricing, there is little published research linking the engineering and financial aspects of transmission asset management at a management policy level.  To remedy this situation, this investigation has drawn on a wide range of literature, together with expert interviews and personal knowledge of the electricity industry, to construct a conceptual model of asset management with broad applicability across transmission enterprises in different parts of the world.  A concise representation of the model has been formulated using a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD).  To investigate the interactions between factors of influence it is necessary to implement the model and validate it against known outcomes. However, because of the nature of the data (a mix of numeric and non-numeric data, imprecise, incomplete and often approximate) and complexity and imprecision in the definition of relationships between elements, this problem is intractable to modelling by traditional engineering methodologies.  The solution has been to utilise techniques from other disciplines.  Two implementations have been explored: a multi-level fuzzy rule-based model and a system dynamics model; they offer different but complementary insights into transmission asset management. Each model shows potential for use by transmission businesses for strategic-level decision support.  The research demonstrates the key impact of routine maintenance effectiveness on the condition and performance of transmission system assets.  However, performance of the transmission network, is not only related to equipment performance, but is a function of system design and operational aspects, such as loading and load factor.  Type and supportiveness of regulation, together with the objectives and corporate culture of the transmission organisation also play roles in promoting various strategies for asset management.  The cumulative effect of all these drivers is to produce differences in asset management policies and practices, discernable between individual companies and at a regional level, where similar conditions have applied historically and today.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asset management</field><field name="subject">infrastructure management</field><field name="subject">electricity transmission systems</field><field name="subject">network performance</field><field name="subject">financial performance</field><field name="subject">fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">rule-based expert system</field><field name="subject">system dynamics modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15884/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Numerical Investigation Of A Two-Stroke Poppet-Valved Diesel Engine Concept</field><field name="creator">Teakle, Philip Robert</field><field name="description">Two-stroke poppet-valved engines may combine the high power density of two - stroke engines and the low emissions of poppet-valved engines. A two-stroke diesel engine can generate the same power as a four-stroke engine of the same size, but at higher (leaner) air/fuel ratios. Diesel combustion at high air/fuel ratios generally means hydrocarbons, soot and carbon monoxide are oxidised more completely to water and carbon dioxide in the cylinder, and the opportunity to increase the rate of exhaust gas recirculation should reduce the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx). The concept is being explored as a means of economically modifying diesel engines to make them cleaner and/or more powerful.    This study details the application of two computational models to this problem. The first model is a relatively simple thermodynamic model created by the author capable of rapidly estimating the behaviour of entire engine systems. It was used to estimate near-optimum engine system parameters at single engine operating points and over a six-mode engine cycle. The second model is a detailed CFD model called KIVA-ERC. It is a hybrid of the KIVA engine modelling package developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and combustion and emissions subroutines developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Engine Research Center. It was used for detailed scavenging and combustion simulations and to provide estimates of emissions levels. Both models were calibrated and validated for four-stroke cycle operation using experimental data. The thermodynamic model was used to provide initial and boundary conditions to the KIVA-ERC model. Conversely, the combustion simulations were used to adjust zero-dimensional combustion correlations when experimental data was not available. Scavenging simulations were performed with shrouded and unshrouded intake valves. A new two-zone scavenging model was proposed and validated using multidimensional scavenging simulations.    A method for predicting the behaviour of the two-stroke engine system based on four-stroke data has been proposed. The results using this method indicate that a four-stroke diesel engine with minor modifications can be converted to a two-stroke cycle and achieve substantially the same fuel efficiency as the original engine. However, emissions levels can not be predicted accurately without experimental data from a physical prototype. It is therefore recommended that such a prototype be constructed, based on design parameters obtained from the numerical models used in this study.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Two-stroke</field><field name="subject">poppet valves</field><field name="subject">KIVA</field><field name="subject">thermodynamic modelling</field><field name="subject">zero-dimensional modelling</field><field name="subject">multidimensional modelling</field><field name="subject">engine modelling</field><field name="subject">scavenging models</field><field name="subject">scavenging simulations</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15885/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing the Culture of Technically Oriented Public Sector Organisations: Transformation, Sedimentation or Hybridisation?</field><field name="creator">Waterhouse, Jennifer Marie</field><field name="description">Over the last two decades the public sector has been the target of significant change driven primarily by advocates of public choice theory who argue that the public sector is too large and inefficient.  Changes, grouped under the banner of New Public Management, have therefore been aimed at achieving greater financial accountability through the adoption of private sector management techniques and the opening up to competition of monopolistic government supplied services.    Recent reappraisals of these changes have suggested that they have failed to adequately address issues of social justice.  It has therefore been proposed that public sector organisations now need to consider more egalitarian methods of service delivery through greater public consultation and involvement in decision making processes.    Studies over the last 20 years in the public sector have tended to concentrate on change aimed at achieving New Public Management outcomes. This study adds to theory of culture and culture change in public sector organisations through exploring a change purposefully enacted to enable an organisation to meet both economic rationalist and egalitarian objectives.  The primary aim of this thesis is to explore a planned process of cultural change within a technically oriented, public sector organisation to determine the processes used to undertake such change, the resulting outcomes and why these outcomes occur.  A case study was used to investigate these areas.    The study was longitudinal and used a combination of methods including focus groups, interviews, non-participant observation and document analysis.  Historical data was first obtained to form a base from which to examine the process of planned change over a two year period.  This method allowed consideration of the impact of contextual changes on the planned process that resulted in some unintended consequences in regard to how change was being driven.    The findings conclude that models of planned change that include mechanisms through which diversity is encouraged may provide arenas through which conflict can act as a positive dynamic for change.  The outcome of the planned change evidences how a purposefully created hybrid organisational form may be capable of addressing the sometimes conflicting goals of economic rationalism and citizenship participation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public choice theory</field><field name="subject">public sector</field><field name="subject">social justice</field><field name="subject">egalitarian</field><field name="subject">new public management</field><field name="subject">economic rationalism</field><field name="subject">private sector management</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15886/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic Equity Management in the Australian Private Sector</field><field name="creator">French, Erica</field><field name="description">Developing equitable practices that provide fair access for all individuals to the benefits and burdens within an organisation remains a dilemma for management both in policy and practice.  Research continues to show that the employment status and representation of women is significantly less in relation to those of men.  Conflicting arguments on the causes of disparity and competing ideals on the value and means for addressing the disparity have resulted in a number of different opinions on the implementation and practice of equity management.  This dissertation contributes to the current knowledge of equity management, exploring contemporary equity management strategies, identifying the approaches of its implementation and analysing these against the outcomes for the status of women's employment.  The equity management practices of more that 1900 Australian Private Sector organisations are explored in order to identify the common themes of equity management.  Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factory Analysis are used to analyse the data.  A model of strategic equity management practice was developed that identifies different structures, strategies and distribution principles designed to address the disparity between men and women.  A major aim of this thesis was to explore the ability of a typological theory of equity management approaches to account for the differences in the status of women's employment.  The thesis proposes a typology of equity management approaches that explain the implementation of equity management strategies based on structure and process.  Four ideal-typical equity management approaches to achieving workplace parity are identified and explored.  The traditional (non-compliance), anti-discrimination, affirmative action and gender diversity approaches proposed inform the a priori Cluster Analysis process that grouped Australian organisations based on their use of the approaches to equity management.  Significant numbers of Australian organisations were identified utilising each of the identified approaches to equity management. It was further proposed that the different equity management approaches would be predictors of different outcomes for the employment status of women.  MANCOVA was used to analyse the equity management approaches (as the independent variables) and the data on the status of women's employment (as the dependent variables).  The findings indicate that the different approaches to equity management are predictors of different outcomes for the employment status of women.  Results show that the traditional approach to equity management, which includes the use of none of the equity management strategies identified, is not a predictor of increases in any of the employment measures of women.  The anti-discrimination approach, which includes the use of a limited number of equity management strategies identified, is a predictor of increases in some of the employment measures of women.  The affirmative action approach to equity management, which includes the use of a number of proactive equity management strategies identified, is a predictor of increases in the employment status of women across a number of measures.  The gender diversity approach to equity management, which includes the use of all the equity management strategies identified, is a limited predictor of increases in the employment status of women across some of the measures of employment. Managing the equity process within organisations is increasingly identified as an important tool in managing human resources in competitive, global environments that require productive workers and quality outputs.  If equity management is to provide an effective means of addressing disparity between men and women in organisations, this thesis argues for the development of a strategic process to address the specific issues of disparity and the particular needs of the individual and the explicit goals of the organisation in equal opportunity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equal Employment Opportunity</field><field name="subject">Anti-Discrimination</field><field name="subject">Affirmative Action</field><field name="subject">Managing Diversity</field><field name="subject">Equity Management</field><field name="subject">Strategic Equity Management</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15887/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioactivity Of Grafted Polytetrafluoroethylene Membranes</field><field name="creator">Suzuki, Shuko</field><field name="description">Polymeric surface modification has become an important technique over the last few decades in many areas, including medicine. It provides improved surface properties for specific applications without altering the bulk of the material. Graft copolymerisation is one technique which allows an existing polymer to covalently immobilise different monomers with or without new functional groups. Some polymeric implants are used as hard tissue substitutes for bone. However, the surface of the implant is often deficient in binding with hard tissue. Since phosphates are one of the building blocks of hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] or HAP, which is the main inorganic composition of bone, phosphate groups may be utilised on the surface of polymeric implants. This has the possible effect of directing bone formation at the material/tissue interface. The radiation-induced grafting of MOEP (methacryloyloxyethyl phosphate) onto ePTFE (expanded PTFE) has been carried out by a simultaneous irradiation technique in the presence of solvents. Two solvents and one mixed solvent system (in this study: methanol, MEK and a mixture of methanol, water and DCM) were used to dilute MOEP under various monomer concentrations and experiments were carried out using two different dose rates. The modified surfaces were characterised using the weight increase, XPS, FTIR-ATR, SEM, and contact angle measurement. The degree of grafting was found to be proportional to the monomer concentration but did not depend on the dose rates used. However, the grafting yield was strongly dependent upon the type of solvent used. The grafting decreased in the order: mixed solvent system &#187; MEK &gt; methanol. In addition, different morphologies of grafting were observed from SEM images depending on the solvent used. The samples prepared in methanol had a smooth morphology, whereas the samples obtained in MEK with a monomer concentration of greater than or equal to 10% w/v and with a mixed solvent system, had globular morphologies. A combination of in vitro tests onto three types of grafted membranes was performed (in this study: simulated body fluid (SBF), protein and cell attachment tests). Structure, composition and morphology of the calcium phosphate growth on the samples after 7 days of immersion in SBF were studied by SEM/EDX and FTIR-ATR. It was found that the growth of CaP onto the sample with low surface grafting (24%) and with a smooth morphology, was carbonated HAP. With the samples with higher grafting and globular morphologies, the inorganic minerals formed were less and had not HAP stoichiometric composition but were presumably Brushite and Octacalcium phosphate (OCP). The amount of protein adhesion in BSA solution (with 24 hours of immersion) and serum solution (with 1 hour of immersion) were determined gravimetrically and by XPS. In addition, the protein layer was investigated using FTIR-ATR. It was found that protein adsorption was highest on the surface with high grafting (100%) possibly due to the electrostatic interaction. Human osteoblast-like cell attachment and cell morphology (both after 3 hours) were examined by cellular protein synthesis assays and SEM. Cell attachment and morphology were also better on the samples with high grafting yield compared to that of low grafting, which follows the results of protein adsorption. The different in vitro tests do not agree, however, in all cases better bioactivity was found for grafted samples than that for untreated samples. This research emphasises the importance of using a series of in vitro tests to evaluate the bioactivity of materials. Although it is not clear as to what the optimum grafting conditions are at this stage, grafting of phosphate-containing monomer onto ePTFE has significantly improved the bioactivity in vitro.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymeric surface modification</field><field name="subject">graft copolymerisation</field><field name="subject">polymeric implants</field><field name="subject">grafting</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15888/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Great Divide : Ableism And Technologies Of Disability Production</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Fiona Anne Kumari</field><field name="description">Subjects designated by the neologism 'disability' typically experience various forms of marginality, discrimination and inequality.  The response by social scientists and professionals engaged in social policy and service delivery has been to combat the 'disability problem' by way of implementing anti-discrimination protections and various other compensatory initiatives. More recently, with the development of biological and techno-sciences such as  'new genetics', nanotechnologies and cyborgs the solution to 'disability' management has been in the form of utilizing technologies of early detection, eradication or at best, technologies of mitigation.  Contemporary discourses of disablement displace and disconnect discussion away from the 'heart of the problem', namely, matters ontological.  Disability - based marginality is assumed to emerge from a set of pre-existing conditions (i.e. in the case of biomedicalisation, deficiency inheres in the individual, whilst in the Social Model disablement is created by a capitalist superstructure). The Great Divide takes an alternative approach to studying 'the problem of disability' by proposing that the neologism 'disability' is in fact created by and used to generate notions and epistemologies of 'ableism'.  Whilst epistemologies of disablement are well researched, there is a paucity of research related to the workings of ableism. The focal concerns of The Great Divide relate to matters of ordering, disorder and constitutional compartmentalization between the normal and pathological and the ways that discourses about wholeness, health, enhancement and perfection produce notions of impairment. A central argument of this dissertation figures the production of disability as part of the tussle over ordering, emerging from a desire to create order from an assumed disorder; resulting in a flimsy but often unconvincing attempt to shore up so-called optimal ontologies and disperse outlaw ontologies. The Great Divide examines ways 'disability' rubs up against, mingles with and provokes other seemingly unrelated concepts such as wellness, ableness, perfection, competency, causation, productivity and use value.  The scaffolding of the dissertation directs the reader to selected sites that produce epistemologies of disability and ableism, namely the writing of 'history' and Judeo-Christian renderings of Disability. It explores the nuances of ableism (including a case study of wrongful life torts in law) and the phenomenon of internalized ableism as experienced by many disabled people. The study of liberalism and the government of government are explored in terms of enumeration, the science of 'counting cripples' and the battles over defining 'disability' in law and social policy. Additionally another axis of ableism is explored through the study of a number of perfecting technologies and the way in which these technologies mediate what it means to be 'human' (normalcy), morphs/simulates 'normalcy' and the leakiness of  'disability'. This analysis charts the invention of forearms transplantation (a la Clint Hallam), the Cochlear implant and transhumanism. The Great Divide concludes with an inversion of the ableist gaze(s) by proposing an ethic of affirmation, a desiring ontology of impairment.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ableism</field><field name="subject">Cyborgs</field><field name="subject">Disability Theory</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Embodiment</field><field name="subject">Legal Disability</field><field name="subject">New Technologies</field><field name="subject">Normalcy</field><field name="subject">Ontological Formations</field><field name="subject">Personhood</field><field name="subject">Science Studies</field><field name="subject">Theology</field><field name="subject">Wrongful Life</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15889/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour and Design of Sandwich Panels Subject to Local Buckling and Flexural Wrinkling Effects</field><field name="creator">Pokharel, Narayan</field><field name="description">Sandwich panels comprise a thick, light-weight plastic foam such as polyurethane, polystyrene or mineral wool sandwiched between two relatively thin steel faces. One or both steel faces may be flat, lightly profiled or fully profiled. Until recently sandwich panel construction in Australia has been limited to cold-storage buildings due to the lack of design methods and data. However, in recent times, its use has increased significantly due to their widespread structural applications in building systems. Structural sandwich panels generally used in Australia comprise of polystyrene foam core and thinner (0.42 mm) and high strength (minimum yield stress of 550 MPa and reduced ductility) steel faces bonded together using separate adhesives. Sandwich panels exhibit various types of buckling behaviour depending on the types of faces used. Three types of buckling modes can be observed which are local buckling of plate elements of fully profiled faces, flexural wrinkling of flat and lightly profiled faces and mixed mode buckling of lightly profiled faces due to the interaction of local buckling and flexural wrinkling. To study the structural performance and develop appropriate design rules for sandwich panels, all these buckling failure modes have to be investigated thoroughly. A well established analytical solution exists for the design of flat faced sandwich panels, however, the design solutions for local buckling of fully profiled sandwich panels and mixed mode buckling of lightly profiled sandwich panels are not adequate. Therefore an extensive research program was undertaken to investigate the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels and the mixed mode buckling behaviour of lightly profiled sandwich panels. The first phase of this research was based on a series of laboratory experiments and numerical analyses of 50 foam-supported steel plate elements to study the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels made of thin steel faces and polystyrene foam core covering a wide range of b/t ratios. The current European design standard recommends the use of a modified effective width approach to include the local buckling effects in design. However, the experimental and numerical results revealed that this design method can predict reasonable strength for sandwich panels with low b/t ratios (&lt; 100), but it predicts unconservative strengths for panels with slender plates (high b/t ratios). The use of sandwich panels with high b/t ratios is very common in practical design due to the increasing use of thinner and high strength steel plates. Therefore an improved design rule was developed based on the numerical results that can be used for fully profiled sandwich panels with any practical b/t ratio up to 600.  The new improved design rule was validated using six full-scale experiments of profiled sandwich panels and hence can be used to develop safe and economical design solutions.    The second phase of this research was based on a series of laboratory experiments and numerical analyses on lightly profiled sandwich panels to study the mixed mode buckling behaviour due to the interaction of local buckling and flexural wrinkling. The current wrinkling formula, which is a simple modification of the methods utilized for flat panels, does not consider the possible interaction between these two buckling modes. As the rib depth and width of flat plates between the ribs increase, flat plate buckling can occur leading to the failure of the entire panel due to the interaction between local buckling and wrinkling modes. Experimental and numerical results from this research confirmed that the current wrinkling formula for lightly profiled sandwich panels based on the elastic half-space method is inadequate in its present form. Hence an improved equation was developed based on validated finite element analysis results to take into account the interaction of the two buckling modes. This new interactive buckling formula can be used to determine the true value of interactive buckling stress for safe and economical design of lightly profiled sandwich panels. This thesis presents the details of experimental investigations and finite element analyses conducted to study the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels and the mixed mode buckling behaviour of lightly profiled sandwich panels. It includes development and validation of suitable numerical and experimental models, and the results. Current design rules are reviewed and new improved design rules are developed based on the results from this research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sandwich panels</field><field name="subject">fully profiled faces</field><field name="subject">lightly profiled faces</field><field name="subject">foam core</field><field name="subject">local buckling</field><field name="subject">flexural wrinkling</field><field name="subject">interactive buckling</field><field name="subject">slender plates</field><field name="subject">effective width</field><field name="subject">rib depth</field><field name="subject">flat plate width</field><field name="subject">experimental investigation</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15890/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Factors That Drive Success in Motion Picture Development : An Australian Context</field><field name="creator">Rossiter, Craig</field><field name="description">The motion picture industry is characterized by a high degree of artistic innovation that revolves around the project rather than the firm. Success is elusive and firms operate in an environment of symmetrical ignorance, that is, high levels of demand uncertainty as well as product uncertainty.  This makes managing the commercial development of new products difficult.  The study of the factors that drive success in new product development have been significant, however, little attention has been given to experiential and creatively driven products such as motion pictures.  While a number of studies have attempted to find accurate means to predict performance in motion pictures, most of these have met with limited results, yet few, if any, have linked the knowledge gained from the study of new product development with the industry.  Similarly, the impact of market orientation on firm performance and new product success has been the focus of much empirical research since the late 1980's and has been shown to be significantly associated with new product performance.  Here, the marketing literature and the NPD literature converge, yet few studies have attempted to study how the same concepts might apply in motion picture production.    The primary focus of this study was to explore the feasibility of the NPD and market orientation literature in the development of successful motion picture and whether or not similar application of this knowledge is tenable.  As such, the study centers around two broad research issues:    RESEARCH ISSUE 1: How can Australian films perform better?  In other words, what are the factors that drive success in Australian motion picture production?    RESEARCH ISSUE 2:  What is the role of the audience in the development of successful Motion Pictures in Australia?  Or in other words, do Australian filmmakers need to be "close" to their audience (market oriented) in order to attain higher levels of success. Australia has been used as a context primarily due to the accessibility of data. This represents a relatively new setting for the study of NPD and market orientation and a new industry.  Therefore, an exploratory study was designed which utilized in-depth interviews with experts from three sectors of the Australian motion picture industry.  This was deemed to be the best approach given the dearth of previous studies in this setting and the fact that the majority of past industry studies have been quantitative.  The findings reveal some support for a significant relationship between success and new product development activities such as product advantage, market orientation, up-front homework, early product definition, cross-functional and coordinated teams, and launch.  Product advantage, however, is better understood in terms of a movie's marketability and playability, that is, the perceived superiority of its attributes before and after its viewing.  A market orientation is likely to be more effective in the motion picture industry when it helps a firm lead its customers rather than encourages a firm to be led by them.  Finally, despite previous studies in the Australian industry, the number of scripts in development is unlikely to matter.  What matters is that the scripts that are ready to move into production are evaluated fully and that full support is provided to those that make it through in order to give them the best chance for success.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Product Development</field><field name="subject">Market Orientation</field><field name="subject">Strategic Orientation</field><field name="subject">Product Advantage</field><field name="subject">Services Marketing</field><field name="subject">Arts Marketing</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Marketability</field><field name="subject">Playability</field><field name="subject">Motion Pictures</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15891/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiritual Heritage : Understanding and Embodying Female Spirituality Through Creative Practice (1998-2004)</field><field name="creator">Goodrich, Elise</field><field name="description">This investigation into embodied female spirituality clearly required an approach which was able to holistically engage all human faculties - different aspects of mind, body, spirit, intuition and memory. Consequently it was essential to use my creative practice as an integrative aspect of the research. I have used my creative practice across health and healing, Sufi processes and light based media to investigate, develop and practice 'embodied female spirituality'. A shamanic-performance paradigm and feminism have been central, philosophically, to the study. In addition I have chosen to explicate the connections between these discourses of the body, the text and the imagery through my own story, my autobiography.   The methodology involves two research strategies; the use of creative practice as research and the use of autobiography as a research tool. The creative practice can be seen as a continuum of modalities, extending from the private to the public. Three dimensions of the practice will be discussed. The following is a description of the dimension of a typical session in (1) a body-based natural therapy treatment I deliver (2) a group-body-based Sufi session I deliver and (3) a brief outline of the approach I have taken to the research within light based media and a list of the works.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sufi</field><field name="subject">Drumming</field><field name="subject">Chanting</field><field name="subject">Chakras</field><field name="subject">Female Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Goddess Religions</field><field name="subject">Energy Serpent</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15892/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Place of a Lifetime</field><field name="creator">Doumenc, Jean-marc</field><field name="description">This autobiographic novella is part of longer novel, not yet written. The novel, &amp;quotLe temps d'une vie", has three parts, corresponding to three periods in the life of the character. This novella is the first part of the novel.    The story takes place in a small village south of France, between the Mediterranean Sea and the vineyards. A child, then a teenager, comes to his grand parents' house for holidays: Christmas, Easter and the long summer break. He meets grand parents, aunts, and an uncle. For him and his friends, the whole village and the countryside around are their playground. He experiences a life there quite different from his regular one in the city of Bordeaux with his parents.    The novella was first written in French, then translated into English by Dr Siobhan Brownlie. The translator and I discussed various problems that arose, the main issue being dealing with culturally specific terms in the French text. The novella was judged by Dr Donna Lee Brien not as a translation but as an original piece of writing, and she made suggestions for changes to the English text. I implemented some of these changes in order to produce a further version of the English text and finding some of the suggestions useful for the French text too, I implemented corresponding changes in the French text.    Dr Siobhan Brownlie wrote a paper about the translation process of this thesis, &amp;quotOriginal as Translation; Translation as Original". The paper has been published in &amp;quotUQ Vanguard", 2003, mini-series #3.

They are used to protect the front of a vehicle during minor impacts, and to attenuate the impact energy during major impacts. With the increased safety of modern passenger vehicles, the fitment of a FPS to a vehicle requires careful consideration to the design and installation of the FPS as they may modify vehicle crush characteristics. This is particularly important in vehicles fitted with air bags.  These community and industry concerns triggered the research discussed in this thesis, which is the first comprehensive project undertaken in this particular area.  This project generated comprehensive research knowledge on the impact response and energy absorption of FPS in order to evaluate performance. This involved a range of experimental testing supplemented by finite element analysis. Experimental testing was conducted using quasi-static and dynamic techniques to assess the overall performance of current FPS available. Finite element models were then generated and analysed using both implicit and explicit techniques, and calibrated against the experimental testing results. These models were used throughout the project to assess the FPS response, in particular the energy absorbed, to changes in impact characteristics.  FPS assessment guidelines were developed from the knowledge generated from the numerous FPS tests and analyses carried out in this research project. These guidelines have been used in the design and evaluation of a number of FPS for airbag compatibility. The real life performance of vehicles fitted with these FPS, have given confidence to the assessment criteria developed in this research project.  This project has demonstrated that FPS can be designed to complement the safety systems of modern passenger vehicles, and thus passenger safety. This would not have been possible without the comprehensive research carried out in this project.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Frontal Protection Systems</field><field name="subject">Bull bars</field><field name="subject">Impacts</field><field name="subject">Energy absorbed</field><field name="subject">Air bags</field><field name="subject">Quasistatic testing</field><field name="subject">Dynamic testing</field><field name="subject">Finite Element Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15894/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study For Orbit Representation And Simplified Orbit Determination Methods</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Ying Fu</field><field name="description">This research effort is concerned with the methods of simplified orbit determination and orbit representation and their applications for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite missions, particularly addressing the operational needs of the FedSat mission.  FedSat is the first Australian-built satellite in over thirty years. The microsatellite is approximately 50cm cubed with a mass of 58 kg. The satellite was successfully placed into a low-earth near-polar orbit at an altitude of 780km by the Japanese National Space Development Agency (NASDA) H-IIA launch vehicle on 14, December 2002. Since then, it has been streaming scientific data to its ground station in Adelaide almost daily. This information is used by Australian and international researchers to study space weather, to help improve the design of space computers, communication systems and other satellite technology, and for research into navigation and satellite tracking.  This research effort addresses four practical issues regarding the FedSat mission and operations.  First, unlike most satellite missions, the GPS receiver onboard FedSat operates in a duty-cycle mode due to the limitations of the FedSat power supply. This causes significant difficulties for orbit tracking, Precise Orbit Determination and scientific applications. A covariance analysis was performed before the mission launch to assess the orbit performance under different operational modes. The thesis presents the analysis methods and results.  Second, FedSat supports Ka-band tracking experiments that require a pointing accuracy of 0.03 degree. The QUT GPS group is obligated to provide the GPS precise orbit solution to meet this requirement. Ka-band tracking requests satellite orbital position at any instant time with respect to any of the observation stations. Because orbit determination and prediction software only provide satellite orbital data at a discrete time point, it is necessary to find a way to represent the satellite orbit as a continuous trajectory with discrete observation data, able to obtain the position of the satellite at the time of interest. For this purpose, an orbit interpolation algorithm using the Chebyshev polynomial was developed and applied to Ka-band tracking applications. The thesis will describe the software and results.  Third, since the launch of FedSat, investigators have received much flight GPS data. Some research was invested in the analysis of FedSat orbit performance, GPS data quality and the quality of the onboard navigation solutions. Studies have revealed that there are many gross errors in the FedSat onboard navigation solution (ONS). Although the 1-sigma accuracy of each component is about 20 m, there are more than 11 %positioning errors that fall outside +/-50m, and 5% of the errors are outside the 100mbound. The 3D RMS values would be 35m, 87m, and 173m for the above three cases respectively. The FedSat ONS uncertainties are believed to be approximately three times greater than those from other satellite missions.  Due to the high percentage of outlier solutions, it would be dangerous to use these without first applying data detection and exclusion procedures. Therefore, this thesis presents two simplified orbit determination methods that can improve the ONS. One is the &amp;quotgeometric method", which makes use of delta-position solutions derived from carrier phase differences between two epochs to smooth the code-based navigation solutions. The algorithms were tested using SAC-C GPS data and showing some improvement. The second method is the &amp;quotdynamic method", which uses orbit dynamics information for orbit improvements.  Fourth, the FedSat ground tracking team at Adelaide use the NORAD TLE orbit for daily FedSat tracking. Research was undertaken to convert an orbit trajectory into these Two Line Elements (TLE). Algorithms for the estimation of TLE solutions from the FedSat onboard GPS navigation solutions are outlined. Numerical results have shown the effects of the unmodelled forces/perturbations in the SPG4 models for the FedSat orbit determination would reach a level of &#177;1000m. This only includes the orbit representation errors with TLE data sets. The total FedSat orbit propagation should include both the orbit propagation and orbit representation terms. The analysis also demonstrates that the orbit presentation error can be reduced to &#177;200m and &#177;100mlevels with the EGM4x4 and EGM10x10 gravity field models respectively. This can meet the requirements for Ka-band tracking. However, a simplified tracking program based on numerical integration has to be developed to replace the SPG4 models.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">FedSat</field><field name="subject">satellite</field><field name="subject">orbit</field><field name="subject">tracking</field><field name="subject">NORAD</field><field name="subject">GPS navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15895/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intrinsically Safe (IS) Active Power Supplies</field><field name="creator">Walpole, Mark Edward</field><field name="description">Intrinsically safe (IS) active power supplies subjected to certain transient load conditions can deliver power to a circuit at significantly higher levels than indicated on their nameplate ratings. During a transient load such as an intermittent short-circuit, energy is transferred from the power supply to the short-circuit and an electrical arc may form when the short-circuit is applied or removed. This poses a spark ignition risk as energy is transferred from the arc to the surrounding atmosphere.    Currently various International and Australian Standards define the performance requirements for IS electrical apparatus. A duly accredited laboratory is required to establish the intrinsic safety compliance of an apparatus with the Standards. It involves an assessment of the apparatus and may include testing. The assessment of the apparatus determines adequate segregation, separation, construction, and selection of components. The tests performed on the apparatus include a temperature rise test and in some cases, the sparking potential of the circuit is tested using the spark test apparatus (STA). Testing the sparking potential of active power supplies to establish compliance adds significantly to the time and costs involved in establishing compliance.    A new alternative assessment method is proposed in this report to augment or replace the testing phase of the compliance certification process for active power supplies. The proposed alternative assessment method (PAAM) is derived from a determination of the steady-state and transient output characteristics of the active power supply under consideration. Parameters such as peak output current, time constant of peak current decay, and the output voltages at these times are measured from the circuit's output characteristics. These measurements can subsequently be used to derive the topology and component values of an equivalent circuit. The resulting equivalent circuit is then considered like a linear power supply and the sparking potential can be determined using existing assessment methods.    This thesis investigates in detail the equivalent circuit of a number of direct current (DC) active power supplies whose transient output characteristics exhibit predominantly capacitive behaviour. The results of the PAAM using the equivalent circuit are then compared with results achieved using the current testing procedure with a STA. A small sample of active power supplies is used to generate data from which a relationship between the current testing procedure and the PAAM can be established.    The PAAM developed in this research project can be used as a pre-compliance check by designers, manufacturers, or IS testing stations. A failure of this test would indicate that the active power supply's sparking energy is not low enough to be regarded as intrinsically safe. The PAAM requires fewer resources to establish a result than the STA. The benefits of a simplified spark ignition test would flow on from designers and manufacturers to end users.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intrinsic safety</field><field name="subject">intrinsically safe</field><field name="subject">active power supply</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">equivalent circuit</field><field name="subject">intrinsic safety Standards</field><field name="subject">intrinsic safety assessment method</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15896/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structuring And Modeling Knowledge In The Context Of Enterprise Systems</field><field name="creator">Chan, Tack Wai</field><field name="description">In recent years, the Information Technology (IT) industry has been overwhelmed by a new class of packaged application software collectively known as Enterprise Systems (ES). Enterprise Systems are comprehensive business operating systems that weave together all the data within an organisation's business processes and associated functional areas. In particular, ES provide organisations with the ability to manage data and information in a real-time environment and to integrate operations between various departments; capacities that had been previously unrealized in traditional information systems. ES have since been established as an integral development in the Information Systems (IS) field and extensively studied by academics. The implementation and operation of ES are known to be complex and costly installations that require knowledge and expertise from various areas and sources. The knowledge necessary for managing ES is diverse and varied; it extends from the application of knowledge in different phases of the ES life cycle to the exchange of knowledge between ES vendors, clients and consultants. The communication of knowledge between the various agents adds another dimension to the complex nature of ES. Thus, ES clients have been motivated to reduce costs and retain ES knowledge within the organisation. Research has been conducted on the critical success factors and issues involved in implementing ES. These studies often address the lack of appropriate in-house ES knowledge and the need to actively manage ES-related knowledge. With motivation from another area of research known as Knowledge Management, academia and industry have strived to provide solutions and strategies for managing ES-related knowledge. However, it is often not clear what this 'knowledge' is, what type(s) of knowledge is relevant, who possesses the type(s) of knowledge and how knowledge can be instituted to facilitate the execution of processes.  This research aims to identify the relevant knowledge in the context of Enterprise Systems. The types of knowledge required for ES are derived by studying the knowledge (techne)1 for different ES roles, managers and implementation consultants. This provides a perspective for understanding how ES knowledge can be structured. By applying a process modeling approach, the understanding of the relation of ES knowledge to roles and business processes thus gained will demonstrate how knowledge can be modeled. The understanding of ES knowledge and how it can be managed is first formalized by the development of a conceptual framework based on the existing literature. An exploratory study found that the identification of ES knowledge was necessary before the other activities in the knowledge management dimension could be effected. As an appropriate concept of knowledge could not be derived from the IS literature, the concept of techne emerged from a more comprehensive literature review. Techne ('art' or 'applied science' or 'skill') is defined as the trained ability of rationally producing, i.e. the ability to produce something reliably, under a variety of conditions, on the basis of reasoning. This involves having knowledge, or having what seems to be knowledge (awareness) of whatever principles and patterns one relies on. With this foundation, the main focus of the research is on the content analysis of the most popular implementation tool for Enterprise Systems management, ValueSAP. This tool is studied with respect to the types of knowledge (techne), roles and activities in ES implementation. The analysis of ValueSAP thus contributes to the understanding of the structure and distribution of knowledge in ES projects. Consequently, case studies were conducted to understand how the derived ES knowledge can be instituted in business processes using process modeling techniques. This part of the study demonstrates the modeling perspective of the research. 1. The terms 'knowledge' and 'skills' will be used interchangeably for the context of this thesis; where the term 'knowledge' is mentioned, the author refers to the skills required in the ES context. This section is further elaborated in Chapter 2 on techne and skills.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Enterprise Systems</field><field name="subject">Process Modeling</field><field name="subject">Software Implementation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15897/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Structural Investigation of Monocoque Fibre Composite Trusses</field><field name="creator">Humphreys, Matthew</field><field name="description">Fibre composite materials are gaining recognition in civil engineering applications as a viable alternative to traditional materials. Their migration from customary automotive, marine, aerospace and military industries into civil engineering has continued to gain momentum over the last three decades as new civil engineering applications develop. The use of fibre composite materials in civil engineering has now evolved from non-structural applications, such as handrails and cladding, into primary structural applications such as building frames, bridge decks and concrete reinforcement. However, there are issues which are slowing the use of fibre composite materials into civil engineering. Issues include high costs, difficulties in realising potential benefits, general lack of civil engineers' familiarity with the material and relatively little standardisation in the composites industry. For composites to truly offer a viable alternative to traditional construction materials in the civil engineering marketplace, it is essential that these issues be addressed. It is proposed that this situation could be improved by demonstrating that potential benefits offered by composites can be achieved with familiar civil engineering forms. These forms must be well suited to fibre composite materials and be able to produce safe and predictable civil engineering structures with existing structural engineering methods.    Of the numerous structural forms currently being investigated for civil engineering applications, the truss form appears particularly well suited to fibre composites. The truss is a familiar structural engineering form which possesses certain characteristics that make it well suited to fibre composite materials. In this research a novel monocoque fibre composite truss concept was developed into a working structure and investigated using analytical and experimental methods. To the best of the author's knowledge the research presented in this thesis represents the first doctoral research into a structure of this type. This thesis therefore presents the details of the development of the monocoque fibre composite (MFC) truss concept into a working structure.    The developed MFC truss was used as the basis for a detailed investigation of the structural behaviour of the MFC truss elements and the truss as a whole. The static structural behaviour of the principal MFC truss elements (tension members, compression members and joints) was investigated experimentally and analytically. Physical testing required the design and fabrication of a number of novel test rigs. Well established engineering principles were used along with complex finite element models to predict the behaviour of the tested truss elements and trusses. Results of the theoretical analysis were compared with experimental results to determine how accurately their static structural behaviour could be predicted. It was found that the static structural behaviour of all three principal truss elements could be accurately predicted with existing engineering methods and finite element analysis. The knowledge gained from the investigation of the principal truss elements was then used in an investigation of the structural behaviour of the MFC truss. Three full-scale MFC trusses were fabricated in the form of conventional Pratt, Howe and Warren trusses and tested to destruction. The investigation included detailed finite element modelling of the full-scale trusses and the results were compared to the full-scale test results. Results of the investigation demonstrated that the familiar Pratt, Howe and Warren truss forms could be successfully manufactured with locally available fibre composite materials and existing manufacturing technology. The static structural behaviour of these fibre composite truss forms was accurately predicted with well established engineering principles and finite element analysis.    A successful marriage between fibre composite materials and a civil engineering structure has been achieved. Monocoque fibre composite trusses have been developed in the familiar Pratt, Howe and Warren truss forms. These structures possess characteristics that make them well suited to applications as primary load bearing structures.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">civil engineering</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">structural engineering</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">fibre composites</field><field name="subject">truss structures</field><field name="subject">Pratt truss</field><field name="subject">Howe truss</field><field name="subject">Warren truss</field><field name="subject">glass fibre</field><field name="subject">carbon fibre</field><field name="subject">epoxy resin</field><field name="subject">particulate filled resin</field><field name="subject">fibre composites in civil engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15898/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical Guidance in Motor Learning</field><field name="creator">Howard III, James Thomas</field><field name="description">Previous studies of physical guidance (PG - physically constraining error during practice of a motor task) have found it to be ineffective in enhancing motor learning.  However, most studies have used a highly constraining form of physical guidance that may have encouraged undue dependency. In addition, previous research has not fully considered the interaction between visual feedback and PG, and many of the studies have failed to use standard delayed retention tests with knowledge of results unavailable (no-KR).  The current experiment examine the effects of varying levels of constraint in PG, as well as the interaction of PG and visual guidance (VG), using no-KR retention tests.    This study involved 99 subjects divided into nine acquisition trial condition groups, forming from a 3 x 3 factorial design with factors of PG x VG, each presented at levels designated as tight, bandwidth, or none.  Subjects undertook a two-dimensional pattern drawing task with no KR, PG, or VG as a pre-test, before completing 100 practice trials under one of the nine conditions.  The same test was given as a retention test (immediately after practice) and as a delayed retention test (two days later).  A transfer test, using a different pattern, was also administered on the second day.  	Almost all groups performed better on the immediate transfer test than they had on the pre-test.  However, after two days only three groups (PG bandwidth-VG tight, PG none-VG bandwidth, and PG none-VG none) retained this improvement and only two groups (PG bandwidth-VG bandwidth and PG none-VG none) performed significantly better on the transfer task than their pre-test.  It is proposed that bandwidth guidance generally promotes learning and that bandwidth physical guidance may enhance proprioceptive cues.  Independent of PG and VG effects, KR (an overall error score) also facilitated learning.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical guidance</field><field name="subject">visual guidance</field><field name="subject">motor learning</field><field name="subject">visual dominance</field><field name="subject">knowledge of results</field><field name="subject">knowledge of performance</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15899/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic Information Warfare : Analysis of the relationship between the protection of Financial Information Infrastructure and Australia's National Security</field><field name="creator">Deakin, Robert Luke</field><field name="description">The thesis presents an argument for the re-alignment of Australia's National Security efforts so that they mirror the changes occurring in our economy and society. Specifically, it seeks outcomes that can focus our efforts in protecting the critical infrastructure including our financial information infrastructure, from new and emerging threats.    The thesis presents a definition of security as it applies to the Nation-State and provides the evidence of the changes in conflict and global security. It outlines the changes in the National Security environment and identifies emerging forms of conflict that effect national economic systems, and financial information infrastructures. It shows how the traditional view of National Security is being eroded by the Information Age. To support this argument a view of the key forces that are changing weapons, warfare, and approaches to National Security are provided. The thesis presents a view of the unconventional threats to economic systems. In particular, it describes the targeting of critical national information infrastructures including energy, banking and finance, transportation, vital human services, and telecommunications.    The thesis outlines concern regarding the vulnerability of developed nations' social structures through increasing dependence on information and communications technology (ICT) systems, and the small population of specialist that support and protect it. The thesis argues that this dependency exposes national and global economies to new threats and forms of attack.    The thesis consists of an overview of the evolution National Security approaches. In particular, it examines collective security and security concepts as they relates to the Nation-State. It identifies a number of drivers, which outline the changing nature of the global security environment. The thesis describes asymmetric warfare and discusses Information Warfare (IW), describing its elements and goals. An analysis of offensive and defensive information warfare, strategies, and operations is provided. This is then related to economic systems and how they have featured in conflicts between nations throughout history. The information and communications technology (ICT) that underpin the financial environment (in particular payment systems) are reviewed and the thesis closes by focusing on the elements of economic infrastructure assets and types of attacks from which they require protection.    We conclude that the challenges for Critical Infrastructure protection in Australia are daunting and a number of recommendations are made that should be considered in light of the rapidly changing security environment. The challenges of Information Warfare will stretch Australia's resources, require re-conceptualising of our national defence forces, greater participation of the private sector, and changes in our daily lives.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National Security</field><field name="subject">War</field><field name="subject">Defence</field><field name="subject">Economic Warfare</field><field name="subject">Future Wars</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15900/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Globalisation Of Regulation And Its Impact On The Domain Name System : Domain Names And A New Regulatory Economy</field><field name="creator">Williams, Elizabeth A.</field><field name="description">This is a multidisciplinary work that encompasses considerations of politics, regulation and technology.  It considers the impact of technology on the way in which, politically, we are able to regulate technology and how we devise policy to guide that regulation.  The added complication is that Internet technology knows no jurisdiction.  The rulemaking established in recent years is globally applicable and is carried out without the direct involvement of national governments in the key decision making processes, particularly in the environment under examination here which focuses on the management of the technical resources of the Internet.    In formulating the hypothesis that grounds this work, I have focused on two things.  Firstly, that technical regulation has political, and therefore, policy implications.  Secondly, that where there are policy implications with direct commercial impact, we can expect to see the vigorous involvement of corporations as they manage the environment in which they do business.  These two critical conditions have driven the formulation of policies and procedures for making decisions about Internet governance.  They have also driven the actual decisions which have been implemented, to a greater or lesser degree of success.    This research contributes to the scholarship in four significant ways.  The first is that the Internet Domain Name System (IDNS) and its governance present a new perspective on the discussion of the globalisation of business regulation.  The data used to support the analysis has not been collated or examined previously and is presented here to illustrate the extension of the literature and to frame the hypothesis.    The second is that I have found that national governments have, despite ongoing control within their national jurisdiction, little effective influence over the management and governance of the Domain Name System (DNS) at an international level.  Thirdly, I have found that corporations have significant power to determine the way in which policies for the management of the technical resources of the Internet are discussed, developed to consensus policy positions, implemented and reviewed.  Finally, the research has opened up new lines of inquiry into the rise of a new class of bureaucrats, the cosmocrats and their cosmocracy, on which further research continues.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Globalisation Of Regulation</field><field name="subject">The Domain Name System</field><field name="subject">Internet Governance</field><field name="subject">Information Technology</field><field name="subject">Critical Infrastructure Protection</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15901/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Petrogenesis Of The Station Creek Igneous Complex And Associated Volcanics, Northern New England Orogen</field><field name="creator">Tang, Eng Hoo Joseph</field><field name="description">The Station Creek Igneous Complex (SCIC) is one of the largest Middle-Late Triassic plutonic bodies in the northern New England Orogen of Eastern Australia. The igneous complex comprises of five plutons - the Woonga Granodiorite (237 Ma), Woolooga Granodiorite (234 Ma), Rush Creek Granodiorites (231 Ma) and Gibraltar Quartz Monzodiorite and Mount Mucki Diorite (227 Ma respectively), emplaced as high-level or epizonal bodies within the Devonian-Carboniferous subduction complex that resulted from a westward subduction along the east Australian margin. Composition of the SCIC ranges from monzogabbro to monzogranite, and includes diorite, monzodiorite, quartz monzodiorite and granodiorite. 	The SCIC has the typical I-type granitoid mineralogy, geochemistry and isotopic compositions. Its geochemistry is characteristics of continental arc magma, and has a depleted-upper mantle signature with up to 14 wt% supracrustal components (87Sr/86Srinitial = 0.70312 to 0.70391; &#61541;Nd = +1.35 to +4.9; high CaO, Sr, MgO; and low Ni, Cr, Ba, Rb, Zr, Nb, Ga and Y). The SCIC (SiO2 47%-76%) has similar Nd and Sr isotopic values to island-arc and continentalised island-arc basalts, which suggests major involvement of upper mantle sourced melts in its petrogenesis. SCIC comprises of two geochemical groups - the Woolooga-Rush Greek Granodiorite group (W-RC) and the Mount Mucki Diorite-Gibraltar Quartz Monzodiorite group (MMD-GQM). The W-RC Group is high-potassium, calc-alkalic and metaluminous, whereas the MMD-GQM Group is medium to high potassium, transitional calc-alkalic to tholeiitic and metaluminous. The two geochemical groups of the SCIC magmas are generated from at least two distinct sources - an isotopically evolved Neoproterozoic mantle-derived source with greater supracrustal component (10-14 wt%), and an isotopically primitive mafic source with upper mantle affinity. Petrogenetic modeling using both major and trace elements established that the variations within respective geochemical group resulted from fractional crystallisation of clinopyroxene, amphibole and plagioclase from mafic magma, and late fractionation of alkalic and albitic plagioclase in the more evolved magma. 	Volcanic rocks associated with SCIC are the North Arm Volcanics (232 Ma), and the Neara Volcanics (241-242 Ma) of the Toogoolawah Group. The major and trace element geochemistry of the North Arm Volcanics is similar to the SCIC, suggesting possible co-magmatic relationship between the SCIC and the volcanic rock. The age of the North Arm Volcanics matches the age of the fractionated Rush Creek Granodiorite, and xenoliths of the pluton are found within epiclastic flows of the volcanic unit. The Neara Volcanics (87Sr/86Sr= 0.70152-0.70330, 143Nd/144Nd = 0.51253-0.51259) differs isotopically from the SCIC, indicating a source region within the HIMU mantle reservoir (commonly associated with contaminated upper mantle by altered oceanic crust). The Neara Volcanics is not co-magmatic to the SCIC and is derived from partial melting upper-mantle with additional components from the subducting oceanic plate. 	The high levels emplacement of an isotopically primitive mantle-derived magma of the SCIC suggest periods of extension during the waning stage of convergence associated with the Hunter Bowen Orogeny in the northern New England Orogen. The geochemical change between 237 to 227 Ma from a depleted-mantle source with diminishing crustal components, to depleted-mantle fractionate, reflects a fundamental change in the source region that can be related to the tectonic styles. The decreasing amount of supracrustal component suggests either thinning of the subduction complex due to crustal attenuation, leading to the late Triassic extension that enables mantle melts to reach subcrustal levels.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Petrogenesis</field><field name="subject">petrography</field><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="subject">Station Creek Igneous Complex</field><field name="subject">Mount Mucki Diorite</field><field name="subject">Gibraltar Quartz Monzodiorite</field><field name="subject">Woolooga Granodiorite</field><field name="subject">Rush Creek Granodiorite</field><field name="subject">Woonga Granodiorite</field><field name="subject">Wratten Igneous Suite</field><field name="subject">andesitic volcanics</field><field name="subject">Highbury Volcanics</field><field name="subject">Neara Volcanics</field><field name="subject">North Arm Volcanics</field><field name="subject">evolution of magma</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">stable isotopes</field><field name="subject">radiogenic isotopes</field><field name="subject">trace elements</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">fractional crystallisation</field><field name="subject">differentiation</field><field name="subject">mineral chemistry</field><field name="subject">geothermometry</field><field name="subject">geobarometry</field><field name="subject">emplacement conditions</field><field name="subject">mantle and lithospheric mantle sources</field><field name="subject">mantle melting</field><field name="subject">mafic underplating</field><field name="subject">continental margin</field><field name="subject">calc-alkalic</field><field name="subject">crustal assimilation</field><field name="subject">magma evolution</field><field name="subject">39Ar/40Ar dating</field><field name="subject">tectonic classification</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15902/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying Children At Risk Of Developing Mental Health Problems : Screening For Family Risk Factors In The School Setting</field><field name="creator">Dwyer, Sarah Blyth</field><field name="description">Children's mental health problems are a significant public health concern. They are costly to society in both human and financial terms. This thesis contributes to the 'science of prevention' by examining issues related to the identification of children at risk of mental health problems. In particular, it was of interest to determine whether 'at-risk' children could be identified before the development of significant behavioural or emotional problems. Three areas were explored: family risk factors that predict the development of children's mental health problems, teachers' ability to identify family risk factors, and parent- and teacher-report screening methods.    Data were collected from the parents and teachers of over 1000 children in preschool to Year 3 as part of the Promoting Adjustment in Schools (PROMAS) Project. Parents and teachers each completed two questionnaires at two time points, one year apart. Parents completed the Family Risk Factor Checklist - Parent (FRFCP) and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the equivalent instruments for teachers were, respectively, the Family Risk Factor Checklist - Teacher (FRFC-T) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF). The FRFC-P and FRFC-T were original to the current research and were designed to assess children's exposure to multiple family risk factors across five domains: adverse life events and instability (ALI), family structure and socioeconomic status (SES), parenting practices (PAR), parental verbal conflict and mood problems (VCM), and parental antisocial and psychotic behaviour (APB).    Paper 1 investigated the psychometric properties of the FRFC-P and the  potential for its use at a population-level to establish community risk factor profiles  that subsequently inform intervention planning. The FRFC-P had satisfactory test-retest reliability and construct validity, but modest internal consistency. Risk assessed  by the PAR domain was the most important determinant of mental health problem  onset, while the PAR, VCM, and APB domains were the strongest predictors of  mental health problem persistence. This risk factor profile suggests that, for the  studied population, the largest preventive effects may be achieved through addressing  parenting practices.    Paper 2 examined teachers' knowledge of children's exposure to family risk factors using the FRFC-T. While teachers had accurate knowledge of children's exposure to risk factors within the ALI and SES domains, they had poor knowledge of children's exposure to risk factors within the PAR, VCM, or APB domains - the types of risk factors found in Paper 1 to be the most strongly related to children's mental health problems. Nevertheless, teachers' knowledge of children's exposure to risk factors within the ALI and SES domains predicted children's mental health problems at one year follow-up even after accounting for children's behaviour at the first assessment.    Paper 3 investigated the potential of both the FRFC-P and FRFC-T for identifying individual, at-risk children. The accuracy of the FRFC in predicting internalising versus externalising disorders was compared against behavioural and simple nomination screening methods. For both parents and teachers, the behavioural screening methods were superior, however, the simple nomination method also showed promise for teachers. Both parents and teachers were more accurate at identifying children at risk of externalising mental health problems than children at risk of internalising problems. The performance of the FRFC and simple nomination methods in identifying children for selective interventions, before the development of significant behavioural or emotional problems, was also tested. Both the FRFC and simple nomination methods showed only modest predictive accuracy for these children.    Combined, the results suggest that while on the one hand, the FRFC is useful for population level screening to inform intervention planning, on the other hand, it falls short of achieving good predictive accuracy for individual children. Future research should investigate ways to optimise predictive accuracy for individual children, particularly those at risk of developing internalising disorders. One option may be to use the FRFC in conjunction with behavioural screening methods. The challenge is to develop accurate screening methods that remain practical to complete at a population level. Finally, this body of research provides insight into the feasibility of offering selective preventive interventions within the school setting. While significant obstacles remain, there were several promising indications that using screening methods such as FRFC-T or simple nomination, teachers may be able to identify children earlier on the developmental pathway, before significant behavioural or emotional symptoms have developed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childhood insanity</field><field name="subject">mental health problems</field><field name="subject">at-risk children</field><field name="subject">screening methods</field><field name="subject">preventative interventions</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15903/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imaging And Radiation Interactions Of Polymer Gel Dosimeters</field><field name="creator">Trapp, Jamie Vincent</field><field name="description">Aim:  The past two decades have seen a large body of work dedicated to the development of a three dimensional gel dosimetry system for the recording of radiation dose distributions in radiation therapy. The purpose of much of the work to date has been to improve methods by which the absorbed dose information is extracted. Current techniques include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical tomography, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound. This work examines CT imaging as a method of evaluating polymer gel dosimeters.    Apart from publications resulting from this work, there has been only two other journal articles to date reporting results of CT gel dosimetry. This indicates that there is still much work required to develop the technique. Therefore, the aim of this document is to develop CT gel dosimetry to the extent that it is of use to clinical and research physicists.    Scope:  Each chapter in this document describes an aspect of CT gel dosimetry which was examined; with Chapters 2 to 7 containing brief technical backgrounds for each aspect. Chapter 1 contains a brief review of gel dosimetry.    The first step in the development of any method for reading a signal is to determine whether the signal can actually be obtained. However, before polymer gel dosimeters can be imaged using a CT scanner, imaging techniques are required which are employable to obtain reliable readings. Chapter 2 examines the various artifacts inherent in CT which interfere with the quantitative analysis of gel dosimeters and a method for their removal is developed. The method for artifact reduction is based on a subtraction technique employed previously in a feasibility study and a system is designed to greatly simplify the process. The simplification of the technique removes the requirement for accurate realignment of the phantom within the scanner and the imaging of calibration vials is enabled.    Having established a method by which readings of polymer gel dosimeters can be obtained with CT, Chapter 3 examines the CT dose response. A number of formulations of polymer gel dosimeter are studied by varying the constituent chemicals and their concentrations. The results from this chapter can be employed to determine the concentration of chemicals when manufacturing a polymer gel dosimeter with a desired CT dose response.    With the CT dose response characterised in Chapter 3, the macroscopic cause of the CT signal is examined in Chapter 4. To this end direct measurement of the linear attenuation coefficient is obtained with a collimated radiation source and detector. Density is measured by Archimedes' principle. Comparison of the two results shows that the cause of the CT signal is a density change and the implications for polymer gel dosimetry are discussed.    The CT scanner is revisited in Chapter 5 to examine the CT imaging techniques required for optimal performance. The main limitation of the use of CT in gel dosimetry to date has been image noise. In Chapter 5 stochastic noise is investigated and reduced. The main source of non-stochastic noise in CT is found and imaging techniques are examined which can greatly reduce this residual noise. Predictions of computer simulations are verified experimentally.    Although techniques for the reduction of noise are developed in Chapter 5, there may be situations where the noise must be further reduced. An image processing algorithm is designed in Chapter 6 which employs a combination of commonly available image filters. The algorithm and the filters are tested for their suitability in gel dosimetry through the use of a simulated dose distribution and by performing a pilot study on an irradiated polymer gel phantom.    Having developed CT gel dosimetry to the point where a suitable image can be obtained, the final step is to investigate the uncertainty in the dose calibration. Methods used for calibration uncertainty in MRI gel dosimetry to date have either assumed a linear response up to a certain dose, or have removed the requirement for linearity but incorrectly ignored the reliability of the data and fit of the calibration function. In Chapter 7 a method for treatment of calibration data in CT gel dosimetry is proposed which allows for non-linearity of the calibration function, as well as the goodness of its fit to the data. Alternatively, it allows for the reversion to MRI techniques if linearity is assumed in a limited dose range.    Conclusion:  The combination of the techniques developed in this project and the newly formulated normoxic gels (not extensively studied here) means that gel dosimetry is close to becoming viable for use in the clinic. The only capital purchase required for a typical clinic is a suitable water tank, which is easily and inexpensively producible if the clinic has access to a workshop.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">X-ray computed tomography</field><field name="subject">Gel dosimetry</field><field name="subject">Radiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Image processing</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Linear attenuation coefficient</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15904/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development Of Microalgae As A Bioreactor System For The Production Of Recombinant Proteins</field><field name="creator">Walker, Tara L.</field><field name="description">Dunaliella, a genus of unicellular, biflagellate green algae, is one of the most studied microalgae for mass culture and is of commercial importance as a source of natural &#61538;-carotene. Dunaliella species have the desirable properties of halotolerance and photoautotrophy that makes their large-scale culture simple and cheap using resources unsuitable for conventional agriculture. The ease and cost-effectiveness of culture makes Dunaliella a desirable target for increased production of natural compounds by metabolic engineering or for exploitation as biological factories for the synthesis of novel high-value compounds. However, the lack of efficient genetic transformation systems has been a major limitation in the manipulation of these microalgae.  In chapter four we describe the development of a nuclear transformation system for Dunaliella tertiolecta. The gene encoding the phleomycin-binding protein from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus, was chosen as the selectable marker as this protein retains activity at high salt concentrations. To drive expression of the chosen selectable marker, two highly expressed Dunaliella tertiolecta RbcS genes and their associated 5' and 3' regulatory regions were isolated and characterised (chapter three). Dunaliella transformation cassettes containing the RbcS promoter and terminator regions flanking the ble antibiotic resistance gene were constructed. These expression cassettes were tested in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells and found to drive expression of the ble gene in this heterologous system. This study also demonstrated that truncation of both the D. tertiolecta RbcS1 and RbcS2 regulatory regions significantly increases the expression of the ble gene in C. reinhardtii cells.  To determine if the foreign DNA could stably integrate into the Dunaliella genome, four transformation methods: microprojectile bombardment, glass bead-mediated transformation, PEG-mediated transformation and electroporation were tested and a number of parameters varied. Southern blot analysis revealed that the plasmid DNA transiently entered the Dunaliella cells following electroporation but was rapidly degraded. Following electroporation, one stably transformed Dunaliella line was recovered. This is the first demonstration of the stable transformation of this alga.  Chloroplast transformation is becoming a favoured method for the production of recombinant proteins in plants, as levels of heterologous protein are often higher than those achieved by transforming the nucleus. The Dunaliella chloroplast genome has not been genetically characterised, and thus there were no existing promoter and terminator sequences or sequences of intergenic regions that could be used for vectors in transformation of the chloroplast. Therefore, this study aimed to isolate and characterise promoters of highly expressed genes and matching terminators capable of driving transgene expression, and also to characterise intergenic regions that would be suitable insertion sites for the vector construct (chapter five). The complete gene sequence of two highly expressed Dunaliella chloroplast genes psbB and rbcL including the promoter and terminator regions as well as the coding sequence of the psbA gene were cloned and sequenced. In addition, the psbA gene is useful as a selectable marker as introduced mutations confer resistance to the herbicide 3-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-1,1-Dimethylurea (DCMU). Two homologous transformation constructs based on mutated psbA genes were developed and tested using microprojectile bombardment. A number of parameters were tested including: the size of the gold microprojectile particle, the distance of the plates from the point of discharge, plating onto membranes or filter paper, helium pressure, addition of an osmoticum to the medium and recovery time. Although no chloroplast transformants were recovered in this study, these homologous recombination constructs should prove useful in the development of a chloroplast transformation protocol.    The other major component of this study was to investigate the use of microalgae as an expression system for the production of recombinant proteins. Transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a species related to Dunaliella, is well developed. In chapter six, this study examined the expression of two human proteins, &#61537;-lactalbumin and IGF-1 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Plasmids containing the C. reinhardtii RbcS2 promoter upstream of the cDNAs of these two proteins were introduced into C. reinhardtii cells using glass-bead mediated transformation. Transgenic C. reinhardtii lines were generated and shown to contain the transgenes by PCR and Southern hybridisation. RT- PCR and northern hybridisation were subsequently used to demonstrate that the transgenes were transcriptionally active. The transcripts however, could only be detected by RT-PCR indicating that the genes were transcribed at low levels. Accumulation of the &#61537;-lactalbumin protein could not be demonstrated, suggesting that although the transgenes were transcribed, they were either not translated or translated at levels below the sensitivity of western blot analysis or that any protein produced was rapidly degraded. Previous studies have indicated that in microalgae codon usage is vital in translation of the foreign protein. Codon modification of the IGF-I and &#61537;-lactalbumin genes should lead to higher levels of protein accumulation.    This study reports the first successful stable nuclear transformation of Dunaliella tertiolecta. Therefore it is now feasible that Dunaliella can be examined as a bioreactor for the expression of recombinant proteins. In addition, two chloroplast genes (psbB and rbcL) and their corresponding promoters and terminators have been characterised and a selectable marker cassette based on the mutated psbA gene constructed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioreactor</field><field name="subject">microalgae</field><field name="subject">Dunaliella tertiolecta</field><field name="subject">RbcS</field><field name="subject">promoter</field><field name="subject">chloroplast</field><field name="subject">nuclear</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="subject">electroporation</field><field name="subject">Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</field><field name="subject">&#61537;-lactalbumin</field><field name="subject">IGF-I</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15905/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity stressors associated with the reintegration experiences of Australasian undercover police officers</field><field name="creator">French, Nicole</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigated a very specialised, highly sensitive and complex research area in policing known as undercover policing or covert policing operations. This is the first examination to be conducted in the Australasian policing context and the only known research to explore, empirically, undercover operatives' experiences of returning to mainstream police duties after completing their covert duties.-----
 
 
 
 There were two main research objectives in this dissertation. The first was to develop research methodology specific for use with undercover police officers. The second main objective was to conduct an empirical investigation to identify the psychological processes associated with the reintegration or re-assimilation of undercover police officers into mainstream policing environments. Social identity theory was applied to deconstruct undercover police officers' reintegration experiences.----- 
 
 
 
 Given the closed and protected nature of covert policing, careful consideration to methodological and ethical issues required high priority in the development of research practices. Addressing these considerations in research practices protected the anonymity and security of those involved in the research. Tailoring research methods to suit the officers' circumstances and satisfy police managements' security concerns improved the practical application of research methods and research relations with police members and, therefore, the quality of the findings.-----
 
 
 
 In developing a research methodology for specific use with undercover police officers, a multi-method approach was adopted. Data triangulation with the use of a variety of data sources and methodological triangulation with the use of multiple methods and multiple indicators were employed. This technique proved constructive in creating a more holistic perspective of undercover policing and officers' experiences of re-assimilation.-----
 
 
 
 In theoretical terms, the major issue under investigation is of negotiating dual memberships or multiple identities. Three studies are reported. The first study is a field study, in which the researcher spent more than 18 months in the covert policing context, as a participant observer. Through field research, the researcher was able to learn about the Australasian covert policing context; obtain in-house police documents; define research issues and hypotheses; understand methodological considerations; identify a psychological theoretical framework; and examine  &amp;quotthe fit " between theory and the social dynamics of covert policing. Other benefits of becoming immersed in the working life of undercover police officers and the police organisation included understanding the ways of proceeding and the social and organisational structure that exists among covert personnel.-----
 
 
 
 The second study interviewed 20 former covert police personnel, from two police jurisdictions, who had been reintegrated for more than three years. The majority of officers found returning to mainstream police duties a difficult experience and two separate profiles of reintegration experiences emerged from the data. This study identified the presence of more than one police identity among former operatives. It found that some officers internalise aspects of the undercover policing norms and use these police norms to define aspects of the self both as a police officer and as an individual. That is, role-playing the undercover police persona became an extension of the officer as an individual and contributed positively to their personal self-worth. It was noted that the majority of officers expressed cognitive confusion over how to behave in the mainstream policing environment after covert duties had ceased.-----
 
 
 
 The other profile to emerge from the data was of officers who characterised their undercover policing experiences as being more integrated into their overall police persona. Officers interviewed in this study employed different identity decision-making strategies to restructure their police identities. In sum, this study found that the extent, to which the undercover and mainstream memberships were integrated cognitively, influenced officers' experiences of reintegration.-----
 
 
 
 The third study is a cross-sectional design using survey methods. Thirty-eight trainees, 31 currently operational and 38 former undercover operatives from four police jurisdictions took part in this study. A group of mainstream police officers matched according to former operatives' age, gender and years of policing experience was also included. This study found that police identities change over the phases of undercover police work and that changes in former operatives' mainstream police identity were a function of covert police work. Cross-sectional comparisons revealed that former operatives' undercover police identity had declined since covert policing, however, officers' mainstream police identity had not significantly increased. Failure to increase identification with mainstream police after undercover police work has ceased has a number of implications in terms of predicting re-assimilation. Operatives most likely to experience difficulties were those who resisted the mainstream police identification and reported difficult relations with their mainstream peers. Trends analysis revealed that despite the physical change, 'cognitive' re-assimilation actually commences in the second year of the operatives' reintegration. These exploratory analyses revealed that following return to the mainstream policing environment, identity stressors were mostly likely to be experienced in the first year of reintegration.-----
 
 
 
 To determine psychological adjustment since undercover police work, the person-environment fit was also investigated in the study. Operatives' current perceptions of working in the mainstream context were reported using a number of behavioural and organisational indicators. Overall, this study found that former operatives remain committed to their policing profession, however, those who experienced identity stress during the re-assimilation process were less satisfied with their current work duties and failed to find their work interesting, tended to perceive undercover duties as having been detrimental to their career, and expressed greater intentions to leave the service within 12 months of the survey. Overall former operatives' satisfaction and commitment levels were not significantly different from mainstream officers. Mainstream police, however, reported being under greater pressure and felt more overworked in the mainstream context than former operatives. In summary, these organisational indicators revealed that the difficulties of re-assimilation and intentions to leave the service are more related to the stress of modifying officers' police identity during this period than the workload characteristics of mainstream policing.----- 
 
 
 
 Overall these studies demonstrated that the process of negotiating police identities is an important psychological dynamic present in undercover operatives' reintegration experiences. The identity stress experienced during this period was shown to have a number of organisational-behavioural consequences, such as problematic intergroup relations and greater intentions to leave the police service after undercover police work. Based on findings from this research a number of practical recommendations are made and suggestions for the direction of future research are outlined. Contributions to theory are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">undercover policing</field><field name="subject">covert police officers</field><field name="subject">reintegration</field><field name="subject">transitional processes</field><field name="subject">identity stressors</field><field name="subject">social identifications</field><field name="subject">psychological adjustment</field><field name="subject">organisational change</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15906/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk management and tacit knowledge in IT projects: making the implicit explicit</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Hazel Ann</field><field name="description">This research addressed the need for in-depth investigation of what actually happens in the practice of risk management in software package implementation projects. There is strong 'official' sanction in the IT literature for the use of formal risk management processes for IT projects but there is a confused picture of their application in practice. While many potential risk factors for IT projects have been identified, and formal procedures have been prescribed for the management of these risks, there has been little work investigating how project managers assess these risks in practice and what countermeasures they employ against these risks in their projects. In particular, the study used an interpretive critical decision interview approach to focus on those areas of risk management knowledge that project managers have acquired through experience, i.e. tacit knowledge. A new categorization of risk factors emanating from three sources -- vendor, client, and third party -reveals risk factors not previously identified. Some of these new factors arise from the three sources noted, while others arise from the package implementation focus of the projects and from aspects arising from the location of the projects in Hong Kong. Key factors that cause problems even when anticipated and mitigated, and the most often unanticipated problems are also identified. The study further presents an examination of the studied managers' risk management practices, and the strategies they use to address both potential and actual problems. This examination revealed close conformance with recommended literature prescriptions at some stages of projects, and significant variation at other stages, with strategies applied being broad and general rather than risk specific. A useful categorization of these strategies into four broad groups relating to different sets of risk factors is presented, reflecting the actual practice of respondents.    Tacit knowledge was revealed throughout these investigations in the variances observed between prescribed and actual practice, and particularly from an examination of project managers' decision-making practices from two different perspectives - rational and naturalistic. A hybrid decision-making model is proposed to capture the actual processes observed, and to provide prescriptive guidance for risk management practice. The investigation makes a contribution to the field of IT project risk management in three ways. First, the investigation has addressed the need for empirical studies into IT risk management practices and the factors influencing project managers in their choice and application of strategies to manage risk. Second, by examining how experienced IT project managers approach the task of managing risk in software package implementations, the study has extended our understanding of the nature of the knowledge and skills that effective IT project managers develop through experience. Third, the study makes a theoretical contribution to our understanding of IT project risk management by examining the decision-making processes followed by IT project managers from the perspective of two contrasting theories of decision-making - the rational method and the Naturalistic Decision Making theory.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making processes</field><field name="subject">IS implementation</field><field name="subject">IS project risk management</field><field name="subject">software packages</field><field name="subject">tacit knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15907/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wavelet Transform For Texture Analysis With Application To Document Analysis</field><field name="creator">Busch, Andrew W.</field><field name="description">Texture analysis is an important problem in machine vision, with applications in many fields including medical imaging, remote sensing (SAR), automated flaw detection in various products, and document analysis to name but a few. Over the last four decades many techniques for the analysis of textured images have been proposed in the literature for the purposes of classification, segmentation, synthesis and compression. Such approaches include analysis the properties of individual texture elements, using statistical features obtained from the grey-level values of the image itself, random field models, and multichannel filtering. The wavelet transform, a unified framework for the multiresolution decomposition of signals, falls into this final category, and allows a texture to be examined in a number of resolutions whilst maintaining spatial resolution.    This thesis explores the use of the wavelet transform to the specific task of texture classification and proposes a number of improvements to existing techniques, both in the area of feature extraction and classifier design. By applying a nonlinear transform to the wavelet coefficients, a better characterisation can be obtained for many natural textures, leading to increased classification performance when using first and second order statistics of these coefficients as features. In the area of classifier design, a combination of an optimal discriminate function and a non-parametric Gaussian mixture model classifier is shown to experimentally outperform other classifier configurations.    By modelling the relationships between neighbouring bands of the wavelet trans- form, more information regarding a texture can be obtained. Using such a representation, an efficient algorithm for the searching and retrieval of textured images from a database is proposed, as well as a novel set of features for texture classification. These features are experimentally shown to outperform features proposed in the literature, as well as provide increased robustness to small changes in scale. Determining the script and language of a printed document is an important task in the field of document processing. In the final part of this thesis, the use of texture analysis techniques to accomplish these tasks is investigated. Using maximum a posterior (MAP) adaptation, prior information regarding the nature of script images can be used to increase the accuracy of these methods. Novel techniques for estimating the skew of such documents, normalising text block prior to extraction of texture features and accurately classifying multiple fonts are also presented.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Texture Classification</field><field name="subject">Texture Analysis</field><field name="subject">Wavelet Transform</field><field name="subject">Document Analysis</field><field name="subject">Multiresolution</field><field name="subject">Segmentation</field><field name="subject">Script Recognition</field><field name="subject">Gaussian Mixture Model</field><field name="subject">Quantisation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15908/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Understanding Of 'Relevant' Keyboard Pedagogy In Tertiary Institutions</field><field name="creator">Carey, Gemma Marian</field><field name="description">In current times, issues of curriculum relevance are driving a raft of reforms and reviews in higher education.  The unmet needs of students in terms of employment outcomes, particularly in the area of the performing arts are increasingly a matter of concern.  For tertiary music training institutions, the need to attach greater importance to student needs has forced a more critical reappraisal of curriculum priorities.  An effect of this has been ongoing contestation and debate within music institutions about the nature and purposes of music curriculum as a university offering.    This thesis examines the implications of the above by undertaking an investigation into the relevance of keyboard curriculum, as it is currently understood in one tertiary institution, a Conservatorium of Music.  It examines the contestation over student needs that is apparent within the curriculum of keyboard within such an institution.  The aim is to improve the institution's capacity to respond appropriately to 'student needs' by better understanding issues about curriculum relevance.  This is done by investigating how needs become articulated within this particular institution and curriculum domain and by investigating the effect these needs articulations have on the practices of those who teach and those who learn within this domain.  The study uses the conceptual work of Nancy Fraser (1989) and Elizabeth Ellsworth (1989) and a doctoral study by Erica McWilliam (1992), to focus on needs articulations or needs talk that is related to the needs of keyboard students within this Conservatorium.  This talk, which is generated in management, staff and student texts, is examined as produced out of systems of language use that are employed within and outside the Conservatorium. The analysis of the talk treats the contestations and struggle over student needs in the Conservatorium as products of, and productive of, power relations.  The analysis reveals discourse communities that are not only fractured from within but which share very little common language.  It demonstrates how systems of language use at work within the Conservatorium marginalise students at the same time as they permit the institution to continue its traditional work and practice.  The study clearly demonstrates how the institution itself is actively producing 'failing' and 'blaming' students as discursive subjects.  The conclusion is drawn that more attention needs to be paid to building shared communities that share a common discourse, rather than trying to wedge more 'relevant' material into the curriculum.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">curriculum relevance</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">tertiary music</field><field name="subject">keyboard curriculum</field><field name="subject">student needs</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15909/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power-Knowledge And Critique In Australian Legal Education : 1987 - 2003</field><field name="creator">James, Nickolas John</field><field name="description">While the word 'critique' appeared frequently in Australian legal education texts between 1987 and 2003, the meaning and the emphasis accorded critique varied widely. Michel Foucault's ideas about the close relationship between knowledge and power provide a theoretical framework within which this inconsistency of meaning and emphasis can be described, analysed and explained. Rather than monolithic, the discipline of legal education was by 2003 a dynamic nexus of distinct and competing discourses: doctrinalism, vocationalism, corporatism, liberalism, pedagogicalism and radicalism. Each of these six discourses was simultaneously a form of knowledge and an expression of disciplinary power within the law school. As a form of knowledge, each discourse accorded critique a different meaning and a different emphasis as a consequence of a range of historical, social and political contingencies. As an expression of power, each discourse was an attempt to achieve a set of objectives including the universalisation of a particular approach to the teaching of law and the enhancement of the status of a particular role within the law school. Critique, in a variety of forms, was a strategy employed by each discourse in order to achieve these  objectives and to dominate and displace competing discourses.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Legal Education</field><field name="subject">Australian Law Schools</field><field name="subject">Michel Foucault</field><field name="subject">Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">Power-Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Doctrinalism</field><field name="subject">Vocationalism</field><field name="subject">Corporatism</field><field name="subject">Liberalism</field><field name="subject">Pedagogicalism</field><field name="subject">Radicalism</field><field name="subject">Critique</field><field name="subject">Critical Thinking</field><field name="subject">Critical Pedagogy</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15910/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motivational factors and the experience of learning in educational leisure settings</field><field name="creator">Packer, Jan Merle</field><field name="description">Motivation is an important aspect of learning in educational leisure settings because it affects the choices visitors make regarding what to attend to, the amount of effort they devote to learning, and the extent to which they enjoy the experience.  Commonly, however, visitors seek entertainment, social or restorative experiences as well as, or in preference to, a learning experience.  This research investigates the impact of motivational factors on the experience of learning in educational leisure settings.  Motivational factors are considered in terms of four components - personal goals, capability beliefs, context beliefs and situational incentives. The experience of learning is considered in terms of visitors&#8217; perceptions of the experience, rather than objective measures of learning outcomes, as the experience itself is seen as the desired outcome of the visit.  
 
 
 
 Visitors to six different educational leisure settings in South East Queensland were invited to participate in the research, including a museum, an art gallery, a wildlife centre, an aquarium, and guided tours of natural and cultural heritage sites. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using questionnaires (499 participants) and interviews (52 participants) in order to ascertain the importance to visitors of different types of learning experiences; identify the extent to which motivations for learning vary across sites and visitor groups; investigate the relationships between the educational, entertainment, social and restorative aspects of the visitors&#8217; experience; and examine the impact of motivational factors on visitors&#8217; experience of learning in leisure settings.
 
 
 
 The findings support the importance of learning to visitors in a range of educational leisure settings.  Visitors seek an experience that combines elements of learning and discovery, and is perceived to be both effortless and fun.  It is concluded that the characteristics of learning in educational leisure settings contribute to a synergy between the educational and entertainment aspects of the experience.  Situational factors are more important than personal factors in motivating visitors to engage in and experience this type of learning.  This is of great significance to educational leisure settings as it implies that sites have a reasonable degree of control over the motivational factors that influence visitor engagement in learning.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Museum Learning</field><field name="subject">Environmental and Heritage Interpretation</field><field name="subject">Visitor Studies</field><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Educational Leisure</field><field name="subject">Free-Choice Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15911/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulating Access To Essential Facilities In Australia : Review And Reform Of Part IIIA Of The Trade Practices Act</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Brenda</field><field name="description">This dissertation critically evaluates the rationale for, and implementation of, the regulatory scheme governing third party access to essential infrastructure services (the 'national access regime') set out in Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).  The analysis and synthesis of background reports, economic and legal theory, statutory provisions, existing case law, academic commentary and regulatory guidelines contained herein represents a useful and necessary contribution to this nascent area of Australian competition law.  In particular, the comprehensive nature of the research has permitted informed assessment of the Productivity Commission's recent review of the national access regime and the Commonwealth Government's response to that inquiry.  While the dissertation endorses both the Productivity Commission's finding that retention of the Part IIIA access regime is warranted and many of the (notably light-handed) recommendations advanced by the Commission to improve aspects of the regime's operation, it takes issue with the Commission's failure to propose a more substantial refashioning of the regime's architecture.  Stepping into this breach, the dissertation specifies the systemic changes to Part IIIA that are imperative to enhancing the efficacy of the national access regime.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trade Practices Act</field><field name="subject">National Access Regime</field><field name="subject">Australian Competition Law</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15912/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A security architecture for protecting dynamic components of mobile agents</field><field name="creator">Yao, Ming</field><field name="description">New techniques,languages and paradigms have facilitated the creation of distributed applications in several areas. Perhaps the most promising paradigm is the one that incorporates the mobile agent concept. A mobile agent in a large scale network can be viewed as a software program that travels through a heterogeneous network, crossing various security domains and executing autonomously in its destination.    Mobile agent technology extends the traditional network communication model by including mobile processes, which can autonomously migrate to new remote servers. This basic idea results in numerous benefits including flexible, dynamic  customisation of the behavior of clients and servers and robust interaction over unreliable networks.    In spite of its advantages, widespread adoption  of the mobile agent paradigm is being delayed due to various security concerns. Currently available mechanisms for reducing the security risks of this technology do not e&#177;ciently cover all the existing threats.    Due to the characteristics of the mobile agent paradigm and the threats to which it is exposed, security mechanisms must be designed to protect both agent hosting servers and agents. Protection to agent-hosting servers' security is a reasonably well researched issue, and many viable mechanisms have been developed to address it. Protecting agents is technically more challenging and solutions to do so are far less developed. The primary added complication is that, as an agent traverses multiple servers that are trusted to different degrees, the agent's owner has no control over the behaviors of the agent-hosting servers. Consequently the  hosting servers can subvert the computation of the passing agent. Since it is infeasible to enforce the remote servers to enact the security policy that may prevent the server from corrupting agent's data, cryptographic mechanisms defined by the agent's owner may be one of the feasible solutions to protect agent's data.Hence the focus of this thesis is the development and deployment of cryptographic  mechanisms for securing mobile agents in an open environment.    Firstly, requirements for securing mobile agents' data are presented. For a sound mobile agent application, the data in an agent that is collected from each visiting server must be provided integrity. In some applications where servers intend to keep anonymous and will reveal their identities only under certain cir-  cumstances, privacy is also necessitated.    Aimed at these properties, four new schemes are designed to achieve different security levels: two schemes direct at preserving integrity for the agent's data, the other two focus on attaining data privacy.    There are four new security techniques designed to support these new schemes. The first one is joint keys to discourage two servers from colluding to forge a victim server's signature. The second one is recoverable key commitment to enable detection of any illegal operation of hosting servers on an agent's data. The third  one is conditionally anonymous digital signature schemes, utilising anonymous public-key certificates, to allow any server to digitally sign a document without leaking its identity. The fourth one is servers' pseudonyms that are analogues of identities, to enable servers to be recognised as legitimate servers while their identities remain unknown to anyone. Pseudonyms can be deanonymised with the assistance of authorities. Apart from these new techniques, other mechanisms such as hash chaining relationship and mandatory verification process are adopted in the new schemes.    To enable the inter-operability of these mechanisms, a security architecture is therefore developed to integrate compatible techniques to provide a generic solution for securing an agent's data. The architecture can be used independently of the particular mobile agent application under consideration. It can be used for guiding and supporting developers in the analysis of security issues during the design and implementation of services and applications based on mobile agents technology.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile agents</field><field name="subject">offer integrity</field><field name="subject">offer privacy</field><field name="subject">forward integrity</field><field name="subject">security architecture</field><field name="subject">modification attack</field><field name="subject">insertion attack</field><field name="subject">colluding servers attack</field><field name="subject">truncation attack</field><field name="subject">stemming attack</field><field name="subject">interleaving attack</field><field name="subject">hash chaining relationship</field><field name="subject">recoverable key commitment</field><field name="subject">joint keys.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15913/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cloning, characterisation and engineering of an IGF-I-BINDING single chain Fv</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Anthony Simon</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the construction and characterisation of an insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I)-binding single chain Fv (scFv) and the utilisation of this scFv as a model protein for the study of the application of DNA shuffling and ribosome display to antibody engineering.  The variable domain genes were isolated from the hybridoma cell line producing the monoclonal  antibody and successfully joined by PCR for the construction of the scFv, named anti-GPE.  Sequencing of the gene revealed an unusually short heavy chain CDR2 region. The cloned scFv was expressed in E. coli and purified. Expression levels were low and the protein has poor solubility, most likely due to a reduction in folding efficiency caused by the abbreviated CDR2. The purified monomeric form of the protein was analysed for binding to IGF-I using surface plasmon resonance on the BIAcore 1000 with the specificity of the IgG version of the antibody for the three N-terminal residues of IGF-I - Gly-Pro-Glu - reproduced. The scFv's calculated dissociation constant of 3.68 &#181;M is a low affinity for an antibody and is approximately 36-fold weaker than was calculated for the Fab  version of the antibody, but it is concluded that the calculated affinity for the scFv was an apparent affinity that may be an underestimation of true affinity due to the presence of non-functional or misfolded scFv species within the gel-filtration purified monomer peaks. A mutant version of anti-GPE with residues inserted in the CDR2 to restore it to normal length produced a protein with improved expression and solubility characteristics while retaining IGF-I-binding. It was concluded that the short  CDR2 was due to deletions generated during the somatic mutation process and a model for this is  described.    A ribosome display method using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate as a source of ribosomes was  developed for specific selection of anti-GPE against IGF-I. Error prone PCR was used to produce a random point mutated library of anti-GPE (EPGPE). This was taken through several cycles of display and selection but selection for non-specifically binding scFvs was commonly observed. This was probably due to poor folding of ribosome-displayed proteins in the system used, possibly caused by the presence of DTT in the lysate and/or the low capacity of the anti-GPE framework to tolerate mutation while retaining stability. It is assumed misfolds, exposing hydrophobic regions, would have a tendency to non-specifically interact with the selection surface. Of the 64 EPGPE clones screened from four rounds of display and selection, many were shown to have poor or non-specific binding, but one scFv was characterised that was affinity matured 2.6-fold over anti-GPE wild type affinity for IGF-I.    A DNA shuffling method was developed to produce libraries of chimaeric scFvs between anti-GPE  and NC10 (anti-neuraminidase scFv) with the objective of isolating functional IGF-I-binding  chimaeras. The NC10 scFv had its CDRs replaced with the anti-GPE CDRs prior to the shuffling to  increase the likelihood of isolating IGF-I binders. Ribosome display was used for selection from the chimaera libraries. Selection  strategies included elution of specific binders by GPE peptide and a GPE 10-mer peptide. Selection was also performed using IGF-I immobilised on a BIAcore sensorchip as a  selection surface. Again, much non-specific selection was observed as seen for display of EPGPE, for what was expected to be the same reasons. Selected scFvs were genuinely chimaeric but with poor expression and solubility and mostly non-specific in their binding. One characterised selected chimaera, made up of three segments of each of the parental scFvs, was shown to bind specifically to IGF-I by BIAcore. Steps to improve the efficiency of the ribosome display system have been identified  and are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antibody</field><field name="subject">IGF-I</field><field name="subject">single-chain Fv</field><field name="subject">error-prone PCR</field><field name="subject">scFv library</field><field name="subject">ribosome display</field><field name="subject">selection</field><field name="subject">enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</field><field name="subject">BIAcore</field><field name="subject">DNA shuffling</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15914/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elements of a Hermeneutics of Knowledge in Government : The Coalition of Public Sector Reform and Enterprise Resource Planning</field><field name="creator">Klaus, Helmut</field><field name="description">In techno-organisational innovation, knowledge is reconstituted. Understanding this process in its complexity and its outcomes asks for an inquiry and interpretation that heed to the conditions at the end of modernity, and must therefore take recourse to practical philosophy. This understanding has been formulated with reference to a field study that inquired into the conduct of reform and effectuation of new information technology by the central department of a regional government over a period of approximately eight years. In considering this ambience, the study has been informed by (i) a synopsis of hermeneutic thinking on knowledge; (ii) an outline of governmentality and (information) technology; (iii) a reflection on the conditions of the social sciences and their relation to information technology; (iv) an exploration of the possibilities of social inquiry at the end of modernity. Deliberating the stipulations of social inquiry, the destructive narrative is proposed that allows for a rational and argumentative appropriation of the past, beyond scientific method and mere perceptivity. Events, ideas, and experiences indicate the reciprocal relation of political and organisational rationalities, on the one hand, and managerial and informational technologies on the other. Within these dimensions, the knowledge of governmentality is being re-defined, shifting expertise into the harness of business discipline. The rationalities of information, process, integration, prediction and performance, and ultimately efficiency, make bureaucracy itself an object of increased scrutiny. These rationalities also remind that the challenge of Ge-stell and the rule of politics-as-fabrication do neither come to pass primarily in implementations of managerial technologies, nor in instantiations of information systems, but within the articulations of the technological worldview. Due to the fragmented and contentious nature of knowledge, innovation as routine nevertheless appears disjointed and asynchronous, yet upholding the representational and disciplinary constellations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Public Sector Reform</field><field name="subject">Enterprise Resource Planning</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15915/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Science Research Students' Conceptions Of Thesauri</field><field name="creator">Klaus, Helmut</field><field name="description">It is widely recognised that meaning and interpretation are fundamental aspects of user-system interaction in the retrieval of specialised information. Important constituents of information retrieval system are thesauri. To identify what understandings of thesauri exist, is crucial to improve instruction of database users and for an assessment of the functioning of thesauri in specialised information. Thesauri as phenomena can be viewed from a techno scientific perspective and a lifeworld perspective. The lifeworld perspective is made up of the collective understanding of those who use them. Lifeworld aspects of thesauri, i.e., how they are understood by social science researchers, have been disclosed by applying phenomenographic research against the background of the hermeneutical constitution of the online dialogue. The phenomenographic interpretative model has been used since its knowledge interest focuses on how techno scientific concepts are conceived of in the lifeworld. This has rendered descriptions of conceptions of thesauri in the form of two main categories: 1) the thesaurus as being separable from the database with the subcategories a) the thesaurus as a control device, and b) as incomplete terminology; 2) the thesaurus as being inseparable from the database with the subcategories of a) descriptors as evaluation criteria, and b) as search enhancers. Based on the configuration of the online dialogue, searching without understanding the thesaurus has also been described in the form of a third, 'empty' category and contrasted with the conceptions of thesauri. The findings represent a contribution to the hermeneutics of the online dialogue, and the results are immediately applicable for the development of discourses in the instruction of end-users and future information professionals. They also provide an empirical argument in support of further conceptual development of thesauri, which strives to make explicit the meaning of descriptors by incorporating terminological and epistemological knowledge, thus integrating domain knowledge into the database search process.

Specifically, it concludes that the behaviours of serial murderers can be allegorical of unresolved childhood trauma - that in the murderous actions of the adult there can be a depth of subconscious allegorical connection to the repressed (forgotten) and unresolved trauma of the murderer's own  childhood. The focus for this hermeneutic inquiry is the intersection that can be constructed between the phenomenon of serial murder and the assertion of the psychoanalyst Alice Miller that every perpetrator of violence was once a child who was (himself or herself) a victim. Alice Miller's concept of Poisonous Pedagogy is explained and critiqued. Her belief that our childhoods tell the stories of our adult behaviours is questioned in light of the similar theoretical ground of Life History, Life Narrative, Psychobiography, and Psychoanalytic Narrative. Miller's contention that there are directly allegorical connections between childhood abuse and adult murderous behaviours is illustrated by her analysis of the life of Jurgen Bartsch. A hermeneutic examination of the biographic records of two other serial murderers (Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy) is then undertaken to question the available support for Miller's contentions    It is concluded that there is strong support for Miller's assertions regarding the etiology of violence, and that violent adult behaviour, even serial murder, can be allegorical of unresolved childhood trauma. It is suggested that there is a need to extend this area of research through face-to-face engagement with perpetrators of violence. It is recommended that we directly engage serial murderers in personal discourses that will allow further exploration of Miller's notion that serial murderers' behaviours are allegorical echoes of harm that was done to them.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Serial murder</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Life History</field><field name="subject">Life Narrative</field><field name="subject">Poisonous Pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Allegory</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15917/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of preoperative education by a nurse led Acute Pain Service on pain management for cardiac surgical patients</field><field name="creator">Stolic, Snezana</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to compare the pain experience of cardiac surgical patients who attended the Acute Pain Service (APS) education program with cardiac surgical patients who did not attend the APS.

The main research question and  two sub-questions were designed to explore teachers' perceptions and understanding of national standards. This exploration engaged teachers in identifying factors which they believed influenced their professional work. This study also explored stakeholders' perceptions of teachers' interpretations of national education standards.    This study adopted social constructivist epistemology, symbolic interactionism, and ethnographic case study methodology. This provided the basis for its theoretical framework to purposefully understand human interactions within their culture and context. Social constructivism accommodates situated learning, a conceptual framework which was adapted to interrogate understanding and implementation of national education standards. A variety of research methods were used to elicit teachers' and stakeholders' perceptions and experiences of their professional world. These methods included in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, documentary analysis, field notes and observations. Most of the focus group discussions engaged participants to "tell their  stories", thus storytelling became an avenue for eliciting teachers' and stakeholders'perceptions.  Workshops conducted for teachers became another important strategy for data collection.    Two schools, one rural and one urban, became case studies to understand national education  standards as an external phenomenon. A total of 595 participants were involved in this study  including teachers and pupils, parents and community members, school board members, members of curriculum committees, and policy makers.    The study found numerous contextual factors influenced teachers' understandings, interpretation and implementation of standards at the school level. Foremost, teachers' own knowledge of formal education standards was deficient thus influencing their commitment to and enthusiasm in their professional work. Teachers' content knowledge and pedagogical skills influenced their ability to  translate content standards into clear benchmarks for pupils' learning. The absence of effective monitoring systems of teachers' performance contributed to pupils' superficial assessment reports and of uncoordinated mastery of subject content and performance skills. The absence of effective school leadership affected teachers' commitment, attitudes and professionalism. This generated a culture of isolationism acute in both schools. Teachers were performing to hierarchically externally  imposed requirements, and in the process, overlooked essential knowledge and skills that were needed to improve quality of students' learning.    The national education standards are an inherited policy from the colonial administration. This study found that successful implementation of education standards is highly dependent on the social and cultural expectations of Papua New Guinea's rapidly changing society. At the local level, education  standards are highly influenced by teachers' professionalism, provincial education boards and  community expectations. This is compounded by the mismatch of priorities and policies between  the national and provincial education divisions. Such a practice impacts negatively on the successful implementation of educational reform agendas.    The study implies that a reconsideration of national education standards is necessary. This process will involve a rethinking of teacher education programmes, dismantling previous assumptions of national standards and local implementation, and accommodating challenges presented by economic, political, social and cultural change in Papua New Guinea.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">national education standards</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">implementation</field><field name="subject">Standards Perspective</field><field name="subject">teachers perception</field><field name="subject">social constructivist epistemology</field><field name="subject">symbolic interactionism</field><field name="subject">ethnographic case study methodology.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15919/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary And Secondary Teachers Shaping The Science Curriculum: The Influence Of Teacher Knowledge</field><field name="creator">Keys, Philip Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on how primary and secondary teachers' knowledge influenced the implementation of a Year 1-10 science syllabus which was introduced into Queensland in 1999. The study investigated how the teachers' knowledge of the primary and secondary teachers differed and how teachers' knowledge impacted on the implementation of the science curriculum. Teacher knowledge otherwise referred to as teacher beliefs and practices has been acknowledged as an influence in the implementation of curriculum. Yet, a considerable portion of curriculum evaluation has focused on measuring the successful implementation of the intended curriculum and not the enactment. As a result, few studies have investigated how the curriculum has been influenced by teacher knowledge or have compared primary and secondary teacher knowledge. Furthermore, in order to provide a seamless grade one to ten science syllabus it is necessary to compare primary and secondary teacher beliefs and practices to determine whether or not the beliefs and practices held by these two groups of teachers is similar or dissimilar and how these beliefs and practices in turn, impact on the implementation of a curriculum. The research adopted Eisner's (1991) methodology of educational criticism and used a comparative case study approach to investigate the teacher knowledge of four primary and three secondary teachers. Data were presented as a dialogue between three composite characters, a lower primary, a middle/upper primary and a secondary teacher. The results revealed that teachers utilised three sets of beliefs to shape the implementation of the science curriculum. These were categorised as expressed, entrenched and manifested beliefs. The primary and secondary teachers did possess similar sets of beliefs and knowledge bases but their strategies for implementation in some instances were different. Furthermore, these sets of beliefs and knowledge bases served as motivator or an inhibitor to teach science in the manner that they did. A theoretical model was developed to explain how these sets of beliefs influenced the curriculum. This study provides professional developers with a framework to observe teacher beliefs in action and thereby to assist in the facilitation of curriculum change.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beliefs</field><field name="subject">Change</field><field name="subject">Coaching</field><field name="subject">Craft Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Curriculum Enactment</field><field name="subject">Educational Criticism</field><field name="subject">Ethnographic Fiction</field><field name="subject">Mentoring</field><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="subject">Organisational Development</field><field name="subject">Pedagogical Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Practical Theories</field><field name="subject">Professional Development</field><field name="subject">Science Teaching</field><field name="subject">Teacher Knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15920/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Addressing Preservice Student Teachers' Negative Beliefs And Anxieties About Mathematics</field><field name="creator">Uusimaki, Sirkka-Liisa Marjatta</field><field name="description">More than half of Australian primary teachers have negative feelings about mathematics (Carroll, 1998).

In this study, sixteen maths-anxious preservice primary education student teachers were engaged in computer-mediated collaborative open-ended mathematical activities and discourse. Prior to, and after their mathematical activity, the students participated in a short thirty-second Online Anxiety Survey based on ideas by Ainley and Hidi (2002) and Boekaerts (2002), to ascertain changes to their beliefs about the various mathematical activities. The analysis of this data facilitated the identification of key episodes that led to the changes in beliefs.

While it does not play a direct causative role in road crashes, unlicensed driving undermines the integrity of the driver licensing system and is associated with a range of high-risk behaviours. This thesis documents three studies that were undertaken to explore the scope and nature of unlicensed driving, in order to develop more effective countermeasures to the behaviour.----- 
 
 Study One utilised official road crash data from the Australian state of Queensland to compare the crash involvement patterns of unlicensed drivers with those of licensed drivers. The results confirmed that unlicensed driving is a relatively small, but significant road safety problem. Unlicensed drivers represent over 6% of the drivers involved in fatal crashes and 5% of those in serious injury crashes. Based on a quasi-induced exposure method, unlicensed drivers were found to be almost three times as likely to be involved in a crash than licensed drivers. In the event of a crash, those involving unlicensed drivers were twice as likely to result in a fatality or serious injury. Consistent with these results, the serious crashes involving unlicensed drivers were more likely to feature risky driving behaviours, such as drink driving, speeding and motorcycle use, than those involving licensed drivers.-----
 
 Study Two involved a cross-sectional survey of 309 unlicensed driving offenders who were recruited at the Brisbane Central Magistrates Court. The survey involved a face-to-face interview that took approximately 25 minutes to complete and achieved a response rate of 62.4%. A wide range of offenders participated in the study, including: disqualified and suspended drivers; expired licence holders; drivers without a current or appropriate licence; and those who had never been licensed. The results reinforced concerns about the on-road behaviour of unlicensed drivers.  Almost one quarter of all the offenders reported driving unlicensed when they thought they might have been over the alcohol limit. Similarly, 25% reported exceeding the speed limit by 10 km/h or more on most or all occasions, while 15% admitted that they didn't always wear their seat belt. In addition, the results indicated that unlicensed drivers should not be viewed as a homogeneous group. Significant differences were found between the offender types in terms of their socio-demographic characteristics (age, education level, prior criminal convictions); driving history (prior convictions for unlicensed driving and other traffic offences); whether they were aware of being unlicensed; the degree to which they limited their driving while unlicensed; and their drink driving behaviour. In particular, a more deviant sub-group of offenders was identified, that included the disqualified, not currently licensed and never licensed drivers, who reported higher levels of prior criminal offending, alcohol misuse and self-reported drink driving. The results of Study Two also highlight the shortcomings of existing police enforcement practices. Almost one-third of the sample reported that they continued to drive unlicensed after being detected by the police (up until the time of the court hearing), while many offenders reported experiences of punishment avoidance. For example, over one third of the participants reported being pulled over by the police while driving unlicensed and not having their licence checked.-----
 
 Study Three involved the further analysis of the cross-sectional survey data to explore the factors contributing to unlicensed driving. It examined the influence of various personal, social and environmental factors on three aspects of the offenders' behaviour: the frequency of their driving while unlicensed; whether they continued to drive unlicensed after being detected; and their intentions to drive unlicensed in the future. This study was also designed to assess the capacity of a number of different theoretical perspectives to explain unlicensed driving behaviour, including deterrence theory and Akers' (1977) social learning theory. At an applied level, the results of Study Three indicated that personal and social factors exert the strongest influence over unlicensed driving behaviour. The main personal influences on unlicensed driving were: the need to drive for work purposes; exposure to punishment avoidance; personal attitudes to unlicensed driving; and anticipated punishments for the behaviour. The main social influences reflected the social learning construct of differential association, namely being exposed to significant others who both engage in unlicensed driving (behavioural dimension) and hold positive attitudes to the behaviour (normative dimension). At a theoretical level, the results of Study Three have two important implications for traffic psychology and criminology.  Firstly, they provided partial support for Stafford and Warr's (1993) reconceptualisation of deterrence theory by demonstrating that the inclusion of punishment avoidance can improve the overall predictive utility of the perspective. Secondly, they suggested that social learning theory represents a more comprehensive framework for predicting illegal driving behaviours, such as unlicensed driving. This is consistent with Akers' (1977; 1990) assertion that formal deterrence processes can be subsumed within social learning theory.----- 
 
 Together, the results of the three studies have important implications for road safety. Most importantly, they question the common assumption that unlicensed drivers drive in a more cautious manner to avoid detection. While the findings indicate that many offenders reduce their overall driving exposure in order to avoid detection, this does not appear to result in safer driving. While it remains possible that unlicensed drivers tend to act more cautiously than they would otherwise, it appears that their driving behaviour is primarily designed to reduce their chances of detection. In terms of countermeasures, the research indicates that a multi-strategy approach is required to address the problem of unlicensed driving. Unlicensed drivers do not represent a homogeneous group who are likely to be influenced by the threat of punishment alone. Rather, innovative strategies are required to address the wide range of factors that appear to encourage or facilitate the behaviour. Foremost among these are punishment avoidance and the need to drive for work purposes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Unlicensed</field><field name="subject">Disqualified</field><field name="subject">Suspended</field><field name="subject">Revoked</field><field name="subject">Road Safety</field><field name="subject">Driver Licensing</field><field name="subject">Deterrence Theory</field><field name="subject">Social Learning</field><field name="subject">Akers</field><field name="subject">Theory Testing</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15923/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of Coal Sedimentation in the Ipswich Basin Southeast Queensland</field><field name="creator">Chern, Peter Kyaw Zaw Naing</field><field name="description">The intermontane Ipswich Basin, which is situated 30km south-west of Brisbane, contains coal measures formed in the Late Triassic Epoch  following a barren non-depositional period. Coal, tuff, and basalt were deposited along with fluvial dominated sediments. The Ipswich Coal  Measures mark the resumption of deposition in eastern Australia after the coal hiatus associated with a series of intense tectonic activity in Gondwanaland during the Permo-Triassic interval. A transtensional tectonic  movement at the end of the Middle Triassic deformed the Toogalawah Group before extension led to the formation of the Carnian Ipswich Coal  Measures in the east.    The Ipswich Coal Measures comprise the Brassall and Kholo Subgroups. The Blackstone Formation, which forms the upper unit of the Brassall  Subgroup, contains seven major coal seams. The lower unit of the Brassall Subgroup, the Tivoli Formation, consists of sixteen stratigraphically  significant coal seams. The typical thickness of the Blackstone Formation is 240m and the Tivoli Formation is about 500m.    The coal seams of the Ipswich Basin differ considerably from those of other continental Triassic basins. However, the coal geology has previously attracted little academic attention and the remaining exposures of the Ipswich coalfield are rapidly disappearing now that mining has ceased. The primary aim of this project was to study the patterns of coal sedimentation and the response of coal seam characteristics to changing depositional  environments.    The coal accumulated as a peat-mire in an alluvial plain with meandering channel systems. Two types of peat-mire expansion occurred in the basin. Peat-mire aggradation, which is a replacement of water body by the peatmire,  was initiated by tectonic subsidence. This type of peat-mire expansion is known as terrestrialisation. It formed thick but laterally limited coal seams in the basin. Whereas, peat-mire progradation was related to  paludification and produced widespread coal accumulation in the basin.    The coal seams were separated into three main groups based on the mean seam thickness and aerial distribution of one-meter and four-meter thickness contour intervals. Group 1 seams within the one-meter thickness interval are  up to 15,000m2 in area, and seams within the four-meter interval have an aerial extent of up to 10,000m2. Group 1A contains the oldest seam with numerous intraseam clastic bands and shows a very high thickness to area ratio, which indicates high subsidence rates. Group 1B seams have moderately high thickness to area ratios. The lower clastic influx and slower subsidence rates favoured peat-mire aggradation. The Group 1A seam is relatively more widespread in aerial extent than seams from Group 1B. Group 1C seams have low mean thicknesses and small areas, suggesting short-lived peat-mires as a result of high clastic influx. Group 2 seams arebetween 15,000 and 35,000m2 in area within the one-meter interval, and between 5,000 and 10,000m2 within the four-meter interval. They have  moderately high area to thickness ratios, indicating that peat-mire expansion  occurred due to progressively shallower accommodation and a rising groundwater table. Group 3 seams, which have aerial extents from 35,000 to 45,000m2 within the one-meter thickness contour interval and from 10,000  to 25,000m2 within the four-meter interval, show high aerial extent to thickness ratios. They were deposited in quiet depositional environments  that favoured prolonged existence of peat-mires. Group 3 seams are all relatively young whereas most Group 1 seams are relatively old seams.    All the major fault systems, F1, F2 and F3, trend northwest-southeast. Apart from the West Ipswich Fault (F3), the F1 and F2 systems are broad Palaeozoic basement structures and thus they may not have had a direct influence on the formation of the much younger coal measures. However, the sedimentation patterns appear to relate to these major fault systems. Depocentres of earlier seams in the Tivoli Formation were restricted to the northern part of the basin, marked by the F1 system. A major depocentre  shift occurred before the end of the deposition of the Tivoli Formation as a result of subsidence in the south that conformed to the F2 system configuration. The Blackstone Formation depocentres shifted to the east (Depocentre 1) and west (Depocentre 2) simultaneously. This depocentre shift was associated with the flexural subsidence produced by the  rejuvenation of the West Ipswich Fault. Coal accumulation mainly occurred in Depocentre 1.    Two types of seam splitting occurred in the Ipswich Basin. Sedimentary splitting or autosedimentation was produced by frequent influx of clastic sediments. The fluvial dominant depositional environments created the  random distribution of small seam splits. However, the coincidence of seam splits and depocentres found in some of the seams suggests tectonic splitting. Furthermore, the progressive splitting  pattern, which displays seam splits overlapping, was associated with continued basin subsidence. The tectonic splitting pattern is more dominant in the Ipswich Basin.    Alternating bright bands shown in the brightness profiles are a result of oscillating water cover in the peat-mire. Moderate groundwater level, which was maintained during the  development of the peat, reduced the possibility of  salinisation and drowning of the peat swamp. On the other hand, a slow continuous rise of the groundwater table, that kept pace with the vertical growth of peat, prevented excessive oxidation of peat.    Ipswich coal is bright due to its high vitrinite content. The cutinite content is also high because the dominant flora was pteridosperms of Dicroidium assemblage containing waxy and thick cuticles. Petrographic study revealed that the depositional environment was telmatic with bog forest formed under ombrotrophic to mesotrophic hydrological conditions. The high preservation  of woody or structured macerals such as  telovitrinite and semifusinite indicates that coal is autochthonous. The high mineral matter content in coal is possibly due to the frequent influx of clastic and volcanic sediments.    The Ipswich Basin is part of a much larger Triassic basin extending to Nymboida in New South Wales. Little is known of the coal as it lacks exposures. It is apparently thin to absent except in places like Ipswich and Nymboida. This study suggests that the dominant control on depocentres of thick coal at Ipswich has been the tectonism. Fluvial incursions and  volcanism were superimposed on this.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ipswich Coal Measures</field><field name="subject">Triassic coal basins</field><field name="subject">Intermontane Ipswich Basin</field><field name="subject">Blackstone Formation</field><field name="subject">Tivoli Formation</field><field name="subject">Brassall Subgroup</field><field name="subject">Kholo Subgroup</field><field name="subject">West Ipswich Fault</field><field name="subject">peat-mire aggradation</field><field name="subject">peat-mire progradation</field><field name="subject">terrestrialisation</field><field name="subject">paludification</field><field name="subject">depocentres</field><field name="subject">sedimentary splitting</field><field name="subject">tectonic splitting</field><field name="subject">brightness profiles</field><field name="subject">Dicroidium</field><field name="subject">structured macerals</field><field name="subject">vitrinite</field><field name="subject">liptinite</field><field name="subject">inertinite</field><field name="subject">clay and other mineral matter</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15924/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating The Discrepancy Between Theory And Empirical Research In Knowledge Transfer And Innovation</field><field name="creator">Cross, Emily L.</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between knowledge transfer and innovation.  The literature documents that increasing knowledge transfer can both increase and decrease an organisation's capability to innovate.  This study proposes a model that integrates these two theoretical standpoints and in doing so hypothesizes a non-linear (parabolic) relationship between knowledge transfer and innovation.  Empirical research to date, including the work of Storey and Kelly (2002), document a linear relationship between knowledge transfer and innovation.  In order to investigate the possibility of a non-linear relationship this study proposes and tests refinements to Storey and Kelly's methodology.  A refined survey questionnaire was sent to all the local government councils within two Australian states and both linear and quadratic statistical analyses were performed.  The results of this pilot study revealed linear relationships between four of the six knowledge transfer questions and the innovation measurement question.

Writers and filmmakers have treated a wide range of issues with varying degrees of success in engaging their audience in a level of social discourse. This success has been independent of the specific issue addressed, the government funding policy, cultural policy, the national and international political climate, and available technologies. Rather it can be attributed to the filmmaker's approach to both characterization and narrative. Of the films chosen for examination it appeared that a positively portrayed protagonist in combination with a narrative that provided a clear but balanced opinion on the issue addressed was more successful in engaging its audience in a level of social discourse. The ability of the films to engage their respective audiences was based on criteria such as box office success, critical reception, and media and public discussion of the film around the time of its release as well as more recently.  The findings of this investigation arose from the production of a feature length screenplay, The Last of the Wombats, which dealt with the issue of national security. The screenplay follows the Ruddocks along on their journey from personal insecurity, through issues of perceived threat, to the initial response of increasing the physical security measures around their house. These actions produce more problems than they solve, and this state of imbalance forces the main characters (Amber, Brian and Karen) to address their own insecurities and eventually to move beyond them.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protagonist</field><field name="subject">Social Comedy</field><field name="subject">Australian Film</field><field name="subject">Characterization</field><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15926/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influencing recidivist drink drivers' entrenched behaviours : the self-reported outcomes of three countermeasures</field><field name="creator">Freeman, James Edwin</field><field name="description">Concern remains regarding the efficacy of drink driving countermeasures to produce lasting change for repeat offenders, as a wide array of countermeasures have been developed that demonstrate varying levels of success in reducing re-offence rates. This thesis proposes that the collection and examination of repeat offenders' self-reported perceptions, experiences and behavioural changes that result from completing court-ordered interventions can provide valuable contributions to the development of effective sentencing strategies.  As a result, the program of research implemented a mixed-method design to investigate the self-reported impact of legal sanctions, a drink driving rehabilitation program, and alcohol ignition interlocks on key outcome measures for a group of recidivist drink drivers.-----  
 
 Study One incorporated a cross-sectional design to examine the deterrent effect of traditional legal sanctions (e.g., fines and licence disqualification periods), non-legal sanctions, alcohol consumption, recent offending behaviour(s), and the actual severity of sanctions on perceptual deterrence and intentions to re-offend.   The study involved face-to-face and telephone interviews with 166 repeat offenders.  The analysis indicated that participants perceived legal sanctions to be severe, but not entirely certain nor swift.-----  
 
 In Study One, self-reported recent drink driving behaviours and alcohol consumption levels were identified as predictors of future intentions to drink and drive.  The results suggest that habitual behaviours are difficult to change, and heavy alcohol consumption levels increase the probability of re-offending.  At a bivariate level, three non-legal sanctions were negatively associated with intentions to re-offend but were not predictors of future intentions to drink and drive in the model.  In addition, a relationship was not evident between: (a) the size of the penalties and perceptions of sanction severity or future intentions to drink and drive, and (b) the number of previous convictions and self-reported deterrence.  The findings of the study confirm the popular assumption that some repeat offenders are impervious to the threat and application of legal sanctions.-----
 
 Study Two examined the stages of change and self-efficacy levels of 132 repeat offenders - who were all involved in Study One - while they completed an 11 week drink driving rehabilitation program.  A repeated measures design was implemented to focus on the impact of the intervention on a number of salient program outcomes such as participants' motivations and self-efficacy levels to control and change their drinking and drink driving behaviour(s).  Prior to program commencement, the majority of participants were motivated to change their drinking driving, but not their drinking.  The sample also reported high self-efficacy levels to control the two behaviours, but did not have high expectations of the effectiveness of the program.-----  
 
 Upon completion of the program, significant increases were evident in motivations to change drinking and drink driving behaviours, and a large percentage of participants reported a positive appraisal of the effectiveness of the intervention.  Program completion also resulted in a reduction in self-reported alcohol consumption levels, yet the majority of the sample continued to consume harmful levels of alcohol.  Self-efficacy levels remained high, although a notable finding was that participants reported higher levels of control over their drinking rather than drink driving behaviours.  In general, Study Two provided a positive perspective of the capacity of a drink driving rehabilitation program to produce change for a group of repeat offenders.-----  
 
 Study Two extended a small body of research and examined the effects that mandated program enrolment has on motivations to change, as well as expectations and appraisals of program effectiveness.  Contrary to predictions, mandated participants did not report lower levels of motivation to change drinking and drink driving compared to voluntary attendees, but did indicate lower expectations of the effectiveness of the program, as well as being willing to engage in the program. Furthermore upon program completion, mandated participants also reported lower appraisals of the effectiveness of the program, but this factor was not associated with intentions to re-offend or non-program completion.  Rather, not successfully completing the program appeared linked with being unwilling to change drinking behaviours.-----  
 
 Study Three involved a longitudinal case-study design that utilised both quantitative and qualitative data to conduct one of the first examinations of the impact of alcohol ignition interlocks on a group of recidivist drink drivers from a users' perspective.  The study investigated 12 participants' self-reported perceptions and experiences of using an interlock and the effect that the device had on key program outcomes such as drinking levels, operational performance, circumvention attempts and general beliefs regarding the effectiveness of the device in comparison to traditional legal sanctions.-----  
 
 Participants reported positive appraisals regarding the effectiveness of the device as qualitative themes emerged concerning the educational and practical benefits of interlocks. However, closer examination of individual interlock performances revealed each participant had attempted to start their vehicle after consuming alcohol, and a smaller sample of three drivers were regularly attempting to start their vehicle after drinking.  The combination and analysis of self-reported and downloaded interlock data revealed four main themes: (a) initial operational difficulties, (b) a general unwillingness to reduce alcohol consumption levels, (c) an unwillingness to acknowledge/recognise that interlock breath violations resulted from drinking, and (d) an overall decline in the frequency of interlock breath violations over the interlock installation period.  Similar to Study Two, a notable finding was that half the sample was still consuming harmful levels of alcohol upon program completion.-----  
 
 Taken together, the results of the program of research highlight that repeat offenders' entrenched behaviours, such as drinking and drink driving, are resistant to change and that multi-modal interventions are required if the drinking and driving sequence is to be broken for this population.  The findings have direct implications for the sentencing and management of repeat offenders and the development of countermeasures that attempt to produce long-term behavioural change.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drink Driving</field><field name="subject">Recidivist</field><field name="subject">Repeat Offender</field><field name="subject">Deterrence</field><field name="subject">Behavioural Change</field><field name="subject">Legal Sanctions</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation Programs</field><field name="subject">Alcohol Ignition Interlocks</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15927/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovation, Collaboration, and the International Firm</field><field name="creator">Hargreaves, Michael</field><field name="description">In the lead up to the Year 2000 dot.com crash of publicly traded high-technology equities, Information Communication Technology (ICT) Companies proudly displayed inter-firm allegiances on their newly created websites.  These collaborative relationships were in reality licensing agreements to develop or market new products internationally.  Phenomena associated with ICT product development - collaboration, innovation, and internationalisation - are the core tenets of the accompanying dissertation.  Leading scholars have suggested these phenomena challenge conventional economic theories of the firm.    This study commences with tracing the evolution of trade and production theories from absolute advantage through to competitive advantage and introduces the concepts of non-adversarial collaborative advantage.  Within the framework of the technology cycle, this dissertation then seeks to answer why firms engage in international collaborative innovation.  The cycle of technological innovation is investigated and this leads to postulating a period of technological overlap and its implications for collaboration.    One of the shortcomings acknowledged in the literature is the generic application of the term collaboration to cover a wide scope of inter-firm agreements.  Within the literature this is referred to as a problem of multidimensionality.  A model is developed in this dissertation that identifies the choices available to the firm and addresses the problem of defining collaboration.  The choices provided in the developed model are more complex than simply choosing between external and internal intermediate markets.  As a separable form of industry organisation, the success rates of alliance collaboration are compared to Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;As) to validate issues of sustainability before examining the impact of location on innovation and collaboration.  Again, theory is tested by recent events that require explanation.  These events include the relocation of early stage foreign R&amp;D to both developed and lesser-developed nations.    The final chapter assesses the findings throughout this study and identifies separate and distinct roles for large and small firms in the international and collaborative commercialisation of new innovations.  This central conclusion requires empirical validation and suggests the need investigate how firms shape the cycle of innovation from a reflected vantage point to the evolutionary perspective taken in this study.  Further research is warranted because the literature on international innovation and collaboration is at an early stage and gaps in understanding remain.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alliances</field><field name="subject">Appropriation</field><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Conglomerate</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary Theory</field><field name="subject">Externalisation</field><field name="subject">Firm</field><field name="subject">Industry</field><field name="subject">Information Communication Technology</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Internalisation</field><field name="subject">Mergers &amp; Acquisitions</field><field name="subject">M&amp;As.

These approaches seek to identify organizational factors (e.g. culture or information technology practices) or to suggest management processes (e.g. human resources management) required to establish environments conducive to IM and KM. Most of these approaches, often presented as frameworks (as they are referred to in this study) for organizational IM or KM, are exemplified by the following features.Firstly, they have emerged as unrelated notions, with little reference to each other or to foundational studies in the area. Secondly these frameworks are not based on any
 
 theoretical foundation. Thirdly, these  frameworks have tended to focus on either
 
 information or knowledge management activities but not both, even though organizational IM and KM exist in a complementary and co-dependent relationship.
 
 
 
 The usefulness of these frameworks is made problematic by muddled use of the terms
 
 'information', 'knowledge', 'IM' and 'KM', which are often transposed or used synonymously. The situation is further complicated by the inherent complexity of the organizational environments into which practitioners attempt to introduce information and knowledge management (IKM) initiatives.
 
 
 
 Early outputs of this research are explanations of how the terminology above is used in
 
 this study and a literature review that describes current IM and KM frameworks by
 
 analyzing their components. The literature review identifies current challenges in the
 
 research domain, including the need for sound foundation (referent model) on which future IKM frameworks can be based. A suitable referent model is proposed by integrating single and double feedback loops (from systems theory) with two concepts from the IM literature: IM processes and the domains of IM activity.
 
 Then, an interpretive multi-methodological research (MMR) approach is pursued consisting of three sequential phases: action research, transition and case study. The first phase, a 3-cycle action research project accompanied by a longitudinal descriptive case study and an embedded literature analysis, was conducted over a 31 month period. The key research outcome of the action research phase was a set of candidate enablers Information and Knowledge Management (IKM) in Business Contexts for organizational IKM, while the organizational deliverables included policies, strategies, process improvement and new information systems. The information gathered in phase one was rich and deep. However, in keeping with the goal of the research to produce a practical, useful IKM framework, the researcher sought a broader view from the IKM community. To achieve this practitioner view, a second research phase was designed to bridge the gap between the detailed examinations of IKM initiatives within one
 
 organizational environment, to the examination of IKM initiatives within other organizations. Therefore phase two - a transition phase - consisted of a series of surveys and interviews with IKM practitioners that explored their perceptions of organizational IKM activities and environments. The data collected in phase two
 
 supported the findings from phase one and informed the development of the case protocols for the third - case study - phase. In the third phase, six IKM projects in three organizations were studied. Documentary and interview data were examined to understand the relationships between IKM projects, the candidate enablers identified earlier in phases one and two, and other organizational factors implicated in IKM
 
 initiatives. When analyzed, the findings from the third phase converged with the data
 
 collected in the previous two phases, and provided a rich, deep and broad collection of
 
 material.
 
 
 
 The study culminates by synthesizing the data collected in the three research phases to
 
 (1) confirm a suitable referent model on which IKM frameworks can be based and (2) develop an integrated, multidimensional IKM framework that assimilates the referent model. The referent model, which is based on previous calls for IKM frameworks to have a sound theoretical foundation, incorporates two established concepts from the IKM literature: (a) the operational, analytical and strategic domains of IKM activity and (b) double and single loop feedback loops of systems thinking applied to IKM processes. The practical and flexible IKM framework, which assimilates these concepts, has three dimensions. These dimensions are (i) domains of IKM activity and feedback loops (ii)
 
 organizational enablers (iii) project context. It is envisaged that this framework be used
 
 by practitioners to identify and manage areas of the business environment that require
 
 attention to ensure success of IKM projects or initiatives.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information management (IM)</field><field name="subject">information resources management (IRM)</field><field name="subject">knowledge management (KM)</field><field name="subject">information and knowledge management (IKM)</field><field name="subject">interpretive research</field><field name="subject">multi-methodology research (MMR)</field><field name="subject">referent model</field><field name="subject">IKM frameworks</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15930/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Psychometric And Clincial Investigation Of Anxiety Sensitivity In Anxiety Disorders</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Kerry Ann</field><field name="description">Anxiety sensitivity is a cognitive, individual difference variable that is differentiated by an individual's fear of anxiety sensations and centred on the belief that such sensations result in harmful consequences. In order to test anxiety sensitivity, Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, and McNally (1986) developed the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI).  However, one contentious issue in the area concerns the factor analytic structure of anxiety sensitivity and this has important consequences for the construct.  Numerous investigations have been conducted using the ASI, and the results have varied appreciably with some researchers arguing for a unidimensional construct.  However the general consensus now is that anxiety sensitivity is multidimensional.  It has been argued that the repeated attempts to clarify the dimensionality of anxiety sensitivity, using the 16-item ASI, is problematic because the scale was never designed to measure a multidimensional construct in the first instance.  Thus, the objective of the dissertation was to critically examine the anxiety sensitivity construct by using an expanded, multidimensional measure of anxiety sensitivity referred to as the Anxiety Sensitivity Index - Revised ([ASI-R] Taylor &amp; Cox, 1998) and establish the psychometric properties of the measure by conducting a series of empirical investigations to assess the clinical utility of the measure.  
 
 A series of three empirical investigations are presented in the current dissertation.  The first investigation aimed to critically examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the ASI-R.  Confirmatory factor analysis using a clinical sample of adults revealed that the ASI-R could be improved substantially through the removal of 15 problematic items in order to account for the most robust dimensions of anxiety sensitivity.  The modified measure was re-named the 21-item Anxiety Sensitivity Index (21-item ASI) and re-analysed with a large sample of nonclinical adults, revealing configural and metric invariance across groups.  Further, comparisons with other alternative models that also include comparisons with previous published ASI models indicated the 21-item ASI to be the best fitting model for both groups.  There was also evidence of internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity for both samples.  The aim of the second investigation was to critically examine differences between and within various anxiety classifications, a mood disorder classification, and a nonclinical control sample, with respect to both general and specific dimensions of anxiety sensitivity as identified by the 21-item ASI.  In most instances, the results revealed that the differences between and within the diagnostic groups were consistent with theoretical expectations.  Finally, the third investigation aimed to examine differences within each diagnostic category before and after cognitive behavioural therapy in order to provide a further test of validity for the revised 21-item ASI.  The results revealed significant differences within all but one diagnostic group on the pre and post-treatment scores, using the global and specific dimensions of the 21-item ASI.  
 
 The strengths, theoretical contribution, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.  It is concluded that the overall findings relating to the series of empirical investigations presented in the current dissertation make a significant and valid theoretical contribution to the field of anxiety sensitivity in particular, and anxiety research in general, by enhancing our understanding of anxiety sensitivity and how the 21-item ASI can be used to improve therapeutic interventions in clinical practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anxiety Sensitivity</field><field name="subject">Anxiety Sensitivity Index</field><field name="subject">ASI-R</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15931/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Family-Focused Intensive Care Nursing Through Action Research</field><field name="creator">Coyer, Fiona Maree</field><field name="description">Introduction:  The purpose of this study was to facilitate an improved understanding by intensive care nurses about their care of family members of critically ill patients. The study aimed to challenge intensive care nurses to reconceptulaise family nursing within the context of the intensive care unit (ICU).    Background to the study:  Critical illness is not an event that occurs in isolation for the patient and staff. It affects the patient's family in a unique way. A plethora of literature exists identifying the needs of family members in the ICU. However, there are considerably fewer studies which have examined interventions to meet family members' needs and no identified research that discreetly examined the concept of family-focused nursing in the intensive care environment.    Design of the study:  This study utilised a collaborative action research methodology. It was developed in four phases through the cyclical, dynamic steps of action research.    Setting:  This study was undertaken in the general intensive care facility of a metropolitan tertiary referral hospital.    Phase One:  Phase One of the study was the establishment of a collaborative action research group (CARG) with interested registered nurses working in a general intensive care unit. The CARG explored the first two research questions of this study: 1) What are intensive care nurses' perceptions of family-focused nursing? and 2) Is familyfocused nursing appropriate in the intensive care environment? Data were collected through audio taping meetings, flip chart notes and the researcher's reflective diary. Data analysis was undertaken utilising open coding. For the first research question, open coding of the data revealed two categories relating to perceptions of family focused intensive care nursing: partnership in care and maintaining a balance. For the second research question, CARG members agreed unanimously that family focused nursing was appropriate in the intensive care environment. The CARG determined future direction of the action research phases, commencing with a family needs analysis in Phase Two.    Phase Two:  Phase Two of the study was the utilization of a descriptive survey to determine family member needs in the ICU to determine focuses for interventions during Phase Three. Both family members and staff in the ICU were surveyed utilising the Critical Care Family Needs Index (CCFNI) (Molter &amp; Leske, 1983). Data were analysed by the CCFNI subcategories of assurance, proximity, information, comfort and support, comparing means, rank ordering of means and t-test for statistically significant differences in means between the family members and staff participants. Results indicated that statistically significant differences in means scores between family members and staff participants were in the CCFNI categories of assurance, proximity, information and support. On the basis of these results, a platform for Phase Three of this study arose. The areas for intervention for Phase Three were identified by the CARG as: the provision of staff education seminars to raise staff awareness of family needs and the development of a structured family assessment tool to identify family needs in the ICU.    Phase Three:  Phase Three of the study addressed research question three: &amp;quotHow can intensive care nurses provide care that is focused toward the family of the critically ill patient?" Phase Three examined practice interventions in two areas. Phase Three Part A was the implementation of nursing staff education seminars. Forty-two nursing staff participated in the family needs education seminars. Data were collected by detailed researcher field notes and completion of a descriptive survey, the CCFNI, post seminar attendance. Thirty-five participants completed the CCFNI. This CCFNI data from nursing participants in the education seminars was compared to family members CCFNI data from Phase Two. Open coding of data from the education seminars revealed codes of family needs, visiting, family presence, encouragement, simple things and boundaries under the theme of &amp;quotestablishing the context" and attitudes, confidence, empathy and culture under the theme of &amp;quotbuilding a partnership". CCFNI results highlighted statistically significant differences in means scores between family members and staff participants were in the subcategories of proximity and support. Results demonstrated that through understanding family members needs that intensive care nurses can provide care that is focused toward the family of the critically ill patient. This is a building process to be achieved over time. Phase Three Part B was the content validity development of a family assessment tool for the Computer Information System (CIS) in the ICU. A family assessment tool (See Figure 6.1) was developed through the literature and in consultation with the CARG. A series of focus groups were organised. All nursing staff in the general ICU were invited to participate. Twenty-nine registered nurses (43.9%, n=66) participated in the family assessment tool focus groups. The five domains of the family assessment tool, family roles, family spokesperson, family perception and coping, family issues and family health needs, were each discussed to determine readability, clarity and applicability. The focus groups agreed on content validity of the family assessment tool. (See Figure 6.2).    Phase Four:  Finally, Phase Four of the study has addressed research question four: &amp;quotIs action research an appropriate methodology to transform intensive care nursing practice?" Somekh's (1995) framework was utilised to guide this critical evaluation. It is suggested that action research is an appropriate methodology to transform intensive care nursing practice as it enables the development of professional, it is sensitive to the specific nature of intensive care nursing, it acknowledges of attributes of the researcher in the process. It is also an appropriate methodological choice as it provides opportunity for a critical evaluation and a platform for the ongoing nature of the action research journey.    Conclusions:  Overall the findings achieved the objectives of the study in that organisational, cultural and clinical practice changes were identified to facilitate family-focused intensive care nursing. Collaboration occurred with intensive care nurses to effect change. The action research process involved in the change process was articulated throughout the four phases of the study. An improved understanding by intensive care nurses about their family nursing practice was demonstrated in Phase Three and the efficacy of action research methodology for clinical practice change was demonstrated in Phase Four.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family Members</field><field name="subject">Intensive Care</field><field name="subject">Action Research</field><field name="subject">General Systems Theory</field><field name="subject">Family Member Needs</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Assessment</field><field name="subject">Family Focused Care</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15932/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pluralism, Australian newspaper diversity and the promise of the Internet</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Kieran Joseph</field><field name="description">In this thesis I address the research question: 'How has the Internet delivered pluralism by promoting structural diversity and/or content diversity in Australia's newspaper industry?' Structural diversity is defined here as diversity in newspaper ownership and content diversity as the diversity of views published by individual newspapers. Central to the thesis is the notion of pluralism, the belief that the news media should provide a range of views and opinions, contradictory as well as complementary, to allow informed citizens to effectively take part in the democratic process. The newspaper industry in this country, however, is controlled by a powerful press oligopoly across a range of markets, a situation believed to greatly limit pluralism. A review of newspaper ownership and circulation from 1986 to 2002 shows that, as at 2002, four newspaper owners are the sole occupants of Australia's national and capital city newspaper market. Seven owners are predominant in Australia's regional daily newspaper market, although just three owners controlled 69 per cent of the market's circulation in 2002. Two owners controlled 69 per cent of Australia's suburban newspaper market in 2002. Similar trends were seen in the country's Saturday newspaper and Sunday newspaper markets. In all markets except the regional daily newspaper market, News Limited is the dominant newspaper owner. Australian Provincial News and Media is the dominant owner in the regional daily newspaper market with a 27 per cent share of circulation in 2002. Australia's concentrated newspaper ownership structure has led to a number of formal inquiries into diversity in the industry since 1980. In this thesis I review two of these inquiries, the 1991-92 House of Representatives Select Committee on the Print Media (the Print Media Inquiry) and the 2000 Productivity Commission Inquiry into Broadcasting, to determine (among other things) the nature of and the relationship between structural and content diversity as they apply to Australia's newspapers. (By virtue of major media groups' involvement in the Productivity Commission's inquiry - particularly News Limited, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited and, to a lesser extent, Rural Press - this inquiry, although broadcast-oriented, considered Australia's newspaper industry at length.) This review shows both inquiries were clear on how they saw this relationship - structural diversity is necessary for content diversity. However, the Print Media Inquiry suggested it was almost impossible to guarantee structural diversity in the nation's newspaper industry. The Productivity Commission, meanwhile, said that while it accepted content diversity was not inconsistent with media ownership concentration, it was more likely to be achieved where there was diverse ownership. With the relationship between structural and content diversity in mind, and the Print Media Inquiry's and the Productivity Commission's beliefs that new entrants in the newspaper industry were unlikely in the short term, I examine the suggestion that the Internet has the potential to increase structural diversity in Australia's newspaper industry by allowing new players to efficiently enter the industry via the World Wide Web. The extent to which this might occur is determined by a study of 18 Australian newspaper websites with one argument being that if established newspapers find the transition online relatively easy, then independent online-only news sites might be similarly established. Mings and White's four online news business models - a subscription model, advertising model, e commerce-based transactional model and partnership-based model - are used as a framework to examine the study's results. The study shows Australia's experience mirrors international experience in terms of the growth of newspapers online and in terms of their lack of profitability. It shows that 28 per cent of the newspapers surveyed maintained their circulation while offering free online news content, while a further 33 per cent registered circulation increases. Advertising revenue increased for seven of the nine newspaper websites containing advertising, suggesting that, for some Australian newspapers at least, gaining online advertising (as opposed to gaining overall profitability) has proved successful. And while the survey shows little evidence of Australian newspapers using the transactional model in any real sense, it does show that Australian newspapers are forming local online partnerships with other media and non-media businesses to facilitate their online activities.    The study's key finding is that of the 18 newspapers surveyed, just two websites were profitable. This finding is consistent with literature that highlights a lack of commercially viable independent online news ventures both in Australia and internationally. While considerable hopes were held that the Internet would introduce more structural diversity into Australia's newspaper industry, I argue that the Internet's commercial imperatives, as they apply to newspapers, have to a large extent precluded it from adding structural diversity in the industry. In these circumstances, it may be that the only viable way of increasing content diversity in the nation's newspaper industry is to increase the availability of diverse information sources to journalists. I propose that one way to do this is via the Internet.      The extent to which this is occurring is determined by a survey of Australian journalists' Internet use, the survey results showing that 97.4 per cent of the journalists who responded now use the Internet regularly, including 97.5 per cent of newspaper journalists. But most journalists who responded use the Internet as a preliminary research tool and as a way to check facts rather than as a means of accessing diverse news sources. The respondents' top five Internet uses, for example, are to e-mail work colleagues, to undertake preliminary research, to access media releases from websites, to verify facts and to search other news organisations' websites. They access major news organisation websites most frequently, followed by government websites, university/research institution websites and corporate/company websites. The least frequently accessed websites are those that could conceivably provide the alternate views demanded by pluralism: online news and current affairs discussion groups and websites set up by private individuals. The survey shows the types of websites Australian journalists most frequently access are linked to the credibility they give to information contained on those websites. Major news organisation websites are seen as providing the most credible information, followed by university/research institution websites and government websites. Websites perceived as providing the least credible information were those that host online news and current affairs discussion groups and websites set up by private individuals. The survey also shows Australian journalists have not embraced online reader interaction to any extent, lessening the likelihood that readers will be able to provide journalists with more diverse news sources. Less than 20 per cent of journalists interact with readers via the Internet and less than 10 per cent use this interaction to create or follow up news stories. The survey does provide results that support source diversity, however. It shows that almost a third of Australian journalists have obtained additional news sources via the Internet. The Internet has also allowed more than 40 per cent of journalists to access individuals or groups that they would not otherwise have accessed. The survey also shows that journalists who have had experience working in the online media environment consistently use the Internet more productively, in terms of diversity, than other journalists. It is these journalists that interact online with readers more, that participate in online discussion groups more and that appear more willing to seek online information from non-traditional sources such as independent news websites and the websites of private individuals or groups. Journalists with online media experience also represent the group that has most sought training in online journalism and online media practice and that most believes the Internet will play an increasingly important role for journalists and news consumers in the future. At present, the survey suggests, journalists with this online media experience comprise just 19 per cent of Australian journalists. But as the number of journalists with online media experience increases in the workforce, these journalists' greater acceptance of the Internet may then assist in greater source diversity leading to greater content diversity in Australia's news media.    The studies of newspaper websites and journalists' Internet use suggest and support differing diversity models. In this thesis I propose two models for diversity, the first drawn from views espoused by the Print Media Inquiry and the Productivity Commission's Inquiry into Broadcasting. This model (below) sees a one-to-one correspondence between structural and content diversity and assumes that to increase the diversity of views available to the public, the number of media outlets must similarly be increased. The argument that the Internet can provide media pluralism by permitting new players to enter the media market relatively easily, an argument tested by my study of Australian newspaper websites, is commensurate with this model.    The second model is based on my inquiries into journalists' Internet use and proposes a method of increasing content diversity within a fixed media ownership structure. This model (below) acknowledges that journalists produce content mostly via traditional news sources, but proposes this content can be increased and/or changed, with an emphasis on more diverse information, via non-traditional news sources obtained via the Internet.    The success of this model, however, is predicated on journalists' acceptance of online information as a viable news source. The implication for journalism is that established journalistic norms and practices, which can limit online-supported content diversity, need to be overcome.    Overall, the results of my inquiries suggest the answer to the research question is that the Internet has so far delivered little in terms of structural and content diversity in Australia's newspaper industry. However, the Internet's potential to do so remains, particularly if independent online-based media ventures find ways to become commercially viable and if journalists adopt the technology as a means of finding more diverse news sources.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">House of Representatives Select Committee on the Print Media</field><field name="subject">Print Media Inquiry</field><field name="subject">Productivity Commission Inquiry into Broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Australian newspaper circulation</field><field name="subject">Australian Provincial News and Media</field><field name="subject">Convergence</field><field name="subject">Globalism</field><field name="subject">The Internet</field><field name="subject">Media diversity</field><field name="subject">Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance</field><field name="subject">Murdoch</field><field name="subject">Rupert</field><field name="subject">New media</field><field name="subject">News Limited</field><field name="subject">Online journalism</field><field name="subject">Online newspapers</field><field name="subject">Packer</field><field name="subject">Kerry</field><field name="subject">Pluralism</field><field name="subject">Productivity Commission</field><field name="subject">Publishing and Broadcasting Limited</field><field name="subject">Rural Press</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15933/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young People and Performance: the Impact of Deterritorialisation on Contemporary Theatre for Young People</field><field name="creator">Gattenhof, Sandra Jane</field><field name="description">Within contemporary performance arenas young people are fast becoming part of the vanguard of contemporary performance. Performativity, convergence and openness of form are key animating concepts in the landscape of Theatre for Young People (TYP). To ignore what is taking place in the making of performance for and by young people is to ignore the new possibilities in meaning-making and theatrical form.    In this period of rapid technological change young people are embracing and manipulating technology (sound, image, music) to represent who they are and what they want to say. Positioned as &amp;quotcultural catalysts", &amp;quotthe new pioneers" and &amp;quotfirst navigators" young people are using mediatised culture and digital technologies with ease, placing them at the forefront of a shift in cultural production.    Performance commentators (Schnechner 2002; Shusterman 2000; Auslander 1999; Hill and Paris 2001; Phelan 1993 and Kershaw 1992) believe that there has been a profound shift in the nature of making theatre and performance works. The forces of globalisation, the new economy and advancements in new media technologies have affected young people's making of performance. Three key concepts animate contemporary young people's performance devising and presenting processes. These concepts can be defined as: performativity, convergence and openness of form.    These three categories can be harnessed under the umbrella concept of deterritorialisation. The processes of deterritorialisation allows for the synthesis of new cultural and performance genres by fragmenting and hybridising traditional cultural categories and forms including the use of new media technologies. Almost half of all TYP performances now incorporate the technologies of reproduction. The relationship between live and mediated forms, the visceral and the virtual is allowing young people to navigate and make meaning of cultural codes and cultural forms as well as to engage in an open dialogue with their audiences. This thesis examines the way young people are using elements of deterritorialisation to become producers of new performance genres.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Industries</field><field name="subject">Content Creation</field><field name="subject">Convergence</field><field name="subject">Deterritorialisation</field><field name="subject">Mediated Culture</field><field name="subject">Performativity</field><field name="subject">Planetism</field><field name="subject">Technology</field><field name="subject">Theatre For Young People</field><field name="subject">Theatrical Form</field><field name="subject">Youth Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15934/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Little brother is watching you: Preschool children, television news and responsibility in Australia</field><field name="creator">Hetherington, Susan</field><field name="description">Hundreds of thousands of Australian children under the age of six witnessed at least some of the coverage of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. In the days and weeks that followed September 11, the researcher was confronted with numerous anecdotes from mothers who talked about the impact the coverage had had on their children. Many of the mothers reported that they had not known their children were watching the coverage or had not believed that they were old enough to understand what was going on. This raised the question of responsibility and sparked the research project which asked how could preschool children best be protected from material that was likely to disturb or harm them both in scheduled news broadcasts and extraordinary events such as September 11? Through surveys, focus groups with mothers and interviews with news directors, the research looked at existing protections, how well they worked in the view of both parents and the industry and whether there could or should be a better way.    The research recommended that greater protection of preschool children from inappropriate television news content could be achieved through the implementation of six recommendations.    1.	Television news should be Rated PG.    2.	Digital television technology should be employed to prevent news events 'overtaking' scheduled children's programming and to protect safe harbours placed in the classifications zones to protect children.    3.	Broadcasters should regain control of the images that go to air during 'live' feeds from obviously volatile situations by building in short delays in G classification zones.    4.	Parents should be educated to understand that even very young children can take in television news and are often scared by it.    5.	Television journalists should understand that even very young children are exposed to television news and are often scared by it.    6.	News promotions during afternoon children's programming should be dropped.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">preschool children</field><field name="subject">television news</field><field name="subject">responsibility.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15935/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Novel Technologies for Improved Natural Illumination of High Rise Office Buildings</field><field name="creator">Greenup, Phillip John</field><field name="description">Effective daylighting can substantially reduce the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of commercial buildings. Daylight is also healthy for building occupants, and contributes to occupant satisfaction. When productivity improvements are considered, effective daylighting is also highly attractive financially. However, successful daylighting of sub-tropical buildings is a very difficult task, due to high direct irradiances and excessive solar shading. A device was created that combined effective solar shading and efficient daylight redirection.    The micro-light guiding shade panel achieves all objectives of an optimal daylighting device placed on the fa&#231;ade of a sub-tropical, high rise office building. Its design is based on the principles of non-imaging optics. This provides highly efficient designs offering control over delivered illumination, within the constraints of the second law of thermodynamics. Micro-light guiding shade panels were constructed and installed on a test building. The tested devices delivered daylight deep into the building under all conditions. Some glare was experienced with a poorly chosen translucent material. Glare was eliminated by replacing this material. Construction of the panels could be improved by application of mass-manufacturing techniques including metal pressing.    For the micro-light guiding shade panel to be utilised to its full potential, building designers must understand its impact on building performance early in the design process. Thus, the device must be modelled with lighting simulation software currently in use by building design firms. The device was successfully modelled by the RADIANCE lighting simulator. RADIANCE predictions compared well with measurements, providing bias generally less than 10%. Simulations greatly aided further development of the micro-light guiding shade panel. Several new RADIANCE algorithms were developed to improve daylight simulation in general.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Daylighting</field><field name="subject">Non-imaging Optics</field><field name="subject">Micro-Light Guiding Shade Panel</field><field name="subject">RADIANCE</field><field name="subject">Lighting Simulation</field><field name="subject">Sub-tropical Climate</field><field name="subject">High Rise Office Buildings</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15936/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Small, Macroeconometric Model Of The Australian Economy : With An Emphasis On Modelling Wages And Prices</field><field name="creator">McHugh, Zoe D.</field><field name="description">Traditional macroeconometric models of the Australian economy estimate the behaviour of wage and price inflation separately, thereby ignoring the possibility that there is a contemporaneous relationship between these two variables. This thesis follows a recent trend emerging in other small open economies, such as the UK and Norway, which is to estimate the behaviour of wage and price inflation in a simultaneous-equations model. In order to capture the behaviour of the major variables which drive wages and prices, a complete model is constructed which embeds these important transmission channels.    The model is developed in three stages. First, underpinned by a theoretical framework of a unionized economy with imperfect competition, the core wage- price system is developed whereby consumer prices and average weekly earnings are jointly estimated in a simultaneous-equations framework. Particular atten- tion is given to estimating two identified cointegrating relationships for wages and prices. These equations are interpreted as the long-run targets of workers and firms respectively and are embedded in a parsimonious system of short-run dynamics which drive wages and prices towards their long-run levels.    Second, llie behaviour of llie main feedback variables driving llie wage-price system is modelled, with particular attention given to the unemployment rate. While several of the most recent models of unemployment show that the aggregate unemployment rate in Australia does indeed behave differently during periods of low and high unemployment, none can explain what drives the unemployment rate to increase at such a rapid rate and what contributes to its much slower decrease. Another central issue of this thesis, therefore, is to propose a rationale for this as yet unexplained phenomenon. The remaining behavioural variables in the model, including aggregate labour productivity, domestic output and the real exchange rate, are all estimated in a single-equation framework.    Third, these equations are then combined with a number of important identi- ties and an interest-rate reaction function to close the model. Then, the impacts of several simulated economic scenarios on Australia's economic landscape are considered. Special emphasis is given to analysing the impact of a large nomi- nal wage shock. The outcomes from these simulated scenarios are pertinent to understanding the inflation process and have important implications for a small open economy like Australia with an explicit inflation target. Overall, the major result to emerge from this thesis is that there is significant statistical support for the hypothesis that wage and price inflation in Australia are jointly determined. This phenomenon has not yet been fully exploited in current macroeconometric models of the Australian economy. The modelling exercise also reveals that the Australian unemployment rate is linear in demand and labour productivity shocks, with nonlinear behaviour caused by real wage rigidity and generous unemployment benefits. Importantly, this simple model is able to simulate the behaviour of the Australian economy extremely well. The outcome from the policy scenarios is clear: both demand-side and supply-side shocks have real and nominal effects on the economy in the short- to medium- run, ceteris paribus. Moreover, a large nominal wage shock to the economy, which results in a real wage rise, will have no sustained effect on the level of domestic activity in the economy, the inflation rate or the real exchange rate. Unemployment is, however, pushed slightly above equilibrium in the short- to medium-run due to a sustained higher real wage level.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wages And Prices</field><field name="subject">Unemployment</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Modelling</field><field name="subject">Cointegration</field><field name="subject">Nonlinearity</field><field name="subject">Model Simulation</field><field name="subject">Scenario Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15937/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">And God Created Pornography : The relationship between pornography and Christianity in the postmodern mediasphere</field><field name="creator">Hope, Ross A.</field><field name="description">Pornography and Christianity are multifaceted, complex institutions that resist generalisation.  In today's postmodern society, they are also mediated commodities that compete within the mediasphere. They are both dependant on the mass media, and communication technologies such as the internet for their survival.  The binarised nature of these two institutions has led to a significant amount of 'productive othering', whereby both institutions have sought to define themselves in relation to their 'other', thus creating a space in society for their opposing force.  In a sense, Christianity and pornography rely on each other in order to contextualise, and provide an opportunity to restate their own ideological position.  This mutual need, suggests that the contemporary nature of their relationship is symbiotic.  The relationship between pornography and Christianity can be observed in various sites within the mediasphere, such as the internet, and the film industry.  These two sites provide varying accounts of their relationship, and evidence of productive othering, while also demonstrating the paradoxical affect the postmodern mediasphere is having on these two institutions -- that they are also becoming increasingly hybridised, intertextual, and difficult to distinguish from one another.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mediasphere</field><field name="subject">Pornography</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">Sexual Abuse</field><field name="subject">Screenplay</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15938/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated hydrogeological/hydrogeochemical approach to characterising groundwater zonations within a quaternary coastal deltaic aquifier: The Burdekin River delta, North Queensland.</field><field name="creator">McMahon, Gerard Armstrong</field><field name="description">Despite being one of the largest aquifers of its type in Australia, the Burdekin River Delta (BRD) is an area that has received comparatively little research on its groundwater resources. This study conceptualises the hydrogeology of the BRD and characterises the relationships between the stratigraphic elements and the physical and chemical components of the groundwater system that influence the major  governing processes. Importantly, a large amount of spatial and temporal groundwater information exists in database form, which enables an integrated conceptual model of the BRD aquifer to be developed from the key hydrogeological  and hydrogeochemical relationships. Conceptualisation of the BRD aquifer is  achieved by categorising four main aspects of the groundwater resource:  1. Surface characterisation;  2. Geologic characterisation;  3. Hydrogeologic characterisation; and  4. Groundwater System characterisation.    The BRD is a large cuspate delta comprising a complex stratigraphy of Pleistocene to  Holocene sediments of fluvial, deltaic and marine origin to a maximum depth of about 150 metres. The lower Pleistocene sediments lie predominantly below sea level and are typified by laterally discontinuous sands, silts and clays that have formed in response to fluctuating sea levels. The upper Pleistocene boundary is differentiated from the overlying Holocene sediments by a formerly exposed surface of semiconsolidated oxidised sandy clays and gravel. By contrast, the Holocene sediments  comprise loose, uncompacted sequences of fluvial channel sands, interdistributary  floodplain silts and marine incursions of estuarine clays and mangrove muds. The  anastomosing array of fluvial sand bodies of former Burdekin River channels and  levees is the setting for the main shallow aquifer units.    Aquifer units of the lower Pleistocene sediments are in hydraulic connection with the  Holocene units, effectively categorising the whole BRD as a single unconfined aquifer. Hydraulic gradients from both sides of the river divide the BRD into two broad flow regimes. Interpreted flow zones based on hydrograph patterns further subdivide the flow system based on seasonal recharge response to elevated river heights and flooding, and response to long-term rainfall patterns associated with La Ni&#241;a  episodes of the Southern Oscillation. Stable isotope data (2H and 18O) indicate that  the dominant isotopic signature of groundwater throughout the BRD corresponds with intense rainfall activity, however high deuterium-excess values indicate that significant evaporation occurs prior to recharge. This infers dominant recharge by the Burdekin River that drains a massive catchment extending hundreds of kilometres inland. Direct recharge via rainfall infiltration is largely dependant on soil texture. More conductive soils are associated with the major levee systems that comprise the  main shallow aquifers.    Two evolutionary hydrogeochemical paths exist for the north and south sides of the river, and are constrained by the interpreted flow zones. In the south side, groundwater enters the main aquifer from river recharge and leakage out of weathered granite outcrops (exposed bedrock). Mineral hydrolysis and evaporative  concentration of salts initially evolve groundwater in the weathered granite to a  combination of Na-Cl and Na-HCO3 type. Leakage through clay-rich hillwash and marginal sediments causes reverse cation-exchange reactions where excess Na replaces Ca and Mg on ion-exchange surfaces. This leads to the formation of Mg,Ca-Cl type groundwaters into the southern parts of the main aquifer  (supersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite). Discharge towards the coast is characterised by seawater mixing where salinity increases with corresponding evolution to Na-Cl type waters. Recharge waters from the Burdekin River are fresh (&lt;250mS/cm) Ca-HCO3  type, undersaturated with respect to calcite, and are easily distinguishable from the  ion-exchange groundwater. In the north, only one smaller outcrop of bedrock exists, which hosts similar mineral hydrolysis reactions and base-exchange reactions. An absence of associated Na-Cl type waters means that reverse-cation exchange reactions are negligible, and so water types are predominantly Na-HCO3 type. Aquifer sands in the north are more widespread than in the south, so the fresh Ca-HCO3 recharge  waters tend to dominate the overall groundwater composition, with Na-HCO3 types limited to the exposed bedrock areas. Towards the coastline, groundwater mixes with seawater towards Na-Cl type waters, similar to that observed in the south. The mangrove mud sequences that flank the coastline of the BRD are associated with  high-Fe and low-pH groundwater formed by the oxidation of Fe-sulphides such as pyrite). SO4 is a product of this reaction, but does not achieve abnormally high concentrations, possibly due to the presence of sulphate-reducing bacteria. Carbonate dissolution is a possible side effect of acid sulphate generation, with possible gypsum dissolution as a secondary source of SO4. This study tested an alternative method to characterising groundwater to determine if  the spatial extent of hydrogeochemical processes could be defined and comparable results achieved. This method involved discriminating discrete statistical groups of ionic ratios based on their cumulative frequency distribution. The statistical groups  are bounded by critical values that distinguish different chemical processes, referred  to as hydrogeochemical indicators. Various tested ionic ratios produced analogous  indicators, proving their reliability as a valid method for the characterisation of groundwater chemistry.    The significance of this research underlies the importance of groundwater use in the BRD as a primary source of irrigation supplies. Land use expansion and unregulated pumping pose a risk to future groundwater quality and sustainable volumes. The understanding of the relationship between the main geologic elements and the  subsequent hydrogeochemical processes provides a scientific basis for conceptualising the groundwater resource. This establishes a framework for initiating future groundwater management options.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogeology</field><field name="subject">hydrogeochemistry</field><field name="subject">conceptual model</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">Burdekin</field><field name="subject">Quaternary</field><field name="subject">delta</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15939/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The vibrational spectroscopy of minerals</field><field name="creator">Martens, Wayde Neil</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the vibrational spectroscopy of the aragonite and  vivianite arsenate minerals (erythrite, annabergite and h&#246;rnesite), specifically the  assignment of the spectra. The infrared and Raman spectra of cerussite have been  assigned according to the vibrational symmetry species. The assignment of satellite  bands to 18O isotopes has been discussed with respect to the use of these bands to the  quantification of the isotopes. Overtone and combination bands have been assigned  according to symmetry species and their corresponding fundamental vibrations. The  vibrational spectra of cerussite have been compared with other aragonite group  minerals and the differences explained on the basis of differing chemistry and crystal  structures of these minerals.        The single crystal spectra of natural erythrite has been reported and compared  with the synthetic equivalent. The symmetry species of the vibrations have been  assigned according to single crystal and factor group considerations. Deuteration  experiments have allowed the assignment of water vibrational freque ncies to discrete  water molecules in the crystal structure. Differences in the spectra of other vivianite  arsenates, namely annabergite and h&#246;rnesite, have been explained by consideration of  their differing chemistry and crystal structures.        A novel approach to the assignment of site occupancy of ions in the erythrite -  annabergite solid solution has been reported. This approach has utilised vibrational  spectroscopy, in conjunction with careful consideration of the crystal structures of the  minerals. It has been shown that in the erythrite - annabergite solid solution Coprefers metal site 2 contrasting nickel which prefers site 1. This study in conjunction  with other studies has yielded the trend that the more electronegative metal prefers to  occupy site 1, with the least electronegative metal preferring to occupy site 2.      Fundamentally this thesis has increased the knowledge base of the  spectroscopic properties of the aragonite and the vivianite minerals. The site  occupancy of metal ion substitutions in solid solution series of the vivianite group of  minerals has been further enhanced, with novel method of studying the site occupancy  of ions in solid solutions has been developed. A detailed knowledge and  understanding of factor group analysis applied to the study of minerals has been  achieved.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Annabergite</field><field name="subject">Aragonite</field><field name="subject">Arupite</field><field name="subject">Baricite</field><field name="subject">Cerussite</field><field name="subject">Erythrite</field><field name="subject">H&#246;rnesite</field><field name="subject">Infrared Spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">K&#246;ttigite</field><field name="subject">Minerals</field><field name="subject">Parasymplesite</field><field name="subject">Raman Spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Solid Solutions</field><field name="subject">Strontianite</field><field name="subject">Vibrational Spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Vivianite</field><field name="subject">Witherite</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15940/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Modelling of the Role of Haptotaxis in Tumour Growth and Invasion</field><field name="creator">Mallet, Daniel Gordon</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a number of mathematical models of haptotactic cell migration are developed. The modelling of haptotaxis is presented in two distinct parts - the &#64257;rst comprises an investigation of haptotaxis in pre-necrotic avascular tumours, while the second consists of the modelling of adhesion-mediated haptotactic cell migration within tissue, with particular attention paid to the biological appropriateness of the description of cell-extracellular matrix adhesion.    A model is developed that describes the e&#64256;ects of passive and haptotactic migration on the cellular dynamics and growth of pre-necrotic avascular tumours. The model includes a description of the extracellular matrix and its e&#64256;ect on cell migration. Questions are posed as to which cell types act as a source of the extracellular matrix, and the model is used to simulate the possible e&#64256;ects of di&#64256;erent matrix sources. Simulations in one-dimensional and spherically symmetric geometry are presented, displaying familiar results such as three-phase tumour growth and tumours comprising a rim of proliferating cells surrounding a non-proliferating region. Novel e&#64256;ects are also described such as cell population splitting and tumour shrinkage due to haptotaxis and appropriate extracellular matrix construction. The avascular tumour model is then extended to describe the internalisation of labelled cells and inert microspheres within multicell tumour spheroids.    A novel model of adhesion-receptor mediated haptotactic cell migration is presented and speci&#64257;c applications of the model to tumour invasion processes are discussed. This model includes a more biologically realistic description of cell adhesion than has been considered in previous models of cell population haptotaxis. Through assumptions of fast kinetics, the model is simpli&#64257;ed with the identi&#64257;cation of relationships between the simpli&#64257;ed model and previous models of haptotaxis.    Further simpli.cations to the model are made and travelling wave solutions of the original model are then investigated. It is noted that the generic numerical solution routine NAG D03PCF is not always appropriate for the solution of the model, and can produce oscillatory and inaccurate solutions. For this reason, a control volume numerical solver with .ux limiting is developed to provide a better method of solving the cell migration models.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adhesion Receptors</field><field name="subject">Anoikis</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Cell Migration</field><field name="subject">Chemotaxis</field><field name="subject">Control Volume Method</field><field name="subject">Extracellular Matrix</field><field name="subject">&#64258;ux Limiting</field><field name="subject">Haptotactic Boundary Layer</field><field name="subject">Haptotaxis</field><field name="subject">Integrin Blocking</field><field name="subject">Integrins</field><field name="subject">Internalisation</field><field name="subject">Invasion</field><field name="subject">Lamellipod</field><field name="subject">Landau Transformation</field><field name="subject">Ligand</field><field name="subject">Metastasis</field><field name="subject">Multicell Spheroid</field><field name="subject">Newton&#146;s Method</field><field name="subject">Phase Plane</field><field name="subject">Protease</field><field name="subject">Taxis</field><field name="subject">Travelling Wave</field><field name="subject">Tumor</field><field name="subject">Tumour</field><field name="subject">Wall Of Singularities</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15941/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The plot against character : Towards a character-centred model of screenwriting</field><field name="creator">Mullins, Anthony</field><field name="description">Summary of exegesis  A review and critique of some of the most popular screenwriting concepts as well as a proposal for a screenplay model that seeks to conceptually synthesise character with structure.

It acknowledges that we exist amidst the parameters of our own perceptual constructs. Our frameworks for navigation often range in degrees of openness to the unknown and to outside scrutiny. I set out to explore these concepts through interactions with different individuals and social groups, each with their unique templates. I hoped to produce a stimulating film that engaged diverse audiences through diverse content.    Structural and stylistic considerations are paramount to my theoretical and post-production reflections on Uncertainty. Deleuze and Guattari's (1988) theory of rhizomes provides a good reference in terms of the cross-fertilisation of ideas, decentralised structure and different states of connection that I hoped to provoke through the film. New documentary theory highlights a trend towards greater interaction between filmmaker, audience and subject (Bruzzi, 2000). This signals a growing understanding that striving for objectivity in documentary is redundant. Although it is a welcome development, discussion could be broadened in relation to filmmaker presence and interactivity, to include style and structure as modes of primary interaction for the filmmaker with the audience and subject. This exegesis approaches expanding the parameters for interaction to examples, such as Uncertainty, where the filmmaker is neither present in image or voice. Texts that offer constellations of ideas, like a rhizome, provide an alternative to those following a more linear progression or centralised argument. Promoting greater connectivity and multiplicity in documentary is congruous with the current developments in communications and technologies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhizome</field><field name="subject">Plateau</field><field name="subject">Chaordic</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15944/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of Community Policing within the Brisbane Metropolitan North Police Region: Issues and Problems</field><field name="creator">Thorne, Colin Stanley</field><field name="description">Abstract  The role of policing within western democratic countries has become increasingly clouded. This nebulous role of policing has been impacted upon by such issues as, the diversity and complexity of social change, the advances achieved within the technology field and the increasing amount of legislation that has been passed in an endeavour to accommodate such changes. Over the decades these developments have required policing organisations to shift their focus from the original crime prevention in conjunction with community collaboration to one which is predominantly incident driven and enforcement focused.    Through the adoption of various strategies utilising technology, beginning with the motor vehicle, the police organisation has also progressively widened the gap between itself and the community being policed. With the widening of this gap such traits as trust, familiarity, co-operation and information exchange between the two parties has declined. This appears to have a domino effect on the fear of crime and social disorder within the community, thus impacting on the quality of life of community members.    Within recent decades some of the traditional policing practices -  including random preventive patrol, rapid response and the need for additional police because of increasing crime - have been questioned and researched. The findings of these research projects have not supported the effectiveness of such policing strategies. The role of policing, thus comes into question and a return to the historical role of policing espoused when Sir Robert Peel established the London Metropolitan Police and drafted the Principles of Policing, which was issued to each newly appointed constable, is being revisited. This has been promoted in the form of the  'community policing' concept.    This community policing concept is stated as consisting of three core components - personalised policing through a police officer being stationed within a set geographic area; police-community partnership and problem-solving. However, in order to establish and maintain a viable partnership, both parties must participate and be aware of what the partnership entails. Similarly, with problem-solving both the community and police must identify and prioritise the local community problems. Both of these core components are bonded together through the appointment of a police officer within the community providing personalised policing. This shift in policing focus would necessitate changes both within the police organisation and the community itself. It must be remembered that the reactive, incident driven model of policing has been in existence for several decades and changing such a model will require some time.    Thus, the effective implementation of community policing requires an agreement as to what community policing means and then a marketing and training program so that at the outset both parties are on an equal footing. As for the problem solving component of community policing, the parties to the partnership need to accommodate the differing foci of the opposite party. From the policing perspective, this requires accepting input from the community rather than maintaining a controlling demeanour. The police therefore, need to adopt an approach espoused by Wilson and Kelling (1982) in their article titled, 'Broken Windows: The Police and Neighbourhood Safety' which has been discussed in several literary works dealing with the community policing concept [Edwards 2001; Kenney (ed) 1989; Trojanowicz &amp; Bucqueroux 1994]. The community also needs to be involved and this can be achieved initially, by maintaining support and enthusiasm for the community policing activities initiated.    The success of implementing community policing relies on the adoption of the core components. The two community policing components, police-community partnership and problem-solving are impacted on by the third core component of personalised policing within a particular area. The personalised policing component is the need to have stable and reasonably enduring police personnel deployed to respective community locales. By adding this factor to the community policing components there is provided a degree of continuity and thus both parties develop a degree of familiarity which can lead to trust and confidence. The implementation of community policing to this extent needs to be holistically addressed through the police organisational dimensions, namely the philosophical, the strategic and the programmatic. Through these dimensions a comprehensive development of the community policing concept can be undertaken.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="subject">Community Policing</field><field name="subject">Community Oriented Policing</field><field name="subject">Fitzgerald Inquiry</field><field name="subject">Police</field><field name="subject">Problem-Oriented Policing</field><field name="subject">Problem-Oriented and Partnership Policing</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15945/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential involvement of Platelet-Derived microparticles during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty</field><field name="creator">Craft, Judy Ann</field><field name="description">Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries.  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is an important treatment option when intervention is required; namely for patients with relatively severe occlusions.  However, adverse events including recurrence of angina pectoris and restenosis of the treated artery limit patient prognosis, with subsequent re-vascularisation often necessary.  Platelet activation accompanies PTCA, with platelet adhesion and aggregation involved in thrombus formation during restenosis.  During platelet activation, highly coagulant platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) are formed, and it is likely that these PMPs will also be produced during PTCA.  While platelet aggregation inhibitors used during PTCA limit platelet aggregation and decrease the incidence of restenosis, they do not prevent PMPs being formed.  PMPs are capable of adhesion and aggregation, and adhere to PTCA treated arteries in an animal model.  Therefore, in order to understand the phenomenon of restenosis and its improved limitation, it is necessary to investigate PMP formation during PTCA.    The field of PMP study is in its infancy, with conflicting results from the substantial inequities in methods of PMP measurement, which may be exacerbated by PMP heterogeneity.  The current literature on this topic is reviewed in Chapter 2, where the PMP surface and possible functions are considered, and the PMP size and morphology examined.  To conclude, the relationship between PMPs and PTCA is explored, with a focus on the potential role of PMPs in restenosis.  The knowledge deficiencies in this field are highlighted at the conclusion of this chapter.    Very little is known regarding the production of PMPs with PTCA.  The level of PMPs during PTCA was monitored in paired arterial blood samples obtained from seventy-five patients undergoing the procedure (Chapter 3).  A significant increase in PMPs from baseline to completion of PTCA was clearly demonstrated for the first time.  This indicated that procoagulant PMPs are produced during PTCA and may contribute to subsequent restenosis.  Furthermore, administration of the platelet aggregation inhibitor abciximab to a group of thirty-eight high risk patients limited PMP formation; given that abciximab patients required more rigorous PTCA, the protective benefit of this medication for PMP production is underlined.  Although few patients in this study experienced restenosis, it is interesting to note that of those treated with abciximab, all patients suffering subsequent restenosis were revascularised using PTCA.  This demonstrates that their occlusions were comparatively mild as the need for coronary artery bypass grafting was avoided, and suggests that minimisation of PMP levels may assist in limiting the progression of severe restenosis.    The increased peripheral level of PMPs predicated investigation of the coronary circulation to determine local events.  Although the level of PMPs increased significantly within the coronary arteries of PTCA patients, there was no corresponding increase in the coronary sinus (Chapter 4).  This important finding indicated that significant levels of PMPs remained within the coronary circulation, where their ability to adhere, aggregate and accelerate haemostasis may allow them to contribute directly to restenosis.  During the time when increased levels of PMPs were being formed, there was no evidence of platelet lysis, which refuted the hypothesis that PMPs are merely membrane fragments of lysed platelets.  A wide variation in reported PMP sizes has contributed to the hypothesis that PMPs are heterogeneous.  As morphological information can assist in understanding physiology, the final study was designed to investigate platelet morphology from PTCA patients (Chapter 5).  Most platelets were activated prior to and following PTCA, with a slight decrease in body size occurring due to PTCA, presumably due to loss of cytoplasm in PMPs being shed as reported in the previous chapter.  Importantly, platelet distal pseudopod buds were observed, and these did not alter significantly with PTCA.  These buds were probably unformed PMPs, although the exact mechanism of PMP formation remains undetermined.  The platelet pseudopods were longer and significantly thinner distally with PTCA, which may be due to movement of cytoplasm into these terminal swellings.  In addition, buds or swellings directly on the platelet body were smaller following PTCA, and it is likely these may also be PMPs prior to detachment from the parent platelet.    This work has contributed substantially to knowledge of PMPs produced during PTCA.  The level of PMPs increased significantly in peripheral arterial samples, with the platelet aggregation inhibitor abciximab preventing this occurrence.  This may indicate that functional aggregation receptors are an essential requirement for PMP formation under these conditions.  However, it is possible for PMPs to be formed when aggregation is inhibited, and therefore the molecular mechanisms of PMP formation remain unconfirmed.  The examination of PMPs from the coronary circulation provided valuable data indicating that PMPs are produced during PTCA but remain within the coronary circulation. As PMPs are capable of adhesion and aggregation, this strongly suggests that PMPs within the coronary circulation would contribute directly to pathogenesis of restenosis, although further investigation on PMPs with PTCA is necessary to confirm this association.  The examination of platelet morphology during PTCA indicated that platelets possessed terminal pseudopod swellings, and cell surface swellings.  Importantly, the terminal swellings, which are likely to be unformed PMPs, were observed for the first time during PTCA.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Platelet-derived microparticles</field><field name="subject">platelets</field><field name="subject">percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty</field><field name="subject">abciximab</field><field name="subject">flow cytometry</field><field name="subject">scanning electron microscopy.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15946/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Becoming Leaders : An Investigation Into Women's Leadership In Male-Defined And Male-Dominated Professions</field><field name="creator">Clare, Jillian</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how women perform as leaders within male-dominated professions, including law, business, politics, the military, and the academy. In studying women's performances in terms of the corporeal and spectacular, the investigation seeks to understand how particular women enact leadership through their materiality within specific times and places. Drawing on Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's (1988) theorising of the processes of 'becoming', woman-as-leader is studied as an entity that passes from one incomplete and multiple assemblage to another, rather than as a singular 'developing' identity.    The research is located within and between the paradoxes that complicate the performances of leadership for women. One key paradox serving as a rationale for this investigation is that, while 'equity' has become a truism of contemporary leadership, it is clear from formal reports (for example, the 2002 Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency (EOWA) report), that many women continue to be marginalised and under-represented as leaders and senior managers. Moreover, those few women who have achieved success often acknowledge themselves as both legitimately and differently - and sometimes awkwardly, located as leaders in the everyday enactments of their work.    The investigation of leadership within and between such paradoxes is problematic for a neo-liberal order of thinking, and even for socially critical theory, because of the assumptions that modernist literature makes about women's struggle for political legitimacy (ie, a narrative of progress, emancipation, and/or linear cumulative historical development). It is for this reason that the conceptual tools used in this study are drawn from post-feminist and post-structuralist theory. Such theorising refuses literal categories in favour of 'ironic categories' (Rorty, 1989) where two apparently oppositional ideas are understood to be both necessary and true.    To explore women 'becoming' leaders (Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1988), 'woman-as-leader' is interrogated using Jean Fran&#231;ois Lyotard's (1984) notion of 'performativity,' Mary Russo's (1994) theorising of the embodied spectacle of 'the female grotesque', and Richard Rorty (1989) and Donna Haraway's (1991) insistence on partiality, doubt, and the importance of 'undoing' the fixity of modernist categories - in this instance, for women. One ironic category of importance to the study is Haraway's theorising of a 'cyborgian identity', a technological assemblage that is part-human/part-machine. This allows acknowledgement that women leaders inhabit realms beyond the boundaries imposed by the same/difference, human/machine, present/past, and real/virtue binaries.    Using these tools, the performances of a number of women leaders is examined in an empirical study that focuses on a few individual women located in male-defined and male dominated settings. The empirical work has two key components. First, it provides a reading of three moments in time where a female individual dys-appears (Leder, 1990) in the public gaze, erupting as a unique spectacle in spaces that are both enabling and constraining. It foregrounds the unique complexities of three public performances in which women made a spectacle of themselves, while the analysis refuses to either celebrate the individuals involved, or to bemoan the conditions under which they did so. The analysis demonstrates the value of re-thinking leadership in terms of its complexity for the female as embodied public 'performer'. It then moves on to focus specifically on the (embodied, spectacular) tactics being deployed by women leaders in contemporary professional work. This analysis is located in the professions of law, business, politics, the military, and the academy. The data-as-evidence emerging from the analysis show women leaders to be both and neither enacting and troubling 'proper' (ie, traditional and/or known) leadership conventions. The analysis provides a reading of how, through certain tactical shifts, women work to 'de-territorialise' both the 'forms of content' and 'forms of expression' (Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1988) constituting leadership performances. It makes visible the tactical assemblages these women deploy, and the ways in which such tactics separate, combine, and compound the same/difference, equality/inequality, either/or binaries. The specific tactical manoeuvres for achieving legitimacy in the public gaze cluster around four identifiable ironic categories: (i) legitimate cross-dressing (ii) assertive defence (iii) proper blasphemy, and (iv) humanly-machinic.    When taken together, the two components of the empirical study compel a re-theorising of 'woman-as-leader' as both insider and outsider, an entity engaging in the on-going work of diss-assembling and re-assembling a leaderly self. Woman is shown 'to be not one, not multiple, but multiplicities', simultaneously (Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1988). This re-theorising provides a more nuanced account of women leaders working to maintain legitimacy, credibility, and propriety as leaders than mainstream theorising of leadership and management currently allows.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Assemblages</field><field name="subject">Assembling</field><field name="subject">Re-Assembling</field><field name="subject">Becoming</field><field name="subject">Becoming-Woman Leader</field><field name="subject">Corporeality</field><field name="subject">Cyborgian Hybridity</field><field name="subject">Dys-Appearance</field><field name="subject">Female Grotesque</field><field name="subject">Identity-Formation</field><field name="subject">Ironic Category</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Performativity</field><field name="subject">Propriety and Legitimacy</field><field name="subject">Spectacle</field><field name="subject">Woman-As-Leader</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15947/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inside The Power Station : Allegory And The Dance Of Represented Ideas</field><field name="creator">Cunnington, Maree Helen</field><field name="description">This performance-as-research project incorporated a five-month residency inside a working power station, Swanbank, Ipswich, a provider of electricity to Australia's eastern states via the national grid. The concept 'power station' is compelling because it involves the transformation of material form (coal) to immaterial phenomena (electricity), a process analogous to making electronically-mediated art. Three linked interdisciplinary works were created out of the artist's immersion on site: Swanshift, a music-video eulogy to the closure of the station's oldest coal-fired facility, Swanbank 'A'; The Industrial Theatre, a photographic series featuring Swanbank workers; and unstatic, a live, video-mediated performance. As an enquiry into meaning within contemporary art practice, this research project used allegory as its symbolic mode of thought and formation. Through allegory, the Swanbank site was explored metaphorically to reveal a fictional, parallel world beyond the literal surface of danger, authority and rigour. In this space of excess, unreality and overflowing boundaries, meaning is multiple and celebrated. Hand-in-hand with an exploration of allegory, this exegesis also presents an insight into methodologies for industrial, site-specific, interdisciplinary practice, and arts-industry collaboration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Allegory</field><field name="subject">Appropriation</field><field name="subject">Fiction</field><field name="subject">Fragmentation</field><field name="subject">Industrial Site</field><field name="subject">Interdisciplinary / interdisciplinarity</field><field name="subject">Machine Aesthetic</field><field name="subject">Metaphor</field><field name="subject">Modernism</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Postmodernism</field><field name="subject">Power Station</field><field name="subject">Semiotics</field><field name="subject">Site-specificity</field><field name="subject">Structuralism</field><field name="subject">Sublime</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15948/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marijuana Australiana: Cannabis use, popular culture and the Americanisation of drugs policy in Australia, 1938-1988</field><field name="creator">Jiggens, John Lawrence</field><field name="description">The word 'marijuana' was introduced to Australia by the US Bureau of Narcotics via the Diggers newspaper, Smith's Weekly,  in 1938. Marijuana was said to be 'a new drug that maddens victims' and it was sensationally described as an 'evil sex drug'. The resulting tabloid furore saw the plant cannabis sativa banned in Australia, even though cannabis had been a well-known and widely used drug in Australia for many decades.    In 1964, a massive infestation of wild cannabis was found growing along a stretch of the Hunter River between Singleton and Maitland in New South Wales. The explosion in Australian marijuana use began there. It was fuelled after 1967 by US soldiers on rest and recreation leave from Vietnam.  It was the Baby-Boomer young who were turning on. Pot smoking was overwhelmingly associated with the generation born in the decade after the Second World War. As the conflict over the Vietnam War raged in Australia, it provoked intense generational conflict between the Baby-Boomers and older generations. Just as in the US, pot was adopted by Australian Baby-Boomers as their symbol; and, as in the US, the attack on pot users served as code for an attack on the young, the Left, and the alternative.    In 1976, the 'War on Drugs' began in earnest in Australia with paramilitary attacks on the hippie colonies at Cedar Bay in Queensland and Tuntable Falls in New South Wales. It was a time of increasing US style prohibition characterised by 'tough-on-drugs' right-wing rhetoric, police crackdowns, numerous murders, and a marijuana drought followed quickly by a heroin plague; in short by a massive worsening of 'the drug problem'. During this decade, organised crime moved into the pot scene and the price of pot skyrocketed, reaching $450 an ounce in 1988. Thanks to the Americanisation of drugs policy, the black market made 'a killing'. In Marijuana Australiana  I argue that the 'War on Drugs' developed -- not for health reasons -- but for reasons of social control; as a domestic counter-revolution against the Whitlamite, Baby-Boomer generation by older Nixonite Drug War warriors like Queensland Premier, Bjelke-Petersen. It was a misuse of drugs policy which greatly worsened drug problems, bringing with it American-style organised crime.    As the subtitle suggests, Marijuana Australiana  relies significantly on 'alternative' sources, and I trawl the waters of popular culture, looking for songs, posters, comics and underground magazines to produce an 'underground' history of cannabis in Australia. This 'pop' approach is balanced with a hard-edged, quantitative analysis of the size of the marijuana market, the movement of price, and the seizure figures in the section called 'History By Numbers'. As Alfred McCoy notes, we need to understand drugs as commodities. It is only through a detailed understanding of the drug trade that the deeper secrets of this underground world can be revealed. In this section, I present an economic history of the cannabis market and formulate three laws of the market.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narcotics</field><field name="subject">Control of&#151;Australia</field><field name="subject">Narcotics and crime&#151;Australia</field><field name="subject">Cannabis use&#151;Australia</field><field name="subject">Popular Culture&#151;Australia</field><field name="subject">Drugs policy&#151;Australia</field><field name="subject">Organised crime&#151;Queensland</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Cannabis prohibition&#151;Australia</field><field name="subject">Police corruption&#151;Queensland</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">the counter-culture&#151;Australia</field><field name="subject">Reefer Madness&#151;Australia</field><field name="subject">the War on Drugs&#151;Australia</field><field name="subject">Woodward Royal Commission (the Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking)</field><field name="subject">the Williams Royal Commission (Australian Royal Commission into Drugs)</field><field name="subject">the Fitzgerald Inquiry</field><field name="subject">the Stewart Royal Commission (Royal Commission into Nugan Hand)</field><field name="subject">Chlorodyne</field><field name="subject">Cannabis&#151; medical use</field><field name="subject">cannabis indica</field><field name="subject">cannabis sativa</field><field name="subject">Gough Whitlam</field><field name="subject">Richard Nixon</field><field name="subject">Donald Mackay</field><field name="subject">Johannes Bjelke- Petersen</field><field name="subject">Terry Lewis</field><field name="subject">Ray Whitrod</field><field name="subject">Fast Buck$</field><field name="subject">Chris Masters</field><field name="subject">John Wesley Egan</field><field name="subject">the Corset Gang</field><field name="subject">Murray Stewart Riley</field><field name="subject">Bela Csidei</field><field name="subject">Maurice Bernard 'Bernie' Houghton</field><field name="subject">Frank Nugan</field><field name="subject">Michael Jon Hand</field><field name="subject">Sir Peter Abeles</field><field name="subject">Merv Wood</field><field name="subject">Sir Robert Askin</field><field name="subject">Theodore (Ted) Shackley</field><field name="subject">Fred Krahe</field><field name="subject">James (Jimmy) Bazley</field><field name="subject">Gianfranco Tizzoni</field><field name="subject">Ken Nugan</field><field name="subject">Brian Alexander.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15949/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the crystalline lens using magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="creator">Jones, Catherine Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The eye lens grows continuously throughout life and changes its shape as the eye changes focus from a distant to a near object (the process of accommodation). These changes are complex because they may affect not only the shape of the lens, but also its refractive index distribution. To date there has been no satisfactory technique for directly and non-invasively measuring these changes. In this study the refractive index distribution through the isolated lens was measured non-invasively using a novel MRI technique.    The dependence of the refractive index value of lens tissue on its transverse relaxation rate (R2) was determined empirically from measurements on lens homogenate samples. Using a multi-spin-echo imaging sequence, data were  acquired for constructing R2 maps of a central slice through the isolated lens. These R2 maps were transformed to refractive index maps using the empirically determined dependence of refractive index on R2. Using a standard algorithm for ray tracing through gradient index media, the propagation of light rays through the index map were simulated. The optical properties of the lens, such as focal length, were then  measured. The technique was validated by also directly measuring the focal length of each lens using laser ray tracing.    The subtle changes in refractive index distribution that are responsible for the  dramatic change in the optical properties of the isolated lens with age, were observed for the first time. The decrease in surface power of the isolated lens with age accounted only partially for the decrease in total lens power with age, the remainder resulting from a reduction in the gradient of refractive index (GRIN) power. It is  likely that this reduction in GFUN power is the mechanism by which the eye maintains emmetropia (good distant vision) with age despite the increasing curvature of its surfaces. The reduction in the GRIN power of the lens was found to be mainly due to a flattening of the refractive index profile in the central region of the lens, accompanied by steepening of the profile near the edge of the lens. In agreement  with a previous MRI study of the isolated human eye lens, this study found a decrease in the refractive index of the nucleus with age. However the age related change in this study was not as large and not found to be statistically significant. The results demonstrate that existing simple models for the optics of the eye lens are  inadequate to accurately describe its properties. Several more sophisticated models  were considered in an attempt to describe better the age-dependent changes that occur in both the power of the lens and its longitudinal aberration. Mathematical modelling was also used to simulate the accommodative process and investigate possible changes in the index distribution of the lens that may occur with  accommodation. A preliminary in vivo study was performed aimed at observing the change in the refractive index distribution of the eye lens with age and accommodation. These results demonstrated the feasibility of the technique for in vivo applications and showed that within experimental error there is little change in the central refractive index of the lens with age. However the resolution achievable with standard clinical  imaging sequences and signal detection hardware was not optimal for in vivo refractive index mapping of changes in the human eye lens with accommodation. Finally therefore, methods for refining the technique for in vivo applications are discussed which may make it possible to directly and simultaneously measure both  the shape and refractive index distribution of the lens with age and accommodation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eye lens</field><field name="subject">crystalline lens</field><field name="subject">crystallins</field><field name="subject">lens paradox</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">protein concentration</field><field name="subject">gradient index</field><field name="subject">refractive index map</field><field name="subject">T1</field><field name="subject">T2</field><field name="subject">relaxation</field><field name="subject">multi-echo imaging.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15950/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Inhibition Of Copper Corrosion In Aqueous Environments With Heterocyclic Compounds</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Ngoc Huu</field><field name="description">Benzotriazole (BTAH) has been used as a corrosion inhibitor for copper and copper-, based alloys for more than 40 years. It has been successfully employed for the, prevention of both atmospheric corrosion and particularly for the protection of, copper under immersed conditions. Whilst BTAH is an excellent inhibitor in alkaline, solution its efficiency drops off markedly as the pH decreases. It was hypothesized, that a possible way to increase surface adsorption and subsequent better inhibition, over a wide pH range might be through the preparation of derivatives, particularly, carboxybenzotriazoles and alkyl esters of these compounds.    In this work the following techniques: weight loss measurements, potentiodynamic, polarisation, SERS spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and, coulometry were employed to investigate the inhibition efficiency of 4- and 5-, carboxybenzotriazole and their alkyl ester for copper corrosion. Molecular modelling, was also investigated as a tool for inhibitor design.    Studies on 4- and 5- carboxybenzotriazole (CBT) showed that the inhibition, efficiency for copper corrosion in aerated acidic sulphate solution of each isomer was, pH, concentration and time dependant. At lower pH the 5-isomer is the better, inhibitor and this behaviour continues at higher pH. The anti-tarnishing test showed, that whilst both isomers exhibited these properties, 5-CBT was once again the, superior inhibitor.    It was found that a commercial mixture of the octyl esters of 4- and 5-, carboxybenzotriazole inhibits copper corrosion in sulphate environments open to air., The inhibition efficiency of the ester mixture at the lx10-4 M level (pH - 0) is 98%, which compares very favourably with that for BTAH (- 50%). With respect to other, alkyl esters of 4- and 5-carboxybezotriazole, hexyl, butyl and methyl, it was found, that all of these inlibited copper corrosion in sulphate environments open to air. In, each case the inhibition efficiency is concentration, pH and time dependent. Both, coupon tests and EIS measurements indicate that inhibition efficiency depends on the, length of the alkyl chain. At pH - 0 the inhibition efficiency decreased in the order, octyl &amp;gthexyl &amp;gtbutyl &amp;gtmethyl. At higher pH (- 8) the order is reversed. At the 1x104, M level (pH - 0) the inhibition efficiency of each of the alkyl esters is equal to or, better than that for BTAH. At higher pH (- 8) the inhibition efficiency in each case is, reduced in comparison to BTAH. but is still good enough for practical use ( 2 75%)., The inhibitive behaviour of the alkyl esters at low pH can be attributed to, chemisorption through an azole nitrogen of the protonated alkyl esters. The, hydrocarbon chain is also physically adsorbed and the increase in physical adsorption, as the chain is lengthened accounts for the improved inhibition efficiency.    Dry films formed by immersing copper in solutions of alkyl esters of, carboxybenzotriazole also inhibit copper corrosion in both strongly acidic (pH - 0), and near neutral (pH - S) sulphate corrodents. The inhibition efficiency depends on, the solvents used to dissolve the esters, solution temperature and immersion time., Aqueous coating solutions furnish the most protective films. Films formed by, CBTAH-BU, CBTAH-HE and CBTAH-OE are more protective than that formed by, BTAH. The inhibition efficiency of the alkyl ester film increases as the alkyl chain is, made longer.    Molecular modeling showed that the optimum crude binding energy (Eblnd), between each protonated ester molecule and the surface varied linearly with the alkyl, chain length. The resulting linear correlation between IE% and E bind for compounds, that are structurally similar suggested that the crude binding energy of a single, molecule with copper may be used to predict the inhibition performance of other, compounds constituting a series.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corrosion</field><field name="subject">Inhibition</field><field name="subject">Inhibitor</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">Alkyl esters of carboxybenzotriazole</field><field name="subject">Polarisation</field><field name="subject">Weight-loss</field><field name="subject">SERS</field><field name="subject">EIS</field><field name="subject">Molecular modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15951/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite Element Modelling Of Anular Lesions in the Lumbar Intervertebral Disc</field><field name="creator">Little, Judith Paige</field><field name="description">Low back pain is an ailment that affects a significant portion of the community. However, due to the complexity of the spine, which is a series of interconnected joints, and the loading conditions applied to these joints the causes for back pain are not well understood. Investigations of damage or failure of the spinal structures from a mechanical viewpoint may be viewed as a way of providing valuable information for the causes of back pain. Low back pain is commonly associated with injury to, or degeneration of, the intervertebral discs and involves the presence of tears or lesions in the anular disc material. The aim of the study presented in this thesis was to investigate the biomechanical effect of anular lesions on disc function using a finite element model of the L4/5 lumbar intervertebral disc.
 
 
 
 The intervertebral disc consists of three main components - the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus and the cartilaginous endplates. The anulus fibrosus is comprised of collagen fibres embedded in a ground substance while the nucleus is a gelatinous material. The components of the intervertebral disc were represented in the model together with the longitudinal ligaments that are attached to the anterior and posterior surface of the disc. All other bony and ligamentous structures were simulated through the loading and boundary conditions.
 
 
 
 A high level of both geometric and material accuracy was required to produce a physically realistic finite element model. The geometry of the model was derived from images of cadaveric human discs and published data on the in vivo configuration of the L4/5 disc. Material properties for the components were extracted from the existing literature. The anulus ground substance was represented as a Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic material, the nucleus pulposus was modelled as a hydrostatic fluid in the healthy disc models and the cartilaginous endplates, collagen fibres and longitudinal ligaments were represented as linear elastic materials. A preliminary model was developed to assess the accuracy of the geometry and material properties of the disc components. It was found that the material parameters defined for the anulus ground substance did not accurately describe the nonlinear shear behaviour of the tissue. Accurate representation this nonlinear behaviour was thought to be important in ensuring the deformations observed in the anulus fibrosus of the finite element model were correct.
 
 
 
 There was no information found in the literature on the mechanical properties of the anulus ground substance. Experimentation was, therefore, carried out on specimens of sheep anulus fibrosus in order to quantify the mechanical response of the ground substance. Two testing protocols were employed. The first series of tests were undertaken to provide information on the strain required to initiate permanent damage in the ground substance. The second series of tests resulted in the acquisition of data on the mechanical response of the tissue to repeated loading. The results of the experimentation carried out to determine the strain necessary to initiate permanent damage suggested that during daily loading some derangement might be caused in the anulus ground substance. The results for the mechanical response of the tissue were used to determine hyperelastic constants which were incorporated in the finite element model. A second order Polynomial and a third order Ogden strain energy equation were used to define the anulus ground substance. Both these strain energy equations incorporated the nonlinear mechanical response of the tissue during shear loading conditions.
 
 
 
 Using these geometric data and material properties a finite element model of a representative L4/5 intervertebral disc was developed.
 
 
 
 When the measured material parameters for the anulus ground substance were implemented in the finite element model, large deformations were observed in the anulus fibrosus and excessive nucleus pressures were found. This suggested that the material parameters defining the anulus ground substance were overly compliant and in turn, implied the possibility that the stiffness of the sheep anulus ground substance was lower than the stiffness of the human tissue. Even so, the mechanical properties of the sheep joints had been shown to be similar to those of the human joint and it was concluded that the results of analyses using these parameters would provide valuable qualitative information on the disc mechanics.
 
 
 
 To represent the degeneration of the anulus fibrosus, the models included simulations of anular lesions - rim, radial and circumferential lesions. Degeneration of the nucleus may be characterised by a significant reduction in the hydrostatic nucleus pressure and a loss of hydration. This was simulated by removal of the hydrostatic nucleus pressure.
 
 
 
 Analyses were carried out using rotational loading conditions that were comparable to the ranges of motion observed physiologically. The results of these analyses showed that the removal of the hydrostatic nucleus pressure from an otherwise healthy disc resulted in a significant reduction in the stiffness of the disc. This indicated that when the nucleus pulposus is extremely degenerate, it offers no resistance to the deformation of the anulus and the mechanics of the disc are significantly changed. Specifically, the resistance to rotation offered by the intervertebral disc is reduced, which may affect the stability of the joint. When anular lesions were simulated in the finite element model they caused minimal changes in the peak moments resisted by the disc under rotational loading. This suggested that the removal of the nucleus pressure had a greater effect on the mechanics of the disc than the simulation of anular lesions.
 
 
 
 The results of the finite element model reproduced trends observed in both the healthy and degenerate intervertebral disc in terms of variations in nucleus pressure with loading conditions, axial displacement of the superior surface and bulge of the peripheral anulus. It was hypothesised that the reduced rotational stiffness of the degenerate disc may result in overload of the surrounding innervated osseoligamentous anatomy which may in turn cause back pain. Similarly back pain may result from the abnormal deformation of the innervated peripheral anulus in the vicinity of anular lesions. Furthermore, it was hypothesised that biochemical changes may result in the degeneration of the nucleus, which in turn may cause excessive strains in the anulus ground substance and lead to the initiation of permanent damage in the form of anular lesions. With further refinement of the components of the model and the methods used to define the anular lesions it was considered that this model would provide a powerful analysis tool for the investigation of the mechanics of intervertebral discs with and without significant degeneration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spine</field><field name="subject">Intervertebral Disc</field><field name="subject">Degeneration</field><field name="subject">Anular Lesions</field><field name="subject">Finite Element Analysis</field><field name="subject">Hyperelastic Material Model</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15952/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibrational spectroscopy of keratin fibres : A forensic approach</field><field name="creator">Panayiotou, Helen</field><field name="description">Human hair profiling is an integral part of a forensic investigation but it is one of the most technically difficult subjects in forensic science.  This thesis describes the research and development of a novel approach for the rapid identification of unknown human and other related keratin fibres found at a crime scene.  The work presented here is developed systematically and considers sample collection, sample preparation, analysis and interpretation of spectral data for the profiling of hair fibres encountered in criminal cases.  Spectral comparison of fibres was facilitated with the use of chemometrics methods such as PCA, SIMCA and Fuzzy Clustering, and the less common approach of multi-criteria decision making methodology (MCDM).    The aim of the thesis was to investigate the potential of some vibrational spectroscopy techniques for matching and discrimination of single keratin hair fibres in the context of forensic evidence.  The first objective (chapter 3) of the thesis was to evaluate the use of Raman and FT-IR micro-spectroscopy techniques for the forensic sampling of hair fibres and to propose the preferred technique for future forensic hair comparisons.  The selection of the preferred technique was based on criteria such as spectral quality, ease of use, rapid analysis and universal application to different hair samples.  FT-IR micro-spectroscopy was found to be the most appropriate technique for hair analysis because it enabled the rapid collection of spectra from a wide variety of hair fibres.  Raman micro-spectroscopy, on the other hand, was hindered with fluorescence problems and did not allow the collection of spectra from pigmented fibres.  This objective has therefore shown that FT-IR micro-spectroscopy is the preferable spectroscopic technique for forensic analysis of hair fibres, whilst Raman spectroscopy is the least preferred.    The second objective (chapter 3) was to investigate, through a series of experiments, the effect of chemical treatment on the micro-environment of human hair fibres.  The effect of bleaching agents on the hair fibres was studied with some detail at different treatment times and the results indicate a significant change in the chemical environment of the secondary structure of the hair fibre along with changes in the C-C backbone structure.  One of the most important outcomes of this research was the behaviour of the f&#209;-helix during chemical treatment.  The hydrogen bonding in the f&#209;-helix provides for the stable structure of the fibre and therefore any disruption to the f&#209;-helix will inevitably damage the molecular structure of the fibre.  The results highlighted the behaviour of the f&#209;-helix, which undergoes a significant decrease in content during oxidation, and is partly converted to a random-coil structure, whilst the f&#210;-sheet component of the secondary structure remains unaffected.  The reported investigations show that the combination of FT-IR and Raman micro-spectroscopy can provide an insight and understanding into the complex chemical properties and reactions within a treated hair fibre.  Importantly, this work demonstrates that with the aid of chemometrics, it is possible to investigate simultaneously FT-IR and Raman micro-spectroscopic information from oxidised hair fibres collected from one subject and treated at different times.  The discrimination and matching of hair fibres on the basis of treatment has potential forensic applications. The third objective (chapter 4) attempted to expand the forensic application of FT-IR micro-spectroscopy to other keratin fibres.  Animal fibres are commonly encountered in crime scenes and it thus becomes important to establish the origin of those fibres.  The aim of this work was to establish the forensic applications of FT-IR micro-spectroscopy to animal fibres and to investigate any fundamental molecular differences between these fibres.  The results established a discrimination between fibres consisting predominantly of f&#209;-helix and those containing mainly a f&#210;-sheet structure.  More importantly, it was demonstrated through curve-fitting and chemometrics, that each keratin fibre contains a characteristic secondary structure arrangement.  The work presented here is the first detailed FT-IR micro-spectroscopic study, utilising chemometrics as well as MCDM methods, for a wide range of keratin fibres, which are commonly, found as forensic evidence.  Furthermore, it was demonstrated with the aid of the rank ordering MCDM methods PROMETHEE and GAIA, that it is possible to rank and discriminate keratin fibres according to their molecular characteristics obtained from direct measurements together with information sourced from the literature.    The final objective (chapter 5) of the thesis was to propose an alternative method for the discrimination and matching of single scalp human hair fibres through the use of FT-IR micro-spectroscopy and chemometrics.  The work successfully demonstrated, through a number of case scenarios, the application of the technique for the identification of variables such as gender and race for an unknown single hair fibre.  In addition, it was also illustrated that known hair fibres (from the suspect or victim) can be readily matched to the unknown hair fibres found at the crime scene.  This is the first time that a substantial, systematic FT-IR study of forensic hair identification has been presented.  The research has shown that it is possible to model and correlate individual&#161;&#166;s characteristics with hair properties at molecular level with the use of chemometrics methods.  A number of different, important forensic variables of immediate use to police in a crime scene investigation such as gender, race, treatment, black and white hair fibres were investigated.  Blind samples were successfully applied both to validate available experimental data and extend the current database of experimental determinations.  Protocols were posed for the application of this methodology in the future.  The proposed FT-IR methodology presented in this thesis has provided an alternative approach to the characterisation of single scalp human hair fibres.  The technique enables the rapid collection of spectra, followed by the objective analytical capabilities of chemometrics to successfully discriminate animal fibres, human hair fibres from different sources, treated from untreated hair fibres, as well as black and white hair fibres, on the basis of their molecular structure.  The results can be readily produced and explained in the courts of law.  Although the proposed relatively fast FT-IR technique is not aimed at displacing the two slower existing methods of hair analysis, namely comparative optical microscopy and DNA analysis, it has given a new dimension to the characterisation of hair fibres at a molecular level, providing a powerful tool for forensic investigations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vibrational spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">keratin fibres</field><field name="subject">forensic evidence</field><field name="subject">PCA</field><field name="subject">SIMCA</field><field name="subject">fuzzy clustering</field><field name="subject">multi-criteria decision making methodology (MCDM)</field><field name="subject">FT-IR micro-spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Raman spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">forensic hair identification</field><field name="subject">chemometrics</field><field name="subject">DNA analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15953/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating patients' energy requirements: Cancer as a case study.</field><field name="creator">Reeves, Marina Michelle</field><field name="description">The nutritional care and management of patients includes provision of adequate nutrition support to ensure that they attain and maintain a desirable body weight, improve nutritional status and avoid negative outcomes associated with over- or underfeeding. The success of nutrition support relies on accurately estimating energy requirements so that adequate energy and nutrients can be provided to the patient. Energy requirements are most accurately determined by measurement of energy expenditure. Most methods for doing so however are expensive, time-consuming, require trained technicians to perform them and are therefore impractical in the clinical setting. As such, prediction equations, which are easy to use, inexpensive and universally available, are commonly used to estimate the energy requirements of hospitalised patients. The accuracy of these equations however is questionable. Recently, a new portable hand-held indirect calorimeter (MedGem(tm), HealtheTech, USA), which has been promoted for its ease of use and relatively short measurement time, has been validated in healthy subjects but is yet to be validated in patients with illnesses.    Weight loss and malnutrition occur commonly in patients with cancer and are often thought to be associated with disturbances in energy metabolism caused by the tumour. Minimising weight loss is an important goal for the nutritional care of patients with cancer. The ability to accurately determine the energy requirements of these patients is therefore essential for the provision of optimal nutrition support.    This research project proceeded in two phases. Phase 1 aimed to determine current methods used by dietitians for estimating adult patients' energy requirements using a descriptive study. Results of this study informed phase 2, which aimed to investigate differences in energy expenditure of cancer patients compared to healthy control subjects and to compare different methods for determining energy requirements of people with cancer in the clinical setting. To address phase 1 a national cross-sectional survey of dietitians working in acute care adult hospitals was undertaken to determine their usual dietetic practice with respect to estimating patients' energy requirements. Responses to the survey (n=307, 66.2%) indicated a large variation in dietitians' practice for estimating energy requirements particularly with respect to the application of methods involving injury factors. When applied to a case study, these inconsistencies resulted in an extremely wide range for the calculated energy requirement, suggesting that there is error inherent in the use of prediction methods, which may be associated with negative consequences associated with under- or overfeeding. The types of patients for whom dietitians estimate energy requirements appears to be heavily influenced by feeding method. Initial dietetic education was identified as the main influencing factor in the choice of method for estimation of energy requirements.    Phase 2 was addressed using four studies based on the same study population - a case-control study, two clinical validation studies and a measurement methods study. Patients had histologically proven solid tumours, excluding tumours of the breast, prostate and brain, and were undergoing anti-cancer therapy (n=18). Healthy control subjects were group matched to cancer patients by gender, age, height and weight from a purposive sample (n=17). Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured by respiratory gas exchange using a traditional indirect calorimeter (VMax 229) and the MedGem indirect calorimeter. A measurement methods side-study established that steady state defined as a three-minute period compared to a five-minute period measured REE within clinically acceptable limits. REE was also predicted from a range of prediction equations.    Analyses of available data found that REE in cancer patients was not significantly different from healthy subjects, with only a 10% higher REE observed in this sample of cancer patients when adjusted for fat free mass. For both cancer patients and healthy subjects the portable MedGem indirect calorimeter and all prediction equations did not measure or estimate individual REE within clinically acceptable limits compared to the VMax 229 (limits of agreement of approximately -40% to 30% for both the MedGem and prediction equations). Collectively, the results of this research project have indicated that current practical methods for determining patients' energy requirements in a clinical setting do not accurately predict the resting energy expenditure of individual subjects, healthy or with cancer. Greater emphasis should therefore be placed on ensuring intake meets requirements. For this to occur, dietetic practice should be focused on directly monitoring both patients' actual energy intake and patient outcomes, such as weight, body composition and nutritional status, to determine whether energy requirements are being met. This research has led to multiple recommendations for dietetic practice, focusing on the standardisation of education practices. Recommendations for future research address methodological improvements.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">clinical nutrition</field><field name="subject">energy expenditure</field><field name="subject">energy requirements</field><field name="subject">dietetic practice</field><field name="subject">indirect calorimetry</field><field name="subject">metabolic rate</field><field name="subject">resting energy expenditure</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15954/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationships between school reforms and teacher professionalism in government primary schools in Karachi, Pakistan.</field><field name="creator">Rizvi, Meher</field><field name="description">The government primary education system in Karachi, Pakistan, is faced with many problems and dilemmas and each dilemma justifies a reason, but perhaps no problem is as grave as the dejected professional status of the government primary school teachers in Karachi. Schools are only as good as their teachers, regardless of how high their standards, how up-to-date their technology, or how innovative their programs. With a large numbers of under-educated, under-trained, under-paid and, most importantly of all, undervalued government primary school teachers in Karachi, Pakistan (Hoodbhoy, 1998; Shaikh, 1997), only a low percentage of teachers can be effective. Whether the children in Pakistan will be the enlightened and the informed citizens of tomorrow or ignorant members of society will depend on teacher knowledge, teacher education and above all teacher professionalism. If teachers do matter the most, then a series of questions result. What is being done for this section of the society that matters so much? Are efforts being taken to find out what teachers in the government primary schools need to achieve their professional goals? Are these teachers given adequate opportunities to learn, to improve and to become effective teachers? How can these teachers meet the ever increasing demands placed upon them? How will these teachers successfully lead the students into the twenty-first century? Do the primary government school teachers believe that they can successfully lead children into the twenty-first century? Are school reforms geared towards enhancing teachers' professionalism? This research that focuses on the relationships between school reforms and teacher professionalism in government primary schools in Karachi, Pakistan, addresses such questions. In this thesis, I outline some of the measures that have been taken at the government, at the non-government and at the school sector level to restructure and reform primary government schools in Pakistan. A mixed methods research approach was undertaken to investigate the relationships between these reforms and teacher professionalism. Quantitative data were collected by means of questionnaire surveys and qualitative data were collected in the selected four case sites by means of interviews and field notes. In this research it was important to investigate teacher efficacy, teacher practice, teacher leadership and collaborative efforts as the different dimensions of professionalism and the relationships between these and the school reforms for enhanced teacher professionalism. Research was required which addressed the question of "What it actually means to be a professional teacher in government primary schools in Karachi, Pakistan, and how school reforms can actually develop teacher learning for improved teacher professionalism?"   	Contrary to the detached and noncommittal attitude with which the government primary school teachers are characterized in many contexts, the teachers in this study have indicated that they are confident and capable; they can articulate and communicate ideas; they can make decisions and undertake responsibilities; they understand that it is important to collaborate and learn from one another; and they are willing to undertake leadership roles if they have the opportunities. This has strong implications for policy makers to provide teachers with the opportunities to become active and reflective professionals. It is important to regard teachers as change agents capable of generating knowledge and of making change happen, rather than as passive recipients and users of knowledge.   	The data provided by the teachers have indicated that it is possible to enhance teacher professionalism within the existing government primary school structures. While the different teachers were at different levels or stages of professionalism, it was quite clear that they had all advanced in terms of their professionalism as a consequence of reform initiatives. These changes in the teachers' levels of professionalism defined the relationships between the school reforms and teacher professionalism. In other words, the school reforms have been able to develop teacher professionalism and take it to a higher level than where it was when the reforms were initiated in the schools. Based on the analysis of the findings, this research theorizes that teacher professionalism is developed when teachers are provided with both the professional knowledge and skills to improve their capabilities, and opportunities to translate professional knowledge and skills into classroom and school activities to make the most of their capabilities. The research proposes that the strength of these relationships between school reforms and teacher professionalism depends on the dynamism with which the reform managers take teachers through the stage of involving them in developmental process, the stage of initiating professional development programmes and the stage of developing schools into collaborative cultures and establishing networks with the help of enlightened principals and hybrid support structures. Based on this proposition a number of principles have been identified for sustaining and further developing teacher professionalism. 		The study acknowledges that the process of developing teacher professionalism is complex and that it will be the blend of different elements in the schools, the particular school context and political will that will decide how professionalism can best be fostered in the government primary schools. However, since the principles derived from this research are based on grounded research findings and are also supported by literature and other relevant research in the area of teacher development, they may be applicable to other primary schools where similar reforms are being implemented in Pakistan and other developing countries seeking to address similar problems. Policy makers and large private organizations may benefit from the principles of developing and fostering teacher professionalism.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Karachi Pakistan</field><field name="subject">government primary education system</field><field name="subject">school reforms</field><field name="subject">teacher professionalism.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15955/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceived performance risk and its influence on Abandoned Cart Syndrome (ACS) - An exploratory study</field><field name="creator">Moore, Simon Scott</field><field name="description">Despite predictions of Internet shopping reaching 6.9 trillion dollars by the end of 2004, research is now suggesting many online consumers are still very reluctant to complete the online shopping process. A number of authors have attributed consumers' reluctance to purchase online to apparent barriers, however, such barriers have not been fully examined within a theoretical context. While most studies of consumers' decision to shop on the Internet have focussed on key shopping determinants, this thesis builds a conceptual model grounded in consumer behaviour theory. In particular, this thesis explores the application of the perceived risk theoretical framework, specifically looking at one dimension of perceived risk theory - performance risk and the influence it has on the phenomenon of Internet Abandoned Cart Syndrome (ACS). To explore this phenomenon, a number of extrinsic cues are identified as playing a major role in the performance evaluation process of online purchases. The combination of these elements enabled the researcher to develop a conceptual model from which a series of propositions were drawn. To acquire pertinent data and investigate each proposition, this study used a combination of indirect and direct techniques, namely projective techniques in the form of a third-person vignette, a structured tick-box questionnaire and finally semi-structured interviews.    The results suggest that collectively the extrinsic cues of brand, reputation, design and price have an overall impact on the performance evaluation process just prior to an online purchase. Varying these cues either positively or negatively had a strong impact on performance evaluation.  The conclusion of this study suggests consumers are often unable to measure the full extent of risk-taking directly. In the majority of cases, consumers are guided by numerous factors, some intrinsic, others extrinsic. E-tailers with an established reputation, a well designed web site with known brands and a balanced pricing strategy reduce the perceived performance risks associated with purchasing online, thus reducing the occurrence of ACS.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet shopping</field><field name="subject">abandoned cart syndrome</field><field name="subject">performance risk</field><field name="subject">extrinsic cues</field><field name="subject">purchase behaviour</field><field name="subject">performance evaluation</field><field name="subject">projective techniques</field><field name="subject">vignettes</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">exploratory.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15956/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chlamydia pneumoniae: detection and geotyping of infections in atherosclerotic carotid arteries</field><field name="creator">Cochrane, Melanie</field><field name="description">A large number of studies have reported on the association between the obligate intracellular bacterium, Chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerosis.  These studies suggest that C. pneumoniae may potentially play a role in the atherosclerotic process, as not all the current atherosclerotic risk factors account for the resulting complications, such as angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke.  The research presented in this thesis analysed whether there are any reliable markers of chronic C. pneumoniae vascular infection, including chlamydial sero-prevalence as defined by two commercial serological tests, detection of C. pneumoniae DNA in the peripheral circulation, the presence or absence of risk factors and symptomatic status.  The presence of the bacterium in atherosclerotic carotid specimens was diagnosed directly using a C. pneumoniae-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a genus-specific immunofluorescent (IF) assay. Eighteen of the 54 (33%) carotid artery diseased (CAD) specimens were positive for the presence of C. pneumoniae DNA by PCR detection, whereas the IF assay detected only six positive samples.    PCR analysis found that only two of 43 (5%) patients had C. pneumoniae DNA present within their peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction.   Chlamydial antibodies were detected by Focus microimmunofluorescence and/or Medac recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbert assay (rELISA) in 56% (24/43) of CAD patients tested.   Traditional risk factors, symptomatic status, antigen detection and PCR-based detection of C. pneumoniae in PBMCs, all failed to correlate with the presence of a chlamydial vascular infection.  In conclusion, the existing non-invasive diagnostic tests (serology and peripheral blood-based PCR detection) are inefficient for diagnosing a vascular Chlamydia infection, suggesting that a different chlamydial antigen should be tested targeted to identify a chronic C. pneumoniae infection in CAD patients.  
 
 
 
 Given the observation that numerous previously published studies have detected C. pneumoniae in atherosclerotic arterial tissue, yet at widely different detection rates (0% to 100%), it was clear that the location and quantity of clinical specimen could directly affect the detection rate.  Previous reports have not used a standard and validated procedure for sampling arterial specimens for C. pneumoniae DNA.  The inconsistent detection rates of chlamydial DNA in atherosclerotic plaque are a result of low concentration and irregular distribution of the bacterium, as reported in this study.  Our research concluded that a minimum of 15 (30&#236;m-thick) sections should be analysed by PCR to minimize these sampling variables and obtain a 95% chance of detecting all true C. pneumoniae-positive samples.  All previous studies may have under estimated the prevalence of C. pneumoniae, as stringent sampling and repeat testing of the bacterium is required to minimise false-negative results.  An interesting finding was that C. pneumoniae DNA was present in all 10 atherosclerotic arteries, although extensive sampling of the carotid was crucial for detection.  
 
 
 
 The third area of research examined the question of possible strain differences between C. pneumoniae isolates infecting human atherosclerotic carotid arteries. Whole genome sequencing as well as specific gene typing suggests that there is relatively little genetic variation in human isolates of C. pneumoniae.  To date, there has been little genomic analysis of strains from human cardiovascular sites.  We analysed the genotypes of C. pneumoniae present in human atherosclerotic carotid plaque and found several polymorphisms in the variable domain-4 (VD4) region of the outer membrane protein-A (ompA) gene and the intergenic region between the ygeD and uridine kinase (ygeD-urk) genes.  Our research identified four different genotypes of C. pneumoniae in human atherosclerotic carotid arteries, including an isolate that appears genetically identical to a strain previously detected in koalas.  Two genotypes of C. pneumoniae were present in both human carotid specimens and koala PBMC fractions, suggesting that these genotypes of C. pneumoniae may be capable of crossing the host barrier.  The study showed that diversity exists in both the ompAVD4 gene and the ygeD-urk intergenic region enabling fine-detailed differentiation between five different genotypes found in respiratory and/or vascular C. pneumoniae isolates.  The importance of the diversity of C. pneumoniae isolates in its role in atherogenesis needs to be further studied.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular Diseases</field><field name="subject">Chlamydia pneumoniae</field><field name="subject">Chlamydophila pneumoniae</field><field name="subject">carotid plaque.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15957/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instrument myopia and myopia progression in Hong Kong microscopists</field><field name="creator">Ting, Wai Ki</field><field name="description">People who work in occupations that involve intensive near work are thought to have a higher chance of developing myopia than other people. For example, microscopists in the United Kingdom have a higher prevalence of myopia than that of the general community. The prevalence of myopia in Hong Kong is extremely high (71 %) and Hong Kong Chinese people are particularly susceptible to myopia development and progression due to environmental factors. It is possible that this environmental susceptibility may lead to Hong Kong Chinese microscopists developing even  greater levels of myopia. We found that the prevalence of myopia in Hong Kong microscopists (n=47, mean age=31 years) was higher than that of United Kingdom microscopists (87 % c.f. 71 %) and similar aged people within the general Hong  Kong population (87 % c.f. 71 %; &#8722;4.45 D c.f. -3.00 D). However, while in most microscopists (83 % of 36 microscopists followed for a two-year period) the amount of myopia and vitreous chamber depth increased over a two year monitoring period (&#8722;0.11 D, 0.06 mm), the increase was not clinically significant. We hypothesised that the slower myopia progression rate in Hong Kong microscopists may be the result of their older average age (Hong Kong microscopists: 31.7 years c.f. United Kingdom  microscopists: 29.7 years).    When a person looks into a microscope, excessive accommodation occurs even though the microscope is designed to render the magnified image at optical infinity (zero accommodation and vergence demand). This over accommodation is called instrument myopia. It is possible that this over accommodation is linked to the myopia development and progression that occurs in users of these instruments. We found that instrument myopia remained consistent with different viewing conditions and microscope settings (inexperienced microscopists, n=20, mean age: 24.1 years, mean spherical refractive error: &#8722;2.83 D). The magnitude of instrument myopia was  not correlated with either the age or refractive error of the microscope user, while it was lower in those users with greater experience (inexperienced microscopists: 1.03  D c.f. experienced microscopists: 0.43 D). As the Hong Kong microscopists (n=10, mean age: 31.2 years, mean spherical refractive error: &#8722;3.39 D) who partook in this study were experienced (6.3 years spent working in this field), this may have contributed to the lower myopia progression that was observed.    Studies to determine the main contribution to the phenomena of instrument myopia were also conducted. Instrument myopia was not correlated with convergence when looking into microscope (r= &#8722;0.224, p=0.342), near phoria (r=0.351, p=0.129), AC/A ratio (r= &#8722;0.135, p=0.571), the convergence induced by the excessive accommodative response (r= &#8722;0.028, p=0.906), lag of accommodation (r=0.065, p=0.785) and tonic accommodation (r=0.142, p=0.551). We suggest that the main contribution to instrument myopia during microscopy is proximal accommodation  due to the awareness of the closeness, caused by the height of the microscope (i.e. the distance between the viewer and the table where the microscope is placed), during microscopy. For example, we found that the magnitude of instrument myopia increased significantly (from 0.64 D to 1.16 D) when the height of the microscope decreased from 50 cm to 35 cm.    In conclusion we have added, through direct observation, to the understanding of the  characteristics of instrument myopia. Guidelines for new microscopists aimed at minimising the amount of instrument myopia that is experienced have been developed. This information might help to reduce the amount of myopia progression  in commencing microscopists.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">myopia</field><field name="subject">nearwork</field><field name="subject">early adult-onset myopia</field><field name="subject">occupational myopia</field><field name="subject">prevalence of myopia</field><field name="subject">myopia development</field><field name="subject">myopia progression</field><field name="subject">microscopy</field><field name="subject">instrument myopia</field><field name="subject">tonic accomodation</field><field name="subject">proximal accomodation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15958/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation in wild stocks of the freshwater prawn Macrobrachium australiense (Holthuis, 1950): Environmental influence on external morphology.</field><field name="creator">Dimmock, Amanda</field><field name="description">Macrobrachium australiense is a common freshwater prawn found throughout most of eastern and inland Australia.  Debate has been ongoing on the systematics of this species due to high morphological variation: past studies have relied on external morphology assessments to describe genetic relationships between populations.  An individual's morphological phenotype results however, from an interplay of genetic factors, environmental, and interactions between genes and the environment.  The current study examined the strength of genetic constraint on morphological traits in this species.    Examination of over 1000 M. australiense museum specimens collected from across the species' extensive natural range, documented high phenotypic variation with no regional pattern of variation.  Within regions, 88% of variation in morphological traits in mature males and juveniles was present between local rivers.  Therefore, morphological variation is not structured at the regional level. If there is a strong genetic base to morphological variation then populations in a single river system must be evolving essentially in isolation.  More intensive sampling within a single river system demonstrated high morphological variation in 600 M. australiense individuals from 18 populations within a geographically connected system.  Populations separated by as little as 1km showed significant morphological differences in 50% of mature male traits.  If morphological variation is primarily genetically based, then populations within a river system were evolving independently at a very fine spatial scale.  This hypothesis was tested by breeding morphologically divergent populations of M. australiense in a controlled environment to isolate genetic influences on morphological variation.     Low heritability for morphological traits in five divergent populations raised under identical environments established that there is no strict genetic control on morphological variation in these M. australiense populations.  Morphologically homogenous offspring resulted from wild parents that had exhibited significant differences at 73% of traits examined.  Therefore, the fundamental assumption that morphological variation in M. australiense is dictated by strict genetic control is not supported in these representative populations.    Moreover, significant variation in 41% of morphological traits was produced by raising a single population at different environmental temperatures (28oC and 22 oC).  A single homogenous stock of M. australiense should not produce morphologically divergent offspring if genetic factors are the major influence of phenotypic expression.  Crossing of pure line divergent stocks resulted in hybrid offspring with significant differences in 50% of female morphological traits, whereas male offspring varied for only 31% of morphological traits.  This result suggests that female morphological expression is affected more strongly by genetic factors than male offspring in this trial.    The growth and maturation of external morphological traits during development in M. australiense is under limited genetic constraint, especially in the later phases of growth.  Only 17% of traits varied between juvenile stocks in the last three months of development when individuals were exposed to identical environmental conditions.  Maturation size was homogenous, except for females in the absence of maturing males in divergent stocks exposed to identical environmental conditions.  Females were much larger in size and shape of morphological traits in the absence of mature males in the population.   Thus environmental factors strongly influence phenotypic expression of external morphology in M. australiense.  Past problems with the taxonomy of this species are therefore understandable as many important traits used in systematics appear to be under limited genetic control.  Past evolutionary studies based on morphological diversity in this species therefore may be unreliable as the traits used to identify divergent forms may not provide a true reflection of genetic divergence.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Macrobrachium australiense</field><field name="subject">environmental effects</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">phenotype</field><field name="subject">hybridisation</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">region</field><field name="subject">river</field><field name="subject">within river</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">social hierarchy</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">juvenile</field><field name="subject">sexual maturity classes</field><field name="subject">field studies</field><field name="subject">laboratory trials</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">multivariate statistics.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15959/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A heterogenous three-dimensional computational model for wood drying</field><field name="creator">Truscott, Simon</field><field name="description">The objective of this PhD research program is to develop an accurate and efficient heterogeneous three-dimensional computational model for simulating the drying of wood at temperatures below the boiling point of water. The complex  macroscopic drying equations comprise a coupled and highly nonlinear system of physical laws for liquid and energy conservation. Due to the heterogeneous nature of wood, the physical model parameters strongly depend upon the local pore structure, wood density variation within growth rings and variations in primary and secondary system variables. In order to provide a realistic representation of this behaviour, a set of previously determined parameters derived using sophisticated image analysis methods and homogenisation techniques is embedded within the model. From the literature it is noted that current three-dimensional computational models for wood drying do not take into consideration the heterogeneities of the medium. A significant advance made by the research conducted in this thesis is the development of a three - dimensional computational model that takes into account the heterogeneous board material properties which vary within the transverse plane with respect to the pith position that defines the radial and tangential directions. The  development of an accurate and efficient computational model requires the consideration of a number of significant numerical issues, including the virtual board description, an effective mesh design based on triangular prismatic elements, the control volume finite element discretisation process for the cou-  pled conservation laws, the derivation of an accurate dux expression based on gradient approximations together with flux limiting, and finally the solution of a large, coupled, nonlinear system using an inexact Newton method with a suitably preconditioned iterative linear solver for computing the Newton correction. This thesis addresses all of these issues for the case of low temperature drying of softwood. Specific case studies are presented that highlight the efficiency of the proposed numerical techniques and illustrate the complex heat and mass transport processes that evolve throughout drying.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wood drying</field><field name="subject">low temperature drying</field><field name="subject">heterogenous</field><field name="subject">computational model</field><field name="subject">three-dimensional</field><field name="subject">control volume finite element</field><field name="subject">triangular prismatic element</field><field name="subject">inexact Newton method</field><field name="subject">Gauss-Green gradient reconstruction</field><field name="subject">Flux limiting</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15960/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disease, disability, service use and social support amongst community-dwelling people aged 75 years and over: the Sydney older persons study</field><field name="creator">Edelbrock, Dorothy Marcia</field><field name="description">This study investigates the characteristics of and the interrelationships between disease, disability, service use and social support in a random sample of 647 community dwellers aged 75 years and over. The two broad objectives of the study are: to examine the physical aspects and manifestations of health by investigating disease and disability and the interrelationships between these two factors, and; to examine the social aspects of health by investigating service use and social support and the interrelationships between these two factors. 	Given the dramatic population ageing in Australia, particularly in the very old age groups, the health, well-being and quality of life of older Australians are of paramount importance and will be well into the future. The proportion of the population with diseases and disabilities increases significantly with age. As the physical aspects of health are manifested with increasing age the social aspects of health also become increasingly important. Older adults, particularly those in advanced old age, are disproportionately high users of health and community services. Despite the high use of services in this age group, far more older adults living in the community rely on their families, friends and neighbours for social support and many older adults use a combination of formal services and informal social support. Little is known about people aged 75 years and over living in the community in Australia. In particular, significant knowledge gaps exist with regard to the relationship between disease and disability and that between service use and social support. The characteristics of social support in this group of older adults are also largely unknown.    The papers presented in this thesis are based on data collected in The Sydney Older Persons Study (SOPS). This is a large longitudinal multidisciplinary project which began in 1991 in order to investigate the health and service use patterns of people aged 75 years and over living in the community in the Central Sydney Health Area. The initial sample consisted of two groups: first, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) selected census districts with probability proportional to size and 9271 households were door-knocked to obtain a random sub-sample of the general community (n=320, response rate 73%); second, community-living veterans and war widows residing in the Central Sydney Health Area were selected at random from a list provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs to obtain a veteran/war widow sub-sample (n=327, response rate 82%).  Respondents participated in both an interview conducted by a social scientist and a medical assessment performed by a medical practitioner with experience in geriatric medicine. An informant was sought for each respondent and this informant participated in a phone interview conducted by a social scientist.    The first paper in this thesis investigates the characteristics of diseases (neurodegenerative, systemic and psychiatric) including their prevalence and association with age. The second paper extends the first by examining the nature of the relationship between disease and disability and in particular which individual diseases and groups of diseases have the greatest impact on disability. The third paper expands the analysis in the second paper by focusing in greater detail on the relationship between disease and disability. The contribution of clinically-diagnosed individual diseases and groups of diseases to three different measures of disability (clinician-rated, informant-rated or proxy and self-report) is investigated here. The fourth paper examines the possibility of disease and disability being the major predictors of service use and social support. It focuses on the determinants of service use and social support using Andersen's behavioral model. The fifth paper investigates the characteristics of social support, in particular gender differences and the socio-demographic variables associated with social support. This is an important research area because lower levels of social support have been found to predict mortality, disease and lower levels of well-being. Finally, the sixth paper links the major themes of the fourth and fifth papers by investigating the relationship between service use and social support. This paper tests Cantor's 'hierarchical-compensatory' mechanism, which predicts a negative association between service use and social support, and the 'bridging' mechanism which predicts a positive association between these two factors. Thus it assesses the extent to which demands for service use and for social support are made together or in a compensatory fashion for respondents of equal disease and disability.    The presented work demonstrates that neurodegenerative diseases [dementia, cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, instability (gait ataxia), immobility (gait slowing) and motivation loss/behaviour change] have the largest and most significant increases with age of all disease groups. Therefore the hypothesis made in paper one that neurodegenerative diseases will come to dominate the health care needs of older adults, particularly when combined with population ageing, is supported. Further, results of papers two and three indicate that neurodegenerative diseases result in greater levels of disability, lending credence to the finding that it is these neurodegenerative diseases that are of central importance to the future of the health care needs of older adults of advanced age. While systemic diseases play an important role in disability, the neurodegenerative diseases are under-recognised by self-report and yet are most strongly associated with severe disability. A major recommendation of this study is that assessments and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases be included in disability assessments.    With regard to the social aspects of health, the fourth paper finds that disease and disability are the main predictors of service use and social support. The fifth paper highlights important gender differences in social support and also finds that lower levels of social support are associated with increased age, male gender, single marital status and lower socioeconomic status. Because it is widely accepted that social support is protective against adverse health outcomes and low levels of wellbeing, these groups of older adults are at risk of poorer health and wellbeing. Finally the sixth paper fills some knowledge gaps with regard to the relationship between service use and social support. It shows that with regard to IADL (instrumental activities of daily living) services and IADL social support, Cantor's 'hierarchical-compensatory' mechanism (negative correlation) applies but with regard to medical services and both ADL (activities of daily living) and IADL social support the 'bridging' mechanism (positive correlation) is supported.    These complex interrelationships between disease, disability, service use and social support are summarised schematically in a model. In light of significant population ageing, substantial resources in the form of medical and community services and social support from carers, family, friends and neighbours will need to be devoted to older adults with diseases, in particular neurodegenerative diseases, and to those with disabilities. Given the increasing importance of disease, disability, service use and social support in very old age, it is crucial that knowledge and understanding of these factors and their interrelationships be advanced in order to better allocate and sustain resources and to ultimately improve the health, well-being and quality of life of very old adults.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disease</field><field name="subject">Disability</field><field name="subject">Service Use</field><field name="subject">Social Support</field><field name="subject">Sydney Older Persons Study</field><field name="subject">Community-dwelling</field><field name="subject">&#145;old-old&#146;</field><field name="subject">Older adults</field><field name="subject">Neurodegenerative diseases</field><field name="subject">The Medical Model</field><field name="subject">The Social Model</field><field name="subject">The Individual-society Model</field><field name="subject">Andersen&#146;s Behavioral Model</field><field name="subject">Cantor&#146;s &#145;Hierarchical-compensatory&#146; Mechanism</field><field name="subject">The &#145;Bridging&#146; Mechanism.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15961/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The information quality of derivative disclosure in corporate annual reports of Australian firms in the extractive industries</field><field name="creator">Hassan, Mohamat Sabri</field><field name="description">Recent events in the business world have focused attention on the importance of high quality financial reporting. Of particular interest is where the collapse of prominent companies such as Baring Plc. was due to the company's involvement with derivative instruments. In Australia, some derivative instruments are not recognised in the balance sheet. However, the Australian accounting standard AASB 1033 Presentation and Disclosure of Financial Instruments requires extensive disclosures to overcome the lack of guidance with regard to the recognition and measurement. Therefore, AASB 1033 may be regarded as a high quality disclosure standard.    This thesis investigates the transparency or information quality of derivative disclosures of Australian firms in the extractive industries using 1998 to 2001 financial reports. The extractive industries play a major role in the Australian economy, where they generated exports worth more than A$30billion in 2000 to 2002 (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2003a and 2003b). Further, firms in the extractive industries extensively use derivative instruments for hedging purposes (Berkman, Bradbury, Hancock and Innes, 1997). The objective of this study is, first, to examine the relationship between the transparency or disclosure quality of derivative information and firm characteristics. Second, this study investigates the value relevance of derivative disclosures in particularly hedge information, net fair value information and risk information. Quality is measured based on a disclosure index developed from AASB 1033 Presentation and Disclosure of Financial Instruments. A finding of concern is that the majority of firms in this study provide less than complete information and therefore enforcement power is required to ensure compliance (Kothari, 2000)    Prior studies have related disclosure quality of accounting information with firm characteristics but no attempt has been made to relate those characteristics with the disclosure quality of derivative instruments. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the relationship between firm characteristics and the quality of derivative disclosures. Firm characteristics investigated are size, profitability, price-earnings ratio, market-to-book ratio, research and development activity, auditor, debt-to-equity ratio and type of extractive firm. This study finds that the variables, firm size, price-earnings and debt-to-equity ratios are associated with the disclosure quality of derivative information. To a lesser extent, the variables, market-to-book ratio and profitability, are also associated with disclosure quality. High disclosure quality has been argued to lead to a reduction in the cost of debt (Sengupta, 1998) and equity (Botosan, 1997), resulting in higher security prices (Miller and Bahnson, 2002). The results of this study indicate that high quality derivative information, as represented by the disclosure index, is value relevant. Market participants do consider hedge information and risk information components as important for decision-making. However, examining the specific information disclosed in the financial statements indicate that some of the disclosed information such as the unrealised gain or loss on financial assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments are not significant. These results contribute to the value relevance literature as this study focuses on the extractive industries which have been neglected in the literature. This study provides important information for standard setters and regulators for future directions in developing accounting standards and is particularly relevant for the impending adoption of International Accounting Standards.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disclosure quality</field><field name="subject">transparency</field><field name="subject">disclosure index</field><field name="subject">financial instruments</field><field name="subject">derivative instruments</field><field name="subject">market value</field><field name="subject">extractives industries.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15962/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magmatic evolution of the Shira Volcanics, Mt Kilimanjaro, Tanzania</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Stephen John</field><field name="description">Mt Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain (5895m), is a large, young (&lt;1.6Ma) stratovolcano at the southern end of the East African Rift, in northern Tanzania.  Consisting of three distinct volcanic centres, Shira, Mawenzi and Kibo, Shira contains the highest proportion of mafic rocks.  Shira samples are strongly silica under-saturated rocks, ranging from picro-basalt, to nephelinite and hawaiite (Mg numbers (Mg #) ranging from 77.2-35.5).  Phenocrysts constitute up to 55% of some samples, and include aluminous augite (often containing abundant fluid and/or melt inclusions), olivine (Fo92-Fo49), plagioclase (An75-An42), nepheline (Ne77-Ne68), magnesiochromite and ulv&#246;spinel.  Groups identified on the basis of phenocryst assemblages and textures correlate with location. East Shira Hill samples contain olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts + microphenocrysts of plagioclase (Group 1), or plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocrysts + microphenocrysts of olivine (Group 2). Samples with high Mg #'s contain abundant cumulate clinopyroxene and olivine (Fo92-Fo85). Group 3 samples (Shira Ridge) contain nepheline phenocrysts and Group 4 samples (Platzkegel) have distinct intergranular textures.  Chondrite normalised REE patterns are steep, with light REE-enrichment up to 400x chondrite.   Spider diagrams, normalised to OIB for primitive Shira samples have strong K depletions and Pb enrichments.    The source of the Shira volcanic rocks is most likely an amphibole-bearing spinel lherzolite, in which amphibole remains residual.  Similarities in spider diagram patterns and trace element ratios suggest a source similar to average OIB.  The Shira volcanic centre is a polygenetic volcano, in which multiple small volume, low degree (4-10%) partial melts from a metasomatised subcontinental lithospheric mantle follow pre-existing structural weaknesses, before ponding in the lithosphere.  Evolution of these small volume melts is dominated by shallow fractional crystallisation of clinopyroxene, olivine&#177;spinel, with plagioclase also fractionating from Group 4 (Platzkegel) samples.  A magma mixing origin is suggested for some samples and supported by complex zonation patterns in major and trace element chemistry of clinopyroxene phenocrysts as well as linear mixing arrays.  The Shira volcanic centre has since ceased activity, and collapsed to form the present day Shira Ridge and caldera before being overlain by various Kibo and parasitic lavas to the east and northwest of the Shira region.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kilimanjaro</field><field name="subject">East African Rift</field><field name="subject">alkalic magmatism</field><field name="subject">petrogenesis</field><field name="subject">magma evolution</field><field name="subject">fractional crystallisation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15963/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Security of reputation systems</field><field name="creator">Ismail, Roslan</field><field name="description">Reputation systems have the potential of improving the quality of on-line markets by  identifying fraudulent users and subsequently dealing with these users can be prevented.  The behaviour of participants involved in e-commerce can be recorded and then this information made available to potential transaction partners to make decisions  to choose a suitable counterpart. Unfortunately current reputation systems suffer from various vulnerabilities. Solutions for many of these problems will be discussed.    One of the major threats is that of unfair feedback. A large number of negative or  positive feedbacks could be submitted to a particular user with the aim to either downgrade  or upgrade the user's reputation. As a result the produced reputation does not reflect the user's true trustworthiness. To overcome this threat a variation of Bayesian Reputation system is proposed. The proposed scheme is based on the subjective logic framework proposed Josang et al. [65]. The impact of unfair feedback is countered through some systematic approaches proposed in the scheme.    Lack of anonymity for participants leads to reluctance to provide negative feedback.  A novel solution for anonymity of feedback providers is proposed to allow participants  to provide negative feedback when appropriate without fear of retaliation. The solution is based on several primitive cryptographic mechanisms; e-cash, designated verifier proof and knowledge proof.    In some settings it is desirable for the reputation owner to control the distribution  of its own reputation and to disclose this at its discretion to the intended parties. To  realize this, a solution based on a certificate mechanism is proposed. This solution allows the reputation owner to keep the certificate and to distribute its reputation while not being able to alter that information without detection. The proposed solutions cater for two modes of reputation systems: centralised and decentralised. The provision of an off-line reputation system is discussed by proposing a new solution  using certificates. This is achieved through the delegation concept and a variant of digital signature schemes known as proxy signatures.    The thesis presents a security architecture of reputation systems which consists of different elements to safeguard reputation systems from malicious activities. Elements incorporated into this architecture include privacy, verifiability and availability. The architecture also introduces Bayesian approach to counter security threat posed by reputation systems. This means the proposed security architecture in the thesis is a combination of two prominent approaches, namely, Bayesian and cryptographic, to provide security for reputation systems. The proposed security architecture can be used as a basic framework for further development in identifying and incorporating required elements so that a total security solution for reputation systems can be achieved.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reputation System</field><field name="subject">E-commerce</field><field name="subject">Rating System</field><field name="subject">Rating Scheme</field><field name="subject">Feedback Scheme</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15964/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic State Construction using Decision  Trees for Reinforcement Learning Agents</field><field name="creator">Au, Manix</field><field name="description">Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a learning framework in which an agent learns a policy from continual interaction with the environment. A policy is a mapping from states to actions. The agent receives rewards as feedback on the actions performed.  The objective of RL is to design autonomous agents to search for the policy that maximizes the expectation of the cumulative reward. When the environment is partially observable, the agent cannot determine the states with certainty. These states are called hidden in the literature. An agent that relies exclusively on the current observations will not always find the optimal policy. For example, a mobile robot needs to remember the number of doors went by in order to reach a specific door, down a corridor of identical doors.    To overcome the problem of partial observability, an agent uses both current and past (memory) observations to construct an internal state representation, which is treated  as an abstraction of the environment. This research focuses on how features of past events are extracted with variable granularity regarding the internal state construction. The project introduces a new method that applies Information Theory and decision tree technique to derive a tree structure, which represents the state and the policy. The relevance, of a candidate feature, is assessed by the Information Gain Ratio ranking with respect to the cumulative expected reward.    Experiments carried out on three different RL tasks have shown that our variant of the U-Tree (McCallum, 1995) produces a more robust state representation and faster learning. This better performance can be explained by the fact that the Information Gain Ratio exhibits a lower variance in return prediction than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test used in the original U-Tree algorithm.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reinforcement learning</field><field name="subject">State</field><field name="subject">Action</field><field name="subject">Reward</field><field name="subject">Policy</field><field name="subject">Value based method</field><field name="subject">Policy search method</field><field name="subject">Automatic state construction</field><field name="subject">Decision tree</field><field name="subject">Partial observability</field><field name="subject">U-Tree</field><field name="subject">Kolmogorov-Smirnov two sample test</field><field name="subject">Information gain ratio test</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15965/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of legislation in driving good occupational health and safety management systems: A comparison of prescriptive based legislation.</field><field name="creator">Kim, Jeong - Ah</field><field name="description">Countries seek to control exposure to hazardous substances and environments by the enactment of legislation. In the past thirty years, two major different approaches to occupational health and safety legislation have been devleoped by countries around the world. The performance-based legislative approach has been linked with the emergence of occupational health and safety management systems but no research has previously been done to determine whether or not  the legislative approach taken by government influences the introduction or form of occupational health and safety management  systems used by organisations. Similarly, although the reasons why Australia and other countries have moved to performance-based  legislation have been explained in terms of social, political and economic factors that influenced the change, little research has been  done on the effectiveness of this approach compared with the prescriptive approach of countries such as Korea.    -I-  The overall aim of this research is to develop a conprehensive  understanding of the management of expusre to heavy metals in selected industries in Korea and Australia. The specific objectives of the study are to determine:   The effectiveness of heavy metal exposure management in the fluorescent lamp manufacturing industry in Korea, and an Oral Health Service, and lead-risk workplaces in Queensland, Australia; The management of the legislative arrangements for health surveillance in Korea and Queensland, Australia;   The characteristics of the occupational health and safety management systems that are in use in the heavy metal industries in Korea in Australia; and The effectiveness of prescriptive and performance based legislative systems in protecting the health and safety of workers in heavy metal based industries. Secondary analysis of biological monitoring data from 6 fluorescent lamp manufacturing companies (8 workplaces) in Korea was used to examine the extent of mercury exposure and the effectiveness of the health surveillance system in that country. A survey of dental workers in an oral health service in Queensland provided data on the extent of mercury exposure to the workforce and workers' attitudes to the management of occupational risks. The efficiency of the lead health surveillance in Queensland was examined by way of a questionnaire survey of lead designated doctors in the state. A survey of registered lead-risk companies and the oral health servies in Queensland, and 5 of the fluorescent lamp manufacturing companies in Korea provided data on the occupational health and safety management systems in place in these organisations.    The health surveillance system for mercury exposed workers in Korea was found to have reduced the incidence of workers with biological  levels of mercury above the Baseline Level from 14% in 1994 to 7% in 1999. Bilogical testing of dental workers in Queensland discovered no  workers with biological levels of mercury approaching the Baseline Level and air monitoring failed to locate any areas where workers were likely to be exposed to levels approaching the Workplace Exposure Standard. The staff of the Oral Health Service were generally aware of the occupational health and safety management systems in place but only 43% felt that mercury management in the workplace  effectively prevented exposure.    The lead surveillance system in Queensland was found to be inadequately managed with approximately 37% of registered doctors  no longer practicing in the field and their being no way for the government to collect reliable data on the extent of lead exposure in workplaces. The occupational health and safety management systems in the companies surveyed in Queensland and Korea were found to be influenced by the legislative arrangements in place in each of the locations. The Korean systems were more geared to meeting the regulatory requirements whereas the Queensland systems were geared more towards a risk management approach. However  substantial differences were also noted  depending on the size of the organisation in each case.    Legislative arrangements in Korea and Queensland were found to provide reasonable protection from heavy metal exposure to workers however improvements in both systems are needed. The legislation was also found to influence the occupational health and safety management systems in place with performance-based legislation producing systems having a wide risk management focus while a narrower regulatory based focus was noted in Korea where more  prescriptive legislation is in force. A confounding factor in the nature of  the occupational health and safety management system in place is the size of the organisation and particular attention needs to be paid to this  when legislative approaches are considered.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health and safety</field><field name="subject">occupational health and safety management systems</field><field name="subject">heavy metal exposure australia</field><field name="subject">heavy metal exposure Korea</field><field name="subject">lead exposure</field><field name="subject">prescriptive legislation</field><field name="subject">performance based legislation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15966/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visually sealed and digitally signed electronic documents: Building on Asian tradition.</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yin - Miao</field><field name="description">E-commerce has developed through the use of digital signatures, employing various forms of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to ensure the secure usage of digital signatures. Digital signatures are designed to facilitate the functions of traditional seals and handwritten signatures for the purposes of authentication,  data integrity, and non-repudiation within the e-commerce environment. Historically, the authenticity of documentation has always been verified by the application of a recognisable visual stimulus to the document; however, the  current digital signature regime overlooks the importance of this analogous sense of visualisation.    One of the primary problems with existing digital signatures is that a digital signature does not "feel" like, or resemble, a traditional seal to the human observer, as it does not have a personal, recognisable, or aesthetic sense of visualisation. Currently, digital signatures, such as the OpenPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) digital signature, are attached to the end of an electronic document as a stream of printable ASCII characters. (RFC2440) This appears to the average user as a long, incomprehensible string of random characters offering no sense of identity or ownership by simple visual inspection. Additionally, digital signatures change each time they are applied, in contrast to traditional seals that remain consistent personal identifiers associated with individual signatories.    The goal of this research is to promote enhancements to existing digital signature schemes in order to bridge the cultural gap between traditional seals and digital signatures. Culturally friendly features integrated into the digital signature have the potential to increase user acceptability of global e-commerce. This research investigates traditional seal cultures within the context of modern digital signatures, identifying the need to develop a new, culturally friendly,  visualised digital signature scheme. The principles behind digital signatures are reviewed and the essential roles and  responsibilities of a PKI are addressed.    A practical analysis of PKI implementation is also essential. Taiwan is selected as the focus of this research since its heritage is deeply rooted in, and strongly adheres to the Chinese seal culture. The Taiwanese government is  in the process of adapting the traditional seal certificate system to the electronic digital signature system. Therefore it is pertinent to review the PKI implementation and digital signatures applications in Taiwan in this study.    The purpose of this research is to make the intangible digital signature virtually tangible; i.e., to incorporate visualisation into the current digital signature practice. This research defines new private extensions to the X.509 v3 certificate, recommending that conforming visualised digital signature applications should then be developed to generate and/or recognise visual digital certificates in support of the proposed visualised digital signature scheme.    The processes of visualised digital signature creation and of verification through the application of the visualised digital certificate are then explained. This is accompanied by a model of system analysis for developers of conforming implementations of this specification. This allows developers the  freedom to select appropriate developing tools. An analysis of this research evaluates the quality of integrity, security,  interoperability, performance, and  flexibility offered by this proposal.Future directions for furthering research development conclude this dissertation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seals</field><field name="subject">signatures</field><field name="subject">signets</field><field name="subject">biblical seals</field><field name="subject">Western seals</field><field name="subject">Chinese seals</field><field name="subject">Japanese seals</field><field name="subject">Digital signatures</field><field name="subject">seal certificates and digital certificates</field><field name="subject">visualised signing and verification</field><field name="subject">visualised digital signatures</field><field name="subject">visualised digital certificates</field><field name="subject">PKI</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15967/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The stability of EMG median frequency under different muscle contraction conditions and following anterior cruciate ligament injury</field><field name="creator">Li, Che Tin Raymond</field><field name="description">Musculoskeletal injuries are commonly associated with muscle atrophy as a function of immobilization or change of normal function.  For example, injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) which may involve ligament reconstruction, results in the "quadriceps  avoidance" gait which leads to atrophy of the knee extensormuscles. In these situations it is not clear whether or not the atrophy is associated with loss of specific muscle fibre types with accompanying functional deficits. Such knowledge would be helpful in implementing exercise regimes designed to compensate for loss of particular fibre types. It is believed that isokinetic exercise performed at speeds below 180&#176; per second strengthens type I muscle fibres, and type II fibres at fast speeds. However, there is no evidence to indicate the specific muscle fibre response to different rates of muscle contraction. Identification of muscle fibre type is most directly determined by biopsy technique but is too invasive for a routine measurement. Electromyography median  frequency has been used as a non-invasive measure to infer muscle fibre composition in various studies. However, the reliability and  accuracy of this technique has been questioned and improvement is necessary.    This research was designed to provide a more accurate and reliable protocol for the determination of EMG median frequency which may  be used, after validation against more direct biopsy techniques, as a routine method for inferring muscle fibre composition. The  investigation also explored the muscular response as measured by EMG median frequency to varying speeds of muscle contraction,  fatiguing exercise and atrophy following ACL reconstruction. The ultimate aim of this research was to improve the reliability of the  determination of EMG median frequency to enhance its application as a predictor of muscle fibre composition. This provides information which may improve ACL rehabilitation programs designed to restore and prevent specific muscle fibre types loss that have not previously been targeted by current rehabilitation programs. This research was conducted in three studies.    Study one determined the stability of the EMG median frequency bilaterally for the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles and identified the mode of contraction associated with the greatest  reliability. The strength and EMG median frequency of the vastus lateralis, medial hamstrings and vastus medialis of 55 subjects was  determined across 5 speeds from 0&#176; to 240&#176; per second using a Kin-Com isokinetic dynamometer and an EMG data acquisition system. Isometric contraction was found to have the least bilateral discrepancy (4.01% &#177;3.06) and between trials standard deviation (4.50) in the vastus lateralis, medial hamstrings and vastus medialis.    Study two investigated the EMG median frequency changes in the vastus lateralis which occur immediately following different speeds of isokinetic exercise to the point of fatigue in normal subjects. Thirty-four subjects  participated in the study, and performed a 90-second period of isokinetic exercise to activate the knee extensors at either 30&#176; or 300&#176; per second. EMG median frequency of the vastus lateralis was determined before, immediately after and 7 minutes after the fatiguing exercise. The percentage drop in EMG median frequency of the vastus medialis was gnificantly (p&lt;0.05) greater after slow speed (27.9%) than fast speed (20.25%) exercise, while no significant difference was found for the percentage drop in extension torque. Full recovery was found 7 minutes after the fatiguing exercise. By reference to previous research showing a relationship between EMG median  frequency and muscle fibre type, an increase in activation of type I muscle fibres with slow speed exercise and an increase in type II  muscle fibres with fast speed exercise was observed.    Study three identified the changes in EMG median frequency following ACL reconstruction and evaluated the bilateral differences in EMG median frequency of the knee muscles. The relationships between EMG median frequency and the measures of knee functional ability, knee muscle strength, age and time since surgery were also investigated. Twelve subjects who had undergone ACL reconstruction using a semitendinosus and gracilis graft 6 to 12  months earlier, participated in the study. EMG median frequency was determined from an 8-second isometric contraction and knee functional ability was assessed using the Cincinnati Rating Scale. Bilateral EMG median frequency shifts were inconsistent among subjects. On the basis of previous research which indicated a  relationship between EMG median frequency and fibre type, no consistent pattern of muscular fibre type atrophy subsequent to ACL reconstruction occurred within 6 to 12 months (ranged from -43 to 57 Hz). Additionally, no significant correlations were found between  the EMG median frequency and the knee functional score and knee extension and flexion torques, age, time since operation and the bilateral differences in EMG median frequency. The results of this investigation will serve to improve the reliability of EMG median frequency across a range of conditions in which it has been  evaluated. Further research is needed to confirm the relationship between EMG median frequency and direct observations of muscle fibre composition to improve the predictive value of this measure. Following this validation it will be possible to evaluate the bilateral EMG median frequency shift to infer the type of muscle fibre atrophy, and use this measure in determining the efficacy of specific rehabilitation programs.    In conclusion  * An 8-second isometric contraction is recommended for determining EMG median frequency.  * EMG median frequency of a muscle decreases significantly more after slow fatiguing exercise than after fast speed fatiguing exercise.  * There was no generalised bilateral EMG median frequency shift found in a group of subjects 6 to 12 months following semitendinosus and gracilis graft ACL reconstruction.  * The results of this study will serve to improve the reliability of procedures used to determine EMG median frequency under a range of different contractile conditions. The EMG median  frequency changes in response to these conditions require further validations with muscle biopsy in future.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Median frequency</field><field name="subject">Anterior cruciate ligament injury</field><field name="subject">Bone patellar-tendon bone reconstruction</field><field name="subject">Semitendinosus and gracilis tendon reconstruction</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Isokinetic exercise</field><field name="subject">Open and closed kinetic chain exercise</field><field name="subject">Quadriceps avoidance gait</field><field name="subject">Muscle atrophy</field><field name="subject">Type I and type II muscle fibres</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15968/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Baggage : unpacked - analysing the short film and its place in the world</field><field name="creator">Noonan, Michael</field><field name="description">In the seedy confines of his one-bedroom apartment, reclusive loner Harris Babel delights in watching the camcorder images of others: images he buys from a strange, smoke-filled store at the end of an alleyway.
 
 They are pre-recorded trips to faraway places, memories he pretends are his own.
 
 Holidays to Madagascar, trips to Lord Howe Island, tours through Kakadu National Park -- there are no boundaries. But Harris' claustrophobic world takes a disturbing turn when he receives a phone call from the airport, claiming he left luggage behind from a trip he doesn't remember. A trip he never went on. Or did he?
 
 From script to screen, Baggage was an exhausting 14-month journey, beginning with the first draft of the script in May 2001 and culminating in the exhibition of the film in July 2002, two days after the final sound and vision cut was completed.
 
 At its heart, the film is an exploration of identity, memory and the childhood demons that haunt us. It is about loss and abandonment, camcorder voyeurism and the obsessions that make us human. On reflection, it is a film with many flaws. But the process of recognising these flaws and better understanding the filmmaking process is an essential part of development and growth. 
 
 This paper will explore the writing and directing process involved in the making of Baggage, analysing structure, cause-and-effect, character identification, suspense, style and substance. It will also evaluate the state of the short film in Australia, its importance in the development of filmmakers and the avenues for exhibition and distribution.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analysis of short films</field><field name="subject">writing and directing process</field><field name="subject">filmmaker development</field><field name="subject">film and television</field><field name="subject">short films in australia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15969/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parallel Data Mining On Cycle Stealing Networks</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Calum Stewart</field><field name="description">In a world where electronic databases are used to store ever-increasing quantities of data it is becoming harder to mine useful information from them. Therefore there is a need for a highly scalable parallel architecture capable of handling the ever-increasing complexity of data mining problems.    A cycle stealing network is one possible scalable solution to this problem. A cycle stealing network allows users to donate their idle cycles to form a virtual supercomputer by connecting multiple machines via a network. This research aims to establish whether cycle  stealing networks, specifically the G2 system developed at the Queensland University of Technology, are viable for large scale data mining problems. The computationally intensive sequence mining, feature selection and functional dependency mining problems are deliberately chosen to test the usefulness and scalability of G2.    Tests have shown that G2 is highly scalable where the ratio of computation to communication is approximately known. However for combinatorial problems where computation times are difficult or impossible to predict, and communication costs can be unpredictable, G2 often provides little or no speedup. This research demonstrates that existing sequence mining and functional dependency mining techniques are not suited to a client-server style cycle stealing network like G2. However the feature selection is well suited to G2, and a new sequence mining algorithm offers comparable performance to other existing, non-cycle stealing, parallel sequence mining algorithms. Furthermore new functional dependency mining algorithms offer substantial benefit over existing serial algorithms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data mining problems</field><field name="subject">parallel sequence algorithms</field><field name="subject">functional dependency</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15970/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community connections:psychological sense of community and identification in geographical and relational settings.</field><field name="creator">Obst, Patricia</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the construct of Psychological Sense of Community (PSOC). Within the discipline of community psychology, there is debate as to the dimensions underlying the construct PSOC. One of the few theoretically proposed structures is that put forward by McMillan and Chavis (1986), who hypothesized  four dimensions: Belonging; Fulfilment of Needs; Influence; and Shared Connections underlying PSOC. Further, there is some deliberation in the literature as to the existence of PSOC in relational, as well as geographical, communities.  Discussion has also emerged regarding the role of social identification within PSOC. It has been suggested that differences in PSOC may be understood in terms of the degree to which members identify with their community (Fisher &amp; Sonn, 1999).  However, few studies have explored the place of identification in PSOC. In addition, while PSOC has been applied to both relational and  geographical communities, little research has looked in depth at PSOC within relational communities. Thus, the principle aims of the current program of research were to elucidate the underlying dimensions of PSOC and their consistency across geographical and relational  communities. Further, the research also aimed to explore the role of identification in PSOC.    The first stage of this research endeavoured to clarify the underlying dimensions of PSOC by utilising a questionnaire which included multiple measures of PSOC and social identification, administered to both relational and geographical community members. The first paper of the current research explored PSOC in a  relational community, science fiction fandom (N = 359) and the third paper in a sample of residents of rural, regional and urban geographical communities (N = 669). In both the relational and geographical communities, support emerged for McMillan and Chavis' (1986) four dimensions of PSOC. In regards to identification, the Sense of Community iv  affective and ingroups ties aspects of social identification were subsumed within the  PSOC dimensions; however, the Conscious Identification aspect emerged as separate  to the existing PSOC dimensions.    The study presented in paper three also examined the role of demographic factors in predicting PSOC in geographical communities. The demographic factors significantly associated with PSOC were: type of region, with rural participants displaying higher PSOC than their urban counterparts; participation in local  organizations; having children; and a vision of one's neighbourhood as broader than  just a street or block.    To date, little research has compared a single group's PSOC with a relational community to their PSOC with their geographical communities. The second paper presented in this manuscript explored PSOC with participants' relational and  geographical communities in the sample of members of science fiction fandom (N =  359). All the PSOC dimensions and Conscious Identification emerged as significant  predictors of overall sense of community in both community types. Participants reported higher levels of global PSOC with fandom than with their geographical communities, a pattern that also emerged across the four dimensions and Conscious Identification. It was proposed that the degree of choice of community membership  may be one reason for this finding. However, stronger conclusions could not be drawn from this study as situational salience may have influenced the results as data was collected in the relational community context.    The second phase of the current research aimed to validate the multidimensional nature and related measures of both social identification and PSOC. The fourth paper presented in this thesis examined the construct validity of  the three-factor model of social identification as measured by the Three Dimensional Strength of Identification Scale proposed by Cameron (1999, 2004). The 12 item version of the scale was used to collect data from an undergraduate sample (N = 219) to assess their social identification across three distinct group memberships (sex,  student and interest group). This data was subjected to confirmatory factor analysis  to examine the fit of the three-factor model of social identity in comparison to fit indices for one and two-factor models. The results indicate that the three-factor model was the most parsimonious and best fit to the data across all groups. In addition, the fact that different patterns of means and correlations emerged across  groups on the three dimensions provided further evidence for a multidimensional model of social identification and, moreover, the greater depth of exploration it allows.    The fifth paper examines The Sense of Community Index (SCI), one of the most commonly used measures of PSOC. There is much discussion in the literature as to the validity of the scale as a measure not only of overall PSOC, but of the  dimensions (Membership, Influence, Needs fulfillment and Emotional Connection)  theorized by McMillan and Chavis (1986) to underlie the construct. This paper examines the factor structure of the Sense of Community Index in a study (N = 219)that examined neighborhood, student and interest group communities. The results showed that the Sense of Community Index, in terms of its original factor structure, did not adequately fit the data. The scale was revised, utilizing confirmatory factor analysis indicators, to produce a new four-factor structure based on the original items. This revised model was tested and found to display adequate fit indices to the  data in all three community types. The results of the study provide empirical support for retaining measures that encapsulate the four dimensions of PSOC.The sixth paper further explores the interplay between PSOC and the  dimensions of social identification. In particular, the study (N = 219) examines the  relative strength of the separate aspects of social identification (based on Cameron's  2004, Three Factor Model of Social Identification) as predictors of overall PSOC,  accounting for situational salience. Results indicate that Ingroup Ties is consistently  the strongest predictor of PSOC and that the strength of Ingroup Affect and Centrality alter according to the group or community context.    The seventh and final paper from the current research program emerged from the results of paper two indicating that choice may influence individuals' social identification and PSOC with their respective communities. The study  presented in this paper examined participants' (N = 219) level of social identification and PSOC  across multiple group memberships that differ in the degree of choice associated with membership (low choice: neighborhood community; medium choice: student community; and high choice: self chosen interest group). Results indicated that,  controlling for contextual salience, choice was positively associated with levels of social identification and PSOC.    Overall, the current program of research  provides some important findings which add significantly to the theoretical understanding of PSOC in today's society.  The research provides clarification of both the dimensions underlying PSOC, their application to both geographical and relational communities and the measurement of overall PSOC and these dimensions. Further, it provides empirical evidence of the importance of the Centrality aspect of identification in PSOC in both geographical and relational settings. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings of the overall program of research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychological sense of community</field><field name="subject">social identity</field><field name="subject">choice</field><field name="subject">relational communities</field><field name="subject">internet communities</field><field name="subject">virtual communities</field><field name="subject">geographical communities</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15971/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local buckling behaviour and design of cold-formed steel compression members at elevated temperatures</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jung Hoon</field><field name="description">The importance of fire safety design has been realised due to the ever increasing loss of properties and lives caused by structural failures during fires. In recognition of the importance of fire safety design, extensive research has been undertaken in the field of fire safety of buildings and structures especially over the last couple of decades. In the same period, the development of fire safety engineering principles has brought significant reduction to the cost of fire protection. However the past fire research on steel structures has been limited to heavier, hot-rolled structural steel members and thus the structural behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel members under fire conditions is not well understood. Since cold-formed steel structures have been commonly used for numerous applications and their use has increased rapidly in the last decade, the fire safety of cold-formed steel structural members has become an important issue. The current design standards for steel structures have simply included a list of reduction factors for the yield strength and elasticity modulus of hot-rolled steels without any detailed design procedures. It is not known whether these reduction factors are applicable to the commonly used thin, high strength steels in Australia. Further, the local buckling effects dominate the structural behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel members. Therefore an extensive research program was undertaken at the Queensland University of Technology to investigate the local buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel compression members under simulated fire conditions. The first phase of this research program included 189 tensile coupon tests including three steel grades and six thicknesses to obtain the accurate yield strength and elasticity modulus values at elevated temperatures because the deterioration of the mechanical properties is the major parameter in the structural design under fire conditions. The results obtained from the tensile tests were used to predict the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel members. An appropriate stress-strain model was also developed by considering the inelastic mechanical characteristics.    The second phase of this research was based on a series of more than 120 laboratory experiments and corresponding numerical analyses on cold-formed steel compression members to investigate the local bucking behaviour of the unstiffened flange elements, stiffened web elements and stiffened web and flange elements at elevated temperatures up to 800&#176;C. The conventional effective design rules were first simply modified considering the reduced mechanical properties obtained from the tensile coupon tests and their adequacy was studied using the experimental and numerical results. It was found that the simply modified effective width design rules were adequate for low strength steel members and yet was not adequate for high strength cold-formed steel members due to the severe reduction of the ultimate strength in the post buckling strength range and the severe reduction ratio of the elasticity modulus to the yield strength at elevated temperatures. Due to the inadequacy of the current design rules, the theoretical, semi-empirical and empirical effective width design rules were developed to accurately predict the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel compression members subject to local buckling effects at elevated temperatures. The accuracy of these new design methods was verified by comparing their predictions with a variety of experimental and numerical results. This thesis presents the details of extensive experimental and numerical studies undertaken in this research program and the results including comparison with simply modified effective width design rules. It also describes the advanced finite element models of cold-formed steel compression members developed in this research including the appropriate mechanical properties, initial imperfections, residual stresses and other significant factors. Finally, it presents the details of the new design methods proposed for the cold-formed steel compression members subject to local buckling effects at elevated temperatures.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cold-formed steel compression members</field><field name="subject">light gauge high strength steels</field><field name="subject">elevated temperatures</field><field name="subject">axial compression strength</field><field name="subject">reduced yield strength</field><field name="subject">reduced elasticity modulus</field><field name="subject">stress-strain model</field><field name="subject">unstiffened element</field><field name="subject">stiffened element</field><field name="subject">local buckling interaction</field><field name="subject">fire safety design</field><field name="subject">local buckling</field><field name="subject">effective width</field><field name="subject">local buckling stress</field><field name="subject">buckling coefficient</field><field name="subject">simulated fire test</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15972/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digestive profile and capacity of the mud crab (Scylla serrata)</field><field name="creator">Pavasovic, Marko</field><field name="description">Commercial farming of mud crab Scylla serrata is a significant industry throughout South East Asia. The limited scientific knowledge of mud crab nutritional requirements and digestive processes, however, is recognised as a  major constraint to the future growth of this industry. To better understand the  mechanisms of digestion in the mud crab we have analysed the diversity of digestive enzymes from the hepatopancreas. Significant protease, amylase,cellulase and xylanase activities were detected in soluble extracts from this  organ.    Temperature profiles for all enzymes were basically similar with optimal activities observed at 500C. Examination of pH tolerance revealed optimal activities for protease and amylase at pH 7.0 while optimal activities for  cellulase and xylanase were observed at pH 5.5. Under optimum conditions,protease and amylase activities were approximately two orders of magnitude greater than those seen for either cellulase or xylanase. Interestingly,  hepatopancreatic extracts were able to liberate glucose from either starch or carboxymethyl (CM)-cellulose suggesting that a range of carbohydrates may be utilised as energy sources. The effects of dietary carbohydrates on feed  digestibility, digestive enzyme levels and growth were also studied by inclusion of additional starch or CM-cellulose at the expense of casein in formulated diets. It was shown that amylase, cellulase and xylanase activities  in extracts from the hepatopancreas were highest in mud crabs fed diets containing 47% carbohydrate. Based on the findings, we suggest that the ability of the mud crab to modulate digestive enzyme activities may represent  a mechanism to maximise access to essential nutrients when the dietary profile changes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mud crab farming</field><field name="subject">scylla serrata</field><field name="subject">commercial mud crab farming</field><field name="subject">commercial farming in south east asia</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">aquaculture production</field><field name="subject">aquatic crustaceans</field><field name="subject">crabs</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15973/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prolonged use of intravenous administration sets: a randomised controlled trial.</field><field name="creator">Rickard, Claire</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research study was to improve the nursing care of intravenous  catheters by providing evidence on the effects of prolonged duration of intravenous  administration set use.    Intravenous therapy is a vital part of modern health care. However, its invasive nature  can result in infection, with high associated morbidity and mortality. The highest infection rates are displayed in intensive care patients with central venous catheters. The duration of intravenous administration set use may have an impact on infection rates,however the current practice usage and the optimum duration of use is unknown. Previous studies of central venous catheters have reported equal infection rates with 1 to 4 days of administration set use; however few patients have been evaluated with  administration sets used beyond this time. Previous research has been limited by the  inadequacy of available definitions for Catheter-Related Infection.    A prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trial was performed to assess the infection risk of using administration sets for prolonged periods. In the developmental phase prior to the clinical trial; definitions of Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI) were developed; a nursing practice survey was undertaken to establish the current duration of administration set use; and laboratory experiments were executed to assess the impact of prolonged use on administration set physical integrity and  performance.    Central venous catheters were randomised to have their administration sets used for 4  days (n = 203) or 7 days (n = 201).    Percutaneous central venous catheters were enrolled into the study from two adult  intensive care units at a metropolitan, tertiary-referral, teaching hospital. Catheters were  multiple-lumen, chlorhexidine-gluconate and silver-sulphadiazine coated lines, both inserted and removed in the intensive care unit.    Catheters were cultured for microbial colonisation on removal using the Maki roll-plate  technique. Patients were assessed for CRBSI using the developed definitions consisting  of categories: definite, probable (type I and II), possible and absent. Prior to the clinical  trial, a practice survey questionnaire was administered, and laboratory experimentation  was performed.    Normality of distribution for continuous variables was assessed using the Kolmogorov-  Smirnov statistic. The distribution between groups of variables considered risk factors  for Catheter-Related Infection were tested to assess for bias using Chi-square and T-test.  Logistic regression modelling was performed to analyse the influence of potentially  confounding variables. The incidence of catheter colonisation and CRBSI was tested between groups using Kaplan-Meier survival curve with Log-rank test. Paired T-tests were performed to test for difference in programmed and delivered volumes of  administration sets. A general linear model (ANOVA)&#177; a Scheffe post hoc test to isolate difference was fitted to the standardised values of delivered volumes to determine the effects of day of measurement and volume delivery rate on the accuracy of volume delivery.    There were 10 colonised tips in the intervention group and 19 in the control group. This  difference was not statistically significant (Kaplan Meier survival analysis, Log Rank =  0.87, df = 1, p = 0.35). There were 3 cases of CRBSI per group and the difference in survival from CRBSI was not statistically significant (Kaplan Meier with Log Rank test, p = 0.86). The pre-clinical trial phases of the research programme established that current clinical practice was 3 to 7-day use of administration sets; that administration sets were physically intact and delivered clinically accurate volumes after 7 days of use; and developed useful definitions of CRBSI.    Prolonged intravenous administration set use of 7 days was found to have no significant  impact on patient infection indicators or physical performance of the sets. This finding is  congruent with previous research and trends in current clinical practice.    In conclusion, the research findings support the use of intravenous administration sets  for 7 days.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infusions</field><field name="subject">intrvenous</field><field name="subject">catheterisation</field><field name="subject">central venous</field><field name="subject">sepsis</field><field name="subject">septicaemia</field><field name="subject">infusion pumps</field><field name="subject">infection control</field><field name="subject">clinical nursing research</field><field name="subject">clinical trails</field><field name="subject">randomised controlled trials</field><field name="subject">questionnaires</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15974/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of work stress and work support on burnout in public hosptial nurses.</field><field name="creator">Spooner-Lane, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) transactional stress-strain-coping theory provides the theoretical background for the present thesis. This theory proposes that strain (i.e., burnout) occurs when demands (i.e., work stressors) exceed coping resources (e.g., social support). The current thesis explores the influence of social support on the stress-burnout relationship in nurses. A sample of Australian nurses working across three public hospitals in Brisbane's metropolitan district were  recruited to investigate the nature and level of burnout experienced by nurses. Burnout is characterised by emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and reduced personal accomplishment. The present research addresses gaps in the empirical literature by investigating the key work stressors experienced by Australian nurses and by establishing nurses' referent levels of work stress, social support, and burnout.  In addition, the research explores the complex relationships between work stress, social support and burnout.  The majority of nursing studies have failed to consider how support from within the nurses' work environment mitigates burnout. The present research builds upon previous nursing literature by examining the "main&amp;qout; and "buffering" effect  hypotheses. Studies have consistently found support for the main effect model, however the hypothesis that social support buffers the negative effects of stress has resulted in highly conflicting findings. Some theorists (Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985; Cutrona &amp; Russell, 1990) propose that the buffering effects of social support will only be found if there is an adequate match between the needs elicited by the stressful event and the type of support an individual receives. The present study extends the stress or support matching theory by exploring the matching between specific types of stressors to specific types (i.e., emotional and instrumental) and sources (i.e.,supervisor and coworkers) of support. Cutrona (1990) suggests that the controllability of a stressor is the primary dimension in determining an appropriate match between stressors and types of support. Cutrona proposes that controllable stressful events elicit needs for instrumental support and uncontrollable events elicit needs for emotional support. Heeding Cutrona's advice, independent raters classified nurses' work stressors as controllable or uncontrollable stressful events prior to investigating the stressor-support matching theory.  Three sequential studies were undertaken to explore the variables of interest to this research program. In Study 1, focus groups were conducted with 68 nurses (11 males, 34 females) from two public hospitals. The qualitative data was subjected to content analysis. The findings revealed that Australian nurses are exposed to a range of job-specific stressors (i.e., Job Conditions, Job Uncertainty, Interpersonal Conflict and a Lack of Professional Recognition and Support) and generic role stressors (i.e.,  Role Overload, Role Conflict and Role  Ambiguity). The findings prompted the research to utilise Wolfgang's (1988) Health Professions Stress Inventory to measure nurses' job-specific stressors and Osipow and Spokane's (1987) Occupational Roles Questionnaire to measure nurses' role stressors in Study 2.  The findings from Study 1 also confirmed that the way nurses perceive work support is consistent with current social support literature. Nurses indicated that their  two main sources of support were their coworkers and their supervisor. Furthermore, nurses discussed social support from a multidimensional perspective, recognising different types of support that were broadly classified as emotional and instrumental support. Based on these findings, the researcher developed a work support measure specifically for the purpose of this research. Items were taken from established social support scales and were slightly modified to ensure that they were contextually relevant to nurses.  In Study 2, 273 nurses (38 males, 235 females) completed a multi-measure questionnaire. While there was sufficient research evidence to indicate that the Occupational Roles Questionnaire (Osipow &amp; Spokane, 1987) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach, Jackson, &amp; Leiter, 1996) possess adequate levels of reliability and validity, less was known about Wolfgang's Health Professions Stress Inventory and the work support scales designed for this research program. Factor analysis of the Health Professions Stress Inventory revealed a four-factor solution:  Lack of Professional Recognition and Support, Patient Care Uncertainty, Job Conditions, and Interpersonal Conflict. Cronbach's coefficient alphas ranged from .62 to .83. Factor analysis of the Coworker Support Scale revealed a two-factor solution, representing emotional and instrumental support. Cronbach's coefficient alphas for the Emotional Coworker Support and Instrumental Coworker Support were .92 and  .88 respectively. Contrary to expectations, factor analysis of the Supervisor Support  Scale revealed a one-factor solution. It was therefore deemed appropriate to examine  Supervisor Support as a unidimensional construct in subsequent analyses. Cronbach's coefficient alpha for the Supervisor Support scale was .96. Overall, the results from Study 2 provided supporting evidence to suggest that the measures used in the current research program were psychometrically sound.  In Study 3, the data collected in Study 2 was subjected to further statistical analysis. The findings from Study 3 indicated that overall, the sample of Australian nurses reported low to moderate levels of work stress, moderate levels of work support and moderately high levels of burnout. For Emotional Exhaustion, predictor  variables accounted for 42.2% of the total variance. Sociodemographic factors explained a small but significant proportion of the variance (2.7%). Work stressors however, were the main predictors of Emotional Exhaustion, explaining 41.5% of the total variance. Role Overload, Job Conditions and Role Conflict were the main determinants of Emotional Exhaustion, with Role Overload explaining most of the variance. For Depersonalisation, the predictor variables accounted for 34.2% of the total variance. Sociodemographic factors (11.5%) and work stressors (33.6%) both explained a significant proportion of the variance. Role Conflict and Patient Care Uncertainty were the main determinants of Depersonalisation, with Role Conflict explaining most of the variance. For Personal Accomplishment, Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity explained 20.5% of the total variance, with Role Conflict explaining most of the variance. Sociodemographic factors and job-specific stressors were not significant  Predictors of Personal Accomplishment. Evidence for main effects of work support on burnout were limited. There was no evidence to suggest that work support had significant main effects on Emotional Exhaustion. Supervisor Support had a  small, but significant main effect on Depersonalisation (&#226; = -.15, p &lt; .05) and  Personal Accomplishment (&#226; = -.24, p &lt; .01). There was no evidence of main effects for Emotional and Instrumental Coworker Support. Furthermore, the present research found no significant evidence to support the buffering effect of work support on burnout. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">burnout</field><field name="subject">emotional exhaustion</field><field name="subject">depersonalisation. personal accomplishment</field><field name="subject">work stress</field><field name="subject">work stressors</field><field name="subject">lack of professional recognition and support</field><field name="subject">patient care uncertainty</field><field name="subject">job conditions</field><field name="subject">interpersonal conflict</field><field name="subject">role overload</field><field name="subject">role conflict</field><field name="subject">role ambiguity</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">work support</field><field name="subject">emotional support</field><field name="subject">instrumental support</field><field name="subject">coworker support</field><field name="subject">supervisor support</field><field name="subject">nurses.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15975/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Legal Tensions in the Governance of Inclusion: Principals' Perspectives on Inclusion and the Law</field><field name="creator">Keeffe, Mary Bernice</field><field name="description">Disability discrimination is an ongoing problem in Australian schools. This study analyses the tension that exists between the requirements of the disability discrimination legislation and the way that principals make decisions about the inclusion of students with disabilities in Queensland state schools. The findings from the study suggest that principals believe the disability discrimination legislation is relevant but it is not helpful in providing a framework for discrimination-free decision-making. Instead, the democratic governance processes of inclusion and collaboration are identified as essential elements of the school principal's decision-making process if inclusive school cultures are to thrive and if discrimination is to be reduced or eliminated.    Habermas's critical theory of lifeworld and systems world provides the conceptual framework to analyse the complex lifeworld of the principal and the systemic requirements of the legislation. A lifeworld model of decision-making interactions within the inclusive school  is proposed from the data collected in this study. Data were collected using a mixed methodology in which 120 principals responded to surveys about their perspectives on inclusion. This was followed by a series of in-depth interviews with six principals who described their schools as inclusive. Focus groups also provided group perspectives and verified the data collected from the surveys and interviews. Together, the quantitative data and the qualitative information complement each other to provide comprehensive perspectives from principals about inclusion and the law.    Recommendations are made in the final chapters that propose a new legal paradigm for disability discrimination legislation so that the discordance between the systems world of the law and the lifeworld of the principal may be reduced. More specific policy and governance recommendations promote collaborative decision-making models to facilitate shared understandings about complex issues that relate to disability.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disability Discrimination Legislation</field><field name="subject">inclusion</field><field name="subject">democratic governance</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">Human Rights</field><field name="subject">disabilities</field><field name="subject">Queensland state schools</field><field name="subject">discrimination-free decision-making</field><field name="subject">lifeworld</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">law.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15976/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of Novel Co-Anhydride cured Epoxy Resins</field><field name="creator">Rocks, Jens</field><field name="description">Epoxy resins are widely used as coatings, encapsulations, structural composites, castings, and adhesives in a number of electrical applications. Recently, novel uncatalyzed co-anhydride cured epoxy formulations that exhibit a high performance property profile, have been introduced. The objective of this thesis was to perform a comprehensive material characterization of these new resin/hardener combinations, which are potentially used as electrical insulation material in medium and high  voltage engineering.    The thermal cure behaviour of commercial tetraglycidyl-diamino-diphenylmethane (TGDDM) and a co-anhydride mixture consisting of maleic anhydride (MA) and hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA) was extensively studied. Different analytical real-time methods, such as FT-Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and chemo-rheological methods were applied to investigate the principal polymerization mechanism and the related curing kinetics. It was demonstrated that kinetic parameters that were based on isothermal measurements provided consistent and reliable results. On the other hand the general limitations of different dynamic  methods for kinetic parameter calculations were outlined and discussed. Temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry provided a powerful technique to confirm a TGDDM/MA and TGDDM/HHPA sub-network structure of the co-anhydride cured epoxy. A generalized time-temperature-transformation-diagram was developed in order to predict the complex material transformations (e.g. gelation and vitrification) occurring during the entire isothermal curing process.    In the selected system, the mechanical deformation and fracture behaviour as a  function of temperature, strain rate, inorganic filler fraction, particle size, and filler/matrix-adhesion were thoroughly studied by using compression-, tension- and double torsion fracture-tests. The potential of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) as low viscosity toughening modifiers for highly crosslinked anhydride-cured epoxy networks was experimentally evaluated. The effects of the HBP molecular structure, in particular the specific shell chemistry, on thermo-mechanical properties, final morphology, and blend concentration, were assessed. For the neat investigated epoxy-system the most efficient toughening modifier was obtained for a molecular  HBP-design that provided a pseudo-homogeneous blend morphology. Thus, by using suitable HBPs in a concentration of 20% w/w, the fracture toughness, expressed by the critical stress intensity factor (Klc) of 0.58 MPam(to the power of)0.5, was increased by over 50% to 0.88 MPam(to the power of)0.5. The corresponding Young's modulus and glass transition temperature were only affected to a limited extent by the addition of the HBP-additive. The toughest epoxy blend (critical stress intensity factor of about 1.6 MPam(to the power of)0.5) was achieved by the incorporation of 60% w/w inorganic silica particles. The application of hybrid concepts by utilizing synergistic toughening mechanisms (HBP and silica), revealed only moderate benefits within the investigated highly crosslinked materials.  As the examined epoxy/anhydride formulations are generally considered for high temperature applications, it was essential to determine their long-term thermooxidative ageing performance. The long-term thermo-oxidative ageing behaviour has been investigated by means of thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic  mechanical analysis (DMA) and vibrational infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) methods with special emphasis on fundamental understanding of the ageing mechanism. Effects of the thermal ageing on the characteristic viscoelastic and flexural behaviour, weight-loss and oxidation susceptibility of the examined epoxy networks were assessed and discussed, thus providing an understanding of the principal material endurance properties. The thermo-mechanical behaviour and the related structural changes with thermal ageing were examined by Cole-Cole plots in combination with a molecular theory previously developed by Perez. It was demonstrated that this new methodology provides a connection between conversion, glass transition temperature, and mechanical relaxation data and allows a fundamental molecular interpretation with respect to physical and chemical ageing phenomena. A variety of thermo-gravimetric experiments were carried out in order to determine and model the specific weight-loss profile as a function of anhydride nature and ageing temperature. The influence of different inorganic fillers on the thermooxidative response was systematically studied. Different models were applied to extract meaningful kinetic parameters in order to describe the thermo-oxidative degradation and to facilitate an extrapolation of weight-loss data outside the experimental time- and temperature-scale.    FT-IR micro ATR-spectroscopy was used to identify, localize and quantify the  complex oxidation behaviour. A thermo-oxidative degradation mechanism, that  involved predominantly radical oxidation processes and C-N as well as C-O chain  scissions, was proposed to account for the experimental observations. Specific  oxidation-front profiles were constructed to describe the heterogeneous oxidation  processes.    Finally, the comprehensive material characterization of these novel co-anhydridecured  amino-glycidyl resins in terms of curing mechanism and kinetic, deformation  and fracture behaviour, and thermo-oxidative ageing performance, allows the assessment of the potential of these materials for demanding applications in electrical and electronic industries.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epoxy Resins</field><field name="subject">Co-Anhydride</field><field name="subject">hexahydrophthalic</field><field name="subject">calorimetry</field><field name="subject">polymers</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15977/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memories are not silence: the trauma of witnessing and art making.

This design procedure is unable to trace the full range of load-deflection response and hence the failure modes of the frame structures can not be accurately predicted. In recent years, the development of advanced analysis methods has aimed at solving this problem by combining the analysis and design tasks into one step. Application of the new advanced analysis methods permits a comprehensive assessment of the actual  failure modes and ultimate strengths of structural steel systems in practical design  situations. One of the advanced analysis methods, the refined plastic hinge method, has shown great potential to become a practical design tool. However, at present, it is only suitable for a special class of steel frame structures that is not subject to lateral  torsional buckling effects. The refined plastic hinge analysis can directly account for three types of frame failures, gradual formation of plastic hinges, column buckling and local buckling. However, this precludes most of the steel frame structures whose behaviour is governed by lateral torsional buckling. Therefore, the aim of this research is to develop a practical advanced analysis method suitable for general steel frame structures including the effects of lateral-torsional buckling.    Lateral torsional buckling is a complex three dimensional instability phenomenon. Unlike the in-plane buckling of beam-columns, a closed form analytical solution is not available for lateral torsional buckling. The member capacity equations used in design specifications are derived mainly from testing of simply supported beams. Further, there has been very limited research into the behaviour and design of steel  frame structures subject to lateral torsional buckling failures. Therefore in order to  incorporate lateral torsional buckling effects into an advanced analysis method, a detailed study must be carried out including inelastic beam buckling failures.    This thesis contains a detailed description of research on extending the scope of advanced analysis by developing methods that include the effects of lateral torsional buckling in a nonlinear analysis formulation. It has two components. Firstly, distributed plasticity models were developed using the state-of-the-art finite element analysis programs for a range of simply supported beams and rigid frame structures to investigate and fully understand their lateral torsional buckling behavioural  characteristics. Nonlinear analyses were conducted to study the load-deflection response of these structures under lateral torsional buckling influences. It was found that the behaviour of simply supported beams and members in rigid frame structures is significantly different. In real frame structures, the connection details are a decisive factor in terms of ultimate frame capacities. Accounting for the connection rigidities in a simplified advanced analysis method is very difficult, but is most critical. Generally, the finite element analysis results of simply supported beams agree very well with the predictions of the current Australian steel structures design code AS4100, but the capacities of rigid frame structures can be significantly higher compared with Australian code predictions.    The second part of the thesis concerns the development of a two dimensional refined plastic hinge analysis which is capable of considering lateral torsional buckling effects. The formulation of the new method is based on the observations from the distributed plasticity analyses of both simply supported beams and rigid frame structures. The lateral torsional buckling effects are taken into account implicitly using a flexural stiffness reduction factor in the stiffness matrix formulation based on the member capacities specified by AS4100. Due to the lack of suitable alternatives, concepts of moment modification and effective length factors are still used for determining the member capacities. The effects of connection rigidities and restraints from adjacent members are handled by using appropriate effective length factors in the analysis. Compared with the benchmark solutions for simply supported beams, the new refined plastic hinge analysis is very accurate. For rigid frame structures, the new method is generally more conservative than the finite element models. The accuracy of the new method relies on the user's judgement of beam segment restraints. Overall, the design capacities in the new method are superior to those in the current design procedure, especially for frame structures with less slender members.    The new refined plastic hinge analysis is now able to capture four types of failure modes, plastic hinge formation, column buckling, local buckling and lateral torsional buckling. With the inclusion of lateral torsional buckling mode as proposed in this thesis, advanced analysis is one step closer to being used for general design practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lateral torsional buckling</field><field name="subject">Steel I-section</field><field name="subject">Rigid frame</field><field name="subject">Advanced analysis</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear analysis</field><field name="subject">Steel frame design</field><field name="subject">Ultimate Capacity</field><field name="subject">Structural Stability</field><field name="subject">load-deflection response</field><field name="subject">and Finite element analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15980/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Framing dialogues- Towards an understanding of the Parergon in theatre.</field><field name="creator">Little, Suzanne Ruth</field><field name="description">This project argues for an elevation and a greater understanding of the importance of framing in theatre. In this respect, the study follows on from Derrida's famous deconstruction of Kant's parergon (frame) in his Critique of  Judgement. Derrida's work exposes what he sees as a complicit desire to &amp;qout;limit" the frame to the role of "decorative adjunct". Finding the frame to be  "undecidable", Derrida asserts that the frame actively affects the work inside  and the space outside while answering a "lack" within the work. Utilising Derrida's work on the parergon as a starting point, this study represents an attempt to formulate a theory of the frame for theatre asserting that the frame provides a prospective key towards understanding persistent "problems" within theatre studies. These include the complicated onstage/offstage and spectator/actor dialectics as well as the point where "reality" ends and theatre begins and also issues of agreed interpretation.  Ultimately the thesis posits that theatre is in itself a parergon which virtualises the space in which it installs itself - a finding that goes some way to explaining and/or accommodating these "problems".    The research methodology involves a detailed study of literature encompassing framing and related theories drawn from a diverse array of  paradigms. A working theory of the theatre frame, along with a series of analogous approaches is developed and further examined through application to a variety of theatre performances. This thesis offers a theory of  the theatre frame and a variety of framing research approaches that function to bridge the gap between the traditionally partitioned areas of performance analysis and reception studies. It also adds to our understanding of the frame  and the theatre art form itself.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">audience</field><field name="subject">conceptual</field><field name="subject">framework</field><field name="subject">differance</field><field name="subject">director</field><field name="subject">frame</field><field name="subject">framing</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">parergon</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">practitioner</field><field name="subject">reception</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">supplement</field><field name="subject">theatre</field><field name="subject">trace</field><field name="subject">undecidability</field><field name="subject">virtuality</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15981/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovation diffusion in state owned health: a study of IT adoption</field><field name="creator">England, Ian William</field><field name="description">The health industry has acquired a reputation as lagging in the use of information technology (IT).  Therefore, this study has been undertaken to assess state health's use of IT and then to assess the causal factors of the differing usage rate, if any.  The state health industry was compared to the banking industry as a benchmark, on the basis that the banking industry is widely perceived as a leading IT user. A literature review summarised and critiqued current literature and informed the subsequent research.  The research comprised two related studies.  The first study was a qualitative study of the beliefs of senior state health executives.  The second study was based upon a survey of state health and banking managers.  The research confirmed that in these two 'knowledge' industries, state health is slower to adopt IT with an apparent lower maturity level.  This finding was observed across a range of best-practice management, procedural and cultural topics as well as the level of resources applied to IT.  Innovation-diffusion-theory helped understand why IT implementation has progressed at a slower rate in state health than other industry sectors.  The complexity of state health organisations and their fragmented internal structure constrain their ability to adopt traditional, hierarchical, organisation-wide IT.  This is further impacted upon by the relative immaturity of clinical health IT, which is complicated, incomplete and unable to show quantifiable benefits.  In addition, elements of the findings suggest that health IT departments are poorly aligned to the needs of clinicians and managers.  Both organisational and technological factors lead to the slow adoption of health IT, although measures suggest that the key factors relate to the unique organisational nature of state health.  The recommendations for health and IT policy arising from this research are:    *	The effectiveness of state health IT departments needs comparing to those in other sectors and improvement interventions implemented;  *	The strongest way for state health IT to proceed is to focus on management and social issues in preference to the ever-seductive technology.  Research and development funds should be allocated, as a priority, to benefits-analysis methods, improved understanding of the true nature of health organisations (formal and informal) and a rich understanding of clinical behaviours and work.  Deeper knowledge in all of these areas will permit the development of more relevant IT leading to greater value, more focussed implementation and new areas for business development in the IT industry.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Innovation Diffusion</field><field name="subject">Innovation Adoption</field><field name="subject">Innovation Diffusion Theory</field><field name="subject">IT</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Hospital</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">IT</field><field name="subject">Information Technology</field><field name="subject">IT Maturity</field><field name="subject">Banking</field><field name="subject">Organisational Development</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15982/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information technology investment evaluation and measurement (ITIEM) methodology: A case study and action research of the dimensions and measures of IT - business -value in financial institutions.</field><field name="creator">Nel, Johan Floris</field><field name="description">This study was motivated by the researcher's, as well as his superior's, concern that a  fundamental area of business, information technology investment and evaluation, continues to be problematic for many organisations.

Time-Frequency Signal Processing (TFSP) provides eective tools  for analyzing nonstationary signals where the frequency content of signals varies in time as well as for analyzing linear time-varying systems. This research aimed at exploiting the advantages of TFSP, in dealing with   nonstationary signals, into the fundamental issues of signal processing, namely the signal estimation and signal separation. In particular, it has investigated the problems of (i) the Instantaneous Frequency (IF) estimation of Linear Frequency-Modulated (LFM) signals corrupted in complex-valued zero-mean Multiplicative Noise (MN), and (ii) the Underdetermined Blind Source Separation (UBSS) of LFM signals, while focusing onto the fast-growing area of Wireless Communications (WCom).  A common problem in the issue of signal estimation is the estimation of the frequency of Frequency-Modulated signals which are seen in many engineering and real-life applications. Accurate frequency estimation leads to accurate recovery of the true information. In some applications, the random amplitude modulation  shows up when the medium is dispersive and/or when the assumption of point target is not valid; the original signal is considered to be corrupted by an MN process thus seriously aecting the recovery of the information-bearing frequency. The IF estimation of nonstationary signals corrupted by complex-valued zero-mean MN  was investigated in this research. We have proposed a Second-Order Statistics approach,  rather than a Higher-Order Statistics approach, for IF estimation using Time-Frequency Distributions (TFDs). The main assumption was that the autocorrelation function of the MN is real-valued but not necessarily positive (i.e. the spectrum of the MN is symmetric but does not necessary has the highest peak at zero frequency). The estimation performance was analyzed in terms of bias and variance, and compared between four dierent TFDs: Wigner-Ville Distribution, Spectrogram, Choi-Williams Distribution and Modified B Distribution. To further improve the estimation, we proposed to use the Multiple Signal Classification algorithm  and showed its better performance. It was shown that the Modified B Distribution performance was the best for Signal-to-Noise Ratio less than 10dB.    In the issue of signal separation, a new research direction called Blind Source Separation (BSS) has emerged over the last decade. BSS is a fundamental technique in array signal processing aiming at recovering unobserved signals or sources from observed mixtures exploiting only the assumption of mutual independence between the signals. The term "blind" indicates that neither the structure of the mixtures nor the source signals are known to the receivers. Applications of BSS are seen in, for example, radar and sonar, communications, speech processing, biomedical signal processing. In the case of nonstationary signals, a TF structure forcing  approach was introduced by Belouchrani and Amin by defining the Spatial Time- Frequency Distribution (STFD), which combines both TF diversity and spatial diversity. The benefit of STFD in an environment of nonstationary signals is the direct exploitation of the information brought by the nonstationarity of the signals.  A drawback of most BSS algorithms is that they fail to separate sources in situations where there are more sources than sensors, referred to as UBSS. The UBSS of nonstationary signals was investigated in this research. We have presented a new approach for blind separation of nonstationary sources using their TFDs. The  separation algorithm is based on a vector clustering procedure that estimates the  source TFDs by grouping together the TF points corresponding to "closely spaced"  spatial directions. Simulations illustrate the performances of the proposed method for the underdetermined blind separation of FM signals. The method developed in this research represents a new research direction for solving the UBSS problem.  The successful results obtained in the research development of the above two problems has led to a conclusion that TFSP is useful for WCom. Future research directions were also proposed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="subject">wireless mobile communications</field><field name="subject">time -frequency distribution</field><field name="subject">nonstatonary signal</field><field name="subject">linear frequency - modulation</field><field name="subject">multiplicative noise(random amplitude modulation)</field><field name="subject">instantaneous frequency estimation</field><field name="subject">time - frequency distribution</field><field name="subject">reduced - inteference distribution</field><field name="subject">array processing</field><field name="subject">underdetermined blind source separation</field><field name="subject">instantaneous linear mixture</field><field name="subject">spatial time - frequency distribution</field><field name="subject">vector clustering</field><field name="subject">rayleigh fading</field><field name="subject">narrowband fading channel</field><field name="subject">wideband fading channel</field><field name="subject">linear time - varying channel</field><field name="subject">wide - sense stationary uncorrelated scattering</field><field name="subject">scattering function</field><field name="subject">estimation</field><field name="subject">separation</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15984/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimation of a class of nonlinear time series models.</field><field name="creator">Sando, Simon Andrew</field><field name="description">The estimation and analysis of signals that have polynomial phase and constant or time-varying amplitudes with the addititve noise is considered in this dissertation.Much work has been undertaken on this problem over the last decade or so, and there are a number of estimation schemes available. The fundamental problem when trying to estimate the parameters of these type of signals is the nonlinear characterstics of the signal, which lead to computationally difficulties when applying standard techniques such as maximum likelihood and least squares. When considering only the phase data, we also encounter the well known problem of the unobservability of the true noise phase curve.  The methods that are currently most popular involve differencing in phase followed by regression, or nonlinear transformations. Although these methods perform quite well at high signal to noise ratios, their performance worsens at low signal to noise, and there may be significant bias. One of the biggest problems to efficient estimation of these models is that the majority of methods rely on sequential estimation of the phase coefficients, in that the highest-order parameter is estimated first, its contribution removed via demodulation, and the same procedure applied to estimation of the next parameter and so on. This is clearly an issue in that errors in estimation of high order parameters affect the ability to estimate the lower order parameters correctly. As a result, stastical analysis of the parameters is also difficult.  In thie dissertation, we aim to circumvent the issues of bias and sequential estiamtion by considering the issue of full parameter iterative refinement techniques. ie. given a possibly biased initial estimate of the phase coefficients, we aim to create computationally efficient iterative refinement techniques to produce stastically efficient estimators at low signal to noise ratios. Updating will be done in a multivariable manner to remove inaccuracies and biases due to sequential procedures.  Stastical analysis and extensive simulations attest to the performance of the schemes that are presented, which include likelihood, least squares and bayesian estimation schemes. Other results of importance to the full estimatin problem, namely when there is error in the time variable, the amplitude is not constant, and when the model order is not known, are also condsidered.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nonlinear time series models</field><field name="subject">nonlinear transformations</field><field name="subject">true noise phase curve</field><field name="subject">parameter iterative refinement</field><field name="subject">iterative refinement techniques</field><field name="subject">regression</field><field name="subject">time-varying amplitudes</field><field name="subject">polynomial phase</field><field name="subject">additive noise</field><field name="subject">estimation and analysis</field><field name="subject">estimation and analysis of nonlinear time series models</field><field name="subject">high signal to noise ratios</field><field name="subject">low signal to noise ratios</field><field name="subject">efficient estimations</field><field name="subject">sequential estimations</field><field name="subject">demodulatin</field><field name="subject">highest order parameter</field><field name="subject">phase coefficients</field><field name="subject">stastitical analysis</field><field name="subject">bayesian estimation.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15985/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the relationship between market values and accounting numbers of firms listed in an emerging market.</field><field name="creator">Suwardi, Eko</field><field name="description">Studies of the relationship between market values and accounting numbers have long been a part of an established theme in capital markets research (CMR). These studies have taken various forms, most being conducted on a cross sectional basis, tied closely with the assumptions of equilibrium behaviour and efficient markets.  Explanatory variables for market value have been dominated by firm-specific variables without incorporating macroeconomic variables. Recently, however, some studies have employed macroeconomic variables and dynamic  specification in assessing the relationship between market values and accounting numbers (e.g. Bilson et al. 2001, Nissim and Penman, 2003, and Willett, 2003).  The objective of this thesis is to investigate the nature of the relationship between share prices and accounting numbers on the Jakarta Stock Exchange for the period 1992-2002, using dynamic modelling principles in addition to the more usual cross sectional analysis. The approach to regression modelling (general-to-specific strategy)incorporated in this thesis relies less heavily than most CMR on prior economic theories of equilibrium behaviour. Apart from these novel aspects of approach and  method, the study also provides valuable information about the emerging financial  markets of Indonesia. The results of this thesis show that cointegration and the accompanying equilibrium  correction relationship between market and book values for firms listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) can often be identified using accounting and macroeconomic regressors. The models are typically more informative, plausible and consistent than cross sectional models and are useful in interpreting the context in which the market to book relationship exists in Indonesia. A possibly surprising result is that in Indonesia, compared to similar models estimated using US data, the book value of net assets seems to have a stronger relationship with market value. This may be a function of the  relative importance of financial statements as a source of information on the JSX.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">capital market research</field><field name="subject">value relevance</field><field name="subject">fundamentals</field><field name="subject">time series anaylsis</field><field name="subject">cointegration</field><field name="subject">error correction models</field><field name="subject">indonesian financial market</field><field name="subject">emerging markets</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15986/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A future for community radio in Australia: Funding, licensing and legislative issues.</field><field name="creator">El -Ghul, Saba</field><field name="description">The community radio sector is an important cultural resource for the Australian community.

This study argues that there is no inherent conflict between entrepreneurial principles and not-for-profit principles, and as long as all revenue is invested back into the station, then there should be no limit on income generation for  community radio.

Several researchers have identified ways to study how information on health related topics is communicated to the community. While research is limited on the sources, search approaches and conditions associated with obtaining reliable information on health issues and topics, there is extensive literature on the important aspects of communication processes that impact on the unique, and at times complex, environment within which health consumer research occurs. This research project has enabled a review of the interpersonal and noninterpersonal communication modes to understand a range of issues that impact on the community member as the receiver of messages on health issues and topics. A qualitative and quantitative research approach has been utilised in original research to examine a number of issues associated with where community members in Australia turn to find information on health related topics.    The study involves the comparison of a number of communication and information gathering approaches and expectations with a picture of  information source experiences.

Furthermore, the challenge of coping with the potential constraints and opportunities of public opinion as an aspect of the organisational environment is essential to contemporary public relations practice.  While the term "public opinion environment" appears intermittently in scholarly and trade publications, the dimensions and characteristics of this aspect of organisational environments remain largely unspecified.  This thesis explores two challenges--the first is to conceptualise and measure variation in an important aspect of contemporary organisational environments, the public opinion environment, and the second is to investigate the influence of that environment on the critical and often highly exposed relationships between organisations and activist publics.  In suggesting a relationship between variation in the environment and the evolutionary pathways of organisational relationships, the perspective underpinning this thesis is both ecological and evolutionary.  Ecological analyses of organisations assume that members of a population are affected similarly by environmental change and share a common dependence on the material and social environment.  Consistent with this perspective, this thesis explores the public opinion environment and the organisation-activist relationships therein longitudinally at the population level of analysis.  The focal organisational population is Australia's major banks, and the period of interest extends from 1981 to 2001.  An evolutionary model of organisation-activist relationships (EOAR) is developed, and the propositions derived from this model are explored using a comparative case study approach.  These propositions anticipate and specify associations between variations in dimensions of the public opinion environment of an organisational population and the evolution of organisation-activist relationships in the population.  Central to understanding the public opinion environment of an organisational population are the issues around which activist publics organise, public opinion develops, and organisation-activist relationships emerge.  Then, the public opinion environment is conceptualised as a set of issues that concern Australia's major banks and their publics. Variations in this "issue set," are described using four dimensions: stability (turnover of issues), complexity (the number of issues in the issue set), intensity (volume of media coverage), and direction (favourability of media coverage for the focal population).  To explore the propositions of the EOAR model, I have analysed the variations in these four dimensions in relation to the evolution of organisation-activist relationships.  To observe and describe this evolution, I have located the state of these relationships on a conflict continuum using relationship-signalling statements made by organisations and activists and published by the media.  Three cases studies from the same organisational population, Australia's major banks, are compared over three different but consecutive seven-year periods from 1981 to 2001.  The case studies involved the extensive review of industry reports, submissions and other documents from several government inquiries, and scholarly articles, as well as the content analysis of more than 6, 500 newspaper articles published during each of the three case study periods.   The findings of this comparative case study suggest that variations in some dimensions of the public opinion environment of an organisational population are associated with the evolutionary ecology of organisation-activist relationships in that population.  However, the associations are more complex than was anticipated by the original propositions of the EOAR model; thus refinements to the model are advanced for further investigation.  A primary contribution of this study is that it provides the theoretical apparatus and tools to systematically explore, interpret, and measure variation in the issues comprising the public opinion environment and to track the evolving organisation-activist relationships organised around those issues.  Because the population level of analysis and a longitudinal lens are applied, this conceptualisation of the public opinion environment effectively captures and specifies the overlapping and persistent nature of issues.  The evidence of this study suggests that when issues have emerged in the public opinion environment at the population level of analysis, they are likely to persist as a hub around which publics organise, providing a focus for discussions and debates for years to come.  This persistence, "issue-set inertia," has important implications for organisational relationships.  Given these conditions, organisations can monitor and manage their responses to issues.  However, it is na&#239;vely optimistic at best to accept the contention of issues management consultants and other pundits that organisations can manage the issues themselves.  Furthermore, the findings of this study call into question the value of advice that encourages organisations to deal with issues by seeking to avoid engaging with their activist publics and by downplaying the issues in the media.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public opinion environment</field><field name="subject">organisation-activist relationships</field><field name="subject">issues management</field><field name="subject">public relations</field><field name="subject">relationship management</field><field name="subject">organisational population</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15989/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and improvement of the nonlinear iterative techniques for groundwater flow modelling utilising MODFLOW</field><field name="creator">Durick, Andrew Michael</field><field name="description">As groundwater models are being used increasingly in the area of resource allocation, there has been an increase in the level of complexity in an attempt to capture heterogeneity, complex geometries and detail in interaction between the model domain and the outside hydraulic influences. As models strive to represent the real world in ever increasing detail, there is a strong likelihood that the boundary conditions will become nonlinear.  Nonlinearities exist in the groundwater flow equation even in simple models when watertable (unconfined) conditions are simulated. This thesis is concerned with how these nonlinearities are treated numerically, with particular focus on the MODFLOW groundwater flow software and the nonlinear nature of the unconfined condition simulation.    One of the limitations of MODFLOW is that it employs a first order fixed point iterative scheme to linearise the nonlinear system that arises as a result of the finite difference discretisation process, which is well known to offer slow convergence rates for highly nonlinear problems. However, Newton's method can achieve quadratic convergence and is more effective at dealing with higher levels of nonlinearity. Consequently, the main objective of this research is to investigate the inclusion of Newton's method to the suite of computational tools in MODFLOW to enhance its flexibility in dealing with the increasing complexity of real world problems, as well as providing a more competitive and efficient solution methodology. Furthermore, the underpinning linear iterative solvers that MODFLOW currently utilises are targeted at symmetric systems and a consequence  of using Newton's method would be the requirement to solve non-symmetric Jacobian systems. Therefore, another important aspect of this work is to investigate linear iterative solution techniques that handle such systems, including the newer Krylov style solvers GMRES and BiCGSTAB. To achieve these objectives a number of simple benchmark problems involving nonlinearities through the simulation of unconfined conditions were established to compare the computational performance of the existing MODFLOW solvers to the new solution strategies investigated here. One of the highlights of these comparisons was that Newton's method when combined with an  appropriately preconditioned Krylov solver was on average greater than 40% more CPU time efficient than the Picard based solution techniques. Furthermore, a significant amount of this time saving came from the reduction in the number of nonlinear iterations due to the quadratic nature of Newton's method. It was also found that Newton's method benefited more from improved initial conditions than Picard's method. Of all the linear iterative solvers tested, GMRES required the least amount of  computational effort. While the Newton method involves more complexity in its implementation, this should not be interpreted as prohibitive in its application. The results here show that the extra work does result in performance increase, and thus the effort is certainly worth it.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MODFLOW</field><field name="subject">GMRES</field><field name="subject">BiCGSTAB</field><field name="subject">picard</field><field name="subject">Newton's method</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15990/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mein Kodak  Avant-Garde Photography in 1920s Germany</field><field name="creator">Simmonds, Toni Mia</field><field name="description">This study examines some of the fundamental principles of a number of influential photographers working in Germany in the 1920s and assesses the ways they understood the world through their camera's lens.

The unique quality of the photographic image's verisimilitude of nature was an important phenomenon in this re-evaluation, as it led to assumptions about the capacity of photography to reveal the truth of reality.

These collections often contain high-quality, structured information that cannot be  crawled using traditional methods. An important problem is selecting which of these collections to search. Automatic collection selection methods try to solve this problem by suggesting the best subset of deep web collections to search based on a query.    A few methods for deep Web collection selection have proposed in Collection Retrieval Inference Network system and Glossary of Servers Server system.    The drawback in these methods is that they require communication between the search broker and the collections, and need metadata about each collection.    This thesis compares three different sampling methods that do not require communication  with the broker or metadata about each collection. It also transforms some traditional information retrieval based techniques to this area. In addition, the thesis tests these techniques using INEX collection for total 18 collections (including 12232 XML documents) and total 36 queries.

The metric for such response in common use is the NHTSA linear stiffness parameter. This parameter is used to show that stiffness increases with vehicle mass in a demographic setting. However, by comparing vehicle mass trends over 28 years of crash testing with similar trends in stiffness, a mass influence in the stiffness increase is implicated. This influence is supported by the introduction of a mass-independent stiffness metric, called reluctance, which shows a lesser increase in mass-independent stiffness over the 28 years. The idea that stiffness should increase with vehicle mass runs counter to intuition and is tested by comparing two identical vehicles in crash tests where one of the vehicles carries an extra 555kg. The idea is further tested by simulation using a multiple mass-spring model on  vehicles, varying mass and impact velocity. Using the reluctance stiffness metric it was  concluded that increased vehicle mass decreases stiffness, confirming intuition.    Using the injury risk metric of contact velocity differential between occupant and interior of  the vehicle it is shown that increased vehicle mass reduces injury. This has important implications for the industry where a marginal performer in a compliance crash test needs  only to increase production vehicle mass to reduce injury levels to the statutory injury  reference values. A fleet study presents evidence of increasing average vehicle mass.    The study observes that blunt injury generally commences prior to vehicle rebound and continues well into rebound. Recognizing vehicle rebound to be influential in almost all blunt injury led to analysis of the fleet for improvement to this injury parameter. Using specific energy absorption as criterion, 18 modern cars were compared with 19 cars 15-17 years older at compliance test velocities. No improvement was discerned. Similarly, two baskets of cars (n=41 modern &amp; n=32 older) tested at NCAP speeds separated by nominally 20 years failed to show improvement in rebound velocity. The implications for this study of the rebound findings was to ensure that the model presented was capable of representing injury into the rebound phase of the crash. To assist in this, a rebound formulation to reflect varying initial velocity was determined to be a linear function, studying 7 models of vehicles involved in 20 crashes at nominally 40, 48 &amp; 56 km/h crash speeds.    Occupant position within a vehicle is identified as an important variable in injury determination. Vehicle crash tests require seating positions to be set to mid-track adjustment. This discriminates against vehicles having more "legroom" while appearing to be fair, using seating adjustment as the determinant. An empirical mathematical model is  proposed permitting crash test results to be extended to investigate the effects of varying  occupant positions thus eliminating the legroom anomaly. In addition to the varying occupant position facility, the mathematical model can easily accommodate changes in vehicle mass and varying impact velocity showing fidelity with test data.    The model is used to show that injury risk in the National Fleet has not improved over an  18-year period of crash testing.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NHTSA</field><field name="subject">NCAP</field><field name="subject">vehicles</field><field name="subject">velocity</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">mass</field><field name="subject">trends</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15993/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oleander : the writing of the contemporary supernatural drama</field><field name="creator">Van Poppel, Elisabeth Wilhelmina</field><field name="description">Oleander is a screenplay and exegesis that explores how the supernatural drama contributes to a deeper understanding of contemporary feature writing.

The thesis argues that the supernatural drama also calls for the logical treatment of the supernatural element, its managed concealment and its step by step revelation as part of the story development.

 Government renewed its support for the short feature in the 1990s viewing it as a development model for writers, directors and producers making the transition  from short form drama to feature length production. While there is no doubt  that the short feature model provides invaluable 'experience through practice'  for writers, directors and producers, a lack of market demand, its continued  dependence on government funding and the mixed development outcomes of  those it supports suggests that the future of the short feature remains unclear. This thesis also includes School Friends, a 50-minute screenplay designed specifically 
 
 to suit the parameters of short feature production. It is a redemption story about a

This has led to considerable research being carried out on energy  absorbers, devices designed to dissipate energy during an impact event and hence  protect the structure under consideration. Energy absorbers have found common  usage in applications such as vehicles, aircraft, highway barriers and at the base of  lift shafts. A type of energy absorber which has received relatively limited attention  in the open literature is the tapered rectangular tube. Such a structure is essentially a  tube with a rectangular cross-section in which one or more of the sides are inclined to  the tube's longitudinal axis.    The aim of this thesis was to analyse the impact and energy absorption response of  tapered and non-tapered (straight) rectangular tubes. The energy absorption response  was quantified for both axial and oblique loading, representative of the loading  conditions typically encountered in impact applications. Since energy absorbers are  commonly used as components in energy absorbing systems, the response of such a  system was analysed which contained either straight or tapered rectangular tubes as  the energy absorbing components. This system could typically be used as the front  bumper system of a vehicle.    Detailed finite element models, validated using experiments and existing theoretical  and numerical models, were used to assess the energy absorption response and  deformation modes of straight and tapered tubes under the various loading  conditions. The manner in which a thin-walled tube deforms is important since it  governs its energy absorption response.    The results show that the energy absorption response of straight and tapered  rectangular tubes can be controlled using their various geometry parameters. In  particular, the wall thickness, taper angle and the number of tapered sides can be  effectively used as parameters to control the amount of absorbed energy. Tapered  rectangular tubes display less sensitivity to inertia effects compared with straight rectangular tubes under impact loading. This is beneficial when the higher crush  loads associated with inertia effects need to be reduced. Furthermore, though the  energy absorption capacity of thin-walled rectangular tubes diminishes under oblique  impact loading, the capacity is more maintained for tapered rectangular tubes  compared with non-tapered rectangular tubes.    Overall, the results highlight the advantages of using tapered rectangular tubes for  absorbing impact energy under axial and oblique loading conditions. Understanding  is gained as to how the geometry parameters of such structures can be used to control  the absorbed energy. The thesis uses this knowledge to develop design guidelines for  the use of straight and tapered rectangular tubes in energy absorbing systems such as  for crashworthiness applications. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of  analysing thin-walled energy absorbers as part of an energy absorbing system, since  the response of the absorbers may be different to when they are treated on their own.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tapered Tubes</field><field name="subject">Energy Absorption</field><field name="subject">Axial</field><field name="subject">Oblique Impact</field><field name="subject">Finite Element Analysis</field><field name="subject">Computer Simulation</field><field name="subject">Crashworthiness</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15997/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trace metal geochemistry and weathering mineralogy in a quaternary coastal plain, Bells Creek catchment, Pumicestone Passage, Southeast Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Liaghati, Tania</field><field name="description">The Bells Creek catchment covers an area of 100 km2 in the northern part of the Pumicestone Passage region of southeast Queensland. This catchment is an example of a low-lying sub-tropical coastal plain including both freshwater and estuarine settings. The main creeks drain into Pumicestone Passage, a large shallow estuary, which is a declared marine habitat and a Ramsar listed wading bird location. The Bells Creek catchment has undergone land-use change from bushland to grazing to pine plantations and is now coming under pressure for urban development. Quaternary age unconsolidated sediments are the dominant surface material in this area and formed during the last marine transgression. Of significance for such a setting is that estuarine sediments can retain metals mobilised as a result of natural processes (e.g. weathering) and anthropogenic activities (e.g. land-use disturbance). As trace metals can also occur naturally in rocks and their weathered products, it is of value to clearly distinguish natural and anthropogenic controls over metal source, distribution and mobility. To achieve this aim two approaches were taken: 1) to determine the factors controlling the geochemistry of weathered profiles, unconsolidated sediments, soils and natural waters, and 2) to identify the most effective analytical and numerical methods for evaluating metal concentration in different solid materials. This investigation is structured around four linked papers. The influence of mineralogy, geological setting, location of water table and depth of burial on the geochemistry of weathered profile are assessed in Paper 1. The second paper is an investigation of different analytical approaches for studying weathered sedimentary rocks, as well as the testing of several numerical methods for evaluating geochemical data from weathered profiles. In paper 3, a large heterogeneous geochemical data set including trace metals, total organic carbon and sulfur content, in addition to mineralogy and land use practices are integrated to enable evaluation of geochemical and anthropogenic processes controlling metal distribution. The fourth paper considers the distribution of iron and its transport as well as variations in size and morphology of different forms of framboidal pyrite within a smaller sub-catchment in the southern part of the study area. The labile and heterogeneous nature of the bedrock of the region, the Landsborough Sandstone, along with the sub-tropical climate of the area have resulted in weathering profiles up to 26 m deep. Due to the absence of industrial activity in the Bells Creek catchment, such weathering of the bedrock constitutes the major process governing metal distribution throughout the area. Analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that the primary minerals occurring in the weathered profiles are quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspars while kaolinite is the most dominant secondary mineral present. Overall, parent rock silicates have been extensively replaced by clay minerals and Fe oxides. The relative influence of mineralogy, geological setting and groundwater over chemical weathering and geochemical cycling of metals can be summarised as follows: Mineralogy&gt;geological setting&gt;watertable position&gt;depth of profile burial As the relationship between the total metal composition and the extractable and mobile component has environmental significance, a comparison was made between these forms of metals in weathered material. This comparison shows that metals such as V, Cr and Fe are part of the aluminosilicate matrix and remain largely in primary mineral structures. The retention of these metals may lead to their future release to the environment during on-going weathering. Other elements such as Cu, Zn, Pb, however, are found to be primarily adsorbed to sediment particles and therefore, easily releasable to the environment. As limited information on weathering of sedimentary rocks is reported in the literature, a variety of chemical analysis and numerical assessment methods were used to understand the geochemical processes involved in trace metal mobility in the weathered profiles. Two analytical methods of digestion, hydrofluoric acid and x-ray fluorescence were tested and found to be highly comparable except for refractory elements such as V and Cr. Among the numerical methods applied to the dataset were "chemical and mineralogical indices", "weight loss factor"  and "immobile element approach". The "immobile element approach"  was found to be the most appropriate method to characterise the weathering profiles typical of the catchment. This method considers a weathering system to be open and transforms the absolute values of trace metals enabling a quantitative evaluation of metal mobility. The following sequence of mobility was determined after applying this method to the data generated in this study: Zn&gt;Pb&gt;Cu&gt;Cr&gt;V The above sequence of mobility is supported by the comparison between extractable and total metal concentrations where Cr and V were identified as being part of aluminosilicate matrix and less mobile. On the other hand, Zn, Pb and Cu were found to exist in adsorbed form and to be readily released to the environment. Trace elements released through weathering and erosion of the bedrock can accumulate in estuarine and coastal sediments. Therefore, both the lateral and vertical distribution of trace metals within sediments and soils of Bells Creek catchment were investigated. Natural and anthropogenic factors controlling metal distribution were compared and it was concluded that the natural sediment character such as its mineral content is more significant than anthropogenic influences in controlling lateral and vertical metal distribution. Further, due to varying degrees of weathering and the heterogeneous nature of soils and sediments, the data were normalised. After testing several methods, it was concluded that calculation of an enrichment factor was the most appropriate. The enrichment factor revealed that elevated trace metal concentrations at some sites are due to bedrock weathering. Due to the environmental persistence of iron, excess of this common metal has always been of environmental concern in many coastal settings. In the small Halls Creek sub-catchment, for example, iron anomalies were detected in bottom sediments (Fe up to 14%). This finding has significance in the area, as iron has been identified as one of the major contributors in the growth of the toxic cyanobacteria "Lyngbya majuscula"  which can negatively impact on aquatic fauna. Iron concentrations were also shown to be high in natural stream waters of this coastal zone (up to 16 mg/L); in the bottom sediments of the creek, iron occurs as hematite (freshwater section) or pyrite (estuarine section). A variety of pyrite morphologies were identified in both bottom sediments and particulate matter samples including spherical closely packed framboids, and the rare form of euhedra which indicates slow crystallisation. The different components of this investigation have: 1) established the order and extent to which natural factors control weathering, 2) tested a number of analytical and numerical methods in evaluating weathering profiles, 3) assessed natural and anthropogenic factors and established the mobility sequence for trace metals in weathered profiles and, 4) determined the iron mineral speciation and established morphological variations of pyrite. As the area of Bells Creek catchment will be under development pressure in the future, findings of this study represent a baseline of comparison for environmental assessment and are of importance for environmental management.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">trace metals</field><field name="subject">mineralogy</field><field name="subject">geological setting</field><field name="subject">weathering</field><field name="subject">Bells Creek catchment</field><field name="subject">Pumicestone Passage</field><field name="subject">southeast Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15998/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thespioprudence : Australian film directors and  Film performance</field><field name="creator">Nugent-Williams, Rosalind Louise</field><field name="description">"...we, directors and actors, put into practice the practice - we don't practice the theory.  I think that if there is no theory of acting, at least there are theoretical laws that we may find, curiously enough, in all traditions of acting.  It is true that the term "theory of acting" does not seem fundamentally wrong, but it seems always somewhat imperialistic and pretentious.  I prefer to use fundamental laws which we sometimes know but then sometimes lose and forget.  It is only practice that all of a sudden can make law or tradition rise to the surface.  I will not say then that there is no theory of acting; on the contrary, there have been many of them.

Schneider and G. Cody, Routledge,  London,  2002.)    I come to filmmaking from an actor's perspective and believe that the power of each individual performance is the key to audience engagement with a feature film.   The technical aspects of filmmaking, for me, exist primarily to serve the story as revealed through the actors' performances.  Because performance in film has been a neglected area of research, I set out to explore the different approaches to performance theory which might apply to film performance in an Australian context.  In this dissertation, I have asked a number of key questions about how the director communicates with the actor to elicit the desired performance.  I framed this thesis around one overarching question:  What is the dominant approach used by Australian film directors when working with actors on performance? This study reveals that many Australian filmmakers have been most influenced by a wide variety of approaches to working with actors, particularly because of the way actors are trained in Australia.  My interest in this project was partially triggered by my observation that many filmmaking students at QUT seem driven by the technical aspects of filmmaking.  Given the complex demands made on actors, filmmakers who do not learn to speak the actor's language arguably fail to capitalize on their working relationships with actors.   I have attempted to express my findings in plain English because the whole purpose of this project was to ensure that my findings would be of use to new filmmakers in a practical sense.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thespioprudence</field><field name="subject">Australian film</field><field name="subject">directors</field><field name="subject">film performance</field><field name="subject">film</field><field name="subject">actors</field><field name="subject">'theory of acting'</field><field name="subject">filmmaking</field><field name="subject">acting</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15999/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards the Development of Synergistic Inhibitors that Exploit the Replication Strategy of HIV-1</field><field name="creator">Pattenden, Leonard Keith</field><field name="description">HIV-1 has evolved with a great deal of functional complexity contained within a very small genome by encoding small, but critical viral proteins within larger viral genes and dividing the replication cycle into early and late phases to differentially produce all proteins leading to efficient replication and virion release. Early replication is restricted by the host spliceosome that processes HIV-1 vRNA transcripts so only the small intragenomic proteins are produced, one of which is Rev (Regulator of Virion Expression). Rev in turn governs the transition from early to late replication by interacting with a highly structured region of vRNA termed the Rev Response Element (RRE). The binding of Rev to the RRE is believed to cause a change in the vRNA tertiary structure and inhibition of splicing of the vRNA. Once, a Rev:RRE complex is formed, a nuclear export signal within Rev facilitates the export of partially spliced and unspliced vRNA to the cytoplasm. During late replication the partially spliced and unspliced vRNA is translated to polyproteins and is packaged into a budding virion where the viral aspartyl protease (HIV-1 PR) autocatalytically excises itself from the larger polyprotein and processes the remaining polyproteins to release all viral structural and functional proteins to form a mature and infectious virion.  Since the vRNA salvaged by Rev is translated to the polyproteins containing HIV-1 PR, the inhibition of Rev function will reduce the amount of HIV-1 PR available and thereby reduce the amount of HIV-1 PR therapeutics required to elicit a clinical effect. Therfore a combination approach to HIV-1 treatment using suitably developed therapeutics that inhibit Rev and HIV-1 PR function represents an attractive synergistic approach to treating HIV-1 infection in vivo. The work of this thesis was divided into two parts, the first part was concerned with HIV-1 PR structural biology and addressing problems encountered with inhibitor design.  A bicyclic peptide (based on inhibitors of analogous structure) was co-crystallised with active HIV-1 PR to develop an enzyme-product (E-P) complex and with a catalytically inactive mutant HIV-1 PR to provide an analogy to the enzyme-substrate (E-S) complex. Both structures of the E-P and E-S complexes were solved to 1.6&#197; resolution and were compared to a hydroxyethylamine isostere enzyme-inhibitor complex (E-I), highlighting the similarity of binding mode for all ligands. The inhibitor in the E-I complex was translated towards the S1 - S3 pockets of the substrate binding cleft relative to the substrate in the E-S complex due to the increased length of the hydroxylethylamine isostere compared to the peptide backbone, although the inhibitor "puckered" the isostere linkage and maintains a binding mode similar to the substrate with very little overall differences in the position of the ligands and surrounding protein. The similarity of the E-S, E-I and E-P complexes was attributed to the macrocyclic ligands ordering the surrounding protein environment, especially the protein &#61538;-strand "flap" structures that form a roof over the ligands in the active site but were not found to close more tightly in any of the trapped catalytic states. The new structures allowed refinement of details of the mechanism of peptide hydrolysis. The mechanism relies on the optimal nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the scissile amide bond with concerted acid-base catalysis of the active site aspartyl residues intitiated by D125. The alignment and intrinsic position of the N-terminus of the bicyclic substrate was interpreted as being critical to facilitate efficient electron transfer with the bicyclic substrate.  An N-terminal cyclic inhibitor, similar to the N-terminal portion of the bicyclic substrate, was used to address a major problem in HIV-1 PR drug design termed "cooperativity," where the sequential optimisation of an inhibitor (or substrate) to individual pockets of the substrate binding cleft, can negatively impact on adjacent and downfield subsites and thereby alter the binding mode of the "optimised" inhibitor. The technique referred to here as "templating" uses the N-terminal cycle to lock the binding mode into a known conformation, probing the S1' and S2' pockets. The structure activity relationship suggested that by viewing the S1' - S3' pockets as a single trough, bulky aromatic groups attached to an N-alkyl sulfonamide could be directed along the line of the trough without adverse interactions with the tops of the S1' and S3' pockets, providing very potent inhibitors. It was also found that specificity and potency of an inhibitor can be maintained with smaller functionalities that carry their bulk low and close to the inhibitor backbone in the S2' pocket, making the P2 functionalities more substrate-like.  The second part of the thesis was concerned with establishing suitable surface plasmon resonance assays for testing potential inhibitors of Rev function. Recombinant Rev and its minimal RNA aptamer target (stem loop II of the RRE termed RBE3), were expressed, purified, and used to develop BIAcore-based assays and test potential inhibitors of their interaction. The system was applied to screening of aminoglycoside antibiotics and other small molecules in a competitive assay, and also to quantitative assay of Neomycin and moderate sized analytes: Rev and three peptidic analogues of the high-affinity binding site of Rev - the native peptide, succinylated form of the peptide and a form incorporating a novel helix-inducing cap. The peptide and protein assay was undertaken to test the proposition that helix induction of the high-affinity binding site of Rev can increase affinity for the biologically important RNA target and thereby form the basis of a new class of inhibitors.  The screen of small molecule antagonists found that Neomycin was the best inhibitor of the Rev:RBE3 interaction and that efficacy of other aminoglycosides was due to the neamine-base structure presenting charge to bind to the RNA and blocking interaction with Rev. The quantitative assay was optimised to reduce non-specific interactions of Rev protein to allow reliable studies of the analytes with RBE3 by the sytematic testing of buffers and modifiers. It was found that mutliple analytes bound to the RBE3 aptamer and a comparison of the KD values found that the native and capped peptides had similar affinity for RBE3 RNA (native slightly greater at 21 &#177; 7nM cf capped 41 &#177; 10nM) that was greater than the Rev protein (101 &#177; 19nM), however the succinylated peptide exhibited stronger binding with a KD &#8804;8nM and Neomycin had the lowest affinity (KD 13 &#177; 3&#61549;M). The similarity of the native and capped peptides may be due to the high concentration of salt in the assay buffers and was necessary for the stability of the Rev protein, but is sufficient to influence secondary structure of the peptides. Therefore, it could not be stated that the helix-inducing cap increased the affinity of the native peptide for the biologically important therapeutic target.  The work conducted in this thesis firmly establishes foundations for the continued development of inhibitors against both Rev and HIV-1 PR that play key roles in the HIV-1 replication strategy. It is envisaged this work could lead to a novel synergistic therapeutic approach to treating HIV-1 infection.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aspartyl Protease</field><field name="subject">HIV-1 Protease</field><field name="subject">Substrate Complex</field><field name="subject">Product Complex</field><field name="subject">X-ray Crystallography</field><field name="subject">Cyclic Peptide</field><field name="subject">&#61538;-strand Mimetic</field><field name="subject">Catalysis</field><field name="subject">Cooperativity</field><field name="subject">HIV-1 Rev</field><field name="subject">RRE</field><field name="subject">RBE3</field><field name="subject">RNA</field><field name="subject">BIAcore</field><field name="subject">Surface Plasmon Resonance</field><field name="subject">in vitro transcription</field><field name="subject">Aminoglycoside</field><field name="subject">Helix-inducing Cap</field><field name="subject">Neomycin</field><field name="subject">Streptavidin</field><field name="subject">Neutravidin</field><field name="subject">Helix Mimetic</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16000/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A correspondence framework for surface matching algorithms</field><field name="creator">Planitz, Brigit Maria</field><field name="description">Computer vision tasks such as three dimensional (3D) registration, 3D modelling, and 3D object recognition are becoming more and more useful in industry, and have application such as reverse CAD engineering, and robot navigation.  Each of these applications use correspondence algorithms as part of their processes.  Correspondence algorithms are required to compute accurate mappings between artificial surfaces that represent actual objects or scenes.  In industry, inaccurate correspondence is related to factors such as expenses in time and labour, and also safety.  Therefore, it is essential to select an appropriate correspondence algorithm for a given surface matching task.  However, current research in the area of surface correspondence is hampered by an abundance of applications specific algorithms, and no uniform terminology of consistent model for selecting and/or comparing algorithms.    This dissertation presents a correspondence framework for surface matching algorithms.  The framework is a conceptual model that is implementable.  It is designed to assist in the analysis, comparison, development, and implementation of correspondence algorithms, which are essential tasks when selecting or creating an algorithm for a particular application.  The primary contribution of the thesis is the correspondence framework presented as a conceptual model for surface matching algorithms.  The model provides a systematic method for analysing, comparing, and developing algorithms.  The dissertation demonstrates that by dividing correspondence computation into five stages: region definition, feature extraction, feature representation, local matching, and global matching, the task becomes smaller and more manageable.  It also shows that the same stages of different algorithms are directly comparable.  Furthermore, novel algorithms can be created by simply connecting compatible stages of different algorithms.  Finally, new ideas can be synthesised by creating only the stages to be tested, without developing a while new correspondence algorithm.    The secondary contribution that is outlined is the correspondence framework presented as a software design tool for surface matching algorithms.  The framework is shown to reduce the complexity of implementing existing algorithms within the framework.  This is done by encoding algorithms in a stage-wise procedure, whereby an algorithm is separated into the five stages of the framework.  The software design tool is shown to validate the integrity of restructuring existing algorithms within it, and also provide an efficient basis for creating new algorithms.    The third contribution that is made is the specification of a quality metric for algorithms comparison.  The metric is used to assess the accuracy of the outcomes of a number of correspondence algorithms, which are used to match a wide variety of input surface pairs.  The metric is used to demonstrate that each algorithm is application specific, and highlight the types of surfaces that can be matched by each algorithm.  Thus, it is shown that algorithms that are implemented within the framework can be selected for particular surface correspondence tasks.  The final contribution made is this dissertation is the expansion of the correspondence framework beyond the surface matching domain.  The correspondence framework is maintained in its original form, and is used for image matching algorithms.  Existing algorithms from three image matching applications are implemented and modified using the framework.  It is shown how the framework provides a consistent means and uniform terminology for developing both surface and image matching algorithms.    In summary, this thesis presents a correspondence framework for surface matching algorithms.  The framework is general, encompassing a comprehensive set of algorithms, and flexible, expanding beyond surface matching to major image matching applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Correspondence</field><field name="subject">surface matching</field><field name="subject">surface registration</field><field name="subject">three dimensional modelling</field><field name="subject">three dimensional object recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16001/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mentoring for effective primary science teaching</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Peter</field><field name="description">Primary science education is a key area in the curriculum, yet primary science education is still less than adequate, both in the number of teachers implementing a primary science syllabus and the quality of primary science teaching.  Mentoring may support both teachers in their roles as mentors and preservice teachers as mentees to develop their primary science teaching practices.  This research investigated mentoring for developing preservice teachers of primary science, which was divided into two stages.  Stage 1 was concerned with the development of an instrument aimed at measuring preservice teachers' perceptions of their mentoring in primary science teaching.  Stage 2 involved developing a mentoring intervention based on the literature and the instrument developed from Stage 1 of this research, and further investigated the influence of the intervention on mentoring practices.  Stage 1 involved a survey instrument developed from the literature and a small qualitative study.  This instrument was refined after pilot testing and then administered to 331 final year preservice teachers.  Stage 2 involved pilot testing a mentoring intervention, which was then implemented with 12 final year preservice teachers and their mentors over a four-week professional experience (practicum).  Using a two-group posttest only design, these 12 final year preservice teachers (intervention group) and 60 final year preservice teachers (control group) from the same university were compared after their four-week professional experience program.  The survey instrument developed from Stage 1 was used to measure both the control group's and intervention group's perceptions of their mentoring in primary science teaching.  Stage 1 results indicated that five factors characterised effective mentoring practices in primary science teaching and were supported by Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA).  The final CFA model was theoretically and statistically significant, that is, X2(513) = 1335, p &lt; .001, CMIDF = 2.60, IFI = .922, CFI = .921, RMR = .066, RMSEA = .070.  These factors were Personal Attributes, System Requirements, Pedagogical Knowledge, Modelling, and Feedback, and had Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients of .93, .76, .94, .95, and .92, respectively.  Stage 2 findings indicated that mentees involved in the intervention received statistically significant more mentoring experiences in primary science teaching on each of the 5 factors and on 31 of the 34 survey items.  It was concluded that the mentoring intervention provided mentors and mentees with opportunities for developing their primary science teaching practices.

Determinants of egg quality are variable among and between teleost species and no common unified criteria have been established.  Maternally inherited genes influence egg quality and early embryo development is partially programmed by the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA).  Among the genes, the insulin family is important for growth functions and the presence of their transcripts in the ovary, oocytes and embryos implies their involvement during the reproductive process and their relevance to egg quality.  The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has three components, the ligands IGF-I and II, the IGFBPs (insulin-like growth factor binding proteins) and the IGF receptors that mediate biological activity of the ligands.

In oviparous fish where the developing embryo is dependent on the stored food in the yolk, vitellogenin levels in the egg could indicate its capability to support embryonic growth.  This study aimed to develop molecular tools, specifically probes for IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-IR, for the evaluation of fish egg quality.  These probes would be used to determine expression levels of IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-IR during egg development to assess their potential as molecular indicators for egg quality.  In addition, this study also aimed to establish an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for quantifying Vtg in fish eggs and determine if differences in Vtg levels could be linked to fertilization and hatching success.    Through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) putative complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) fragments of IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-IR were cloned and sequenced from mullet (Mugil cephalus) and grouper (Epinephelus coioides).   The relative expression ratio of the three genes in the eggs of mullet and grouper were assayed by quantitative PCR (QPCR) and calculated using the Pfaffl method (Pfaffl, 2001).  Levels of vitellogenin in different batches of mullet eggs were quantified by ELISA. Spawned eggs of grouper were grouped into low (&lt;60%) or high (&gt;60%) fertilization rate (FR) and the fertilized eggs that were incubated until hatching were grouped into medium (&gt;90%) or high (&gt;90%) hatching rate (HR).  Samples were categorized into sinking eggs, late embryo and hatched larvae.  Relative expression ratio of IGF-II was significantly high (P&lt;0.01) compared to IGF-I and IGF-IR in all samples examined.  All three genes were strongly expressed in sinking eggs compared to either late embryo or hatched larvae. However, there was no significant interaction effect between the genes and the samples analyzed.  Mullet samples all came from a high FR and high HR group and were categorized into sinking, multicell stage, blastula, gastrula, late embryo and hatched larvae.  There was a significant interaction effect (P&lt;0.01) between gene and stage, showing that genes are differentially expressed during embryonic development.  IGF-II was strongly expressed relative to the other genes in all stages examined and was highest during the gastrula stage.    Vtg levels were examined in mullet oocytes and egg samples that were grouped into 4; oocytes from females that subsequently spawned, had fertilized eggs which hatched (Group A); oocytes from females that did not spawn, therefore no fertilization and no hatching (Group B); eggs that were stripped, artificially fertilized but no hatching (Group C); and eggs that were spawned, assumed to be fertilized but did not hatch (Group D).  Group A showed a trend of higher Vtg levels than the other three but this result was not statistically significant.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I</field><field name="subject">IGF-II</field><field name="subject">IGF-I Receptor</field><field name="subject">egg quality</field><field name="subject">vitellogenin</field><field name="subject">enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</field><field name="subject">quantitative polymerase chain reaction</field><field name="subject">mullet</field><field name="subject">grouper</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16003/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of design technology issues in the primary classroom</field><field name="creator">Davis, Robert Scott</field><field name="description">Design technology is a poorly understood aspect of educational practice, particularly as it applies in the primary school classroom. In a number of countries around the world the implementation of design technology has met with difficulties as it applies to educational practice. In Australia, this curriculum area is a relatively recent addition to classroom programs of study, and it is crucial that a sound understanding of the subject and its specific characteristics is developed to assist in its effective implementation.    In this research a case study of a single primary school classroom was undertaken with a view to identifying issues that may have impeded or facilitated the effective implementation of design technology in such a context. The classroom experiences of the teacher and her students were examined in detail to ascertain any insights into design technology curriculum implementation and practice, particularly as it applies to the primary school environment.  The research identified nine key assertions relating to the practices of this teacher and her students. These assertions were developed and refined throughout the data collection to explain the observed classroom activity. Linkages between previous research and these assertions were utilised to develop a discussion that broadly identifies key issues that may impact on the effective implementation of design technology, as well as addressing broader conceptual issues associated with the subject area. The concept of a contingent approach to design is proposed as a means to explain classroom behaviour by students, and is allied to the concept of a 'field of possibility' and the interpretation of artefacts through a narrative approach. These key concepts combine to develop a structure through which classroom activity may be interpreted by teachers in a manner grounded in student behaviour. A model for interpreting technology activity in the classroom is also developed.    The research, therefore, develops present understanding through the observations of actual classroom activity. Furthermore, it presents new ways of conceptualising design technology that may assist in the progression of the curriculum area by academic and classroom professionals in a manner that is grounded in the reality of the classroom experience.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative assessment</field><field name="subject">Classroom</field><field name="subject">Curriculum implementation</field><field name="subject">Design and technology</field><field name="subject">Outcomes-based education</field><field name="subject">Primary education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16004/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Importance Prioritised Image Coding in JPEG 2000</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Anthony Ngoc</field><field name="description">Importance prioritised coding is a principle aimed at improving the interpretability (or image content recognition) versus bit-rate performance of image coding systems. This can be achieved by (1) detecting and tracking image content or regions of interest (ROI) that are crucial to the interpretation of an image, and (2)compressing them in such a manner that enables ROIs to be encoded with higher fidelity and prioritised for dissemination or transmission. Traditional image coding systems prioritise image data according to an objective measure of distortion and this measure does not correlate well with image quality or interpretability.  Importance prioritised coding, on the other hand, aims to prioritise image contents according to an 'importance map', which provides a means for modelling and quantifying the relative importance of parts of an image. In such a coding scheme the importance in parts of an image containing ROIs would be higher than other parts of the image. The encoding and prioritisation of ROIs means that the interpretability in these regions would be improved at low bit-rates.  An importance prioritised image coder incorporated within the JPEG 2000 international standard for image coding, called IMP-J2K, is proposed to encode and prioritise ROIs according to an 'importance map'. The map can be automatically generated using image processing algorithms that result in a limited number of ROIs, or manually constructed by hand-marking OIs using a priori knowledge.  The proposed importance prioritised coder coder provides a user of the encoder with great flexibility in defining single or multiple ROIs with arbitrary degrees of importance and prioritising them using IMP-J2K. Furthermore, IMP-J2K codestreams can be reconstructed by generic JPEG 2000 decoders, which is important for interoperability between imaging systems and processes.  The interpretability performance of IMP-J2K was quantitatively assessed using the subjective National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS). The effect of importance prioritisation on image interpretability was investigated, and a  methodology to relate the NIIRS ratings, ROI importance scores and bit-rates was proposed to facilitate NIIRS specifications for importance prioritised coding.    In addition, a technique is proposed to construct an importance map by allowing a user of the encoder to use gaze patterns to automatically determine and assign importance to fixated regions (or ROIs) in an image. The importance map can be used by IMP-J2K to bias the encoding of the image to these ROIs, and subsequently to allow a user at the receiver to reconstruct the image as desired by the user of the encoder. Ultimately, with the advancement of automated importance mapping techniques that can reliably predict regions of visual attention, IMP-J2K may play a significant role in matching an image coding scheme to the human visual system.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eye-tracking</field><field name="subject">image coding</field><field name="subject">image interpretability</field><field name="subject">importance map</field><field name="subject">importance prioritised coding</field><field name="subject">JPEG 2000</field><field name="subject">National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS)</field><field name="subject">region of interest (ROI)</field><field name="subject">visual attention</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16005/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Concentration of Aqueous Solutions By Osmotic Distillation (OD)</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Adelaide Fiona Grace</field><field name="description">This study was to investigate theory and application of Osmotic Distillation (OD). OD is a new novel membrane separation process used for the concentration of aqueous solutions such as fruit juices without the application of heat.    The present work was undertaken to investigate flux limitations focusing on feedside, membrane and stripper side characteristics of OD. Once the limiting areas were identified, further studies were undertaken to determine methods of minimizing those limitations without losing the quality and integrity of the liquid feed. A laboratory scale OD system was used to simulate the industrial process which takes place during the production of grape juice concentrate for the fruit juice industry.    Results of a UF pretreatment study showed that the use of UF membranes with pore diameters of 0.1 f&#221;m or less as a pretreatment for the subsequent OD of grape juice resulted in significant increases in OD flux over that observed for juice not subjected to UF. The study of the physical properties of the feed played an important role in the explanation of the OD process. The increase in OD flux was attributed to a reduction in juice viscosity as the result of the removal of protein and other high molecular weight components.    Apart from an increase in OD flux, UF pretreatment of the grape juice proved to be beneficial in other areas of the OD process. HPLC measurements showed that the normal concentration of fermentable sugars in standard 68 oBrix concentrate can be achieved at a lower Brix value in feed subjected to UF pretreatment, further reducing the need to handle highly viscous feeds. UF pretreatment also resulted in an increase in juice surface tension consequently reducing the tendency for membrane wet-out to occur. The study of the deoxygenation of the feed solution shows that the removal of dissolved gases by the pre boiling method and the perstraction with chemical reaction (PCR) method both had a positive affect on OD flux. Pre boiling the brine resulted in an indirect reduction in dissolved oxygen in the feed. Pre boiling both the feed and brine, further increased the flux. Throughout the PCR study, it was evident that stripper side mass transfer of O2 was not limited by flowrate but was limited by higher stripper concentration. However, the latter had an insignificant effect when the sulfite-oxygen reaction was catalysed. The use of a catalyst and increase in temperature gave a significant improvement in overall mass transfer coefficient.    Ten types of hydrophobic microporous membranes were tested for their influence on OD flux. While the pore diameter is a considerable factor in mass transport of gases through the membrane, it was also noted that the type of membrane material used had an affect on the overall mass transfer. All top three performing membranes had pore diameters of 0.2 x 10-6 m and were made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).  The choice of brine to use as the stripper was based on criteria that were confirmed by the brine studies performed here. The best performing stripper solutions demonstrating the greatest improvement in OD flux over the most commonly used brines, NaCl, CaCl2 and CH3COOK were aqueous solutions of potassium salts of phosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid and blends thereof. These salts agreed with all the required characteristics of a suitable brine, demonstrating high solubility rates, supporting the ability to lower water vapour pressure. The study of the corrosion effects of brine salts confirmed the phosphate salts are superior demonstrating some of the lowest corrosion rates and highest pH.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osmotic distillation (OD)</field><field name="subject">reverse osmosis (RO)</field><field name="subject">membrane distillation (MD)</field><field name="subject">ultrafiltration (UF)</field><field name="subject">hydrophobic membranes</field><field name="subject">microporous membranes</field><field name="subject">juice permeate</field><field name="subject">juice retentate</field><field name="subject">concentration polarization</field><field name="subject">flux</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16006/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specification-Driven Dynamic Binary Translation</field><field name="creator">Tr&#246;ger, Jens</field><field name="description">Machine emulation allows for the simulation of a real or virtual machine, the source machine, on various host computers.  A machine emulator interprets programs that are compiled for the emulated machine, but normally at a much reduced speed. Therefore, in order to increase the executions peed of such interpreted programs, a machine emulator may apply different dynamic optimization techniques.
 
 
 
 In our research we focus on emulators for real machines, i.e. existing computer architectures, and in particular on dynamic binary translation as the optimization technique.  With dynamic binary translation, the machine instructions of the interpreted source program are translated in to machine instructions for the host machine during the interpretation of the program.  Both, the machine emulator and its dynamic binary translator a resource and host machine specific, respectively, and are therefore traditionally hand-written.
 
 
 
 In this thesis we introduce the Walkabout/Yirr-Ma framework.  Walkabout, initially developed by Sun Micro systems, allows among other things for the generation of instrumented machine emulators from a certain type of machine specification files. We extended Walkabout with our generic dynamic optimization framework &#8216;Yirr-Ma&#8217; which defines an interface for the implementation of various dynamic optimizers: by instrumenting a Walkabout emulator&#8217;s instruction interpretation functions, Yirr-Ma observes and intercepts the interpretation of a source machine program, and applies dynamic optimizations to selected traces of interpreted instructions on demand.  One instance of Yirr-Ma&#8217;s interface for dynamic optimizers implements our specification-driven dynamic binary translator, the major contribution of this thesis.
 
 
 
 At first we establish two things: a formal framework that describes the process of machine emulation by abstracting from real machines, and different classes of applicable dynamic optimizations.  We define dynamic optimizations by a set of functions over the abstracted machine, and dynamic binary translation as one particular optimization function. Using this formalism, we then derive the upper bound for quality of dynamically translated machine instructions. Yirr-Ma&#8217;s dynamic binary translator implements the optimization functions of our formal framework by modules which are either generated from, or parameterized by, machine specification files.  They thus allow for the adaptation of the dynamic binary translator to different source and host machines without hand-writing machine dependent code.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Machine emulation</field><field name="subject">formal specification of machine instructions</field><field name="subject">dynamic optimization</field><field name="subject">dynamic binary translation</field><field name="subject">specification -driven dynamic binary translation.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16007/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queensland and Saskatchewan middle years students' experiences of environmental education : an analysis of conceptions</field><field name="creator">Nagel, Michael</field><field name="description">This study explores the qualitatively different ways in which the phenomenon of environmental education is understood or experienced by a purposeful sample of year seven students in Queensland and Saskatchewan. In 'directing the activities of the young', environmental education has, since its genesis, existed in an epistemological quagmire surrounding the development of 'responsible' environmental behaviours.  Yet, after some thirty years of research and pedagogical initiative, this is one of only a few studies that have looked at the reality of environmental education through the eyes of young people.
 
 Contested and debated, environmental education has received much attention in many countries from educators interested in merging the complexities of the terms environment and education. In the context of this study it is significant to note that environmental education's history bears witness to scholarly discourse and educational initiatives in Australia and Canada. However, while environmental education has continued to expand its presence in pedagogical and didactic endeavour, its history also demonstrates contested ideological foundations regarding its implementation in schools. Queensland and Saskatchewan offer pertinent examples of this contestation.
 
 From a global perspective, the goals and objectives of environmental education have been driven, developed and established around international agendas developed at a number of conferences designed and delivered through UNESCO. These global initiatives were then left to local interpretation that often resulted in very different didactic and pedagogic frameworks. Such is the case with Queensland and Saskatchewan where environmental education is situated within a social science framework in Queensland and a science framework in Saskatchewan. However, the pedagogical structure of environmental education was not the focus of this study per se. Instead, this phenomenographic research project looks at how the phenomenon of environmental education is experienced by a group of Year 7 children in each region.  These children's experiences of environmental education can be encapsulated in a limited number of qualitatively different conceptualisations.
 
 The study finds that, regardless of their country of origin, the children conceptualise environmental education in five ways; Environmental Education as: 
 
 'Human Being'.
 
 'Human Escaping'.
 
 'Human Doing'.
 
 'Human Complying'.
 
 'Human Distancing'.
 
 Specific components of these conceptions are detailed through 'categories of description' which lend themselves to a structural framework referred to as an 'outcome space'. Through this 'outcome space' it becomes apparent that for the year seven students who participated in this research project, environmental education is, at is best irrelevant, and at its worst depressing. For the goals of environmental education and those who aspire and work towards meeting those goals, this 'cumulative movement of action (environmental education) toward a later result' as noted by Dewey and quoted above, appears to be growing in the wrong direction.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">conceptions</field><field name="subject">phenomenography</field><field name="subject">environmentalism</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16008/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The expression and regulation of membranetype matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPS) in prostate cancer</field><field name="creator">Palliyaguru, Tishila Sepali</field><field name="description">Prostate cancer (PCa) represents the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in males. Initial development and progression of the disease is mainly regulated by androgens. However, the pathology of the disease may progress to a loss of hormone dependence, resulting in rapid growth and a metastatic phenotype.
 
 
 
 Invasion and metastasis of tumour cells results from the degradation of the basement membrane (BM) and extracellular matrix (ECM). The degradation of the BM and ECM is in part mediated by a family of proteinases called the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Currently more than 20 members of the MMP family have been identified and they are further divided in to sub-classes according to their protein structure. Collectively, MMPs are capable of degrading essentially all ECM components. High expression of some MMPs correlates with a malignant phenotype of various tumours.
 
 
 
 This study focused on the expression and regulation of a sub-class of MMPs called the membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs) in PCa. To date 6 MT-MMPs have been identified and they are characterized by a transmembrane domain, followed by a short cytoplasmic tail (MT1-, MT2-, MT3- and MT5-MMPs) or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety (MT4- and MT6-MMPs). MT-MMPs are thought to play a key role in tumour cell invasion by virtue of their ability to activate MMP-2 (a secreted MMP, which is implicated in many metastatic tumours) and their direct degradation activity on ECM components.
 
 
 
 Elevated MT-MMP expression has been shown in breast, colon, skin, stomach, lung, pancreas and brain cancers. Until very recently there had been no studies conducted on MT-MMPs in PCa. The few studies preceding or occurring in parallel with this one, have mainly reported the mRNA expression of these enzymes in PCa. Most studies have focused on MT1-MMP. Thus, at the commencement of this project there were many unexplored aspects of the expression and regulation of the broader MT-MMP family in PCa.
 
 
 
 The aims of this study were to examine: 1 a) The expression of MT-MMPs in prostate cancer cell lines using RT-PCR and western blot analysis and b) expression of MT1-MMP and MT5-MMP in BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and PCa clinical tissue sections by immunohistochemistry. 2) The regulation of MT1-MMP, MT3-MMP and MT5-MMP in PCa cell lines by Concanavalin A (Con A), phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF I and IGF II) using western blot analysis.
 
 
 
 In this study RWPE1, a transformed but non-tumorigenic prostate cell line was used as a 
 
 "normal" prostate cell model, ALVA-41 and LNCaP as androgen-dependent PCa cell models and DU-145 and PC-3 as androgen-independent PCa cell models.
 
 
 
 The mRNA expression for the 6 MT-MMPs was determined by RT-PCR. The results indicate that MT1- and MT3-MMP were detected in all cell lines. This is the first study to report MT1-MMP mRNA expression in LNCaP cells and MT3-MMP mRNA in DU-145 cells. MT2-MMP mRNA was detected in only LNCaP and DU-145 cells, whilst MT5-MMP was detected in PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP cells. nterestingly, MT2-, MT4-, MT5- or MT6-MMP mRNA expression was not detected in the "normal" cell line RWPE1, perhaps indicating an induction in gene transcription in tumour cells. MT4-MMP mRNA was only detected in the androgen-independent cell lines, indicating a potential role in the invasion and metastasis processes of the aggressive androgen-independent PCa. In this study, very low expression of MT6-MMP was detected only in LNCaP and DU-145 cells.  Previously there had been no reports on the expression of MT6-MMP in the normal or cancerous prostate.
 
 
 
 Due to the mRNA of MT1-, MT3- and MT5-MMPs being the predominant MT-MMPs expressed in the current study, and the availability of suitable antibodies against them, the protein expression of these three MT-MMPs was studied by western blot analysis. MT1-, MT3- and MT5-MMP protein expression was detected in the cell lysates and conditioned medium (CM) of RWPE1, LNCaP and PC-3 cells. For each MT-MMP, various protein species were detected including putative proforms, mature (active) forms, processed or fragmented forms as well as soluble or shed forms. The presence of soluble or shed forms of MT-MMPs in the CM of cultures of "normal" and PCa cells could imply one of the following mechanisms: ectodomain shedding by either extracellular sheddases, the secretion of intracellular processed proteins without the transmembrane domain, the release of membrane vesicles containing membrane-bound enzymes, or the presence of alternatively spliced mRNA, which gives rise to MT-MMPs without a transmembrane
 
 domain. Further characterization of these various forms, including their amino acid
 
 sequence, is required to fully elucidate their structural composition.
 
 
 
 Despite the detection of the mRNA, we did not detect the cell-associated proteins of MT1-MMP and MT5-MMP and only very low expression of MT3-MMP in DU-145 cells (CM of DU-145 cells were not screened for soluble forms of the enzymes). This is the first study to report MT5-MMP expression at the protein level in prostate derived cell
 
 lines.
 
 
 
 Immunohistochemistry was carried out on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa clinical tissues using MT1- and MT5-MMP antibodies to determine their cellular localisation in benign and cancer glands. MT1- and MT5-MMPs were expressed in BPH and moderate and high grade PCa. MT1-MMP expression was highest in moderate grade cancer compared to BPH and high grade cancer. MT1-MMP expression was predominantly observed in the cytoplasm of secretory epithelial cells of both benign and cancer glands, although in cancer glands, some nuclear staining was also observed.  Stromal expression of MT1-MMP was only observed in high grade cancer.
 
 
 
 This study is the first to report the immunolocalization of MT5-MMP outside the brain and in kidneys of diabetic patients. MT5-MMP was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of the secretory cells in benign glands. In the cancer glands, staining was heterogeneous with low to intense staining, mainly in the nuclei, plasma membrane and cytoplasm of secretory epithelial cells. Stromal expression of MT5-MMP was only
 
 observed in cancer tissues, particularly in high grade cancer.
 
 
 
 To study the regulation of MT-MMPs in PCa, we treated LNCaP and PC-3 cells, with either Con A, PMA, DHT or IGF-I and -II and studied the protein expression of MT1-, MT3- and MT5-MMPs by western blot analysis. Con A and PMA have been shown to stimulate MMP expression in other cell systems.
 
 
 
 Con A treatment showed a general increase in the protein expression of MT1-, MT3- and MT5-MMPs. By far the greatest induction by Con A observed was the nearly 4 fold increase in MT5-MMP expression caused by 40&#956;g/mL Con A treatment of PC-3 cells. PMA treatment of LNCaP and PC-3 cells appeared to increase shedding or secretion of all three MT-MMPs in to the CM. This increase in the soluble forms corresponded to a decrease in cell-associated forms in LNCaP cells.  Treatment of LNCaP with DHT alone and treatment of LNCaP and PC-3 cells with IGF-I and -II alone failed to detect any change in expression of MT1-MMP.
 
 
 
 The information gathered in this study on MT-MMPs with respect to cellular localization,
 
 expression levels and regulation by growth factors or chemicals that mimic their actions,
 
 will aid in our understanding of the role of MT-MMPs in PCa. This study provides strong preliminary data for further research, particularly with respect to functional studies of MT-MMPs in PCa. Understanding the processes which govern the actions of such proteins as these will provide potential insights into development of new management and therapeutic regimens to prevent cancer progression.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs)</field><field name="subject">Prostate cancer</field><field name="subject">Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)</field><field name="subject">Extracellular matrix</field><field name="subject">Androgen</field><field name="subject">Dihydrotestosterone</field><field name="subject">Insulin-like growth factor-I and &#150;II</field><field name="subject">Concanavalin A</field><field name="subject">Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16009/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing Intellectual Property and Licensing:  A Study on Cooperative Research Centres</field><field name="creator">Sheen, Peter Bernard</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the perceived importance by two-tiered management of Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) for managing a range of intellectual property issues. Fifty survey items are presented to the executive directors and  commercialization managers of 62 CRCs. The survey items are categorized under four themes: relationships with collaborators, project management; design and implementation of agreements; and specific licensing issues. An analysis of the data, using a series of independent samples t-tests, repeated measures t-tests, chi-square tests for independence or relatedness and goodness of fit, shows a range of results.  There are significant differences between executive directors and commercialization  managers on a number of issues. There are particular emphases or trends about certain issues for the whole sample of managers.    These findings are compared with text analyses of 23 CRC strategic planning documents. This is done in order to explore any similarity, difference or nuance between what the managers say in response to the survey items, compared with what is stated in the codified policies of the CRCs. While there is a high degree of  consistency among certain themes between the two sets of findings, the overall analysis points to the need for the CRCs to have a better understanding and practice of commercialization opportunities, especially through the involvement of third party commercial interests. It is argued that accommodating third party commercialization interests involves the application of an important knowledge economy principle that has an important bearing on the future economic viability and competitiveness of the CRCs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chief executive officer</field><field name="subject">Chi-square test for goodness of fit</field><field name="subject">Chi-square test for independence or relatedness</field><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Commercializable intellectual assets</field><field name="subject">Commercialization</field><field name="subject">Commercialization manager</field><field name="subject">Competitive advantage</field><field name="subject">Cooperation</field><field name="subject">Cooperative Research Centres</field><field name="subject">Executive directors</field><field name="subject">Human capital</field><field name="subject">Independent samples t-test</field><field name="subject">Intangible assets</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Intellectual property</field><field name="subject">Issues</field><field name="subject">Know-how</field><field name="subject">Knowledge economy</field><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Licensing</field><field name="subject">Managers</field><field name="subject">Managerial know-how</field><field name="subject">Mann-Whitney test</field><field name="subject">Patenting</field><field name="subject">Project Management</field><field name="subject">Relationships</field><field name="subject">Repeated measures t-test</field><field name="subject">Research and development</field><field name="subject">Supporting intellectual assets</field><field name="subject">Text analysis</field><field name="subject">Third party licensing</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16010/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the nature and function of mental computation in primary mathematics curricula</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Geoffrey Robert</field><field name="description">This study was conducted to analyse aspects of mental computation within primary school mathematics curricula and to formulate recommendations to inform future revisions to the Number strand of mathematics syllabuses for primary schools.

 Little has been documented in relation to the nature and role of mental computation in mathematics curricula in Australia (McIntosh, Bana, &amp; Farrell, 1995,p. 2), despite an international resurgence of interest by mathematics educators.  This resurgence has arisen from a recognition that computing mentally remains a viable computational alternative in a technological age, and that the development of mental procedures contributes to the formation of powerful mathematical thinking
 
 strategies (R. E. Reys, 1992, p. 63). The emphasis needs to be placed upon the mental processes involved, and it is this which distinguishes mental computation from mental arithmetic, as defined in this study.  Traditionally, the latter has been
 
 concerned with speed and accuracy rather than with the mental strategies used to arrive at the correct answers.
 
 
 
 In Australia, the place of mental computation in mathematics curricula is only beginning to be seriously considered. Little attention has been given to teaching, as opposed to testing, mental computation. Additionally, such attention has
 
 predominantly been confined to those calculations needed to be performed mentally to enable the efficient use of the conventional written algorithms. Teachers are inclined to associate mental computation with isolated facts, most commonly the basic ones, rather than with the interrelationships between numbers and the methods used to calculate. To enhance the use of mental computation and to achieve an improvement in performance levels, children need to be encouraged to value all methods of computation, and to place a priority on mental procedures.  This requires that teachers be encouraged to change the way in which they view 
 
 mental computation. An outcome of this study is to provide the background and recommendations for this to occur.
 
 
 
 The mathematics education literature of relevance to mental computation was analysed, and its nature and function, together with the approaches to teaching, under each of the Queensland mathematics syllabuses from 1860 to 1997 were documented. Three distinct time-periods were analysed: 1860-1965, 1966-1987, and post-1987. The first of these was characterised by syllabuses which included specific references to calculating mentally. To provide insights into the current status of mental computation in Queensland primary schools, a survey of a
 
 representative sample of teachers and administrators was undertaken. The statements in the postal, self-completion opinionnaire were based on data from the literature review. This study, therefore, has significance for Queensland educational history, curriculum development, and pedagogy.
 
 
 
 The review of mental computation research indicated that the development of flexible mental strategies is influenced by the order in which mental and written techniques are introduced. Therefore, the traditional written-mental sequence needs to be reevaluated. As a contribution to this reevaluation, this study presents a mental-written sequence for introducing each of the four operations. However,
 
 findings from the survey of Queensland school personnel revealed that a majority disagreed with the proposition that an emphasis on written algorithms should be delayed to allow increased attention on mental computation. Hence, for this
 
 sequence to be successfully introduced, much professional debate and experimentation needs to occur to demonstrate its efficacy to teachers.
 
 
 
 Of significance to the development of efficient mental techniques is the way in which mental computation is taught. R. E. Reys, B. J. Reys, Nohda, and Emori (1995, p. 305) have suggested that there are two broad approaches to teaching
 
 mental computation,,Ya behaviourist approach and a constructivist approach. The former views mental computation as a basic skill and is considered an essential prerequisite to written computation, with proficiency gained through direct teaching. In contrast, the constructivist approach contends that mental computation is a
 
 process of higher-order thinking in which the act of generating and applying mental strategies is significant for an individual's mathematical development. Nonetheless, this study has concluded that there may be a place for the direct teaching of selected mental strategies. To support syllabus development, a sequence of mental strategies appropriate for focussed teaching for each of the four operations has
 
 been delineated.
 
 
 
 The implications for teachers with respect to these recommendations are discussed. Their implementation has the potential to severely threaten many teachers&#129;f sense of efficacy. To support the changed approach to developing
 
 competence with mental computation, aspects requiring further theoretical and empirical investigation are also outlined.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arithmetic</field><field name="subject">Computation</field><field name="subject">Computational Estimation</field><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Mathematics Curriculum</field><field name="subject">Mathematics Teaching</field><field name="subject">Mental Arithmetic</field><field name="subject">Mental Computation</field><field name="subject">Mental Strategies</field><field name="subject">Number</field><field name="subject">Number Sense</field><field name="subject">Queensland Educational History</field><field name="subject">Queensland Mathematics Syllabuses</field><field name="subject">Teacher Beliefs and Practices</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16011/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time for the boys?  Gender equity policy, masculinities and the education of boys</field><field name="creator">Toussaint, Julian</field><field name="description">Since the early 1990s, there has been an increasing focus on the education of boys in the media, impacting more recently on education policy processes. Some previous research has documented the background to this focus, including the impact on earlier policies and programs addressing the education of girls. However, the ways in which discourses about masculinity have informed gender equity policies in education have not been analysed at a fine-grained level. This study identifies the major perspectives involved in debates about the education of boys, and the various discourses informing them 1) advocates for boys' perspectives informed by discourses including biological essentialism and anti-feminism; 2)  feminist and profeminist perspectives and discourses; and 3) social psychological  perspectives and discourses.    A theoretical framework for understanding discourse and policy, as well as gender and masculinities is developed, drawing on critical discourse theory and theories about gender relations. Using critical discourse analysis, drawing on the work of Fairclough, I analyse the discourses about masculinity informing two recent policy documents: Gender Equity: A Framework for Australian Schools and Education  Queensland's Boys Education Strategy. The study found that the Gender Equity Framework was primarily informed by (pro)feminist discourses, although advocates for boys discourses informed the Framework in significant ways as well. The Boys Education Strategy, while primarily framed by advocates for boys' discourses, was largely informed by (pro)feminist discourses at the micro level. In both cases, discourses marginalised in the broader culture and in the debates generally, such as those associated with marginal sexualities or minority cultural groups, were found to be marginal.    These findings have implications for policy and policy processes, gender equity policy and for teacher education. In particular there is a need for further research on the role of the media in policy processes as well as work on developing teacher understanding of and responses to policy processes and the construction of gender and masculinities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction of gender; critical discourse analysis; education of boys; education policy</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16012/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Bachelor's Family   A memoir of relationship and childlessness</field><field name="creator">Close, Alan</field><field name="description">A Bachelor's Family is a memoir of relationship, exploring --from a male point of view--my trajectory to a 'circumstantially childless' middle age.

Electro Discharge Machining (EDM) has been used for over 50 years and recent developments have  seen the use of EDM become much more viable. The goal of this research is to produce and evaluate electrodes produced by different manufacturing methods.    The use of electroforming and spray-metal deposition has only recently become viable methods of producing usable rapid tooling components. The speed and accuracy as well as the cost of manufacture play a vital role in the tool and mould manufacturing process. Electroforming and spray-metal deposition offer an alternate option to traditional machining of electrodes.    Electroforming is one method of producing electrodes for EDM. The fact that electroforming can be used to produce multiple electrodes simultaneously gives it the advantage of saving on costs when multiple electrodes are needed. Spray-metal deposition offers another alternative that is much cheaper and relatively faster to manufacture.    The used of these non-traditional manufacturing methods in this research are compared to the performance of traditional solid electrodes in terms of machining time, material removal rate, tool wear rates and surface roughness at several standard machining settings.    The results of this research are presented in this thesis along with conclusions and comments on the performance of the different methods of electrode manufacture. The major findings of the research include the solid electrodes performed better than the electroformed electrodes in Material Removal Rate (MRR), Tool Wear Rate (TWR), and Surface Roughness (Ra) at all machine settings. However it was found that the production cost of the solid electrodes was six times that of the electroformed electrodes.    The production of spray metal electrodes was unsuccessful. The electrode shell walls were not an even thickness and the backing material broke through the shell making them unusable.    It is concluded that with further refinements and research, electroforming and spray metal processes will become an extremely competitive method in electrode manufacture and other rapid tooling processes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electro Discharge Machining (EDM)</field><field name="subject">Electroforming</field><field name="subject">Material Removal Rate (MRR)</field><field name="subject">Tool Wear Rate (TWR)</field><field name="subject">Surface Roughness (Ra)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16014/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrogeology, Conceptual Model and Groundwater Flow Within Alluvial Aquifers of the Tenthill and Ma Ma Catchments, Lockyer Valley, Queensland</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Andrew Scott</field><field name="description">The study focuses on the adjacent Tenthill and Ma Ma catchments which converge onto the heavily cultivated alluvial plain of Lockyer Creek.  Groundwater extracted from the alluvial aquifers is the primary source of water for intensive irrigation. Within the study the hydrogeology is  investigated, a conceptual groundwater model produced and a numerical groundwater flow model is developed from this. The hydrochemistry and  stable isotope character of groundwater are also investigated to determine processes such as recharge and evaporation.    Examination of bore logs confirms the Quaternary alluvium comprises a laterally continuous gravel aquifer with an average thickness of 4.5 m,  overlain by mixed sands and clays which form a semi-confining layer with an average thickness of 22 m. Variations in long term groundwater  hydrographs indicate the aquifer changes from confined to unconfined in some locations as water levels drop, while bores adjacent to creek banks display a rapid response to a flood event. Pump testing of bores screened in the gravel produces estimates of hydraulic conductivity ranging from 50-80 m/day and storativity of 0.00166 which are both within realistic bounds for this aquifer material.    Major ion chemistry of surface water collected during a flood is Mgdominated, similar to alluvial groundwater in the Tenthill catchment and the Lockyer plain, suggesting a strong connection between surface and groundwater in these locations. Alluvial groundwater salinity in Tenthill catchment is typically less than 3500 &#236;S/cm but may approach 6000&#236;S/cm on the Lockyer plain. By contrast Ma Ma catchment alluvial groundwater is Na-dominated with conductivity up to 12000 &#236;S/cm and more associated with groundwater from the underlying sandstone bedrock. Stable isotope analyses of alluvial groundwater from throughout both catchments and the Lockyer plain are compared with basalt and sandstone groundwater. A range of processes have been identified including recharge to alluvium from basalt groundwater and evaporated surface water; and alluvial-bedrock  groundwater mixing at some locations.    Integration of the components of the study enabled the production of a conceptual hydrogeological model of the Lockyer alluvial plain, proposing two hydrostratigraphic units; the gravel aquifer and the overlying mixed  sand and clay which acts as a semi confining unit. Hydrochemical and stable isotopic evidence suggests seepage from creek channels as the dominant recharge process. A single layer groundwater flow model using MODFLOW was developed, based on groundwater extraction data, to represent flow in the gravel aquifer. The model was calibrated to transient conditions with groundwater fluctuations, incorporating both drought and flood conditions. A sensitivity analysis for each of the aquifer properties  demonstrates the model is insensitive to variations within realistic bounds for the gravel aquifer material, however, the model is highly sensitive to changes in the chosen boundary conditions. Predictive simulations with  several annual extraction scenarios ranging from 1.75 to 0.5 ML/ha indicate the resulting minimum saturated aquifer thickness ranges from 0.03 to 1.4 m.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogeology</field><field name="subject">conceptual model</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">alluvial aquifers</field><field name="subject">Lockyer Valley</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16015/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalising Australian Children's Television Drama: The Collision of Australian Cultural Policy and Global Market Imperatives</field><field name="creator">Potter, Anna</field><field name="description">When considering the effects of cultural policy on international trade in television programming there is an area that is frequently overlooked, that of classification and censorship. The role that classification and censorship play as tools of cultural policy is poorly understood, as is their impact on the ease with which television programs can be traded. A broad definition of cultural policy has been used here, in order to  encompass both its theoretical and practical elements. Cultural policy as expressed through television classification and censorship is seen here as having three layers. These layers are legislative policy such as local content quotas, the content gate keeping carried out by television producers prior to production, and program classification, that is the implementation of local programming codes by broadcasters. It is important to understand the effects of television regulatory regimes, including those that govern content classification, on the international trade in programs for two reasons. One is the precedence international economic agreements generally take over cultural policy, because classification and censorship can quietly undermine this precedence in a way which currently receives little attention. The second is the importance of the export market to the Australian television production industry, which  is unable to fully fund its program output from local markets.    Australian children's drama and its export to the UK are the focus of this research as this provides an excellent example of the current tensions between cultural policy and economic imperatives. Australian children's drama is tightly regulated through government policy, particularly the demands of the 'C' (children's) classification. It is argued here that the demands of current Australian cultural policy are making it extremely difficult for Australian producers to internationalise their product and thus cultivate a competitive advantage in international markets.    With the advent of digital technology and the end of spectrum scarcity, the television landscape is changing rapidly. Australian producers of children's programming are facing commercial challenges that have been created by the proliferation of children's channels in the UK and particularly the popularity on those channels of American animation. While the need to cultivate a competitive advantage is pressing, Australian producers of children's programming are also having to accommodate the three layers of cultural policy described earlier, that is the demands of government policy regarding the 'C' classification, the local programming codes of their export market, in this case the United Kingdom, and their own internalised cultural values as expressed through  their gate keeping roles.    My Industry experience in a senior compliance role in the pay television industry led to an awareness of the impact of local classification procedures on international trade in programming and provided the initial starting point for this research. Through scholarly investigation and interviews with three key producers of Australian children's programs and a senior UK programmer, certain findings regarding the impact of regulatory regimes on the export of Australian children's programs have been reached.    The key findings of this research are firstly, that the rationales and operations of national classification schemes seem to be fundamentally untouched by supranational trade agreements and arguably are able to act as restraints on international trade.  Additionally, programs that do not conform to the societal values of the countries to which they are being exported, will not sell. Secondly, multi-channelling is having the unexpected effect of driving down prices achieved for children's programs which is a cause for concern, given the importance of international sales to Australian producers.  Part of this decline in pricing may be attributed to the rise in popularity of inexpensive animation, which now dominates children's channels in the UK. Thirdly, this research finds that Australian cultural policy is preventing Australian producers cultivating a  competitive advantage in international markets, by making demands regarding content and quality that render their programs less attractive to overseas channels.    If the Australian government believes that certain culturally desirable forms of television such as high quality, children's programming should continue to exist, it may in future have to modify its cultural policy in order to attain this objective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internationalisation; trade in children&#146;s television; cultural policy; censorship and classification; local content regulation; children&#146;s production assistance; television regulation; cultural imperialism</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16016/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Airborne Particles in Indoor Residential Environment: Source Contribution, Characteristics, Concentration, and Time Variability</field><field name="creator">He, Congrong</field><field name="description">The understanding of human exposure to indoor particles of all sizes is important to enable exposure control and reduction, but especially for smaller particles since the smaller particles have a higher probability of penetration into the deeper parts of the  respiratory tract and also contain higher levels of trace elements and toxins. Due to the limited understanding of the relationship between particle size and the health effects they cause, as well as instrument limitations, the available information on submicrometer (d &lt; 1.0 &#181;m) particles indoors, both in terms of mass and number concentrations, is still relatively limited.  This PhD project was conducted as part of the South-East Queensland Air Quality program and Queensland Housing Study aimed at providing a better understanding of ambient particle concentrations within the indoor environment with a focus on exposure assessment and control. This PhD project was designed to investigate  comprehensively the sources and sinks of indoor aerosol particles and the relationship between indoor and outdoor aerosol particles, particle and gaseous pollutant, as well as the association between indoor air pollutants and house characteristics by using, analysing and interpreting existing experimental data which  were collected before this project commenced, as well as data from additional experiments which were designed and conducted for the purpose of this project. The focus of this research was on submicrometer particles with a diameter between 0.007 - 0.808 &#181;m. The main outcome of this project may be summarised as following:    * A comprehensive review of particle concentration levels and size distributions  characteristics in the residential and non-industrial workplace environments was conducted. This review included only those studies in which more general trends were investigated, or could be concluded based on information provided in the papers. This review included four parts: 1) outdoor particles and their effect on indoor environments; 2) the relationship between indoor and outdoor concentration levels in the absence of indoor sources for naturally ventilated  buildings; 3) indoor sources of particles: contribution to indoor concentration levels and the effect on I/O ratios for naturally ventilated buildings; and 4) indoor/outdoor relationship in mechanically ventilated buildings.    * The relationship between indoor and outdoor airborne particles was investigated for sixteen residential houses in Brisbane, Australia, in the  absence of operating indoor sources. Comparison of the ratios of indoor to outdoor particle concentrations revealed that while temporary values of the ratio vary in a broad range from 0.2 to 2.5 for both lower and higher ventilation  conditions, average values of the ratios were very close to one regardless of ventilation conditions and of particle size range. The ratios were in the range from 0.78 to 1.07 for submicrometer particles, from 0.95 to 1.0 for  supermicrometer particles and from 1.01 to 1.08 for PM2.5 fraction. Comparison of the time series of indoor to outdoor particle concentrations showed a clear positive relationship existing for many houses under normal ventilation conditions (estimated to be about and above 2 h-1), but not under minimum ventilation conditions (estimated to be about and below 1 h-1). These results suggest that for normal ventilation conditions and in the absence of operating indoor sources, outdoor particle concentrations could be used to predict instantaneous indoor particle concentrations but not for minium ventilation, unless air exchange rate is known, thus allowing for estimation of  the "delay constant".    * Diurnal variation of indoor submicrometer particle number and particle mass (approximation of PM2.5) concentrations was investigated in fifteen of the houses. The results show that there were clear diurnal variations in both  particle number and approximation of PM2.5 concentrations, for all the investigated houses. The pattern of diurnal variations varied from house to house, however, there was always a close relationship between the concentration and human indoor activities. The average number and mass concentrations during indoor activities were (18.2&#177;3.9)&#215;10&#179; particles cm-&#179; and (15.5&#177;7.9) &#181;g m-&#179; respectively, and under non-activity conditions, (12.4&#177;2.7)x10&#179; particles cm-&#179; (11.1&#177;2.6) &#181;g m-&#179;, respectively. In general, there was a poor correlation between mass and number concentrations and the correlation coefficients were highly variable from day to day and from house to house. This implies that conclusions cannot be drawn about either one of the number or mass concentration characteristics of indoor particles, based on measurement of the other. The study also showed that it is unlikely that particle concentrations indoors could be represented by measurements conducted at a fixed monitoring station due to the large impact of indoor and local sources.    * Emission characteristics of indoor particle sources in fourteen residential houses were quantified. In addition, characterizations of particles resulting from cooking conducted in an identical way in all the houses were measured.  All the events of elevated particle concentrations were linked to indoor activities using house occupants diary entries, and catalogued into 21 different types of indoor activities. This enabled quantification of the effect of indoor sources on indoor particle concentrations as well as quantification of emission rates from the sources. For example, the study found that frying, grilling, stove  use, toasting, cooking pizza, smoking, candle vaporizing eucalyptus oil and fan heater use, could elevate the indoor submicrometer particle number concentration levels by more than 5 times, while PM2.5 concentrations could be up to 3, 30 and 90 times higher than the background levels during smoking, frying and grilling, respectively. * Indoor particle deposition rates of size classified particles in the size range from 0.015 to 6 &#181;m were quantified. Particle size distribution resulting from cooking, repeated under two different ventilation conditions in 14 houses, as well as changes to particle size distribution as a function of time, were measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS), and a DustTrak. Deposition rates were determined by regression fitting of the measured size-resolved particle number and PM2.5 concentration decay curves, and accounting for air exchange rate. The measured deposition rates were shown to be particle size dependent and they  varied from house to house. The lowest deposition rates were found for particles in the size range from 0.2 to 0.3 &#181;m for both minimum (air exchange rate: 0.61&#177;0.45 h-1) and normal (air exchange rate: 3.00&#177;1.23 h-1) ventilation  conditions. The results of statistical analysis indicated that ventilation condition (measured in terms of air exchange rate) was an important factor affecting deposition rates for particles in the size range from 0.08 to 1.0 &#181;m, but not for particles smaller than 0.08 &#181;m or larger than 1.0 &#181;m. Particle coagulation was assessed to be negligible compared to the two other processes of removal: ventilation and deposition. This study of particle deposition rates, the largest conducted so far in terms of the number of residential houses investigated, demonstrated trends in deposition rates comparable with studies previously reported, usually for significantly smaller samples of houses (often only one). However, the results compare better with studies which, similarly to  this study, investigated cooking as a source of particles (particle sources investigated in other studies included general activity, cleaning, artificial particles, etc).    * Residential indoor and outdoor 48 h average levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 48h indoor submicrometer particle number concentration and the approximation of PM2.5 concentrations were measured simultaneously for fourteen houses. Statistical analyses of the correlation between indoor and outdoor pollutants (NO2 and particles) and the association between house  characteristics and indoor pollutants were conducted. The average indoor and outdoor NO2 levels were 13.8 &#177; 6.3 ppb and 16.7 &#177; 4.2 ppb, respectively. The indoor/outdoor NO2 concentration ratio ranged from 0.4 to 2.3, with a median value of 0.82. Despite statistically significant correlations between outdoor and  fixed site NO2 monitoring station concentrations (p = 0.014, p = 0.008), there was no significant correlation between either indoor and outdoor NO2  concentrations (p = 0.428), or between indoor and fixed site NO2 monitoring station concentrations (p = 0.252, p = 0.465,). However, there was a significant correlation between indoor NO2 concentration and indoor submicrometer  aerosol particle number concentrations (p = 0.001), as well as between indoor PM2.5 and outdoor NO2 (p = 0.004). These results imply that the outdoor or fixed site monitoring concentration alone is a poor predictor of indoor NO2 concentration.    * Analysis of variance indicated that there was no significant association between indoor PM2.5 and any of the house characteristics investigated (p &gt; 0.05). However, associations between indoor submicrometer particle number concentration and some house characteristics (stove type, water heater type, number of cars and condition of paintwork) were significant at the 5% level. Associations between indoor NO2 and some house characteristics (house age, stove type, heating system, water heater type and floor type) were also significant (p &lt; 0.05). The results of these analyses thus strongly suggest that the gas stove, gas heating system and gas water heater system are main indoor sources of indoor submicrometer particle and NO2 concentrations in the studied residential houses.    The significant contributions of this PhD project to the knowledge of indoor particle  included: 1) improving an understanding of indoor particles behaviour in residential  houses, especially for submicrometer particle; 2) improving an understanding of indoor particle source and indoor particle sink characteristics, as well as their effects on indoor particle concentration levels in residential houses; 3) improving an understanding of the relationship between indoor and outdoor particles, the  relationship between particle mass and particle number, correlation between indoor NO2 and indoor particles, as well as association between indoor particle, NO2 and house characteristics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Air quality</field><field name="subject">Indoor air</field><field name="subject">Submicrometer particles</field><field name="subject">Supermicrometer particles</field><field name="subject">Particle size distributions</field><field name="subject">Particle number</field><field name="subject">Particle mass</field><field name="subject">Indoor and Outdoor relation</field><field name="subject">Particle emission</field><field name="subject">Particle deposition</field><field name="subject">NO&#178;</field><field name="subject">PM&#178;.5;</field><field name="subject">House characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16017/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fatigue and beyond : patterns of, and motivations for illicit drug use among long haul truck drivers</field><field name="creator">Richards, Naomi</field><field name="description">Long distance truck drivers are considered a special interest group in terms of drug-----

High rates of licit and illicit drug use (particularly amphetamines) were reported. However, unlike previous studies which focus on fatigue, this research found overlapping and changing motivations for drug use during individual lifetimes. Using Becker's model of a drug use 'career' it was revealed that some drivers begin illicit drug use before they begin truck driving. As well as fatigue, powerful

For example, in Australia, the annual spending on infrastructure requiring flood estimation is of the order of $650 million ARR (I.E. Aust., 1998). Rainfall-based flood estimation techniques are most commonly adopted in practice.  These require several inputs to convert design rainfalls to design floods. Of all the inputs, loss is an important one and defined as the amount of precipitation that does not appear as direct runoff. The concept of loss includes moisture intercepted by vegetation, infiltration into the soil, retention on the surface, evaporation and loss through the streambed and banks. As these loss components are dependent on  topography, soils, vegetation and climate, the loss exhibits a high degree of temporal and spatial variability during the rainfall event.    In design flood estimation, the simplified lumped conceptual loss models were used because of their simplicity and ability to approximate catchment runoff behaviour. In Australia, the most commonly adopted conceptual loss model is the initial losscontinuing loss model. For a specific part of the catchment, the initial loss occurs prior to the commencement of surface runoff, and can be considered to be composed  of the interception loss, depression storage and infiltration that occur before the soil surface saturates. ARR (I. E. Aust., 1998) mentioned that the continuing loss is the average rate of loss throughout the remainder of the storm. At present, there is inadequate information on design losses in most parts of Australia and this is one of the greatest weaknesses in Australian flood hydrology. Currently recommended design losses are not compatible with design rainfall information in Australian Rainfall and Runoff. Also design losses for observed storms show a wide variability and it is always difficult to select an appropriate value of loss from this wide range for a particular application. Despite the wide variability of loss values, in the widely used Design Event Approach, a single value of initial  and continuing losses is adopted. Because of the non-linearity in the rainfall-runoff process, this is likely to introduce a high degree of uncertainty and possible bias in the resulting flood estimates. In contrast, the Joint Probability Approach can consider probability-distributed losses in flood estimation.    In ARR (I. E. Aust., 1998) it is recommended to use a constant continuing loss value in rainfall events. In this research it was observed that the continuing loss values in the rainfall events were not constant, rather than it decays with the duration of the rainfall event. The derived loss values from the 969 rainfall and streamflow events of Queensland catchments would provide better flood estimation than the recommended design loss values in ARR (I. E. Aust., 1998). In this research, both the initial and continuing losses were computed using IL-CL loss model and a single median loss value was used to estimate flood using Design Event Approach. Again both the initial and continuing losses were considered to be random variables and their probability distribution functions were determined. Hence, the research showed that  the probability distributed loss values can be used for Queensland catchments in near future for better flood estimate.    The research hypothesis tested was whether the new loss value for Queensland catchments provides significant improvement in design flood estimation. A total of 48 catchments, 82 pluviograph stations and 24 daily rainfall stations were selected from all over Queensland to test the research hypothesis. The research improved the recommended design loss values that will result in more precise design flood estimates. This will ultimately save millions of dollars in the construction of hydraulic infrastructures.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Losses</field><field name="subject">Rainfall and runoff modelling</field><field name="subject">Flood estimation</field><field name="subject">Initial losses</field><field name="subject">Continuing losses</field><field name="subject">joint probability Approach</field><field name="subject">Design Event Approach</field><field name="subject">IL&#150;CL model</field><field name="subject">Pluviograph station</field><field name="subject">Stream gauging station</field><field name="subject">Daily rainfall station</field><field name="subject">Baseflow</field><field name="subject">streamflow</field><field name="subject">Study catchments</field><field name="subject">Storm losses</field><field name="subject">Design floods</field><field name="subject">Rainfall-runoff</field><field name="subject">Runoff routing</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16019/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Going Up the Down Escalator: An ethnographic case study of the uptake and utilisation of  information and communication technologies by three Women in Film and Television (WIFT) organisations at the State, National and International level, 1995-2000</field><field name="creator">Carriere, Glenda Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the implementation of the new digital information and communications  technologies (ICTs) by the Women in Film and Television (WIFT) Non-government organisation (NGO) at the state, national and international levels through an ethnographic, participant observation case study, informed by the precepts of feminist research.

For over a decade Feminist  theorists have pointed to the omission of gender as a focus in studies on the new information  and communications technologies. There has also been little research and few surveys into the uptake of ICTs by either women's NGOs or the broader NGO sector, nationally or internationally.    The detailed, longitudinal case study of the implementation process from pre-establishment  through to advanced use of digital communications by a women's NGO at state, national and international level is also unique. Combined with the survey, it affords the opportunity to not only document which ICTs are being adopted but also why particular technologies are being used over others and how they are being used. Despite key successes, the results show less than optimum uptake, a lack of advanced or strategic use, and the myriad of challenges shared by all three WIFT organisations, Australian women's peak NGOs, and the national and international NGO sector in utilising ICTs. The reasons for this are analysed revealing the conflicting values between the NGO sector and  those underlying the development of ICTs and demonstrates that difficulties systemic to both  the technology and the NGO sector are limiting access and utilisation by women's NGOs.    While the myths of women as technophobic are seriously challenged by the findings, the study  highlights the importance of gender factors in limiting access and uptake and shaping the use  of ICTs. Australian women's NGOs' uptake is shown to be less than their mixed gender  counterparts and the study also reveals a lack of acknowledgement by government of gender as a key factor in the uptake of ICTs. It is also shown that significant funding, infrastructure support and policy initiatives recognising the special technological and communication challenges of women's NGOs and the overall NGO sector are needed, if both are to fully and strategically embrace these technologies and function effectively in the new millennium.    The significant contribution to knowledge of this thesis lies foremost in furthering the  understanding of gender as a key factor in the uptake and utilisation of the new ICTs while at  the same time challenging the patriarchal myth of women as technophobic. It thus contributes  to the reconstruction of the epistemologies surrounding women's relationship to technology.  The study also contributes to furthering the current very limited knowledge and understanding  of women's NGOs and the overall NGO sector's uptake and use of information and communications technology. The knowledge and the critical insight provided is not purely historical but rather as the push to take up broadband begins, has relevance to this and future technological innovations. Without an understanding of the process, requirements and challenges faced by women's NGOs and the NGO sector in general, the existing problems will continue to be replicated.    The material presented in this study will be useful to all women's organisations and NGOs  contemplating establishing digital communications or wishing to review their current use of these technologies. It will also be of value to government and policy makers seeking to establish policies and initiatives that will enable NGOs to take up the new information and communication technologies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet: Gender issues</field><field name="subject">Access</field><field name="subject">Emancipatory</field><field name="subject">Democratisation; Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs); New Media Technologies; Women's Non Government Organisations (NGOs); Non Profit Organisations (NPOs); Women in film and Television</field><field name="subject">(WIFT) Case Study; Pamela's List; Australian Peak Women's NGOs</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16020/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' Professional Knowledge Bases for Offshore Education:Two Case Studies of Western Teachers Working in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Exley, Beryl Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This research thesis set out to better understand the professional knowledge bases of Western teachers working in offshore education in Indonesia. This research explored what two groups of Western teachers said about the students they taught, their own role, professional and social identity, the knowledge transmitted, and their pedagogical strategies whilst teaching offshore. Such an investigation is significant on a number of levels. Firstly, these teachers were working within a period of rapid economic, political, cultural and educational change described as 'New Times' (Hall, 1996a). Secondly, the experiences of teachers working in offshore education have rarely been reported in the literature (see Johnston, 1999).    A review of the literature on teachers' professional knowledge bases (Shulman, 1986a, 1986b, 1987; Turner-Bisset, 1997, 1999) concluded that, in general terms, teachers draw on three main interrelated and changing knowledge bases: knowledge of content, knowledge of teaching processes and knowledge of their  students. This review also explored the notion that teachers had an additional knowledge base that was in a continual state of negotiation and closely related to the aforementioned knowledge bases: teachers' knowledge of their own and  students' pedagogic identities (Bernstein, 2000). A theoretical framework appropriate to exploring the overarching research problem was developed. This framework drew on models of teachers' knowledge bases (Elbaz, 1983; Shulman,  1986a, 1986b, 1987; Nias, 1989; Turner-Bisset, 1997, 1999), the sociology of knowledge (Bernstein, 1975, 1990, 1996, 1999, 2000), and notions of pedagogic identity (Bernstein, 2000). This framework theorised the types of knowledges  taught, categories of teaching process knowledge, and the range of pedagogic identities made available to teachers and students in new times. More specifically, this research examined two case studies (see Stake, 1988, 2000; Yin, 1994) of Western teachers employed by Australian educational institutions who worked in Central Java, Indonesia, in the mid-to-late 1990s. The teacher participants from both case studies taught a range of subjects and used English as  the medium of instruction. Data for both case studies were generated via semistructured  interviews (see Kvale, 1996; Silverman, 1985, 1997). The interviews focused on the teachers' descriptions of the learner characteristics of Indonesian students, their professional roles whilst teaching offshore, and curriculum and  pedagogic design.    The analyses produced four major findings. The first major finding of the analyses confirmed that the teacher participants in this study drew on all proposed professional knowledge bases and that these knowledge bases were interrelated.  This suggests that teachers must have all knowledge bases present for them to do their work successfully. The second major finding was that teachers' professional knowledge bases were constantly being negotiated in response to their beliefs about their work and the past, present and future demands of the local context. For  example, the content and teaching processes of English lessons may have varied as their own and their students' pedagogic identities were re-negotiated in different contexts of teaching and learning. Another major finding was that it was only when the teachers entered into dialogue with the Indonesian students and community members and/or reflective dialogue amongst themselves, that they started to question the stereotypical views of Indonesian learners as passive, shy and quiet.    The final major finding was that the teachers were positioned in multiple ways by contradictory and conflicting discourses. The analyses suggested that teachers' pedagogic identities were a site of struggle between dominant market orientations and the criteria that the teachers thought should determine who was a legitimate teacher of offshore Indonesian students. The accounts from one of the case studies suggested that dominant market orientations centred on experience and  qualifications in unison with prescribed and proscribed cultural, gender and age relations. Competent teachers who were perceived to be white, Western, male and senior in terms of age relations seemed to be the most easily accepted as offshore teachers of foundation programs for Indonesian students. The analyses suggested that the teachers thought that their legitimacy to be an offshore teacher of Indonesian students should be based on their teaching expertise alone. However, managers of Australian offshore educational institutions conceded that it was very difficult to bring about change in terms of teacher legitimisation.    These findings have three implications for the work of offshore teachers and program administrators. Firstly, offshore programs that favour the pre-packaging of curricula content with little emphasis on the professional development and support needs of teachers do not foster work conditions which encourage teachers  to re-design or modify curricula in response to the specific needs of learners.  Secondly, pre-packaged programs do not support teachers to enter into negotiations concerning students' or their own pedagogic identities or the past, present and future demands of local contexts. These are important implications because they  affect the way that teachers work, and hence how responsive teachers can be to learners' needs and how active they can be in the negotiation process as it relates to pedagogic identities. Finally, the findings point to the importance of establishing a learning community or learning network to assist Western teachers engaged in  offshore educational work in Asian countries such as Indonesia. Such a community or network would enable teachers to engage and modify the  complexity of knowledge bases required for effective localised offshore teaching.  Given the burgeoning increase in the availability and use of electronic technology in new times, such as internet, emails and web cameras, these learning networks could be set up to have maximum benefit with minimal on-going costs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teachers&#146; knowledge bases</field><field name="subject">Offshore education</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Teachers' and students' pedagogic identities</field><field name="subject">Whiteness</field><field name="subject">Teaching in New Times</field><field name="subject">Bernsteinian theory</field><field name="subject">Guest teacher program</field><field name="subject">Education as 'Aid'</field><field name="subject">Education as 'Trade'</field><field name="subject">Western teachers</field><field name="subject">Indonesian students</field><field name="subject">International students</field><field name="subject">English as a global language</field><field name="subject">English as a foreign language</field><field name="subject">Case study method</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured interviews</field><field name="subject">Market orientations in education</field><field name="subject">Analytic networks</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16021/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intellectuals in the Australian Press</field><field name="creator">Murray, Craig</field><field name="description">The notion of the 'public intellectual' has been a recurring discussion topic within sociology and the humanities for decades. Yet it has been largely neglected within media and cultural studies. Accordingly, few scholars have discussed in much depth how public intellectuals operate within the media and what functions this media role may facilitate. Intellectuals in the Australian Press is an exploration into this generally overlooked area of scholarship. It aims to provide three levels of insight into the topic. Firstly, the study looks closely at the appearance and the function of public intellectuals in the Australian press. It outlines how public intellectuals contribute to the newspapers and how newspapers contribute to Australian public intellectual life. Secondly, the thesis outlines and examines in detail three types of public intellectual in Australia. Specifically, it examines the journalist, the academic and the think tank researcher as types of intellectual who write regularly for Australia's newspapers. Thirdly, Intellectuals in the Australian Press delivers detailed intellectual biographies of three of Australia's most prominent press intellectuals, each of whom exemplifies one of these three categories. These commentators are The Australian's Paul Kelly, The Age's Robert Manne, and the Sydney Morning Herald's Gerard Henderson.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectuals</field><field name="subject">Public Intellectuals</field><field name="subject">Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Political Columns</field><field name="subject">Political Columnists</field><field name="subject">Journalists</field><field name="subject">Academics</field><field name="subject">Think Tanks</field><field name="subject">Paul Kelly</field><field name="subject">Robert Manne</field><field name="subject">Gerard Henderson</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16022/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heuristic Optimization of Boolean Functions and  Substitution Boxes for Cryptography</field><field name="creator">Burnett, Linda Dee</field><field name="description">Fundamental to the electronic security of information and communication systems, is the correct use and application of appropriate ciphers. The strength of these ciphers, particularly in their ability to resist cryptanalytic attacks, directly in  uences the overall strength of the entire system. The strength of the underlying cipher is reliant upon a robust structure and the carefully designed interaction between components in its architecture. Most importantly, however, cipher strength is critically dependent on the strength of the individual components of which it is comprised.    Boolean functions and substitution boxes (s-boxes) are among the most common and essential components of ciphers. This is because they are able to provide a cipher with strengthening properties to resist known and potential cryptanalytic attacks. Thus, it is not surprising that significant research effort has been made in trying to develop ways of obtaining boolean functions and substitution boxes with  optimal achievable measures of desirable cryptographic properties. Three of the  main cryptographic properties required by strong boolean functions and s-boxes are nonlinearity, correlation immunity and propagation criteria, with different cryptographic applications requiring different acceptable measures of these and other properties. As combinations of cryptographic properties exhibited by functions  can be conicting, finding cryptographically strong functions often means that a trade-off needs to be made when optimizing property values. Throughout this thesis, the term "optimization" specifically refers to seeking to obtain the best achievable combination of target property values which may be exhibited by boolean functions and s-boxes, regardless of whether the relevant properties are  conflicting or complementary.    This thesis focusses on a particular class of techniques for obtaining strong functions for cryptographic applications, referred to as heuristic methods or, simply, heuristics. Three new heuristic methods, each aimed at generating boolean functions optimizing one or more of the main cryptographic properties mentioned above, in addition to other desirable properties, are presented. The first of the new heuristic methods developed for this thesis focusses on generating boolean functions which are balanced and exhibit very high nonlinearities. Highly nonlinear balanced functions are critical to many cryptographic applications, as they provide good resistance to linear cryptanalytic attacks. This first method is based on the recursive modification of a starting bent function and is shown to be highly successful and efficient at generating numerous such functions, which also exhibit low autocorrelation values, in a very short computational time.    The generation of balanced, correlation immune boolean functions that also exhibit the confl  icting property of high nonlinearity is the focus of the second new heuristic method developed for this thesis. By concatenating selected pairs of lower-dimensional boolean functions together in the Walsh Hadamard transform domain, direct optimization for both resilience and nonlinearity was able to take place at each level towards and for the final function. This second method was able to generate examples of boolean functions with almost all of the best known optimal combinations of target property values. Experiments have shown the success of this method in consistently generating highly nonlinear resilient boolean functions, for a range of orders of resilience, with such functions possessing optimal algebraic degree.    A third new heuristic method, which searches for balanced boolean functions which satisfy a non-zero degree of propagation criteria and exhibit high nonlinearity, is presented. Intelligent bit manipulations in the truth table of starting  functions, based on fundamental relationships between boolean function transforms and measures, provide the design rationale for this method. Two new function generation schemes have been proposed for this method, to efficiently  satisfy the requirements placed on the starting functions utilized in the computational  process. An optional process attempts to increase the algebraic degree of the resulting functions, without sacrificing the optimalities that are achievable. The validity of this method is demonstrated through the success of various  experimental trials.    Switching the focus from single output boolean functions to multiple output boolean functions (s-boxes), the effectiveness of existing heuristic techniques (namely Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing Method and combined Genetic Algorithm/Hill Climbing) in primarily being applied to improve the nonlinearity of s-boxes of various dimensions, is investigated. The prior success of these heuristic techniques for improving the nonlinearity of boolean functions has been previously demonstrated, as has the success of hill climbing in isolation when applied to bijective s-boxes. An extension to the bijective s-box optimization work is presented in this thesis. In this new research, a Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing Method  and the two in combination are applied to the nonlinearity and autocorrelation optimization of regular NxM s-boxes (N &gt; M) to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of each of these heuristics. A new breeding scheme, utilized in the Genetic Algorithm and combined Genetic Algorithm/Hill Climbing trials, is also presented. The success of experimental results compared to random regular s-box generation is demonstrated.    New research in applying the Hill Climbing Method to construct NxM sboxes (N &gt; M) required to meet specific property criteria is presented. The consideration of the characteristics desired by the constructed s-boxes largely dictated the generation process. A discussion on the generation process of the component functions is included. Part of the results produced by experimental trials were incorporated into a commonly used family of stream ciphers, thus further supporting the use of heuristic techniques as a useful means of obtaining strong functions suitable for incorporation into practical ciphers.    An analysis of the cryptographic properties of the s-box used in the MARS block cipher, the method of generation and the computational time taken to obtain this s-box, led to the new research reported in this thesis on the generation of MARS-like s-boxes. It is shown that the application of the Hill Climbing  Method, with suitable requirements placed on the component boolean functions, was able to generate multiple MARS-like s-boxes which satisfied the MARS sbox requirements and provided additional properties. This new work represented an alternative approach to the generation of s-boxes satisfying the MARS sbox  property requirements but which are cryptographically superior and can be obtained in a fraction of the time than that which was taken to produce the MARS s-box. An example MARS-like s-box is presented in this thesis.    The overall value of heuristic methods in generating strong boolean functions and substitution boxes is clearly demonstrated in this thesis. This thesis has made several significant contributions to the field, both in the development of new, specialized heuristic methods capable of generating strong boolean functions, and in the analysis and optimization of substitution boxes, the latter achieved  through applying existing heuristic techniques.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">boolean function</field><field name="subject">substitution box</field><field name="subject">heuristic techniques</field><field name="subject">Genetic Algorithm</field><field name="subject">Hill Climbing</field><field name="subject">cryptographic properties</field><field name="subject">autocorrelation</field><field name="subject">balance</field><field name="subject">nonlinearity</field><field name="subject">correlation immunity</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">propagation criteria</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16023/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epoxy/Clay Nanocomposites: Effect of Clay and Resin Chemistry on Cure and Properties</field><field name="creator">Siddans, Bradley</field><field name="description">Polymer/clay nanocomposites consisting of an epoxy resin matrix filled with organoclays have been investigated. The main objective of this study was to determine which combination of components led to the greatest enhancement in  properties of the epoxy resin. Exfoliation of the clay was desired, as exfoliated  nanocomposites are known to exhibit great improvements in mechanical properties [1].    The epoxy resins studied were di-functional DGEBA and tetra-functional TGDDM.  The epoxy resin was cured with three different hardeners, these included: the high functionality amine hardener, TETA, and two anhydride hardeners, accelerated MTHPA and pure HHPA. The three organoclays used, contained alkylammonium  cations and were also compared to the unmodified clay. Morphology was investigated by XRD and TEM, and the flexural properties of the resulting nanocomposites were studied. The effect that the addition of an organoclay has on the cure of the epoxy resin was investigated using MDSC. Both the  temperatures required to cure the resin with, and without, the clay, and any changes in the total heat flow that occurred were studied. The Tg&#129;++ of the cured nanocomposites was also measured using MDSC.    The heat flow results indicated that the clays added to the epoxy resins act as a physical barrier, which prevents the resin from reaching full cure. In the higher functional resin, the addition of clay resulted in a significant decrease in the total heat flow, suggesting that a large amount of epoxy remains uncured, and, as a result, there should be a reduction in the amount of cross-linking. The lower cross-link density led to a significantly lower Tg and the mechanical properties were also poorer.  The reactivity of the hardener towards the resin was found to have the greatest impact on the cured nanocomposite morphology. Intragallery polymerisation occurring at a faster rate than the extragallery polymerisation causes exfoliation. In order to achieve a balance that favours intragallery polymerisation, it was found that the curing reaction was required to be catalysed by the alkylammonium cation of the organoclay, and not catalysed by other means. The DGEBA cured with HHPA provided the largest layer expansion in the clay structure due to the alkylammonium cation catalysing the anhydride ring-opening reaction. The effect was not seen with TGDDM due to the tertiary amine in its structure. The accelerator within the MTHPA assisted extragallery polymerisation of the resin and the TETA cured readily without additional catalysis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymer</field><field name="subject">Clay</field><field name="subject">nanocomposites</field><field name="subject">epoxy resin</field><field name="subject">organoclays</field><field name="subject">DGEBA</field><field name="subject">TGDDM</field><field name="subject">MTHPA</field><field name="subject">HHPA</field><field name="subject">TETA</field><field name="subject">XRD</field><field name="subject">TEM</field><field name="subject">MDSC</field><field name="subject">polymerisation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16024/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards Bodydialogue : developing a process for enhancing the actor's physicalisation skills in rehearsal and performance</field><field name="creator">Radvan, Mark</field><field name="description">Bodydialogue is a coherent and simple system of exercises, rehearsal techniques, principles and aesthetic values which in application enhance the actor's ability to physicalise dramatic action and behaviour.

 Unlike many other movement systems taught in drama schools, such as Mime, Dance, Acrobatics or Alexander, which are grounded in their own discipline base, Bodydialogue is grounded in Stanislavsky's Acting through the Method of Physical Action, and as such is centered in the discipline of text-based Acting. It is thus first and foremost an approach to Acting via Physical Action and Physical Behaviour, rather than a study of Movement, or a movement genre.

It is the major cause of permanent vision loss in adults over 50 years and is increasing in prevalence and incidence, faster than the aging population would suggest. Early in the disease process (early ARM) there is little or no vision loss and there are only slight retinal changes with abnormal deposits within Bruch's membrane. As the disease progresses (late ARM or age-related macular degeneration, AMD) vision loss may be quite severe due to atrophy (dry AMD) or the development of chorioretinal neovascularisation (CNV, wet AMD). It is hard to predict from conventional eye examinations and clinical vision tests which cases will progress to the severe, dry or wet forms of the disease. Moreover, most of the conventional clinical tests are based upon subjective vision measures. Objective tests which detect ARM earlier would be a useful aid to diagnosis and to monitoring progression.    The multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) is a relatively new clinical tool which enables the recording of electrical potentials from multiple, small areas of the central retina and thus assesses function from specific retinal locations. It is therefore useful in detecting focal retinal diseases such as hereditary or acquired maculopathies or in monitoring retinal laser or surgical treatment effects.    There is cone and rod impairment in ARM and histopathological and psychophysical evidence for a preferential vulnerability of rods compared to cones. This research project investigated if an objective tool such as the mfERG could detect early ARM,its progression and the treatment effects of multiple photodynamic therapies (PDT) on retinal function in late ARM, prior to a battery of subjective vision measures.  For comparison purposes a subjective assessment of central retinal function was performed using high and low contrast distance visual acuities (VA), near VA, low luminance VA (SKILL cards), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson, P-R), saturated and desaturated Panel D-15 (sat Panel D-15, desat Panel D-15) and central visual fields (Humphrey 10-2, mean sensitivity, MS and mean defects, MD). As an objective assessment of central retinal function the cone- and rod-mediated multifocal electroretinograms were recorded.    Subjective and objective tests of retinal function were compared in early ARM and an age-matched control group (chapter 3). Seventeen eyes of seventeen subjects with early ARM and twenty control subjects with normal vision were measured. For the cone-mediated mfERG responses conventional averaging methods were used and results were correlated with subjective vision tests. The conventional cone-mediated mfERG failed to distinguish between the early ARM and control subjects whereas subjective vision measures such as HC- and LC-VA, desat Panel D-15, MS, P-R were significantly reduced in the ARM group. However, there were significant correlations between the cone-mediated mfERG and the desat Panel D-15 results in the ARM group. This suggests that the mfERG measures similar retinal processes that detect colour vision deficiency under desaturated conditions. There was no significant correlation between cone-mediated mfERG measures and funduscopic changes. The conclusion from this study was that the subjective vision tests detected early ARM better than the objective cone-mediated mfERG. Thus the aim of detecting early ARM objectively was not met by the cone-mediated mfERG suggesting the need to develop other objective tests such as a rod-mediated mfERG.    Whether the preferential rod vulnerability others have reported in early ARM could be detected by the rod-mediated mfERG was determined in the next study (chapter 4). A protocol for recording rod-mediated mfERG responses was developed by determining the optimal testing luminance to reduce the effect of stray light and elicit maximal rod-mediated responses. Sixteen of the seventeen ARM subjects and seventeen control subjects from the previous study were tested. For analysis, a customized computer template fitting method was developed in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). This method has been shown to be useful for low signal-to-noise ratio responses that characterize the rod-mediated mfERG. Significantly delayed rod-mediated mfERG responses were found whereas cone-mediated mfERG responses were within the normal range. This suggested that the effect of ARM on the rod system could be detected objectively with the rod-mediated mfERG before changes in the cone-mediated mfERG.    Which of the tests best detected progression of vision loss was investigated in chapter 5. Visual function of 26 (13 ARM and 13 control subjects) of the original 37 subjects (17 ARM and 20 control subjects) had cone- and rod-mediated mfERG and the subjective vision measures repeated after one year. The main purpose was to determine which of the tests best detected progression of vision loss. The mfERG results were analysed by using both averaged and local responses and by using the computer template fitting procedure. On average no significant worsening of either objective or subjective function measures was evident after one year. These results reinforce the slow progression of the disease. With a longer follow-up period progression of ARM may translate into measurable changes in the mfERG and the other visual function tests.    The effect of multiple photodynamic therapies (PDT) on cone- and rod-mediated function was assessed with the mfERG in the last study (chapter 6). The cumulative treatment effects of PDT in five subjects with late ARM were determined. Having demonstrated that the rod-mediated mfERG was applicable in early ARM, this study also aimed to investigate how useful it was in late ARM where there is substantially greater rod loss. Cone- and rod-mediated mfERGs, visual acuities, contrast sensitivities and central visual fields were investigated a week before treatment began and then one month after each PDT treatment. The subjects received three treatments each over an average period of five and a half months. In some subjects there were significant transient reductions in cone- and rod-mediated amplitudes possibly reflecting alterations in choroidal hypoperfusion dynamics one month after treatment. Further, b-wave component of the mfERG became increasingly misshapen after each PDT treatment suggesting an ischemic insult mainly targeting post-receptoral sites. However, objective and subjective function was stabilized after multiple PDT treatments in most of the subjects. This pilot study of five cases showed that there was no additional damage to cone- and rod-mediated outer retinal function after three PDT treatments.    One of the novel findings of this research was that the rod-mediated function measured with the mfERG was impaired in early ARM. This finding supports histopathological and psychophysical evidence of rod vulnerability in early ARM.  The results of these studies also suggest that early ARM affects different aspects of visual function which is reflected by different outcomes from objective and subjective vision tests. A model (chapter 7) based upon the results was developed proposing a hypoxic insult with a preferential alteration of post-receptoral sites in early ARM. The cone-mediated mfERG documented the retinal damage and possible treatment effects on outer retinal function of the multiple PDTs which did not further deteriorate. Thus, this technique might assist in the development of optimal treatment modalities for ARM, especially in retreatment regimes. Greater variability was found for the rod-mediated mfERG and its clinical use in PDT treatment regimes still needs to be investigated.    In conclusion, this research has provided a better understanding of the disease process and treatment effects in ARM and might contribute to improvements in diagnosis and treatment of ARM.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Age-related maculopathy</field><field name="subject">ARM</field><field name="subject">age-related macular degeneration</field><field name="subject">AMD</field><field name="subject">early ARM</field><field name="subject">late ARM</field><field name="subject">cone-mediated multifocal electroretinogram</field><field name="subject">rod-mediated multifocal electroretinogram</field><field name="subject">mfERG</field><field name="subject">subjective vision measures</field><field name="subject">psychophysical tests</field><field name="subject">objective vision measures</field><field name="subject">photodynamic therapy</field><field name="subject">PDT</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16026/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School choice in a new market context: A case study of The Shelbyville College</field><field name="creator">English, Rebecca Maree</field><field name="description">Since the 1990s in Australia, education policies have created an environment in which competition among schools has increased and parental choice of school has been encouraged. This has been coupled with practices of corporatisation, marketisation and performativity, which have led to the proliferation of a new type of independent school, which operate in the outer suburbs of large cities, target a specific niche market, and charge low cost fees.    This study examines the reasons parents are making the choice to send their children to a new, non-government schools in preference to other alternatives and the role of promotional material produced by the school in that choice. The case study of one such school, The Shelbyville College, involved in-depth interviewing of parents at the College as well as a Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough) of the College's prospectus and website which act as performative tools to measure the school's effectiveness in the market.    Using Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and cultural capital, the study showed that parents interviewed were choosing this type of school to increase the educational and social status and career prospects of their children as 'extraordinary children'. Through such discourses, parents as consumers of particular schooling products and their engagement with the promotional activities of the College are produced as 'good parents'. Seeking and engaging with promotional material helped remove any dissonance that may occur from a long and expensive relationship with the institution. In choosing this particular school, parents were seeking 'good Christian values' and the freedom to actively engage in their children's education.    The College, through its promotional efforts, promises to build on familial habitus and inculcate valued cultural capital in order to make students more successful academically and socially than their parents. The promotional materials of the website and prospectus emphasised the co-curricular involvement in music, speech and drama and invite parents into a discourse of success through the College's educational offering which creates 'extraordinary children'. The uniform mandated by the College is another 'text' in the production of extraordinary children as outlined in the prospectus and website and is an important site for identity production. The uniform demonstrates, not only the disciplinary regime and preparation for professional dress, but also the prestige and esteem derived from the consumption of high status products such as non-government schooling.    It is expected that the findings of this study will have relevance for government schools that are the primary competition for new, non-government schools and will lose funding if they continue to lose students. The study will have some implications for CEO (Catholic Education Office) schools that have traditionally provided a low-cost alternative to the government sector. Parents in the study reported choosing the new, non-government school because of differences in values, and perceptions of safety and status improvement offered by these schools. The continued success of the new, non-government schools is also likely to have broader effects on social and educational inequality in Australia through their effects on the government school sector.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School choice</field><field name="subject">Marketisation</field><field name="subject">Performativity</field><field name="subject">Habitus</field><field name="subject">Cultural capital</field><field name="subject">Institutional habitus</field><field name="subject">Non-government schools</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">School promotions</field><field name="subject">Parent school relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16027/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The antecedents of the employee loyalty-customer loyalty relationship</field><field name="creator">Peloso, Antony Frederick</field><field name="description">Increasing and maintaining customer loyalty has been shown to enhance service firm profitability. This research focuses on the antecedents of customer loyalty in a large
 
 national North American banking organisation, in particular the relationship between employee loyalty and customer loyalty, and further within the organisation, the antecedents of the employee loyalty-customer loyalty relationship. Thus the current research investigates the chain of events from managerial actions to customer loyalty with the aim of identifying relevant managerial practices and their influences within the organisation that lead to customer loyalty.
 
 
 
 The research provides tangible evidence supporting the importance of providing
 
 organisational resources to increase employee loyalty as a means of increasing customer
 
 loyalty in service organisations. To achieve this goal, the study suggests that a
 
 comprehensive set of managerial practices will enhance an organisation's service climate,
 
 foster positive employee attitudes and behaviours in relation to service provision, that
 
 impact on employee loyalty, service quality, and ultimately customer loyalty. These practices include support provided by senior leadership, the provision of resources that facilitate effective work practices, a positive management orientation on customers, and the use of employee evaluation and remuneration based on service-oriented behaviours and attitudes. By instituting these managerial practices, management can increase employee perceptions of self-efficacy, employees' beliefs in the abilities to perform well in their jobs, increase employee satisfaction, which in turn drive employee loyalty.
 
 
 
 These managerial practices also enhance the favourable nature of the organisation's
 
 service climate so that customer perceptions of service quality are likely to be more positive.
 
 
 
 Overall the study provides evidence to support the existence of a chain of events from
 
 managerial actions to employee and customer loyalty intentions. Evidence also exists to
 
 support the relationship between employee loyalty and customer loyalty, so that higher
 
 levels of loyalty within service a service organisation can potentially lead to higher levels of customer loyalty.
 
 
 
 The implications of the research are that management within service organisations can
 
 impact customer loyalty by focussing directly on service delivery issues and by providing a favourable service climate. Managers can also influence employee beliefs about their
 
 abilities to do their jobs and the level of satisfaction employees have within those
 
 organisational roles.
 
 
 
 The study also suggests that a service organisation's service climate is an important
 
 mechanism by which management can communicate to both employees and customers that a customer orientation is a primary managerial imperative. Finally, the study provides valuable insight into the processes by which employees perceive managerial orientation and support, and how those perceptions influence customer perceptions of service quality and impact on their loyalty intentions towards service organisations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">Perceived service quality</field><field name="subject">Service climate</field><field name="subject">Employee loyalty</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Employee self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">Employee empowerment</field><field name="subject">Behaviour-based evaluation</field><field name="subject">Direct leadership support</field><field name="subject">Senior leadership support</field><field name="subject">Work facilitation resources</field><field name="subject">Management customer orientation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16028/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and Development of a Model of Railway Track Dynamic Behaviour</field><field name="creator">Steffens, David Martyn</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis has identified and developed a sophisticated computer model for the analysis of railway track dynamic behaviour to be used by the Rail Cooperative Research Centre for Railway Engineering and Technologies (Rail CRC) in Australia.    To be competitive railway track owners need to extract as much performance as possible from their asset without serviceability or catastrophic failure. Railway track designers therefore need to develop more knowledge of the static and dynamic loadings that track may be subjected to in its lifetime. This would be best undertaken using computer modelling capable of quantifying the effects of train speed, traffic  mix, wheel impact loading and distribution of vehicle loads into the track.    A comprehensive set of criteria for the selection of a model of track dynamic behaviour was developed. An international review of state-of-the-art models which represented the railway track structure under the loading of a passing train was undertaken. The models' capabilities were assessed and a number of potential models identified.    A benchmark test was initiated to compare current models available throughout the international railway research community. This unique benchmark test engaged six researchers to compare their railway track models using a set of theoretical vehicle and track data. The benchmark results showed that significantly different results may be obtained by models, depending on the assumptions of the user in representing a particular track scenario. Differing complexities and modelling methods, the number of different input parameters required and the representation of the irregularities in the wheel and rail all have effect on the results produced.    As a result of these initiatives, the DARTS (Dynamic Analysis of Rail Track Structures) computer model was chosen for use by the Rail CRC. A user-friendly interface was created for DARTS by the writer, which was readily interpretable by railway design engineers. At the time of writing, DARTS was found to be suitable for detailed investigations planned by the Rail CRC for future research and was  provided for use through an Intellectual Property agreement with its author.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Railway</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="subject">DARTS</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Analysis of Rail Track Structures</field><field name="subject">Rail cooperative research centre</field><field name="subject">Railway engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16029/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Rebellious Distemper: A Foucaultian History of Breast Cancer to 1900</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Alexandra Leigh</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores some of the conditions of possibility underpinning contemporary breast cancer discourse, which is imbued with harsh moral, social and spiritual nuance. I have therefore explored a set of questions concerned with the past state of things in breast cancer care that laid the foundation for present approaches. I wanted to know how it became possible to speak what we now regard as the only truth about breast cancer. I wanted to understand how this truth was determined; who determined it, and who or what gave them the right to assert that their truth was the only truth. I wanted to acquire insight into the ways that thinking about and managing breast cancer based on this truth came to dominate the post-modern consciousness (rather than other, perhaps equally valid ways). And if it was possible, I wanted to open up a space for thinking differently about breast cancer. Finally, I wanted to test the fit of the ideas of the philosopher-historian, Michel Foucault, to these questions.    Foucault's notions of discontinuity, discipline, the gaze, normalising judgements and to a lesser extent, some aspects of power/knowledge and the ethics of the self are here tested on the surgical archive of breast cancer, which housed the discourse that best represented Western societal beliefs about the disease, and which had been invested by society with the greatest authority in its conception and management. The analytic framework - modes of consciousness - suggested by Foucault provided a coherent structure with which to explore the archive. I found that there are numerous elements in the archive instrumental in cementing the conditions of possibility for breast cancer discourse in our own time. This dissertation demonstrates that, as is the case in the present day, these were based on unstable truths about breast cancer that were a result of a complex of sociocultural and political norms rather than an objective truth.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">surgical archive</field><field name="subject">critical modality</field><field name="subject">enunciative modality</field><field name="subject">practical modality</field><field name="subject">analytic modality</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16030/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation, Structure and Spectra of  Meso-metalloporphyrins</field><field name="creator">Hodgson, Margaret Joan</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the synthesis and characterisation of new examples of meso-n1-organometallic porphyrins. These porphyrins were originally encountered as catalytic intermediates in the C-C bond forming reaction on the porphyrin periphery using palladium catalysts. They have now become a research topic in their own right and no other examples of this type of organometallic porphyrins had been reported at the outset of this work.    In Chapter 2, several examples of meso-palladioporphyrins were prepared in high yield using oxidative addition of the porphyrin-bromine bond to a suitable Pd(0)phosphine precursor. These phosphine precursors were prepared from Pd(PPh3)4 or Pd2dba3 plus either PPh3 or a chelating diphosphine. Several new examples of mono- and di palladium complexes of chelating diphosphines were prepared.    Chapter 3 looks at the preparation of meso-platinioporpyrins and the insertion of various central metal ions into the porphyrin ligand. Pairs of cis- and transisomers of the Pt(II) complexes were isolated from the oxidative addition of Pt(PPh3)3 to the free base and Ni(II) bromoporphyrins. The cis-isomer converted  to the trans upon heating. At room temperature the two isomers are geometrically stable and survive unchanged through column chromatography and slow recrystallisation. The central metal ion can be introduced either before or after the  oxidative addition to Pt(0). However, it is preferable to insert the metal ion last as the complexes of Br(MDPP) are rather insoluble (especially that of MnCl) and are more difficult to handle than the common intermediate trans-  [PtBr(H2DPP)(PPh3)2]. The oxidative addition of Pt(dba)2 to meso-bromo-DPP in the presence of PPh3 has also been shown to be an effective method of synthesising n1-organo platinum porphyrins in high yield. However, this method was unsuccessful when using  chelating diphosphines.    In Chapter 4, the physical properties of meso- metalloporphyrins are reported including electrochemistry, fluorescence spectroscopy and crystal structure determinations. The fluorescence intensities of the meso-substituted porphyrins (freebase and zinc complexes) are dramatically reduced in comparison with the  unsubstituted porphyrins. This fluorescence quenching is a dramatic example of the "heavy atom effect". Electrochemical measurements of freebase and Ni(II)porphyrins indicate that the organometallic fragment is a strong electron donor.    The visible absorption spectra for all Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes are typical for diarylporphyrins. All groups other than H in the 5- or 5- and 15-positions cause a red shift of the major absorption bands for both the free bases and central-metal complexes.    The crystal structure studies of the Pt(II) complexes include the complexes, cis-  [PtBr(MDPP)(PPh3)2] (M = H2, Ni), trans-[PtBr(MDPP)(PPh3)2] (M = H2, Ni, Zn and Co), trans-[PtCl(H2DPP)(PPh3)2] and trans-[PtBr(NiDPPBr)(PPh3)2]. In all these structures, the free bases are virtually planar while the metallo derivatives adopt a hybrid of the ruffled and saddled conformations.    Chapter 5 contains the initial studies of chiral palladioporphyrins, using three different types of chiral chelating diphosphine ligands. These chiral palladioporphyrins are readily prepared by oxidative addition of the Pd(0) precursor with bromoporphyrin. The asymmetry of the chiral ligand is detectable at the remote B-pyrrole protons in all the chiral complexes as eight doublets are observed in 1H NMR spectra. The chirality of these ligands in the porphyrin  complexes induces circular dichroism in the region of the porphyrin electronic absorption. High optical activity is observed for the BINAP complexes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meso-metalloporphyrins</field><field name="subject">porphyrins</field><field name="subject">synthesis</field><field name="subject">characterisation</field><field name="subject">periphery</field><field name="subject">palladium</field><field name="subject">catalysts</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16031/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of International Competitiveness: A Comparative Study of the Sugar Industry in Australia, Brazil, and the European Union</field><field name="creator">Banerjee, Shantanu</field><field name="description">The dissertation involves an investigation into the circumstances of international competitiveness and how it is pursued by firms from different sugar producing and marketing nations. Understanding of competitiveness has primarily been pursued in terms of economic variables and market conditions. The roles of the government, the socio-cultural-political context in international business, and their effects on competitiveness have largely been ignored. This study integrates perspectives from strategic management, the resource-based view of the firm, and international business to propose a conceptual framework of international competitiveness. The work advances understanding of competitiveness in international business in two ways. First, it develops a conceptual framework that captures the socio-political element of a nation's industry and the crucial role it plays in achieving international competitiveness. Second, it combines firm, industry, strategy, and socio-political influences. Those are involved in a multi-level hierarchical process between firms, industry and the nation that effectively generates competitiveness. The dissertation employs a qualitative method of comparative analysis between Australia, Brazil and the European Union, which are the three dominant sugar producing and exporting economies in the world. A series of propositions are presented on the four identified influences on international competitiveness. How firms from different nations pursue these is highlighted. After considering the varied approaches for attaining international competitiveness, implications for further research and for theory, policy and practice are outlined.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competitiveness</field><field name="subject">Sugar</field><field name="subject">Production and Marketing Regimes</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Brazil</field><field name="subject">European Union</field><field name="subject">Conceptual Framework</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16032/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-igniting the Gothic: Contemporary Drama in the Classic Mode</field><field name="creator">Williams, Ian Kennedy</field><field name="description">While the gothic in its various interpretations is well established in contemporary culture, the traditional form, rooted in its late eighteenth century literary conventions, would seem to have little relevance for theatre audiences today.

An analysis of the writing of my play Burn, which presents as a contemporary family drama, will demonstrate how the narrative can be structured with deliberate reference to the established tropes of the classic gothic mode.

The completion of eight chlamydial genome sequences identified three different RNA polymerase sigma factor (&#243;) genes. Temporal gene expression analysis has predicted that each &#243; may play an integral role in controlling the development cycle. This thesis examines the role of the chlamydial alternate sigma factor, &#243;54 (rpoN) and the potential mechanism for the control the developmental cycle and disease pathogenesis. To achieve this, we searched the genome for putative &#243;54 promoters, validated the findings by DNA-binding assays, and examined the roles of the genes predicted to be regulated by &#243;54.    This study applied a bioinformatics approach to search for additional &#243;54 regulated genes in C. trachomatis L2. A reduced consensus sequence (TGGCACnnnnnTTGC) identified two previously published &#243;54 promoter sequences upstream of CT652.1 and CT683. A modified consensus sequence (TGG-N9-TGC) was applied to the C. trachomatis D genome in Findpatterns yielded 512 potential targets of which 20 by virtue of sequence orientation and distance upstream of the predicted ORF start codon    Primer extension analysis of total RNA isolated at 24 hours post-infection mapped the 5' RNA end upstream for acpS (CT100), yhf0_1 (CT258), SAM (CT404), lpxA (CT531), hypothetical proteins CT652.1 and CT683, and htrA (CT823) to the predicted &#243;54 promoters. Three candidates (CT291, CT404, and CT847) were mapped to putative &#243;70-like &#243;66 promoters. No transcript start sites were detected for the remaining &#243;54 promoter candidates. Two transcripts were detected from predicted &#243;66 and &#243;54 tandem promoters upstream of CT404. Primer extension analysis of the CT404 transcripts from RNA isolated at 4, 8, 12, 24 and 32 hours post-infection showed a decrease between 12 hours and 24 hours post-infection in transcripts  thought to be generated from the predicted &#243;66 promoter. Transcripts from the predicted &#243;54 promoter were identified throughout development.    Temporal gene expression profiles of the candidate genes with predicted &#243;54 promoters (CT652.1, CT683, CT100, CT258, CT531 and CT823) were resolved throughout the C. trachomatis L2 developmental cycle using real-time PCR. Transcripts for CT608 and CT609 were detected early in the cycle, while strong transcript levels were detected for CT258, CT531 and CT823 after the appearance of CT609 (rpoN). Low levels of CT652.1 and CT683 were measured, in the mid to late phase of the cycle, and transcripts for CT100 appeared at lower levels during the middle phase of the cycle.    The functional assay of the predicted &#243;54 promoters required the generation of recombinant C. trachomatis L2 &#243;54 (rRpoN). The C. trachomatis rpoN was cloned into a bacterial expression system (pQE70) and the recombinant proteins purified for subsequent DNA mobility shift assays. Expression of rRpoN was hampered by low copy numbers, and unusual physical characteristics. DNA binding and mobility shift assays using rRpoN extracts against the chlamydial CT652.1 &#243;54 promoter, plus two characterised E. coli &#243;54 promoters (hypA and hycA), were successful if E. coli core RNA polymerase was added to the assay. All 20 candidates with predicted &#243;54 promoters were analysed with EMSA using rRpoN extract. The promoters upstream of CT100, CT223, CT258, CT322, CT652.1 and CT683 showed affinity towards the recombinant rRpoN-E. coli core RNA polymerase holoenzyme complex.    Searches for potential chlamydial &#243;54 transcription initiation activators were made using the Multiple Em for Motif Elucidation (MEME) software, looking to identify the DNA binding motifs. The upstream promoter regions of CT100, CT223, CT258, CT322, CT531, CT652.1, CT683 and CT823 in C. trachomatis L2 and orthologs found in other species of Chlamydia were analysed. The software identified a near palindromic sequence upstream of CT100 orthologs in C. trachomatis D and C. trachomatis MoPn (CAACCCAAC and CACCACAAC) where as a CT531- and CT823-specific motif was also discovered (CCGTTGTAGAATCTC).    It is beginning to emerge that &#243;54 may regulate the expression of proteins required for the formation of the cell wall. Since the expression of the &#243;54 transcript, rpoN, coincides with the morphological change from the non-infectious RB to the infectious EB, predictions could be made concerning which genes are potentially regulated by &#243;54.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chlamydia</field><field name="subject">RpoN</field><field name="subject">&#243;54</field><field name="subject">promoter</field><field name="subject">transcription</field><field name="subject">electrophoretic mobility shift assay</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16034/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secure Key Establishment for Mobile Networks</field><field name="creator">Tin, Yiu Shing (Terry)</field><field name="description">Informal analysis of authenticated key establishment (ake) protocols was commonly  accepted as the valid argument for their security in the past. Although it  can provide some confidence in protocol correctness, experience has shown time  and again that ake protocols are likely to contain flaws even after an informal  analysis is completed. Therefore, it has become increasingly common to expect a  formal analysis, and preferably a mathematical proof, of any published ake protocol  in order to obtain increased confidence in its security.    In this research we use an appropriate model for analysing ake protocols based on its features and properties. The model allows us to design ake protocols modularly and reuse existing protocol components. We provide a detailed  description of its formalisation, operations and usage. This description also includes  ways of extracting new protocol components from existing ake protocols.    Following the description of the model, we propose a new unauthenticated key  establishment protocol for two-party communications. By composing this protocol  with authentication protocols, we can construct several new secure ake protocols.  These new protocols are compared with existing protocols for their computational  efficiency. The comparison shows that our new proven secure protocols  are as efficient as the existing protocols with an informal security analysis.    We then propose a three-party key establishment protocol which involves a  trusted server and two users. We also propose a non-interactive authentication  protocol and discuss it and a variant of it. These components are used to construct  a secure three-party ake protocol that supports a privacy framework. This  framework allows users to remain anonymous while conducting electronic transactions  with an independent service provider.    A new password-based authentication protocol is proposed to address the  problem of authentication using passwords. This protocol carries a proof of  security and satisfies a slightly relaxed definition of security. We demonstrate its application by composing it with existing key establishment protocols. To maximise its use, we modified a two-party key establishment protocol to become three-party server based. By using the server for authentication, two users within  a common network domain can establish a secure session key.    Only a small number of ake protocols are demonstrated in this thesis. There  exist many more provably secure ake protocols that can be constructed using the  protocol components presented by applying the approach of "mix and match".  That is, each new component results in a number of new ake protocols depending  on the number of existing components.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Provable security</field><field name="subject">modular approach</field><field name="subject">Canetti-Krawczyk model</field><field name="subject">secure protocol</field><field name="subject">secure protocol design</field><field name="subject">mobile key establishment</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16035/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arts Facilitation and Creative Community Culture: A Study of Queensland Arts Council</field><field name="creator">Richards, Michael John</field><field name="description">This thesis adopts a Cultural Industries framework to examine how Queensland's arts  council network has, through the provision of arts products and services, contributed  to the vitality, health and sustainability of Queensland's regional communities. It  charts the history of the network, its configuration and impact since 1961, with  particular focus on the years 2001 - 2004, envisages future trends, and provides an  analysis of key issues which may be used to guide future policies and programs.    Analysis is guided by a Cultural Industries understanding of the arts embedded in  everyday life, and views the arts as a range of activities which, by virtue of their  aesthetic and symbolic dimensions, enhance human existence through their impact  on both the quality and style of human life. Benefits include enhanced leisure and  entertainment options, and educational, social, health, personal growth, and  economic outcomes, and other indirect benefits which enrich environment and  lifestyle.    Queensland Arts Council (QAC) and its network of branches has been a dominant  factor in the evolution of Queensland's cultural environment since the middle of the  20th century. Across the state, branches became the public face of the arts, drove  cultural agendas, initiated and managed activities, advised governments, wrote  cultural policies, lobbied, raised funds and laboured to realise cultural facilities and  infrastructure.    In the early years of the 21st century, QAC operates within a complex, competitive  and rapidly changing environment in which orthodox views of development,  oriented in terms of a left / right, or bottom up / top down dichotomy, are breaking  down, and new convergent models emerge. These new models recognise synergies  between artistic, social, economic and political agendas, and unite and energise them  in the realm of civil society. QAC is responding by refocusing policies and programs  to embrace these new models and by developing new modes of community  engagement and arts facilitation.    In 1999, a major restructure of the arts council network saw suffragan branches  become autonomous Local Arts Councils (LACs), analogous to local Cultural  Industry support organisations. The resulting network of affiliated LACs provides a  potentially highly effective mechanism for the delivery of arts related products and  services, the decentralisation of cultural production, and the nurturing across the state  of Creative Community Cultures which equip communities, more than any other  single asset, to survive and prosper through an era of unsettling and relentless  change.    Historical, demographic, behavioural (participation), and attitudinal data are  combined to provide a picture of arts councils in seven case study sites, and across  the network. Typical arts council members are characterised as omnivorous cultural  consumers and members of a knowledge class, and the leadership of dedicated  community minded people is identified as the single most critical factor determining  the extent of an LAC's activities and its impact on community.    Analysis of key issues leads to formulation of eight observations, discussed with  reference to QAC and LACs, which might guide navigation in the regional arts field.  These observations are then reformulated as Eight Principles Of Effective Regional  Arts Facilitation, which provide a framework against which we might evaluate arts  policy and practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Society</field><field name="subject">Community Arts</field><field name="subject">Community Cultural Development</field><field name="subject">Community Revitalisation</field><field name="subject">Community Engagement</field><field name="subject">Creative Class</field><field name="subject">Creative Industries</field><field name="subject">Cultural Policy</field><field name="subject">Excellence</field><field name="subject">Elite(s)</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Class</field><field name="subject">Meritocracy</field><field name="subject">Regional Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16036/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imaging China through the Olympics: Government Publicity and Journalism</field><field name="creator">Li, Hui</field><field name="description">Chinese propaganda nowadays is focused on producing soft-sell messages  international consumption instead of hard-core propaganda of agitation.  emphasis on "image design" as Jiang Zemin coined it, rather than on  propagation of Communist ideals.

The creative practice was partially represented in an exhibition of paintings, drawings, photographs and artist books entitled Traces, held at WiseART Gallery, 166 Ann St, Brisbane, March 2005. The written component is represented in this manuscript.    This case study illustrates the creative process of an individual artistic practice through intuitive inquiry, which utilized self-observation methods such as painting, drawing, photographing, bookmaking, exhibitions, journaling, questioning and mindfulness. Intuitive inquiry is outlined as the predominant method of both the phenomenon of art making in this case, as well as the method used to study the creative process. The concept of intuitive inquiry as a research method, by its similarity to this particular creative process, was well suited to studying its delicate, preconscious, internally reflective and reflexive activities. Intuitive inquiry also underpins the exceptional, transformative experiences of the artist, which are often excluded from conventional empirical research.    The results of this study demonstrate that it is through the hermeneutic interpretations of process, product and dialogue that a deeper understanding of the creative process is gained. The hermeneutic model of creative process that emerged (Fig 4.14) will assist others in a deeper understanding of how creative process can be utilized in generating new knowledge. More importantly, it is this creative interpretive process that can lead to transformative experiences, which encourage both the artist and the audience to search for a deeper engagement with each other and the world.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intuition</field><field name="subject">Intuitive inquiry</field><field name="subject">Creative practice as research</field><field name="subject">Creative process</field><field name="subject">Creativity</field><field name="subject">Transformation</field><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Artifact</field><field name="subject">Painting</field><field name="subject">Autobiography</field><field name="subject">Autoethnography</field><field name="subject">Subjectivity</field><field name="subject">Mindfulness</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Journaling</field><field name="subject">Self observation</field><field name="subject">Stream of consciousness</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16038/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effectiveness of Wildlife Corridors in Facilitating Connectivity: Assessment of a Model System from the Australian Wet Tropics</field><field name="creator">Horskins, Kerrilee</field><field name="description">Wildlife corridors have become a widely adopted management strategy for the conservation of species in fragmented habitats. Fragmentation reduces the size of habitat patches and increases the isolation of the populations within them, potentially resulting in extinction due to stochastic processes. The provision of a  corridor between habitat patches is believed to increase the level of connectivity through the integration of populations into a single demographic unit, thus increasing the probability of survival. This assumption remains largely untested due to both a lack of investigation, and design limitations in some of the few studies performed. Connectivity is often assumed to occur simply from the presence of individuals within the corridor.    Design criteria essential for the rigorous assessment of connectivity were identified  and a landscape meeting these criteria selected. The vegetation within the corridor was found to be comparable in both structure and species composition to that of the patches that it connected. Two target species (Melomys cervinipes and Uromys caudimaculatus) were shown to occur along the corridor but not within the  surrounding matrix. The combination of these factors indicated that the corridor was  suitable for use as a model system and ensured that any subsequent results truly reflected the capacity of the corridor to function in the desired manner.    The population structure was similar within the corridor and the connected patches for both species. Weights of individuals, sex ratios and the percentage of juveniles were consistent between the two system components, suggesting that the corridor contained breeding populations. Connectivity was therefore possible via generational gene flow for both species, while long distance movement events for U.  caudimaculatus also indicated that direct movement between habitat patches may  be possible for this larger species.    Despite all ecological parameters indicating that connectivity was likely, genetic  markers (mtDNA and nDNA) revealed significant population differentiation between the connected patches for both species. Populations linked by the corridor and those in isolated habitats were found to show the same level of genetic  differentiation. Sampling at a finer spatial scale within connected patches and a  continuous control habitat showed that population differentiation was common for M. cervinipes. Given the continuity of suitable vegetation, and the presence of individuals of breeding age along the corridor system, this was attributed to social structuring. U. caudimaculatus populations also showed evidence of genetic differentiation within a connected patch and along the corridor, despite panmixia  within the continuous habitat. Having investigated a model system, the data from this study has implications for other wildlife corridor studies and for landscape managers. Firstly, the advantages of using an integrated ecological and genetic approach have been demonstrated.  While genetic data determined the level of connectivity, the ecological data provided an understanding of the processes operating within the system. Secondly, the level of scale at which wildlife corridor studies are conducted may need addressing. Most  studies currently treat a fragmented landscape in a binary manner and consider the connected patch to be the finest "grain". However, the processes responsible for the lack of connectivity were found to operate at the much finer within-patch scale.  Finally, this study clearly indicated that not all wildlife corridors will provide connectivity between the connected populations and that connectivity cannot be inferred from the presence of individuals within the corridor. Given that social behaviour such as territorial defence and philopatry are common in many species,  especially small mammals, a lack of connectivity via a wildlife corridor may be more common than currently assumed. The successful use of wildlife corridors as a management strategy, and the accurate assessment of their effectiveness therefore requires careful consideration of not only structural attributes of the corridor, but also behavioural, demographic and genetic parameters of the target species.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife corridor</field><field name="subject">connectedness</field><field name="subject">connectivity</field><field name="subject">matrix</field><field name="subject">corridor system</field><field name="subject">Australian wet tropics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16039/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Politics of Friends in Modern Architecture : 1949-1987</field><field name="creator">Troiani, Igea  Santina</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to reveal paradigms associated with the operation of Western architectural oligarchies. The research is an examination into "how" dominant architectural institutions and their figureheads are undermined through the subversive collaboration of younger, unrecognised architects. By appropriating theories found in Jacques Derrida's writings in philosophy, the thesis interprets the evolution of post World War II polemical architectural thinking as a series of political friendships.
 
 
 
 In order to provide evidence, the thesis involves the rewriting of a portion of modern architectural history, 1949-1987. Modern architectural history is rewritten as a series of three friendship partnerships which have been selected because of their subversive reaction to their respective establishments. They are English architects, Alison Smithson and Peter Smithson; South African born architect and planner, Denise Scott Brown and North American architect, Robert Venturi; and Greek architect, Elia Zenghelis and Dutch architect, Rem Koolhaas.
 
 
 
 Crucial to the undermining of their respective enemies is the friends' collaboration on subversive projects. These projects are built, unbuilt and literary. Warring publicly through the writing of seminal texts is a significant step towards undermining the dominance of their ideological opponents. It also appears that through the making of these projects, the unrecognised architects are able to convert themselves to being recognised as new figureheads.
 
 
 
 This thesis contends that as a consequence of the power within each of the three friendship partnerships, the architects are enabled to collaborate against the dominant ideology of their respective enemies and gain status. It also contends that a cycle of friendship and warring is the political system by which the institution of modern architecture has historically reengineered itself to suit the times.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architecture - modern architecture; History &#150; modern architectural history</field><field name="subject">1949-1987; Architects - Alison Smithson</field><field name="subject">Peter Smithson</field><field name="subject">Denise Scott Brown</field><field name="subject">Robert Venturi</field><field name="subject">Elia Zenghelis</field><field name="subject">Rem Koolhaas</field><field name="subject">Philosophy - Jacques Derrida</field><field name="subject">Politics of friendship; Subversive collaboration</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16040/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eliciting Expert Knowledge for Bayesian Logistic Regression in Species Habitat Modelling</field><field name="creator">Kynn, Mary</field><field name="description">This research aims to develop a process for eliciting expert knowledge and incorporating this knowledge as prior distributions for a Bayesian logistic regression model.  This work was motivated by the need for less data reliant methods of modelling species habitat distributions.  A comprehensive review of the research from both cognitive psychology and the statistical literature provided specific recommendations for the creation of an elicitation scheme.  These were incorporated into the design of a Bayesian logistic regression model and accompanying elicitation scheme.  This model and scheme were then implemented as interactive, graphical software called ELICITOR created within the BlackBox Component Pascal environment.  This software was specifically written to be compatible with existing Bayesian analysis software, winBUGS as an odd-on component.  The model, elicitation scheme and software were evaluated through five case studies of various fauna and flora species.  For two of these there were sufficient data for a comparison of expert and data-driven models.  The case studies confirmed that expert knowledge can be quantified and formally incorporated into a logistic regression model.  Finally, they provide a basis for a thorough discussion of the model, scheme and software extensions and lead to recommendations for elicitation research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayesian statistics</field><field name="subject">component software</field><field name="subject">elicit</field><field name="subject">expert knowledge</field><field name="subject">informative prior</field><field name="subject">logistic regression</field><field name="subject">presence absence models</field><field name="subject">prior</field><field name="subject">species habitat models</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16041/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young Women's Sun-Protective Attitudes and Behaviours: The Role of Social Influence  Factors</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Natalie G</field><field name="description">Sun protective attitudes and intentions were investigated in 2 experiments and 1 field study. Participants in the first experiment were female Caucasian university students between the ages of 17 and 35 years (N = 102). A 2 x 2 experimental design manipulated message frame and the normative context and measured the level of identification with the ingroup (university students) to examine intentions to engage  in sun protective behaviour within the next fortnight and within the next month. To  manipulate levels of ingroup normative support, participants studied bar graphs and  testimonial statements showing ostensible information on the percentage of  recreational sportswomen engaging in sun-protective behaviours in comparison to  non-sporting women.    To manipulate the message frame, messages were presented in either a gain  or loss frame format. Regression analyses revealed significant effects for prior  attitudes towards engaging in sun-protective behaviour in the next fortnight and also  in the next month. Contrary to expectations, no interactive effects involving norms  were found in the prediction of intentions. The lack of significant results were  attributed to the unsuitability of the sample population (university students) in  relation to sun-protective behaviours.    To test third person perceptions, two measures of perceptions of influence  were assessed. The first measure assessed perceptions of how much the target groups  would be affected by the sun-protective advertisement and the second assessed  perceptions of how much target groups would engage in regular sun-protective  behaviour after reading the sun-protective advertisement. Results of the repeated  measures mixed ANOVAS revealed reversed third person perceptions between self  and other when participants were exposed to a supportive ingroup norms and a  Sun-protective attitudes and behaviours vi  classic third person effect when participants were exposed to a non-supportive  ingroup norm. Similar patterns of results were found for perceptions between  ingroup and outgroup members. It was concluded from study one that the  manipulations due to ingroup norms may not have been effective for a sample of  participants whose personal relevance for sun-protective behaviour was not strong.    In study 2, sun protective attitudes, intentions and behaviour at a 2-week  follow-up were investigated in an experimental study using a population more likely  to engage in decision-making in relation to the target behaviour; Caucasian  sportswomen between the ages of 17 and 35 years (N = 101). The 2 x 2 experimental  design manipulated the normative context and image norms and measured the level  of identification with ingroup (young recreational sportswomen). Ingroup norms  were manipulated in a similar manner to study 1. Image norms were manipulated  through the inclusion of a colour photograph featuring a sportswoman whose skin  tone had been manipulated via a computer imaging program (Photoshop 6.0) to  appear either pale or tanned. Regression analyses revealed a significant 2-way  interaction for ingroup norm x identification on intentions. When decomposed, the  interaction showed that participants who identified strongly with their ingroup had  stronger intentions to engage in sun-protective behaviour in the next fortnight when  exposed to a supportive ingroup norm. The findings lend support to the impact of  social influence on intentions to engage in sun-protective behaviours. A trend was  also revealed for the 2-way interaction for group norms x image norms on attitudes  towards engaging in sun-protective behaviour in the next fortnight. The trend  suggested that participants exposed to a pale image norm had more positive attitudes  towards engaging in sun-protective behaviour when exposed to a supportive group  norm in comparison to those exposed to a non-supportive group norm.  Sun-protective attitudes and behaviours vii    Thus, study 2 provided support for the interactive effects of ingroup norms  and identification on intentions to engage in sun-protective behaviours suggesting  that group norms, conceptualised from a SIT/SCT perspective, may be important in  the sun-protective decision-making process. Study 2 also provided some support for  the interactive effects of ingroup norm and image norms on attitudes towards  engaging in sun-protective behaviours, highlighting the importance of investigating  the effects of social influence factors in young sportswomen's sun-protective  decision making processes.    In study 3, participants were Caucasian women between the ages of 17 and  35 years (N = 123) who were visitors to beaches on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland,  Australia. A model based on the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991) was  developed incorporating additional normative factors (i.e., image norms, group  norms and personal norms). The revised TPB model was then compared to two  models previously tested in the context of health behaviours. The first comparative  model was based on Jackson and Aiken's (2000) psychosocial model of sunprotection  and, the second model was based on Gibbons, Gerrard, Blanton and  Russell's (1998) prototype/willingness model. The models were examined using the  EQS structural equation modelling program which revealed that the TPB-based  model provided the most parsimonious fit to the data. The results support the  inclusion of different sources of social influence (i.e., group norms and personal  norms) in a TPB-based predictive model for sun-protective intentions and  behaviours. Results revealed it is important to consider the impact of group norms,  from a SIT/SCT perspective, on young women's sun-protective decision-making  processes. Results also showed that it is important to consider the impact of young  women's personal norms (i.e., internal moral rules and expectations about their own  Sun-protective attitudes and behaviours viii  behaviour) in the sun-protective decision-making process. Overall, the findings of  the program of research suggested that it was specific referent norms that were  important in the sun-protective decision-making process rather than more broad and  general societal norms.    Overall, the program of studies established the important role of social  influence factors in young women's sun-protective decision making processes. The  program of studies highlighted important theoretical and practical contributions that  can aid in the development and implementation of more effective sun-protection  messages to motivate young women to engage in sun-protective behaviours. The  current program of research adds to the field of research by providing a comparison  of the impact of various sources of social influence on attitudes and intentions to  engage in sun-protective behaviour. The current research also empirically elucidates  the core dimensions, mechanisms and relationships underlying the formation of sunprotective attitudes, intentions and behaviours.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sun-protective behaviour</field><field name="subject">theory of planned behaviour</field><field name="subject">intentions</field><field name="subject">group norms</field><field name="subject">personal norms</field><field name="subject">image norms</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16042/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Generation and Evolvement of Ideas in the Lifeworld of Artists and the Practice of Their Art: Implications for Education</field><field name="creator">Kellow, Amanda Lee</field><field name="description">How artists develop their ideas has been envisaged as a mysterious and intriguing  process, difficult to understand or emulate. The "mystery" of how art ideas evolve has carried through to education, where students and teachers may view the introduction of how to formulate ideas as an unachievable task. Art educators have recognised the investigation of how artists think through the progression of their own practice as being an important aspect of understanding the evolvement of art ideas,  and have advocated that approaches to teaching and learning should be grounded in such artistic thinking. This study was based on the notion that it is important for research to give insights into the differing ways visual art ideas are constructed and to also identify the influences that may impact on this process. Through researching the formulation of art ideas over time in influential contexts, a revealing picture of the process of art idea evolvement emerged.

The goal was to use an involvement framework - comprised of the elements of power, information, rewards, knowledge, and a fifth element developed for this thesis, integration - to select human resource practices that impact on work outcomes, and to develop an understanding of intervening  involvement processes. Data was collected from 200 work groups in a public sector organization of 4,300 employees, engaged in large infrastructure projects, including bridge and road construction and maintenance. Group-levels of human resource practice implementation were collected through surveying a sample of  employees from each work group. Data on work outcomes and high involvement work processes were collected three months later through an organizational survey of all 4,300 employees. This process was repeated 12 months later to  identify the unique effects of human resource practices and investigate causal relationships and lagged effects. Involvement-oriented human resource practices were found to impact significantly on work outcomes. High involvement work processes explained significant variance in outcomes and mediated the relationship between HR practices and outcomes. Longitudinal analyses  supported the existence of lagged effects of involvement-oriented human resource practices on high involvement work processes, and high involvement work processes on work outcomes. The research supports the utility of an involvement framework for practice selection and for explaining mediating processes on work outcomes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human resources</field><field name="subject">Involvement</field><field name="subject">Morale</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Team innovation</field><field name="subject">Absenteeism</field><field name="subject">Turnover</field><field name="subject">Commitment</field><field name="subject">Group</field><field name="subject">Affect</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16044/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who am I as Teacher?  Promoting the Active Positioning of Self within Teaching Realities.</field><field name="creator">Black, Alison Lizette</field><field name="description">What it means to teach is becoming progressively more complex and ambiguous. For teachers, remaining confident about personal conceptions of teaching is becoming ever more difficult as a result of increased demands and changing educational environments. It is not surprising then, that the teachers who engaged in the collaborative inquiry in which this thesis is grounded so often asked "Who am I as teacher?"    Six narrative accounts are developed in this thesis from data gathered while working with fourteen early childhood teachers employed in child care centres. During fortnightly meetings, across a period of five months, the researcher worked with two groups of teachers in a process of collaborative inquiry. The accounts highlight the many forces that make working in the contemporary work context of child care unique and sometimes difficult, and highlight teachers' meaning-making in everyday teaching situations. Attention to the dynamism and intensity of this contemporary workplace, and identification of ongoing dilemmas, provided a place to understand what it means to be a teacher within the realities of contemporary educational settings. Providing a collaborative context for acknowledging these realities, whilst re-directing reflection to focus on 'self-as-teacher' encouraged teachers to view the multiplicity, contradiction and emotion of their work differently. Situating self in the work context provided an opportunity to encompass more than evidence of ambiguity, to tune into enduring images and personal conceptions of being a teacher.    The narrative methodology employed in this thesis united several forms of data representation. Conversation, metaphor, drawing, and written reflection in the form of life history writing and journal writing which mapped dilemma experiences, enabled teachers to make multiple probes into their ways of knowing about managing the ambiguity, contradictions and competing imperatives characteristic of many everyday teaching situations. Combining these forms of data representation encouraged teachers to consider the ways past experiences, present circumstances and visions for the future influenced their images of self-as-teacher and teaching actions. These were useful tools for eliciting the products and processes of reflection, self-awareness and change in practice. Creative, non-linear forms such as visual imagery and writing, together with narrative reporting were catalysts for revealing multiple connections and meanings for actions. Using the construct of image as the lens through which to view these meanings enabled the emergence of many dimensions of teachers' ways of knowing including emotions, moral and ethical values and dilemmas, and ideals about teaching. Collaborative meaning-making supported teachers' efforts to re-construct what they knew about the knowledge that informed their teaching. Attending to these personal ways of knowing enhanced teachers' understanding of themselves and their teaching context.    As they made sense of their feelings, current knowledge, need for knowledge and how these related to work dilemmas, teachers found they could picture more clearly their teacher selves. They were also able to author more deliberatively their place in their harmonious, discordant, rhythmic and irrhythmic world of work.    To capture the dynamism involved in actively positioning self to teach, this thesis draws on a metaphor of teaching as 'a making of a music'. The metaphor focuses attention on what teachers do to position themselves within teaching realities, in ways that create a workable fit between their ideals, their abilities and the demands of situations. The metaphor makes it possible to portray the dynamics through which feeling and responding to dissonance in teaching realities, and attending to personal professional knowledge, encourages active creating and intentional acts. Of importance is the interplay and interconnectedness of practical knowledge, teaching realities and teaching identity.    This thesis argues that self-directing teachers, who continually strive to improve their practice, have the ability to become critically aware of vibrations, rhythms, tonal qualities and discord in their work milieu and are able to work within these to make teaching like 'a making of a music'. The knowledge required to do this is not so much a matter of technique, knowing how to instruct, how to observe, how to manage behaviour and so on. It has more to do with knowing that work contexts inevitably shape what it is possible to do as a teacher, and that teaching identities are constructed and re-constructed within the particulars of time, place, relationships, rules, routines and experiences.    The thesis draws on the narratives to construct a theory of practice that is grounded in teachers' ways of knowing their experiences, their teaching contexts and themselves as teachers. It proposes four principles of practice for supporting teachers in their efforts to be the teachers they want to be. These principles direct attention to the need for teachers to acquire knowledge and skill conducive to dealing effectively with teaching realities. They were generated through attending carefully to what the teachers in this inquiry, and those reported in other studies, reveal about their teaching realities and what they consider they need to know in order to teach. The first principle of practice, which is an overarching principle for the other three, is:  An orientation to teaching that includes understanding of self and context, will support teachers' efforts to act intentionally within the intensity and ambiguity of contemporary workplaces.    This orientation can begin to develop when teacher education programs encourage teachers to attend more closely to the interplay of personal conceptions of what it means to teach and the realities of teaching contexts; to understanding what it means to act intentionally within the dynamism, intensity and ambiguity of contemporary workplaces.    Further enhancement of this knowledge can occur when teachers are encouraged to participate in collaborative inquiry where they probe their practical knowledge; begin to (re-)discover their teaching voice, who they are as teacher; and construct a shared understanding of what they need to know to be the teachers they want to be. Collaborative inquiry provides an opportunity for teachers to make music together: for sharing discordant experiences; for balancing internal tensions in the light of common experiences and background noise; for expressing ideas; and for gathering confidence to improvise and act. These conditions and opportunities support the development of an orientation that includes understanding of self and context. Thus principles 2-4 are:  Teachers' sense-making efforts are supported by opportunities to (re-)discover voice through collaborative inquiry.  Teachers' sense-making efforts are supported as they examine the everyday experiences and tensions of educational life.  Teachers' sense-making efforts are supported as they engage in (re-)constructing practical knowledge.    In this thesis, the teachers gained a deeper understanding of their practical knowledge and contextual dilemmas. This set the stage for teachers to deal more intentionally with work demands. Locating self, understanding the relationships between teaching images and teaching situations, brought strategies for managing workplace ambiguity. Locating self reminded these teachers of the melody they wished to create, and triggered the imagining of new ways to weave this melody into the existing textures and tensions of teaching.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher</field><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">Teaching</field><field name="subject">Self</field><field name="subject">Awareness</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Early Childhood</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16045/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Testing of a Method for Forecasting Prices of Multi-Storey Buildings during the Early Design Stage: the Storey Enclosure Method Revisited</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Kai Tak (Franco)</field><field name="description">Although design decisions that are made in the preliminary design stages of a building are more cost sensitive than those that are made at later stages, previous research suggests that they result in only a slight improvement in the accuracy of building price forecasts as the design develops. However, established conventional forecasting methods lack measures of their own performance, which has inhibited the development of simpler early-stage techniques. One early-stage price forecasting model, the Storey Enclosure Method, which was developed by James in 1954, uses the basic physical measurements of buildings to estimate building prices. Although James' Storey Enclosure Model (JSEM) is not widely used in practice, it has been proved empirically, if rather crudely, to be a better model than other commonly used models. This research aims firstly to advance JSEM by using regression techniques and secondly to develop an objective approach for the assessment of model performance.  To accomplish the first research aim, this research uses data from 148 completed Hong Kong projects for four types of building: offices, private housing, nursing homes, and primary and secondary schools. Sophisticated features of the modelling exercise include the use of leave-one-out cross validation to simulate the way in which forecasts are produced in practice and a dual stepwise selection strategy that enhances the chance of identifying the best model. Two types ofregressed models from different candidate sets, the Regressed Model for James' Storey Enclosure Method (RJSEM) and Regressed Model for Advanced Storey Enclosure Method (RASEM), are developed accordingly. In considering the RJSEM, RASEM, and the most commonly used alternative early stage floor area and cube models, all of the models except JSEM are found to be unbiased. The RJSEM and RASEM models are also examined for their consistency using a structured approach that involves the use of both parametric and non-parametric inference tests. This shows that although the RASEMs for different building types are generally more consistent, they are not significantly better than the other models. Finally, the combination of the forecasts that are generated from different models to capture the different aspects of information from the models is suggested as an alternative strategy for improving forecasting performance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regressed Model for Advanced Storey Enclosure Method</field><field name="subject">RASEM</field><field name="subject">Regressed Model for James' Storey Enclosure Method</field><field name="subject">RJSEM</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16046/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reference Models for IT Service Provision</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Chris</field><field name="description">The new age, the "Information Age" (Davenport and Prusak 1997) has increased society's and businesses' reliance on Information Technology (IT). Hence, there is an increasing focus on the management of IT, not only from a technological perspective but also from a business perspective. This research, sponsored by REALTECH and the Australian Research Council, applies one of the modern management approaches, business process management (Hammer 1990), to the domain IT service provision, by designing a business process reference model for IT Service Provision. A reference model is an abstracted depiction of reality that serves as a standardised or suggestive conceptual basis for the design of enterprise specific models, usually within a like domain. They are one method of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of enterprise modelling and can also be used to standardise communication or capture knowledge. There is a general lack of theory regarding the classification, design and quality of reference models. The first part of this thesis attempts to fill these gaps, by presenting a reference model classification scheme, outlining 7 philosophies for the design of reference models and detailing 2 case studies on the user-perceived quality of business process reference models. Reference models and the Business Process Management Lifecycle (Rosemann 2000) are integrated to show how reference models can be applied to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of business process improvement projects.  This reference model theory was then applied to produce a model for domain of IT Service Provision. Investment in IT has increased to become the largest single element of capital expenditure (Thorp 1998). Gartner predicted that organisations will spend over 10% of revenue on IT by 2005 (Haines 2000). A major input for this model is the ITIL best practice documents (CCTA 2000). The reference model focuses on Incident Management and used focus groups with participants from several large IT service providers to validate the models. The designed reference model is then tested in two case studies to determine its accuracy and usefulness. The thesis finishes with a discussion of the designed model, the effectiveness of the procedural model and provides suggestions for the design of other reference models. The final chapter provides a summary and an outlook for further research into the area.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reference Model</field><field name="subject">IT Service Provision</field><field name="subject">ITIL</field><field name="subject">Quality of Models</field><field name="subject">Business Process Management</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16047/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career Counselling Services: Client Expectations and Provider Perceptions</field><field name="creator">Lim, Roslyn Beth</field><field name="description">The career counselling services industry is currently being challenged by a unique set of conditions which has resulted in calls for a greater client orientation in the delivery of career services.  The current study takes up this challenge by using marketing concepts to explore the relationship between the expectations (desired) people in career transition have of a career counselling service and the perceptions career counselling service providers have of client expectations.  In the process, it also examines variables (career transition group membership, career decision-making self-efficacy, age, gender, and previous experience with a career counselling service) that may impact on the expectations people in career transition have of a career counselling service.  The study used a three-phased mixed method approach to gather expectation and perception data.  In Phase 1, focus group interviews were conducted with participants from three career transition groups - Year 12 students, final year university students, and adults in midcareer transition.  A series of one-to-one interviews with three groups of career counsellors (those in schools, tertiary institutions, and private practice) was undertaken in Phase 2.  Phase 3 consisted of a questionnaire, which was administered to broader populations of people in career transition and career counsellors.  The people in career transition subject group completed a three-part questionnaire consisting of the Expectations About Career Counselling measure (developed by the researcher), the Career Decision-Making Self-Efficacy-Short Form (an existing measure), and demographic questions.  Career counsellors completed a two-part questionnaire, which included the Expectations About Career Counselling (EACC) and demographic questions.  The people in career transition subject group were asked to respond to the EACC according to what they wanted from a career counselling service.  Career counsellors were asked to respond to the same measure as if they were one of their clients attending their first career counselling interview. In the development of the EACC, an existing measure (the Expectations About Counselling-Brief Form; Tinsley, 1982), was modified using career counselling expectation themes derived from the analysis of data collected in Phases 1 and 2.  Factor analysis of the data obtained from the EACC identified four clear factors.  These factors were named Career Counsellor Responsibility, Client Responsibility, Quality Outcome and Realism.  The findings from Phase 3 indicated that people in career transition had high to very high expectations for the EACC subscales Career Counsellor Responsibility and Quality Outcome, moderate expectations for Realism, and moderate to high expectations for Client Responsibility.  Significant differences were found based on transition group membership, gender, age, and previous experience with a career counselling service.  In addition, it was found that people in career transition had moderate to high career decision-making self-efficacy and that respondents with higher self-efficacy scores also had higher expectations of a career counselling service.  The findings also indicated that there was a significant difference or gap between the expectations of people in career transition and the perceptions of career counsellors concerning client expectations of career counselling.  Career counsellors perceived that clients were less committed and more unrealistic about the career counselling process and the counsellor's role than was indicated by the results from the people in career transition subject group.  Recommendations based on the findings of this research study were made for career counsellors, professional associations, education and training organisations, education institutions and systems and government policy makers.  Specifically, the recommendations addressed the importance of acknowledging, clarifying, and managing client expectations, providing interventions to educate people in career transition about the career decision-making process and the role of the career counsellor, and the implementation of processes to promote ongoing professional development in the career counselling services industry.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">career counselling</field><field name="subject">career counsellor</field><field name="subject">career counselling services</field><field name="subject">client expectations</field><field name="subject">career counsellor perceptions</field><field name="subject">career transition</field><field name="subject">career decision-making self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">Year 12 students</field><field name="subject">final year university students</field><field name="subject">adults in career transition</field><field name="subject">world of work</field><field name="subject">employment patterns</field><field name="subject">gap analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16048/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication of Osmotic Distillation Membranes for Feeds Containing Surface-Active Agents</field><field name="creator">Xu, Juanbao</field><field name="description">The present work was undertaken to develop a composite osmotic distillation (OD) membrane consisting of a thin hydrogel coating on a microporous hydrophobic substrate for the concentration of aqueous feeds containing surface-active agents. The range of OD applications using the hydrophobic membrane alone have been severely limited by the propensity for membrane wet-out when contacted by amphiphilic agents such as oils, fats and detergents. Wet-out allows the feed solution to track freely through the membrane pores with a resulting loss of solutes and a decrease in selectivity. The rationale for the approach taken was based on the hypothesis that the high water selectivity of the hydrophilic coating would maintain good water mass transfer to the underlying hydrophobic substrate but exclude other components including surface-active agents. The first stage of this work involved the identification of potential coating materials and the fabrication and structural characterization of films of these materials to determine their suitability. The second stage involved the development of techniques to facilitate adhesion of the hydrophilic coatings to the hydrophobic substrate, and the testing of the resulting composite membranes for OD performance and resistance to wet-out by surface-active agents.    Sodium alginate was selected as the major coating component on the basis of its non-toxicity and its potential for stable hydrogel formation. Structural characterization of noncrosslinked films and films crosslinked using a water-soluble carbodiimide (WSC) was carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and swelling measurements. Maximum crosslinking through esterification of hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on adjacent polymer strands using the film immersion method was achieved with a non-solvent (ethanol) concentration of 60 vol % and a WSC concentration of 100 mM at pH 4. These conditions resulted in a hydrogel with  an equilibrium water content of 60 wt %.    DSC measurements of noncrosslinked and crosslinked alginate films showed an increase in crystallinity and hence rigidity on crosslinking. Therefore, several coatings were prepared as blends of sodium alginate and amorphous highly flexible carrageenan gum in order to meet the flexibility requirements of a membrane subjected to varying operating pressures in an industrial OD plant. Structural characterization with respect to polymer blend ratio was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), DSC, X-ray diffraction (XRD). The optimisation for crosslinking conditions was undertaken as for sodium alginate alone. Optimum conditions for film preparation were 20 wt % carrageenan content and a crosslinking medium containing 60 vol % non-solvent (ethanol) and 120 mM WSC at pH 4. These conditions produced a hydrogel with an equilibrium water content of 85 wt %.  Two different techniques were employed to anchor the coatings on substrate PTFE membranes. For membranes with a nominal diameter of 0.2 &#181;m, the technique involved surface tension adjustment of the coating solution by ethanol addition in order to enhance penetration of the coating solution meniscus into the substrate pores. This was followed by polymer precipitation by the selective removal of water using OD to provide structural interlocking. T-peel strength measurements showed that this technique resulted in a ten-fold increase in adhesion strength when compared with a coating cast without surface tension adjustments. For membranes with a nominal diameter of 0.1&#181;m, an interfacial bonding agent, myristyltrimethylammonium bromide (MTMA), was used. This technique gave a three-fold increase in adhesion strength relative to that of coating cast without the use of MTMA. The composite membranes were tested in extended OD trials using pure water and feeds containing limonene, the major surface-active components of orange oil. The sodium alginate-carrageenan blend membrane, which was the preferred membrane based on flexibility and water sorption considerations, was also tested against full-cream milk and an industrial detergent, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS). The results indicated that the coatings offered little resistance to water transport and were effective in providing protection against membrane wet-out. Durability trials showed that the composite membranes retained their integrity in water for a minimum of 30 days.    Overall, this study has expanded the potential applications of OD to include many important industrial concentration steps that are currently being undertaken by conventional processes with unsatisfactory results. These include the concentration of citrus juices, full-cream milk and nuclear power plant liquid waste. These feeds contain limonene, fats and detergents respectively, all of which wet out unprotected hydrophobic membranes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osmotic distillation; membrane distillation; hydrophobic microporous PTFE membrane; membrane wet-out; surface-active agents; alginate&#150;based hydrogel coatings; physical interfacial bonding; coating pore penetration</field><field name="subject">composite membranes</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16049/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of knowledge-based fuzzy inference system on high voltage transmission line maintenance</field><field name="creator">Mohd Noor, Mohd Junaizee</field><field name="description">A majority of utilities conduct maintenance of transmission line components based on the results of routine visual inspection. The inspection is normally done by inspectors who detect defects by visually checking transmission line components either from the air (in helicopters), from the ground (by using high-powered binoculars) or from the top of the structure (by climbing the structure).
 
 
 
 The main problems with visual inspection of transmission lines are that the determination of the defects varies depending on the inspectors' knowledge and experience and that the defects are often reported qualitatively using vague and linguistic terms such as "medium crack", "heavy rust", "small deflection". As a result of these drawbacks, there is a large variance and inconsistency in defect reporting (which, in time, makes it difficult for the utility to monitor the condition of the components) leading to ineffective or wrong maintenance decisions. The use of inspection guides has not been able to fully address these uncertainties.
 
 
 
 This thesis reports on the application of a visual inspection methodology that is aimed at addressing the above-mentioned problems. A knowledge-based Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is designed using Matlab's Fuzzy Logic Toolbox as part of the methodology and its application is demonstrated on utility visual inspection practice of porcelain cap and pin insulators.  The FIS consists of expert-specified input membership functions (representing various insulator defect levels), output membership functions (indicating the overall conditions of the insulator) and IF-THEN rules. Consistency in the inspection results is achieved because the condition of the insulator is inferred using the same knowledge-base in the FIS rather than by individual inspectors. The output of the FIS is also used in a mathematical model that is developed to suggest appropriate component replacement date.
 
 
 
 It is hoped that the methodology that is introduced in this research will help utilities achieve better maintenance management of transmission line assets.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high voltage transmission lines</field><field name="subject">insulators</field><field name="subject">tower structures</field><field name="subject">foundations</field><field name="subject">conductors</field><field name="subject">maintenance management</field><field name="subject">visual inspection</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">fuzzy inference systems</field><field name="subject">knowledge-based systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16050/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scaffolded Growth of Knowledge Using Distributed Collaborative Learning Tools in Preservice Teacher Education</field><field name="creator">McDougall, Mathew Jon</field><field name="description">The Education Faculties within the universities are looking to meet the needs of their learners more completely. Teaching and learning strategies are being adopted to make educational provision more flexible by using computer supported collaborative learning environments. However, research has shown that in preservice teacher programs, many teachers do not have a complete knowledge of subject-matter or pedagogical content knowledge. This study investigated how a lesson-planning task within the context of a computer supported collaborative learning environment can facilitate the growth of teacher knowledge, specifically subject-matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge about the teaching of ratio and fraction. The findings from this research showed that using a lesson-planning task facilitated the development of teacher knowledge, specifically subject-matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. Within the computer supported collaborative learning community, the preservice teachers were able to articulate their current understandings and re-define their knowledge of fraction and ratio. The thesis concludes with a conceptual framework and some specific guidelines for the design of a scaffolded computer-mediated community and discusses implications for the design of future collaborative learning environments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lesson Planning Studies</field><field name="subject">Computer Supported Collaborative Learning</field><field name="subject">Preservice Teachers</field><field name="subject">Subject-matter Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Pedagogical Content Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Ratio</field><field name="subject">Fraction</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16051/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Secure Infrastructural Strategy for Safe Autonomous Mobile Agents</field><field name="creator">Giansiracusa, Michelangelo Antonio</field><field name="description">Portable languages and distributed paradigms have driven a wave of new applications and processing models.  One of the most promising, certainly from its early marketing, but disappointing (from its limited uptake)is the mobile agent execution and data processing model.  Mobile agents are autonomous programs which can move around a heterogeneous network such as the Internet, crossing through a number of different security domains, and perform some work at each visited destination as partial completion of a mission for their agent user.  Despite their promise as a technology and paradigm to drive global electronic services (i.e.any Internet-driven-and-delivered service, not solely e-commerce related  activities), their up take on the Internet has been very limited.  Chief among the reasons for the paradigm's practical under-achievement is there is no ubiquitous frame work for using Internet mobile agents, and non-trivial security concerns abound for the two major stake holders (mobile agent users and mobile agent platform owners).  While both stake holders have security concerns with the dangers of the mobile agent processing model, most investigators in the field are of the opinion that protecting mobile agents from malicious agent platforms is more problematic than protecting agent platforms from malicious mobile agents.  Traditional cryptographic mechanisms are not well-suited to counter the bulk of the threats associated with the mobile agent paradigm due to the untrusted hosting of an agent and its intended autonomous, flexible movement and processing. In our investigation, we identified that the large majority of the research undertaken on mobile agent security to date has taken a micro-level perspective.  By this we mean research focused solely on either of the two major stakeholders, and even then often only on improving measures to address one security issue dear to the stake holder - for example mobile agent privacy (for agent users) or access control to platform resources (for mobile agent platform owners).  We decided to take a more encompassing, higher-level approach in tackling mobile agent security issues. In this endeavour, we developed the beginnings of an infrastructural-approach to not only reduce the security concerns of both major stakeholders, but bring them transparently to a working relationship.  Strategic utilisation of both existing distributed system trusted-third parties (TTPs) and novel mobile agent paradigm-specific TTPs are fundamental in the infrastructural framework we have devised.    Besides designing an application and language independent frame work for supporting a large-scale Internet mobile agent network, our Mobile Agent Secure Hub Infrastructure (MASHIn) proposal encompasses support for flexible access control to agent platform resources.  A reliable means to track the location and processing times of autonomous Internet mobile agents is discussed, withfault-tolerant handling support to work around unexpected processing delays.  Secure,highly-effective (incomparison to existing mechanisms) strategies for providing mobile agent privacy, execution integrity, and stake holder confidence scores were devised - all which fit comfortably within the MASHIn framework.  We have deliberately considered the interests - withoutbias -of both stake holders when designing our solutions.    In relation to mobile agent execution integrity, we devised a new criteria for assessing the robustness of existing execution integrity schemes.  Whilst none of the existing schemes analysed met a large number of our desired properties for a robust scheme, we identified that the objectives of Hohl's reference states scheme were most admirable - particularly real - time in - mission execution integrity checking.  Subsequently, we revised Hohl's reference states protocols to fit in the MASHIn framework, and were able to overcome not only the two major limitations identified in his scheme, but also meet all of our desired properties for a robust execution integrity scheme (given an acceptable decrease in processing effiency).    The MASHIn offers a promising new perspective for future mobile agent security  research and indeed a new frame work for enabling safe and autonomous Internet mobile agents.  Just as an economy cannot thrive without diligent care given to micro and macro-level issues, we do not see the security prospects of mobile agents (and ultimately the prospects of the mobile agent paradigm) advancing without diligent research on both levels.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MASHIn</field><field name="subject">MASHs</field><field name="subject">RECDAM</field><field name="subject">SCC4MAP</field><field name="subject">application-independent mobile agents</field><field name="subject">autonomous mobile agents</field><field name="subject">checking hosts</field><field name="subject">confidence scores</field><field name="subject">distributed systems</field><field name="subject">dummy call back classes</field><field name="subject">first-hand observations</field><field name="subject">itinerant agents</field><field name="subject">language-independent mobile agents</field><field name="subject">mobile agent execution integrity</field><field name="subject">mobile agent paradigm</field><field name="subject">mobile agent platform</field><field name="subject">mobile agent platform owner</field><field name="subject">mobile agent privacy</field><field name="subject">mobile agent security</field><field name="subject">mobile agent user</field><field name="subject">mobile agents</field><field name="subject">mobile computing</field><field name="subject">real call back classes</field><field name="subject">real-time in-mission checking</field><field name="subject">reference state</field><field name="subject">reputation</field><field name="subject">second-hand opinions</field><field name="subject">secure call back classes</field><field name="subject">trusted third party</field><field name="subject">ubiquitous framework</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16052/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical and Computational Methods to Assess Uncertainty and Risk in Accounting</field><field name="creator">Falta, Michael</field><field name="description">Informed economic decisions are made on the basis of accounting data.  It is therefore crucial to have rigorous and scientific approaches for measuring, modelling and forecasting accounting numbers.    Dr Falta's research was motivated by two observations.  Firstly, in accounting practice, decision-making often relies on subjective quantifications and forecasts of business activities and, thus, does not account for uncertainty in a rational way.  Secondly, there are some academic foundations for statistical approaches to accounting, yet none has been developed carefully enough for results to penetrate and to contribute to practitioners' needs.    Dr Falta applied components of mathematics, statistics, econometrics, finance and computing to aspects of accounting and auditing. He developed an enhanced framework for scientific measurement of business process costing and recording accounting transaction data.  This has enabled a better understanding of risk in accounting-based decision-making.

However 'young' is not uniformly defined within the literature. Studies have reported on a wide range of ages considered to be 'young', such as samples simply divided by menopausal status or other researcher-defined parameters. For the purpose of this study, young women with breast cancer were defined as those diagnosed at 40 years of age or younger. The overarching aim of the study was to explore the problems faced by this group of young women using qualitative methodology, guided by constructionist epistemology, and grounded in symbolic interactionism and social constructionism. The study was conducted longitudinally, with data collected three times over a 12-18 month period using one-to-one in-depth semi-structured interviews. Baseline data were collected in the first phase of the study (n=35). A sub-group of participants (n=13) were chosen to be followed twice more approximately six months apart, which made up the next two phases. Themes derived from the literature guided the first phase of the study, data collection and analysis. Data analysis was performed after each data collection phase, with findings informing the next phase/s of the study. Thematic and content analysis were utilized in regards to the analysis of the first phase of the study, providing a framework identifying the most pressing concerns, such as those centred around children and partners, emotional aspects and negative physical consequences of treatment. Interrelationships between these themes were apparent. Findings suggest that the emotional support needs of this group of young women remains a challenge. Basic analytical principles of data reduction, data display and drawing conclusions guided the following phases of the analysis. NUD*IST (N6) software was utilized to help undertake in-depth analysis of all follow-up data. The literature concentrates on infertility as a concern for young women with breast cancer, however the study found that fertility per se was a concern for this group of women. Issues of maintained and regained fertility were reported, i.e., concerns surrounding suitable, safe and reliable contraception, pregnancy and breastfeeding after breast cancer. Over time, perceptions of fertility changed. Decisions related to unplanned pregnancies and breastfeeding were particularly onerous. The study also provided other insights into the participants' lives. Body image is suggested to be of greater concern for younger women with breast cancer than their older counterparts. Perceptions of breast symbolism, societal and personal, were explored, as were perceptions of the external portrayal of their bodies. In addition, the participants reported how their experience of breast cancer differed from that of older women with breast cancer, e.g., to be and dress more sexually. Theories and notions of social constructionism and the social construction of the body helped explain the participants' experiences. The women were acutely aware of the sexual importance society placed on women's breasts. Social norms and expectations and cultural trends, that is the youth and beauty culture, were found to greatly influence the participants' perceptions and hence decisions made. Prosthesis use and breast reconstructive surgery were viewed as normalising efforts undertaken by participants to reduce stigma related to breast loss/disfigurement and to enhance body image. The findings from this study provide a greater understanding of the issues, concerns and experiences of young women with breast cancer and provide information that could be utilized in the redesign of educational/information resources to provide these women with relevant information. Currently available support services may also benefit from these findings as greater understanding of these women's experiences may facilitate and promote the provision of more age-appropriate support for young women with breast cancer diagnosed in the future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Young women</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Partners</field><field name="subject">Support</field><field name="subject">Reproduction issues</field><field name="subject">Fertility/infertility after breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Contraception after breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy after breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Breastfeeding after breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Breast symbolism</field><field name="subject">Generational differences</field><field name="subject">Body image</field><field name="subject">Social norms</field><field name="subject">Social expectations</field><field name="subject">Cultural trends</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Longitudinal</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/16054/</field></doc></add>
