alternative sub-culture in Australia in the period between 1959 and 1980.
Dual protagonists, Anna Martin and Jack Rose, personify aspects of the
movement that would later be known as 'psychedelic romanticism.'
The narrative follows Jack Rose's disenchantment with the prevailing social
system and his efforts to achieve personal integration and his conflict with societal
pressures to conform. Likewise, in a parallel narrative, it describes the events that
surround Anna Martin's early institutionalisation and her attempt to achieve personal
authenticity.
When the protagonists finally encounter one another they find that a common
and binding philosophy has drawn them together.
The thesis looks at the prevailing social notions of'normality' at the time and
the problems associated with alienation and the struggle to found alternative life styles
in a society they deem to be repressive.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">novel</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">alternative sub-cultures</field><field name="subject">normality</field><field name="subject">alienation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060705.150107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of records management for overcoming excessive quantity, poor quality and storage media problems in computer-based information systems</field><field name="creator">Druitt, Denise</field><field name="description">Organizations are experiencing problems with the control
of information in computer-based information systems.
Records management is a system that consists of a number
of elements to control recorded information over its life
cycle.
Previous studies have ranked various records management
activities. However, these studies were not conducted in
Australia, were not specifically related to computerbased
information systems, and were based on the
frequency with which records management tasks, or duties
and responsibilities were being performed by records
management personnel rather than the perceived importance
of records management elements for overcoming problems.
This study is conducted in Australia on the role of
records management within the context of computer-based
information systems. It has two purposes: to determine
whether there is an appreciable difference in the
perceived importance of the various records management
elements for overcoming excessive quantity, poor quality
and storage media problems in computer-based information
systems by RMAA individual members; and to determine
whether regardless of professional involvement and level
of education of RMAA individual members, there is no
statistically significant difference in the perceived
importance of the various records management elements in
computer-based information systems for overcoming these
three problems.
To carry out the research a questionnaire was devised and
distributed to individual members of the Records
Management Association of Australia. The survey obtained
a usable response rate of 53.1 percent from a population
of 399 individual members of the Association.
The study indicated that there is a difference in the
perceived importance of the various records management
elements for overcoming excessive quantity, poor quality
and storage media problems in computer-based information
systems. There was evidence to suggest that respondents
frequently involved in professional activities are more
likely to consider certain records management elements
more important than respondents not frequently involved
in these activities. The study also found that level of
education is associated with the selection of certain
records management elements. In particular, those
respondents with no tertiary qualifications are more
likely to consider the records management elements mail
management and a records retention and disposition
schedule important than respondents with tertiary
qualifications.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">records management</field><field name="subject">computer based information systems</field><field name="subject">Records Management Association of Australia</field><field name="subject">RMAA</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060705.151052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parents as partners in prevention</field><field name="creator">Drysdale, Robyn L.</field><field name="description">Parents play a central role in their children's education and social development and
therefore can be extremely influential in children's attitudes, decisions and behaviour
towards drugs. Despite this, there has been limited research to date which explores the
parents' perspective and their needs in the area of drug education. This thesis reports on
research which surveyed 92 parents of secondary students (Years 7-10) across ten
secondary schools in the Australian Capital Territory. Two follow up focus group
sessions, involving fourteen parents of secondary students, were also conducted with
self-nominated parents of these respondents. The issues explored in the research
include parents' concerns and knowledge of young people and drug issues, and their
needs for a drug education program aimed at parents.
The results show that parents see their role in drug education as a central one and are
concerned about drugs in relation to their children and other young people. They are
largely unaware of school drug policies and school drug education programs and want
to work in closer partnership with the school and community in educating their children
about drug issues. Parents identified a need for accurate and up to date information as
they do not have sufficient knowledge in this area. Parents also identified a need to
develop skills in dealing with adolescents and drug issues.
This study provides insight into a range of parents' views on drug issues and confirms
that parents would like to develop both knowledge and skills in order to support young
people and reinforce school drug education programs. A number of implications of the
results for the involvement of parents in drug education programs are presented,
including: parent needs, strategies for delivery/ implementation and motivating factors
for encouraging parental participation in such programs.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drug education</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">parents</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060705.154625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computers in the primary school with special reference to mathematics</field><field name="creator">Dubow, A.

or not a microcomputer can be integrated into a standard
primary mathematics curriculum and to investigate
generally if computers should be introduced into the
primary school with the aim of improving, or adding to,
the teaching-learning processes.
Resource limitations restricted the project to the
use of a comparatively cheap microcomputer into a fourth
and fifth grade mathematics programme at the school where
I was teaching. 15 children used the machine for approximately
10 minutes a day for 16 weeks. Gains on graded
pre and post tests were compared with matched control
groups' gains.
Questionnaire and observation techniques were used
to attempt assessment of children's and teacher's
feelings towards computers in primary education.
Naturally, these devices were less exact.
The evaluation of these efforts suggests that using
a computer in the classroom is a viable proposition,
providing the school has some trained staff who are
prepared to spend a considerable amount of extra time,
especially in the initial stages.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">classrooms</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060705.155616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instructional design for adult learners in vocational training</field><field name="creator">Ducker, C. H.</field><field name="description">Growing concern for an improvement in the formal learning situations
experienced by adults is reflected in much of the literature currently
available. Evidence from studies of adult learning suggests that (i)
adults are generally well able to accept a significant degree of
responsibility for the management of their own learning, and (ii) that
an adult's learning is enhanced if the learning situations are matched
to the preferences and strengths of the learner.
In this study a design for adult instruction, which takes these
factors into account, is developed. The Educational Cognitive Styles
of 47 adult learners are mapped using a self-report inventory. The
profiles thus obtained are used in the development of instructional
techniques for the learners who are enrolled in a first-year, TAFE,
para-professional course. Comparison of this experimental group with
a control group indicates that the attrition rate is reduced, learners
have more positive feelings toward their course of study, and
performance on a content achievement test is, arguably, improved.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult learners</field><field name="subject">instructional design</field><field name="subject">vocational training</field><field name="subject">Educational Cognitive Styles</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060705.160234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of post-secondary Aboriginal support systems</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Pearl</field><field name="description">An overview of Aboriginal education in the last two hundred years reveals that Aborigines
have had a depressingly inadequate education, also marked by inequity of opportunity and
participation.
The developmental pattern of Aboriginal education has been characterised by four broad
periods or eras related to specific government policies. These periods are identified
successively as The Protection Era, the Segregation Era, The Assimilation Era and The
Integration Era. The Protection Era began with the early frontier settlement of Europeans in
Australia and extended until the 1860's. The Segregation Era marked the full development
of Aboriginal reserves from 1860 to 1940. The Assimilation Era extended from the 1940s
to the mid 1960s. Finally the period of Integration began in the late 1960s and gathered
momentum in the 1970s.
Throughout the periods of protection, segregation and assimilation very little effort was
expended in the provision of adequate education for Aborigines.
It was not until the late 1960s that concerted attempts were made to redress the many
decades of neglect and apathy.
Researchers uncovered glaring problems needing urgent redress. Aboriginal pupils
persistently achieved very poorly in comparison with others and left school at an earlier age.
As a consequence Aborigines left school lacking the knowledge and skills to compete with
other Australians and had much poorer prospects of employment.
In the early 1970s the National Aboriginal Education Committee and the state Aboriginal
Education Consultative Groups, combined with support and funding from DAA,
Commonwealth Education and The Schools Commission, were very influential in
establishing programmes.
In response to the growing numbers of Aborigines who were denied adequate schooling,
three general types of adult programmes were developed: a) enclave/support systems; b)
pretertiary/bridging courses and c) off campus centres.
It was these programmes operating at WACAE that DEET commissioned me to evaluate.
The existence of these programmes is the result of WACAE's prompt response to the need
for redressing Aboriginal educational imbalance. The programmes developed following the
commencement of the Aboriginal Teacher Education Programme at Mt Lawley College in
1973. The first enclave was established in 1976, external AEEC commenced in 1978 and
G.E.C. in 1980, the first off campus centre was set up in 1983, and the Tertiary Preparation
Course (internal AEEC) began operation in 1985.
Commonwealth money has provided the financial basis for the programmes, but WACAE
was the first institution in Australia to implement programmes and its achievement is
significant.
The terms of reference for this project required that the method of research should be
through data gathering by means of interviews and examination of documentary evidence
during a three week period in Perth.
The evaluator consulted DAIS staff, students and, as particularly requested in the brief,
Aboriginal community members.
Findings revealed that WACAE's enclaves, on campus and off campus, have made
progress towards educational equity for Aborigines, provide good support and are valued
by students and Aboriginal community members.
Aboriginalisation was found to be essential to maximum enclave effectiveness. Staff,
students and Aboriginal community members would like to see increased Aboriginal
representation, contract hiring of staff not being conducive to employment security or staff
continuity.
It is recommended that rationalisation of enclaves would achieve a more efficient pooling of
resources. During the last thirteen years considerable amounts of external funds have
been injected and it is recommended that WACAE take greater institutional responsibility
for enclaves, using funds from normal Commonwealth sources, as distinct from special
course funding.
The existing staffing patterns and conditions of employment should be regularised in
regard to salary, tenure, study leave, superannuation, etc. Such a measure is necessary to
ensure staff continuity, security and inclusion in the power structure of the institution.
WACAEs external pretertiary courses (AEEC and GEC) have achieved a small measure of
progress towards equity of access and participation in education for Aborigines.
The wide geographical distribution is significant in providing availability of courses.
The courses are valued by Aboriginal community members and there is a need for external
courses of this nature to continue in the future.
However, progress towards equity has been extremely slow and time taken for completion
of courses is unduly long considering the basic nature of GEC, and the fact that the courses
are designed for completion in one year.
The courses are preceived as enhancing employment performance and prospects as well
as being preparation for tertiary study.
There has been a shift in opinion regarding Aboriginal education during the 1980s towards
the view that education should not be seen in isolation but in combination with employment
and training.
It is recommended that DEET take immediate steps to implement the Aboriginal
Employment Development Policy in Western Australia, considering how best the benefits
of external AEEC and GEC can be maintained and expanded. On the other hand, the
Tertiary Preparation Course (internal AEEC) has achieved commendable results and is
assessed as being worthy of increased resources and energy.
Difficulty was encountered in efforts to determine exactly how DEET funding was used. It
seems that this type of enquiry would necessitate the services of a qualified accountant.
Enclave/support systems and pretertiary/bridging courses will be needed for some time to
come. Many Aboriginal people stated that they envisage the time when these programmes
will no longer be needed, 'when inequity of education has been addressed' and 'equality'
achieved. Until this goal is reached the programmes will remain necessary. The
achievement of the broad objectives of the AEDP, i.e. employment and income equity with
other Australians and equity of participation in all levels of education, will see Aboriginal
aspirations becoming a reality.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal education</field><field name="subject">tertiary education</field><field name="subject">WACAE</field><field name="subject">inequity</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060706.112807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From grammar to communication : a moderate viewpoint in the teaching of EFL adult learners in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Dung, Nguyen Hanh</field><field name="description">This Study is concerned with the problems arising
from the application of new ideas in communicative
language teaching for EFL adult learners in Vietnam,
and the solutions to these problems.
The Study argues that to learn to communicate
effectively in a foreign language does not mean merely
to master the linguistic forms of the language, but also
to be able to use them in an appropriate way: to
acquire what is called communicative competence. The Study
also suggests that in Vietnam, the structural system of
the language cannot be neglected if teaching/learning is
to be successful. Accordingly, the Study attempts to
search for an appropriate approach to develop communicative competence in the EFL adult learners of Vietnam.
In order to achieve this aim, the Study enters into
consideration of the relevant literature with reference
to the development of the concept of communicative
competence, and communicative language teaching. Then
the Study makes a survey of some communicative-approach-based
textbooks pointing out the practical values of
different syllabus design models and teaching strategies
discussed in the literature.
Finally the Study proposes a communicative-structural
approach to syllabus design for the target group, the
teaching strategies as well as some techniques and
activities associated with the suggested approach.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult learners</field><field name="subject">English as a Foreign Language</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">communicative competence</field><field name="subject">syllabus design</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060706.113712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of suprasegmental errors in the interlanguage of North Vietnamese students of English</field><field name="creator">Dung, Le Thanh</field><field name="description">Stress and intonation play important roles in the production and

In teaching such students, one problem is the provision of
interesting and relevant materials. This study addresses the

business English listening skills.
This Field Study Report consists of five chapters. Chapter 1
describes the purposes and aims of study, the background to
this study, dealing with students, the teaching and the
curriculum.
Chapter 2 looks at the general theory about listening and in
particular listening in business. The chapter also describes
listening requirements for business graduates from the HFTC.
Chapter 3 discusses criteria for selection of textbooks for
language teaching in general and for teaching listening skills
in business English in particular.
Chapter 4 surveys the teaching of business English in two
institutes of Technical and Further Education in the Australian
Capital Territory (ACT).
The final chapter makes suggestions for priorities to improve
the teaching of business English.

level of self-perception prior to and following a training process.
The study attested the view that the action learning based program in
question was an effective mechanism for change in self-perception.
The population studied were officers of the Australian Public Service
and the Commonwealth Teaching Service located in the Australian Taxation Office, Austrade, ACT Schools Authority and the Department
of Community Services and Health. A pilot study conducted in the
Public Service Board in 1987 suggested that an action learning
training process may be impacting on management competencies.
Respondent's attitudes to nine personality variables were measured
using the Saville Holdsworth Occupational (OPQ) Concept 5
Questionnaire. The variables were Assertive, Gregarious, Empathy,
Field of Use, Abstract, Structure, Anxieties, Controls and Energies.
Using the Solomon's Four quasi-experimental design, containing three
experimental and two control groups, pre-test, change and post-test
scores were compared using a one-way Analysis of Variance. Where
pre-tests were statistically significantly different an Analysis of
Covariance was used,
The general conclusion from the study was that the experimental
groups showed an overall insignificant relationship with training
particularly as control groups showed similar differences over time.
Apart from few exceptions the results did not support any strong
notion of positive change in self-perception as a result of a training

and practices in primary schools since the abolition of
corporal punishment. The purposes of the study were to
find out who is involved in the formulation of a
policy; how this procedure takes place from the
initial stages to fruition; the contents of a
completed policy document and to canvass opinions of
teachers and students about their school policy.
Information was obtained from twenty-two completed
questionnaires received from public primary schools in
the Belconnen region of the ACT and a more detailed
case study of three of these schools.
A search of the literature revealed a number of key
elements of a whole school discipline policy. These
included: formulation of policy; recognition of
appropriate student behaviour; rules and consequences;
policy procedures; responsibility for policy
implementation; the abolition of corporal punishment.
The study showed that there is a growing awareness of
the democratic decision-making process within
classrooms and that schools are producing comprehensive
discipline policies, many of which are now more
accurately titled 'Management of Student Behaviour'.
Schools are encouraging appropriate behaviour from the
students, endeavouring to develop student
self-discipline and self-esteem, and are using agreed
logical consequences when rule violations occur.
The case study concludes with comments on the ACT
Schools Authority Discussion Paper 'Policy and
Procedures for the Management of Student Behaviour in

defence system. For the purposes of this analysis, major capital equipment constitute
selected projects with a total value of at least $200 million.
The projects selected for examination are from each of the three arms of the military
service. These projects are: the Royal Australian Air Force's BLACKHAWK helicopters,
the Army's PERENTIE vehicles, and the Royal Australian Navy's Australian FFG-7
FRIGATES. These projects were chosen because they share similar planning and
management related characteristics. They represent substantial public sector investments.
The technology used in each of the systems is available 'off-the-shelf but the way in
which the systems were ultimately assembled and produced are uniquely Australian: this
adaptation and local innovation involved developmental work. Since each of these
projects is almost complete, a comprehensive analysis of the project has been possible.
The study of these particular projects provides the basis for a comparative analysis of the
acquisition of major defence projects, and facilitates the development of project planning
and management 'lessons'. Since current Australian public (and private) sector policies
seek to maximise the use of leading edge technology by adapting it to meet specific local
requirements; the examination of these three projects provides an objective determination

impeding their progress. This can arise with students in science,

courses. The problem can be anticipated with mature age students who
are often admitted to courses lacking formal entry qualifications, but
younger students are increasingly involved. The problem is not a static one but has been developing rapidly in recent
years. This Field Study commenced by analysing the extent of the problem
at CCAE, its past development and possible further developments in the
near future. A search was then undertaken for instances of recognition of,
and response to, the problem in other institutions.
Instances of responses elsewhere, and of theory relating to adult learning
and mathematical learning, were assessed for relevance to the CCAE
situation. A response appropriate to the CCAE situation was designed,
implemented, and its initial success evaluated. This response was based
upon an individualised approach, involving diagnosis of individual problems
and needs, self-learning materials in modular form, one-to-one tutorial
assistance in a "Maths Lab", self-paced learning, testing for mastery of
modules using criterion referenced tests.
The evaluation undertaken indicates that this response is basically
successful in the CCAE situation. However, some recommendations for the
future development of the response follow from the evaluation; the most
important of these involves a requirement upon students with weaknesses

in perception of competence in processes practised in
Home Economics education as expressed by students of
Home Economics and those who have not studied Home
Economics.
The research method consisted of applying a
questionnaire to five hundred senior students enrolled
in high schools in Brisbane, Queensland. The survey
items were designed to test students perception and
source of competence and the value they place on Home
Economics knowledge expressed in terms of life skills.
To augment the study, teachers of Home Economics were
surveyed to establish the emphasis they place on
processes during teaching, their perception of sources
of students' skills and the value they place on life
skills taught during Home Economics classes.
The questions focused upon management and design skills
and interpersonal interaction competence.
Results indicated that students of Home Economics
perceived an enhanced level of competence in life skills
at all stages of the design and management processes.
Home Economics students also perceived competence in
practices of caring and a significant number of
behaviours implicit in interpersonal interaction when
compared with non Home Economics students.
Students of Home Economics perceived the school, the
home and their friends as positive sources for skill
development in management, design and interpersonal
interaction. Non Home Economics perceived the home as
the only resource for management skills, but they do not
perceive school, home or friends as resources for
acquiring design skills. However, they target the
school, their friends and home as sources for interpersonal
skill development.
Teachers of Home Economics perceived the school, home
and student's friends as a source of management and
interpersonal skills but responded negatively to the
home as a source of design skills.
Home Economics students, non Home Economics students and
teachers of Home Economics placed a high value on Home

purity (map unit accuracy) should result from increasing the scale of mapping of the soil
resource, since it should enable a more intricate breakdown of the landscape into
landform facet based units. This study compared the predictive success of a 1:1 OK scale
soil association map with the 1:25K and 1:1OOK scale soil landscape maps within the
Birrigai area of the Paddy's river catchment, south west of Canberra, A.C.T. The 1:25K
and the 1:100K scale soil landscape maps were also evaluated in a second larger
evaluation area in the Paddy's river catchment which allowed more of the larger soil
landscape map units to be evaluated. The 1:25K scale soil map was produced by
another author for the A.C.T Government, and was surveyed at a substantially lower
survey intensity than that for the 1:100K and 1:10K scale soil maps (ie only 0.05
observation sites / cm2 of published map). These maps were evaluated using a set of
randomly located independent evaluation sites in each evaluation area, and from these
calculating and comparing standard Marsman &amp; de Gruijter(1986) measures of Map
Purity.
The strength of soil-landscape relationships within this catchment were determined from
a Fixed One Way Analysis of Variance, and from more simplistic graphical
comparisons of the means and standard deviations of the discrete soil data within these
landform based map units. Soil-landscape relationships for the Nominal scale soil data
(ie class type data) were evaluated by comparing the Marsman &amp; de Gruijter(1986)
Homogeneity index ratings among the soil map units. Intensive survey traverses were
also carried out in selected soil landscapes to further evaluate the strength of soil
landscapes present.
The results revealed obvious improvements in map quality associated with increasing
map scale from 1:100,000 to 1:10,000, and these included increases in the predictive
success (Map Purity), reductions in the extent of map unit impurities, and planning
advantages associated with having individual land facets delineated on the 1:10,000
scale map. The respectable purity ratings achieved by the 1:100,000 scale soil
landscape map (ie average purity rating of 63%) was largely attributed to the flexibility
of the "soil material" approach to soil landscape mapping. The relatively poor
performance of the 1:25K consultancy soil landscape map demonstrated the fact that;
any benefit gained from the improved intricacy in the representation of map unit
delineation's with increased mapping scale, will be drastically reduced if it is not
matched by an associated increase in the intensity of field investigations.
Evaluations of the soil-landscape relationships found that the land facets of the Paddy's
river catchment generally failed to delineate areas that were both uniform and unique in
respect of their soil properties. Soil-landscape relationships were instead found to be
quite complex, applying to only certain land facets, and in regards to only certain soil
properties. Soil maps with units based on landsurface features were recommended on
the basis of the importance of other landscape factors other than soils to land capability
ratings, as well as on the useability of such maps. This study recommended the
adoption of a " &gt;2 detailed soil profile observations / land facet in each map unit "
mapping standard to ensure a reasonable estimate of the variability and modal soil
conditions present, as well as a reliable confirmation of the perceived soil-landscape
relationships. The error usually associated with small scale mapping was effectively
reduced by rapid ground truthing, involving driving along the major roads dissecting the
map area and making brief observations of soil exposures on road batters, despite the
bias of the road network making such mapping improvements uneven across the map.
The major point to come from this study was the re-emphasising of the point that soil
spatial variability has to be accepted as a "real landscape attribute" which needs to be
accurately described and communicated to land users, and must not be considered as
some sort of soil mapping failure. The fact that individual facets of the landscape
rarely coincide with unique pockets of uniform and unique soils and soil properties must
be considered simply an on the ground reality of nature, and not some mapping failure.
It was thought that since other landscape factors (eg hillslope gradient) most often
dominate the determination of land use suitability and capability, it is better to
effectively describe the range and modal state of the soil conditions within such facets,
then to attempt to extrapolate possible soil boundaries using geostatistical techniques
which cut across such land facets, and may or may not correlate with real groupings of
soil properties, depending on the spatial resolution of the soil variability distribution in
the landscape. Even so the results of this investigation do put the validity of the
physiographic terrain class mapping model as a predictor of soil traits under question, at
least for the more complex landscape settings.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil maps</field><field name="subject">map scale</field><field name="subject">Birrigai</field><field name="subject">Paddy's river</field><field name="subject">soil association maps</field><field name="subject">soil landscape maps</field><field name="subject">surveying</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060707.102807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading recovery : do children maintain their place in the average band of reading performance in their classrooms in subsequent years?</field><field name="creator">Elliot, Janet Irene</field><field name="description">Compulsory schooling, such as exists in Australia, does not
guarantee literacy in the nation. The literature has established
that a minority of children do fail to learn to read and write
effectively. Failure to learn to read presents a serious disability
to those concerned. Programs such as Reading Recovery are used in
schools to try and identify at risk children and work with them to
reduce illiteracy.
Traditional methods of addressing the literacy problem have not
proven to be effective. Studies in New Zealand, the U.S.A. and in
Australia have established that Reading Recovery is an effective
program. However, there is no longitudinal evidence to establish
whether it is effective in the long run in the A.C.T. This study
sought to establish the long term effectiveness of the program in
the A.C.T. It has compared discontinued Reading Recovery children
three and five years after they had been discontinued from the
program with two 'average ' children from their current class. The
discontinued Reading Recovery sample was drawn by random. The
two classmate control children were selected by the teachers as
performing in the average band of class achievement in reading.
Four research instruments were chosen to collect the data. These
were, interviews with class teachers and the children themselves,
running records, a modified standardized test and an oral retell.
The study confirmed that Reading Recovery is effective in the
A.C.T. and that gains made whilst on the program were sustained in
subsequent years. This being the case, every child who is being
diagnosed as 'at risk' should have access to Reading Recovery .</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">rading recovery</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060707.132302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of school-based curriculum development in ACT primary schools 1975-1976</field><field name="creator">English, K. R.</field><field name="description">The review of the literature, which constitutes the first two
chapters of the study, traces the movement towards the development
of an autonomous ACT education system and the development within that
movement of a philosophy of devolution of decision-making to individual
schools within the larger ACT system.
In particular the Currie, Neal-Radford, Campbell and Hughes Reports
have been drawn upon rather extensively to illustrate, not only the
arguments being put forward for the adoption of a philosophy of school-based
curriculum development, but also the rather strong proposals for
extensive systemic support services for schools, especially in the early
years of the new system.
The second part of the literature survey discusses the possible
problems associated with the implementation of school-based curriculum
development. These problems are mostly associated with five interrelated
elements within curriculum development; manpower, activity,
materials, finance and time. Finally the literature review discusses
feelings of discontent with school-based curriculum development that
have surfaced at various parts of the system in recent times.
Ensuing chapters of the study describe the survey and discuss the
findings. The survey, which involved the completion of a questionnaire
consisting of four parts, was designed to provide information regarding
the extent to which the philosophies of school-based curriculum development
have been adopted, the effectiveness of school and systemic support,
the extent to which teachers have coped with associated problems and to
identify areas of need within the ACT education system with regard to
school-based curriculum development.
The concluding section discusses the implications of these findings
and suggests a number of areas of need within the primary sector of the
ACT Educational System that will have to be satisfied if it is not to
suffer by comparison with Australian state primary education systems in
the future.
Possible areas for future research were then suggested and the
future of school-based curriculum development in ACT primary schools
was discussed.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school-based curriculum development</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060707.132934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Co-op School : The Co-operative School, ACT, 1978-1980, curriculum options compatible with alternative, early childhood education</field><field name="creator">Enright, Coleen</field><field name="description">This field study was based on experiences as a
teacher and parent in an alternative, progressive early
childhood school: The Co-Operative School, O'Connor, ACT.
The data for the study was recorded during 1978, 1979,
1980; the first three years of the school's existence as a
Government school. The development and educational
progress of fourteen girls and boys, aged from five to
eight years in 1978, was followed. The philosophy,
policies , organization, curriculum content, teaching
strategies and general milieu of the school were examined.
The aim of the study was to analyse the philosophy
of the school, as set out in the constitution, and to see
how it related to curriculum and teaching strategies.
Issues of freedom and choice within a compulsory school
environment were examined in relation to the stated aims
of the school: the underlying reason for this examination
was the problem caused by the gap which existed between
philosophy and practice, which caused the experiences of
the children in the school, to often be at variance with
stated aims.
The developmental needs of children in the early
childhood age group, and the personal variables they
brought to the learning situation, were related to the
school environment. Social learning theory was utilised,
as a perspective from which to provide a unified
conceptual basis, for planned interventions in teaching
and learning. The importance of modelling, self-expectation,
feelings of self-efficacy and competency,
were related to the community, the curriculum content, and
teaching strategies of the school.
Decision-making strategies were examined for their
relevance to consensus-based processes and a co-operative
style of community management. Consideration was given to
the provision of a cohesive environment, in which adult
members of the community could participate freely in
autonomous learning experiences with children. The area of
conflict resolution and the incidence of aggressive
behaviour in the school were explored, and techniques for
successful negotiation of differences were suggested.
Areas of the curriculum which have traditionally
been difficult for alternative schools to implement to the
satisfaction of all community members were examined.
Areas such as: goal-setting and m o t i v a t i o n of children;
basic skills in early childhood; transition to mainstream
education; the effect of emergent lifestyle values; the
provision of equal opportunity for girls and boys; and the
importance of co-operative learning strategies.
The study ends with reflections on the place of
alternative, progressive schools in the 1980s, and the
need for such schools to exist to provide an educational
choice for parents and children in the future.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">progressive education</field><field name="subject">early childhood</field><field name="subject">Co-operative School</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">school philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060707.142242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of attempts to change the range of educational alternatives in a provincial city</field><field name="creator">Ennis, Rex</field><field name="description">This study is an attempt to share with others, the experiences of two
people who have worked to extend the range of choices in the provisions for
schooling in a small provincial city. As experienced teachers as well as
parents we felt that the provision of choice was essential if quality and
involvement were to be increased. We were concerned both about our own
children and about schooling in general.
What follows is a case study of our efforts. It is a personal account
of the events, the problems and the successes and failures. Although an
attempt has been made to see these events clearly, to describe them as they
happened, it is quite definitely written from our own point of view. In
writing this account there has been a need for selectivity in regard to
specific details and emphasis. The study sets out to provide sufficient
detail to explain the processes involved without intruding too far into
individual personalities and attitudes.
Nevertheless, these events involve actual people and readers will form
their own impressions. Since one of the important factors in attempts to
bring about this sort of change is the personalities of the persons involved,
the details are important. The writing of the study will have been
worthwhile if the experiences offered here help readers gain insight into
their own involvement in bringing about change or increase their awareness
of the need for careful planning as well as commitment. If it poses further
questions and reactions we would be delighted to hear them.
Throughout the study I have used the collective "we" to signify both
my wife and myself. On occasions indicated, the "we" included a variety
of other people. A Chronology of Events (see Appendix A, page 64) is
included since events referred to in separate chapters were occurring
simultaneously. It should also be stressed that although the account ends
at a certain point our activities continue.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational alternatives</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">provincial city</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060707.141511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Montessori : method or response : a practitioner's investigation into Montessori pre-school education</field><field name="creator">Erskine, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the practice and discourse of Montessori education should be
explicitly concerned with the creation of a culture of response rather than with the
implementation of a method. It is argued that in order for a culture of response to occur
there must be within Montessori discourse and practice an explicit recognition of the need
for teachers to engage critically and continuously with the assumptions that underpin
Montessori thought and practice.
This is difficult, however, because there is a tension between Montessori as a method and
Montessori as response. An attempt is made to examine Montessori discourse in order to
understand the nature of this tension. This involves looking at Montessori discourse from
a perspective that borrows from Poststructuralist thinking.
It is suggested that in Montessori discourse there exists a relationship between certain
elements of the discourse and its practices that may bind tightly together the subjectivity,
or identity, of the teacher; the claims to legitimacy and truth of the discourse itself; and
particular, positivist, notions of the individual, of truth, nature, change, society, and
knowledge.
From a Postructuralist perspective this constellation of relationships begins to unravel
when Montessori discourse is seen to arise from specific beliefs and assumptions that
underpin apparently common sense understandings regarding children, learning, society
and change. These understandings may result in the maintenance of the dichotomy
between the observer and the observed, the teacher and the child, the knower and the
known and the inevitable power relations that accompany such dichotomies. This
Poststructuralist concern with the issue of power is thus a significant issue for educators
who are attempting to provide a learning environment that is responsive to children's
diverse attempts to make sense of the world and to find a voice. A critical engagement
with Montessori discourse, and practice, thus requires an engagement with the ways in
which it may construct a relationship between teacher and child that may be inimical to the
development of a culture of response in Montessori schools.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Montessori</field><field name="subject">pre-schools</field><field name="subject">poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060707.143251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of exotic shrubs on birds or urban yellow box-blakly's red gum (E. melliodora-E. blakelyi) woodland in Canberra</field><field name="creator">Evans, Darren J.</field><field name="description">This study considered the influence of exotic shrubs on birds in urban patches of Yellow Box-
Blakely's Red Gum (E. melliodora-E. blakelyi) woodlands in the Australian Capital Territory,
Canberra. The aim of this research was to identify native and exotic birds that have their
abundance influenced by exotic shrubs. The purpose of this work was to provide more
information to managers of this woodland about the potential impacts of weed control on birds
living in woodland reserves adjacent to suburban areas.
Birds were sampled between 1996 and 1998 using the twenty minute area-search method to
derive estimates of bird abundance. Around 680 twenty minute area-searches were completed,
with 665 of these undertaken at 12 two hectare plots with varying levels of exotic shrub cover
over a period of ten months. The abundance of birds for each of the ten months sampled were
compared by pooling sites into four classes of exotic shrub cover. Classes of exotic shrub cover
were nil, light, moderate and dense. Seasonal inferences were drawn from non-parametric
analysis of variance. Non-parametric measures of association were used to test for correlation
between the mean abundance of bird species at different woodland sites and percentage foliage
estimates of exotic shrub cover. Percentage foliage estimates of native shrub cover were included
in tests for correlation between bird abundance and exotic shrub cover by applying partial
measures of association. To support statistical information, observations of birds in exotic shrub
cover were also recorded. In one woodland site birds were sampled before and after the removal
of exotic shrub cover. No statistical tests were applied to these samples because of a lack of
replication; however, descriptive graphs of the abundance of selected birds following weed
control are presented. To investigate the effect that exotic shrub invasion may have on the
composition of bird assemblages in woodland cluster analysis and ordination of the 12 sites using
the mean abundance of the 75 species recorded between July 1997 and June 1998 were also
undertaken.
The presence of exotic shrub cover in E. melliodora-E. blakelyi woodland in Canberra was found
to have differential effects on bird abundance. Wrens, finches, thornbills, whistlers and pigeons
were more abundant in woodland sites where exotic shrubs were present when compared to sites
with no or little exotic shrub cover. Fruit-eating birds, such as Silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis),
Pied Currawong (Strepera graculina) and Crimson Rosella (Platycercus elegans), were more
abundant in woodland with exotic shrubs in winter and autumn when these shrubs provided food
in the form of berries. The abundance of fruit-eating birds, and wrens and finches was reduced in
a single woodland site following the removal of most of the exotic shrub cover. The Common
Blackbird (Turdus merula) was the only exotic bird which showed a strong association with
exotic shrubs in woodland, while the Laughing Kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae) was
negatively correlated with exotic shrub cover, possibly because prey is harder to detect and
capture in woodland with a shrubby understorey.
Cluster analysis and ordination of the 12 woodland sites did not group sites into the four
experimental classes used to undertake analysis of variance. Multivariate analysis, however, did
reveal that seasonal peaks in the abundance of fruit eating birds affected the composition of bird
assemblages by increasing the mean abundance of these birds in densely invaded sites. Similarly,
structural differences in the understorey resulted in some birds being more abundant in woodland
sites invaded by exotic shrubs when compared to sites lacking a shrubby understorey. The
distance between some sites confirmed this stark difference in bird life when plotted in three
dimensions.
The results of this study suggest that exotic shrubs add food and structural complexity to
woodland habitat. Benefits of structural complexity for small native birds in woodland include
nest sites and protection from predators. These benefits may operate at certain thresholds of
invasion, as the woodland site with the densest level of exotic shrub invasion showed a slight
decrease in the number of wrens and finches. Adverse impacts from exotic shrub invasion may
include reduced open ground in which to forage and loss of floristic diversity in the understorey.
In effect, exotic shrubs add and remove resources in woodland habitat, benefiting some bird
species and limiting others.
These findings suggest that the removal of exotic shrub cover in woodland located in urban
landscapes simplifies the structural complexity of the understorey, reducing the quality of habitat
for some birds. Thus, adverse impacts on biodiversity arising from the invasion of exotic shrubs
in woodland need to be considered against the important role that a diverse bird population has in
maintaining ecosystem function.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">exotic shrubs</field><field name="subject">birds</field><field name="subject">urban yellow box-blakly's red gum</field><field name="subject">E. melliodora-E. blakelyi</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">woodland</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060707.144146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A library services, community needs evaluation model</field><field name="creator">Evans, Idris John</field><field name="description">This study proposes a seven step evaluation model for evaluating
library services using criteria based on community needs. The
evaluation modal does not concern itself with direct measures of
library processes but with examining the end product of those

community needs and library outputs and provide planning steps which

to a specific community unique to itself. The model is presented as a
general model, with implementation guidelines and checklists, as a

Briefly the study attempts to analyse the process of curriculum
change within a sociological framework. The second section deals with
the history behind, and subsequent introduction of similar courses in
Tasmania, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and their
significance to the curriculum innovation under study. The third
section deals with the background to the case study, the context in which
the project was undertaken and the factors which gave rise to it. Emphasis
is given to the negotiations which must go on in reconciling the differing
perspectives of those groups directly involved in the change process. The
process of accreditation and the influence this had on the structure of the
courses is also examined. The problems inherent in developing and
establishing a curriculum innovation are dealt with in considerable depth.
Finally the process of curriculum change is analysed in the context of the
currently available research literature on models and strategies for change
in education. Implications are drawn for future studies in this field.
Hopefully this report will contribute to the various theoretical models

increased antigenic exposure associated with moving into a school like environment.
Saliva samples were collected at regular intervals and analysed for immunoglobulin and

The elevated mucosal immune response observed in previous studies involving children
in day care centres and attending school was not seen in this study. No significant
difference was observed between children who had previously attended Pre-School or
child care centres and those who were attending for the first time. However, a marked
seasonal increase in mean salivary IgA during the winter months was observed and this
increase correlated with an increase in respiratory infections. Hence, in studies of

performance were analysed using fourteen sprint athletes (7 elite performers, 7 sub-elite
performers). Subjects were required to perform sprints over 60m, Counter Movement
Jumps with and without loading (20kg), High Speed Alternate Leg Bounding over 30m
and High Speed Single Leg Hopping over 20m. All athletes were subject to
anthropometric measurement (Height, Weight and Leg Length). Of all variables
measured, the Elite group were significantly better (p&lt;0.001) in Counter Movement
Jump, Time to 60m, Time from 30m to 60m and in their Maximal Running Velocity.
Linear regressions were carried out on all variables that correlated with Time to 30m
(Acceleration Phase) and Maximal Running Velocity at both the pO.OOl and p&lt;0.01
level of significance. This allowed several prediction tables to be compiled that had
performance measures (sprints and jumps) that could be used as testing measures for
sprint athletes to determine their Acceleration Phase and Maximal Running Velocity. A
stepwise multiple regression demonstrated that Time to 60m was the best predictor of
Maximal Running Velocity. Time to 60m, Leg length, High Speed Alternate Leg
Bounding and Sprint Stride Rate were the best predictors of the Acceleration Phase. A
Stepwise cross-validation linear discriminant function analysis was used to determine the
best predictors from both sprint and jump measures that would distinguish an athlete as
an elite or sub-elite performer. From sprint variables, Time to 60m and Time to 30m were
the two variables that best placed a sprint subject in either the Elite or Sub-elite group.
From the bounding variables, Counter Movement Jump and the Ground Contact Time of
the High Speed Alternate Leg Bounding were the two variables that best placed a sprint
subject in either the Elite or Sub-elite group. The present study suggests that Time to 60m
is the best predictor of Maximal Running Velocity and Acceleration Phase. Counter
Movement Jumping and High speed Alternate Leg Bounding are also useful tools in
developing and testing elite sprint athlete performance.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speed strength</field><field name="subject">sprint specific</field><field name="subject">bounding exercises</field><field name="subject">sprint athletes</field><field name="subject">running velocity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060707.160114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language games as a means of encouraging communication in language acquisition</field><field name="creator">Fang, Wang</field><field name="description">The communicative approach is one of the most

competence of students by using informal language practice
and games in teaching. It attempts to look more closely
at the relationship between language acquisition, language
games and communicative language teaching.
This study is based on the theory that language
games and informal language practice allow natural learning
to occur and provide opportunities for developing
communicative competence in a foreign language. While
games and informal language practice are widely used in
language classrooms in many countries, it appears from the
writer's observation and experience of teaching English in
China that there is still, among Chinese teachers and
students, a great deal of suspicion and uncertainty about
the functions and the effectiveness of such classroom
activities. Problems detected in language classrooms in
using these activities and games suggest that Chinese
teachers and students have misunderstood and misused these
activities.
In this study, it is hoped to analyze in some
depth the problems involved in using language games in
China, including the attitudes, teaching methods and
expectations of the teachers and students. Also, it is
hoped to investigate the optimal use of games and practice
in Chinese classrooms.
As the use of games has received little serious
attention in China to date, it is hoped, finally, to
suggest ways of using games effectively to improve
learners' communicative ability.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communicative approach</field><field name="subject">language teaching</field><field name="subject">language games</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060707.160609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing students' choice of library and information studies</field><field name="creator">Farley-Larmour, Kim</field><field name="description">This study endeavoured to establish what influences students to undertake library
and information studies. Are prospective students of library and information
studies choosing their course and future occupation for the same sorts of reasons as
in the past? Are prospective students well informed about their future occupation
when they choose a course of study? What is the relative importance of some of
the factors influencing their choice? Do metropolitan, regional and isolated
students have the same understanding and expectations of their course and future
occupation?
A study of first year undergraduate students of library and information studies at
three universities sought to provide answers to these questions. A quantitative and
qualitative comparison of first year undergraduate students of Library and
Information Studies at the University of Canberra and a random group from the
same University was also undertaken in order to provide some comparative data.
The findings showed that reasons for choosing library and information studies have
generally not changed as much as one might expect. An interest in books and
reading still ranks as a relatively important factor in students' choice, though there
is some evidence of an increased interest in career and employment issues. Library
and information studies students without an occupational background in the
discipline generally have a hazy picture of what is involved in their future
occupation and this lack of knowledge is compounded where students are located in
regional or isolated areas. Generally most library and information studies
respondents expressed a desire to enter 'traditional' workplaces in libraries rather
than entering the broader information management field.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">library and information studies</field><field name="subject">undergraduate students</field><field name="subject">career choices</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060707.161125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the personal experience of peer leadership</field><field name="creator">Farmiloe, Bridget Joy Anne</field><field name="description">Drug use and misuse among young people in Australia has caused concern throughout the
community and has prompted nationwide action to address the problem. One component of
intervention strategies with young people is drug education.
Drug education in Australia represents an international philosophy of prevention and takes
a harm minimisation approach to intervention. One strategy that has had international
success in the area of drug education with young people, and that has been used effectively
in health education in Australia since the 1970s, is peer education.
Peer drug education involves young people conducting drug education sessions with their
peers. An example of peer drug education in Australia is the Teenagers Teaching
Teenagers' (Triple T) program, conducted in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).
Evaluations and descriptions of peer drug education programs tend to focus more on
outcomes pertaining to program recipients and fail to explore in detail the specific
experience of peer leaders. Existing research on the experience of peer leadership does not
explore in detail the personal experience of leaders, that being the effect of peer leadership
training and duties on leaders' personal perceptions of drugs, their behaviour with drugs and
their own feelings and skills.
This thesis explores the personal experience of a group of peer leaders who participated in
the Triple T program in 1994. It considers their perceptions of the program at the time of
training and then goes on to explore the impact of this experience on their formulation of
ideas about drugs to the present day.
The thesis is a qualitative project which utilises in-depth interviewing and focus groups to
gather data and then presents a thematic analysis of participant response. The thesis asks
two research questions,
1. What do young men and women involved in the Triple T program take from the
experience of peer leadership training and duties?
2. In what way does the Triple T' experience appear to contribute to the development
of drug related ideas of these young people in the two years following involvement in
the program?
The findings suggest that the participants gained information, skills and personal
development from the training and generally found it to be a positive experience. However,
participants distanced themselves personally from a substantial amount of the training
content and did not personally reflect on the training content to any great extent at the time
of training. Training processes and some aspects of leadership duties more personally
affected them, although again there was personal distancing from this part of the program.
In exploring the findings there was difficulty determining the influence of the training
experience due to participant reluctance to attribute influence to any one source on the
formulation of ideas. Instead, participants describe a complex interaction of influences on
the formulation of ideas about drugs and a process which involves maintaining control,
upholding the notion of informed choice and incorporating ideas about drugs into the
formation of an adult identity. Influences on these ideas include the training, actual
experiences with drugs and observations of others.
The thesis exploration suggests that being involved in peer drug education does impact on
peer leaders but this experience was not personalised to any great degree at the time of
training. However, in the following two years, participants called on the training
information as well as other influences as they formed their ideas about drugs.
The thesis raises some issues of how to maximise leaders' personal connection to the peer
drug education process, if this is in fact a desired outcome of peer education. It also
suggests the need for further research into the experience of peer leaders who seem to have
remained the least considered party in the peer education movement.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drug abuse</field><field name="subject">peer drug education</field><field name="subject">Teenagers Teaching Teenagers'</field><field name="subject">Triple T</field><field name="subject">peer leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.094543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young children in the art gallery : excursions as induction to a community of practice</field><field name="creator">Fasoli, Lyn</field><field name="description">Learning in 'communities of practice' is a new way of describing and investigating how
people learn and has not been applied extensively in research in early childhood or in art
galleries. This thesis is a critical case study undertaken with preschool children as they
prepared for, participated in and followed up a series of excursions to the National Gallery of Australia. The study explores and analyses children's induction into the
practices of the art gallery and their negotiation of the meanings around these practices in
the gallery and in their preschool. Children's engagement in practices is analysed using a
sociocultural framework for learning called 'communities of practice' (Wenger, 1998) in
combination with a multilevel analysis of the artefacts of practice derived from the
philosophical writings of Wartofsky (1979). Multiple data sources included photographs
of children, their drawings, tape recordings of their incidental talk and group discussions,
and results of play activities as children participated in the practices of the art gallery and
the preschool. Data was also collected through semi-structured interviews with gallery
and preschool staff. In a study involving such young children, the use and juxtaposition
of these multiple sources of data was important because it allowed for the inclusion and
privileging of the material and non-verbal resources as well as verbal resources that
children used as they engaged in practices. Outcomes of this research have been used to
illuminate and problematise early childhood as a site for the intersection of multiple
communities of practice. Learning to make sense of experience is portrayed as more than
language-based 'scaffolding' and the representation of experience through child-centred
play activity. The study provides a detailed descriptive account of children's learning and
sees it as a fundamentally unpredictable and emergent process. It shows that relations of
power are always a part of learning and can be seen through an analysis of the resources
available to children, those they took up and were constrained by in the local situation
and those they brought from other communities of practice. In this process, the children,
as well as their teachers, were active negotiators. They participated in complying with
community-constituted views of knowledge as well as shaping, resisting and contesting
what counted as knowledge. This study makes a contribution to understanding children's
learning in early childhood as fundamentally social, unpredictable, productive and
transformative rather than individually constructed, stable, predetermined and
representational of experience.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communities of practice</field><field name="subject">art galleries</field><field name="subject">early childhood</field><field name="subject">National Gallery of Australia</field><field name="subject">school excursions</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.095714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development, implementation and evaluation of the Diploma of Special Education (UG 2) program at the Nepean College of Advanced Education</field><field name="creator">Fee, Richard Walter</field><field name="description">This field study report is concerned with the development,
implementation and evaluation of a Diploma of Special Education
(UG2) teacher training program. In March, 1974, the Advanced
Education Beard of Mew South Wales requested that Nepean College
of Advanced Education, Westmead, implement a one year training
course for Generalist (Resource) Teachers in Special Education
to begin in February, 1975.
The lecturers in special education, Mr. Richard Fee and Mr.
George Comino, proceed to design a training program which
departed radically from the approach adopted by the other colleges
of advanced education in New South Wales (Mitchell, Newcastle,
Kuring-gai, Alexander Mackie). Instead of following the noncategorical/
commonality approach used at these colleges, Nepean
chose the categorical method. With this method, the education of
a number of different handicapped children is studied separately
(i.e. mentally retarded, orthopaedically handicapped, etc.)
rather than by studying the various disorders collectively (i.e.
Exceptional Children in Society, Exceptional Children in School,
etc.).
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Nepean's approach
to training special education teachers, on-going and summative
evaluation in a variety of forms was carried out during the first
semester. This evaluation which included the administration of a
pilot Teacher Competency in Special Education Self-Rating Scale
clearly demonstrated that the first intake of 29 students made
significant increases in their ability to teach exceptional
children. The results of the evaluation also assisted the lecturers
in determining areas of course weakness which could be alleviated
during the second semester.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diploma of Special Education</field><field name="subject">Nepean College of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">handicapped children</field><field name="subject">exceptional children</field><field name="subject">categorical method</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.100402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of a school based, multimodal program for middle primary boys with difficult behaviours</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Shirley</field><field name="description">This study examined the efficacy of a multimodal intervention with conduct
disordered boys in the middle primary years. The intervention consisted of a behavioural
classroom program; a small group, social skills program; and a behavioural parenting
program Resource implications of this model were also evaluated.
A review of the current literature on conduct disorders showed that these children
account for less than 5% of the population, but they have a strong impact on families,
teachers, peers, schools and the wider community. About 50% of children with severe, early
behavioural problems will continue with these problems, not only throughout their adult
lives, but into the next generation. Early intervention appears to offer our best hope of
altering this trajectory.
Interventions with this population have been largely unsuccessful. At the present
time the most promising intervention is behavioural parent training programs. Combining
these with child focused social skills programs, and behavioural programs in the school
setting, increases their efficacy.
This study used a single subject experimental design to examine the effects of this
program on four boys with behavioural difficulties. Continuous measures were taken with
parent, and teacher daily record charts, and classroom observations. Pre, post and followup
measures were taken with the Child Behaviour Checklist. The results of the study were
mixed. Some subjects, according to some respondents, improved in home and school
behaviours. All three subjects, for whom there was followup data, had improved.
The classroom, and parenting programs appeared to be associated with positive
changes in child behaviour, the small group was associated with more disruptive behaviour
at school.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multimodal intervention</field><field name="subject">boys</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">difficult behaviours</field><field name="subject">conduct disorders</field><field name="subject">behavioural problems</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.101053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The analysis of curriculum structure and its application to curriculum planning and improvement in secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Fergusson, Andrew L.</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to develop a model for the
analysis of curriculum structure and organisation in
Australian secondary schools and to apply a computer
formulation of the model to two case studies. The model
proposes the construction of indicators of curriculum provision
and teacher workload using the raw data provided by school
timetables and class lists. This in turn leads to the idea of
standardising curriculum structure in a way that will enable
comparisons to be made between different schools, the same
school with different timetables or between school
substructures such as year groups.
Limitations and advantages of this approach are explored
through an analysis of the concepts of modelling, information
and organisation. It is proposed that this view of curriculum
implies an evaluation perspective that focusses on school
improvement as a process of informed criticism and collective
decision-making.
Several applications of curriculum analysis are suggested
including the setting of specific goals for school improvement
programmes, industrial applications in the area of workloads
and a scheme for the classification and standardised

relatively little known in Australia, and does not feature at
policy level in the Australian Army. It has, however, been
adopted by the US Department of Defense (US DoD) and the
Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and is being investigated
by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).
TQM is analyzed as a theory and as an organizational
concept. This is supported by extensive analysis and case
studies from US and Australian organizations. The public and
private sector organizations examined provide indications of
the worth of TQM, guidance for planning and implementation,
and the facility to learn from the experiences of others. TQM
cannot be undertaken without detailed, organizationally specific
preparation and requires pro-active support from the
highest level of the organization.
This paper examines the TQM philosophy and the Australian
Army and proposes a model for the development of TQM as an
integral part of the organizational function of the Army. The
emphasis is on general management, the level that has the
responsibility for structuring and managing the Army in
support of all Army functions.
Research conducted by elements of the US DoD is analyzed
to indicate applicability to the future requirements of the
Australian Army.
The paper argues that general management in the
Australian Army has been affected by organizational changes
over time. A management philosophy is now needed that will
support, into the 21st Century, the values and roles required
by the Army. TQM provides such a basis, and the proposed TQM
Development Model provides in turn a sound basis for further
examination of TQM by the Army.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Total Quality Management</field><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">Australian Army</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.104131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Valuing public goods</field><field name="creator">Fethers, A. V.</field><field name="description">There are three broad areas of public administration that
require valuation for public goods. One of these areas is
concerned with value for cost benefit analysis. The concept
here is quantitative, in money terms, and the purpose is to
aid decision making. Planners and economists either
calculate, or estimate total costs and total benefits of
programs or projects as an aid to decision making.
The second broad area involves justifying, or allocating
public resources. Benefits bestowed by intangibles such as
the arts, or questions that affect the environment are
difficult to quantify as value may involve concepts the
beneficiaries find difficult to identify or describe. The
concept of value involves total costs, but also may involve
perceptions of the community about value. Valuation costs
may be calculated from the aggregate demand, but estimating
demand can be difficult.
The third broad area involves estimating demand for government
services such as those provided by the Bureau of Statistics,
and the Department of Administrative Services, as well as many
others, who are being required to charge fees for services
previously provided without direct charge. This development
is part of the trend called corporatisation now occurring in
many countries, including Australia.
Economists and planners have a range of approaches available
to assist them in the estimation of value, whether it be for
the purpose of comparing costs with benefits, or for
estimating the demand for tangible or intangible items like
the arts or statistics.
Surveys have been used for many years to assist a wide range
of decisions by private enterprise. The use of surveys by
government in Australia has been limited, but is increasing.
US and European governments have used surveys to value both
more and less tangible public goods since 1970. Surveys have
also proved useful to assist many other decisions, including
policy making, developing the means for implementing policies,
monitoring and adjusting programs, and evaluation.
This paper is primarily concerned with surveys. A particular
type of survey, known as contingent valuation (CV), has been
developed to assist the estimation of value for intangible
public goods. Also discussed are other applications of
surveys for government decision making, and other ways of
imputing or estimating values, largely developed by economists
and planners to assist cost benefit analysis.
Three examples of surveys used to estimate values are
discussed. These include a survey of Sydney households to
help estimate the value of clean water; an Australia wide
survey to help estimate the value of the arts; and a survey
of Australians to help estimate the value of Coronation Hill
without mining development.
While the paper suggests that surveys have potential to assist
a range of government decisions, examples also demonstrate the
care required to obtain results that are reasonably precise
and reliable.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public administration</field><field name="subject">public goods</field><field name="subject">cost benefit analysis</field><field name="subject">estimating value</field><field name="subject">contingent valuation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.105721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning strategies of a group of English as a second language adult male students</field><field name="creator">Fiedeldy, John</field><field name="description">This study examines the ways in which adult male students approach learning English as a
second language. A number of recent studies have indicated that many male learners
experience considerable difficulty participating in language classes. In particular several
studies have found that course failure rates of male language students were higher than
those of females. The objectives of the present study, therefore, are to: describe the
preferred strategies of a group of male students for approaching language learning;
describe the strategies they use when interacting in class discussion; and to examine the
relationship between learning strategies and ESL academic achievement.
This broad subject has been narrowed down to a specific focus on how male ESL
students develop oral and aural skills. The subjects are a small group of students of the
Adult Migrant English Service Program, Canberra. Data have been obtained through
questionnaires, interviews and observations in classroom settings. The questionnaires and
interviews aim to reveal how frequently, and in what situations, certain learning strategies
appear important to the male students' participation in language learning. These strategies
include those of memory, cognition, compensation, meta-cognition, social communication
and emotion. The observations examine patterns in interaction. Both the questionnaire
and observations provide the basis for statistical analysis.
Literature covering the role of strategies and styles in second language learning, the
characteristics of adult learners; and gender differences in the range of strategies used by
adult learners has been examined and used as a foundation for the present study.
Strategies for listening and speaking are often used without conscious attention given to
them. However, given the right learning environment, male students may develop a range
of strategies that may assist them in ESL learning. This environment exists both
informally, in the community, and in the ESL classroom. It was found that students who
used ESL frequently in community life, such as in a workplace setting, had developed a
"strategy awareness" and were able to call on a broad range of strategies to help them
when interacting with other speakers. Within the classroom, it was observed that
unstructured discussions using open-ended themes encouraged male students to use a
variety of strategies, such as asking questions, asking for clarification and expanding
ideas, to enable them to participate in the communication.
The findings of this study suggest that an awareness of and ability to apply appropriate
learning strategies have an important place in helping male students participate in selected
language learning activities and to develop their ESL skills. An examination of Australian
Second Language Proficiency Rating scores and the Certificate in Spoken and Written
English III results revealed that students who were successful in these assessment
measures, were those who were observed and who reported frequent awareness and
utilisation of the above mentioned strategies.
Finally, it can be suggested that because not all male students have equal opportunities to
use ESL in community life, the English language teacher is in an ideal position to develop
students' strategy awareness. For this to occur, the teacher also needs to create a learning
environment whereby students are encouraged to select from these strategies and to
utilise them in appropriate ways.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English as a second language</field><field name="subject">ESL</field><field name="subject">language classes</field><field name="subject">learning strategies</field><field name="subject">adult male students</field><field name="subject">Adult Migrant English Service Program</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.110402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of exceptional talent in high school students and implications for a school's curriculum</field><field name="creator">Finocchiaro, John I.</field><field name="description">Questionnaires were sent to parents of three hundred

comprehensive school. Parents were asked to indicate the
nature and extent of talent they believed their child possessed.
Their replies were used as the basis for the range of talents -
some fifty two areas - considered in this study.
The questionnaire, together with questionnaires given
to students and teachers, also served to identify seventy five
exceptionally talented children.
The talent areas were grouped into talent 'clusters'
and students representing each cluster were selected for
interviews. During the interviews, parents were asked whether
their son had previously been identified as exceptionally
talented, and what they perceived to be the educational needs
of their son.
These needs were looked at in terms of the formulation
of a differentiated curriculum for exceptionally talented
children.
The curriculum is described mainly in terms of three
teaching modes traditionally associated with gifted children :
grouping, acceleration and enrichment. Each of these is

Government in territory in New South Wales, but distant from Sydney. Interpreted as
cause for building a new city it was, from the earliest deliberations, conceived as a city
beautified by landscape and enhanced by water.
Despite Australia's variable climate, particularly it's unreliable rainfall, the Canberra
site on the Molonglo River provided an opportunity for storing a large body of
ornamental water in a picturesque landscape setting, provided storage reservoirs were
built to maintain water levels. Walter Burley Griffin's design gave the Lake form as a
chain of ornamental lakes and parklands through the centre of the city. However,
developing the Lake was complex and costly and although Parliament met at Canberra
from 1927 it was not until the early 1960s that work began on implementing the Lake.
Lake Burley Griffin was inaugurated in 1964.
Inquiring into the significance of landscape setting and ornamental water for Australia's
National capital the thesis reviews designed landscapes in cities that Australia aspired to
emulate and the role of the professions in these designs. Using Canberra's lake as a
focus this thesis examines the national and international context of landscape ideas,
analyses the processes of landscape implementation in the public domain and evaluates
the design outcome. The thesis also highlights the role of national aspiration, the rivalry
between Federal and State governments, the power of government bureaucracy, the
influence of the design professions and the ascendancy of Modernism as a design force
in the built environment.
The thesis establishes that over the sixty-year period Australian perceptions and
expectations of landscape underwent a fundamental change. From the idea of landscape
as a part of the aesthetic and moral high ground of national consciousness and
international discourse, landscape, particularly landscape with water, became a device
to consolidate power, bolster national pride, garner international recognition and
enhance recreational opportunity. The thesis establishes the fundamental importance of
the Lake landscape in creating a distinctive image of a visually unified National capital
as well as a public place for people.
As an empirical thematic history the thesis articulates landscape ideas and practice with
the creation of a place of national significance. Through links with cultural context, the
history of cities, and the history of design the research and its findings extend the
knowledge base of the profession and practice of landscape architecture in Australia.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">national capital</field><field name="subject">Lake Burley Griffin</field><field name="subject">Molonglo River</field><field name="subject">landscape architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.121506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secondary teachers' perceptions of selected professional development needs and delivery mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Fitzhardinge, Jocelyn</field><field name="description">This study highlights the professional development needs and perceptions of secondary
teachers in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) as these relate to teacher promotion
level, years of teaching experience, and subject specialisation. The study also
investigates the delivery mechanisms best suited to these needs and perceptions.
In a devolving education system, effectiveness of teachers' professional development
will depend on finding an appropriate balance between the systems' needs, the schools'
needs and the needs of individual teachers. A mismatch appears to exist between the
provision of professional development and teachers' perception of their professional
development requirements.
This study was conducted in secondary government high schools and colleges in a
selected school region of the ACT. It involved circulating, collecting and analysing a
survey which included seven questions related to four selected themes on professional
development. These are
&#65533; teachers' participation in professional development activities by time and provider
&#65533; teachers' perception of the effectiveness of formal and informal professional
development in and away from the workplace
&#65533; teachers' preferred delivery system of professional development
&#65533; professional development and the role of the Advanced Skills Teacher classification.
The overall findings of this study indicate that the professional development needs of
secondary teachers in the ACT are as multifaceted and diverse as those found in other
studies such as Logan (1990), DEBT (1991), Boomer (1988) and the Schools Council
(1990). A less centralised more devolved system of professional development has a
greater chance of meeting the varied needs of individual teachers according to the
DEBT (1991) study and the ACT review (ACTDET, 1993: 52).
In the ACT a centralised program of professional development is provided by the
Professional Development Section of the ACT Department of Education and Training
(ACTDET). This centralised model of professional development delivery is the most
used provider of professional development services and programs within the ACT,
although 43% of the respondents in this study did not attend any courses offered by the
Professional Development Section.
Overall this study found very little variation occurred in teachers' beliefs about whether
professional development is more effective if conducted through formal courses, or by
informal associations with teachers, students and parents. The findings imply the need
for a balance between on-site and off-site delivery mechanisms of professional
development. Working with colleagues for professional development purposes is
supported by the respondents who agreed with involving the proposed Advanced Skills
Teacher 2 classification (AST 2) with specific organisational and leadership
responsibilities for professional development.
This study found that respondents in Health/PE and Science had very low participation
rates in courses offered by the Professional Development Section, compared to other
key learning areas, and they perceived that they improved their knowledge and skills to
a greater degree 'on' the job, that is, at school. Teachers with extended teaching
experience perceived formal courses to be a more effective means of improving their
skills and knowledge.
In conclusion this study raises the question of balancing the needs of the individual
teacher with those of the school and the system. It has highlighted the need for a more

any researcher immense freedom to investigate those area(s) which are of particular
interest to him/her. While there are set theoretical parameters for studying
organisations, eg. various theories looking at organisational communication, structure
and networks, the only real limitation lies in the mind of the researcher. That is the
beauty and nature of organisations, they do not have to wholly conform to any set ideal,
rather they have the opportunity to be unique and diverse depending upon the
organisation's purpose.
It seems that most investigations of organisations are one dimensional, ie. reporting on
what actually happens or how efficient processes are or attempting to define aspects of
culture. However, in this thesis a second dimension has been added&#65533;intercultural
aspects of communication. Hence, the research evaluates the intersection of the
intercultural communication which exists within an organisation.
For this two dimensional approach, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) was chosen. As with most bureaucratic organisations, due to the
size and complexity it is not practicable to look at an entire organisation For this
thesis, a case study of one of ATSIC's twenty-seven regional offices was undertaken.
Details of this follow in the paper; however, the two main reasons for choosing to
complete a case study of ATSIC are 1) because the author is full-time employee with
access to people, facts and inside information that might otherwise not be available and
2) ATSIC is not a typical bureaucracy; rather it is atypical due to its structure and
purpose, which is to further the economic, social and cultural diversity of Aboriginal
people and Torres Strait Islanders. While part of the Commonwealth Government,
ATSIC is founded upon, and is committed to, furthering both intercultural concepts and
the economic status of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. This is
accomplished by ATSIC being the major advisory body to Government; attending
national and international policy forums; raising awareness of Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander cultures; and in providing supplementary funding (through both grant
and loan initiatives) which supports other funding that is given to indigenous people or
organisations through Government mainstream programs (health, housing, education,
social welfare etc.).
To further limit the scope of this research, the communication which has been analysed
is that relating to grant administration. As ATSIC plays a major role in providing grant
funding to indigenous people, this area of evaluation is highly important, as it shows
how ATSIC (represented by one regional office) carries out its functions and business:
providing services and assistance to its clients&#65533;the Aboriginal people and Torres Strait
Islanders.
The case study includes comments gleaned from both questionnaires and interviews
from staff and managers within the chosen regional office. This also includes views of
indigenous and non-indigenous people as well as views from the elected community
representatives of that region. It is envisaged that by incorporating the views of those
mentioned above, that the data is as complete, valid and reliable as possible As with
any traditional group of people, there are different norms and cultures which permeate
their social and working lives. The information presented in this thesis is based on
views of a non-indigenous person who has collected data from one specific region and
it is not valid to generalise these findings to other regions in Australia.
Communication in ATSIC is highly complex and difficult to explain to those outside
the organisation. A main reason for this is that there are many requirements that both
the Government and the indigenous communities place on ATSIC, and unfortunately
they are often diametrically opposed. This creates quite an ironic and disharmonious
situation for all parties concerned&#65533;a bureaucracy versus intercultural perspectives.
These situations are discussed throughout the thesis. It is important for readers to note
that the ideas which are conveyed in this thesis are the author's own and are not
necessarily those of ATSIC, the Government or indigenous people.
This research experience is one which has been extremely beneficial for the author.
While the author's personal views may not be aligned with others, I challenge those
people to read not only this thesis, but other work like it so that they may be in a
position to make their own informed decisions about controversial issues such as
Aboriginal affairs.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">organisational communication</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission</field><field name="subject">ATSIC</field><field name="subject">bureaucracy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.123605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of particulate matter pollutants in the Canberra air shed, including total suspended particles PM10, lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</field><field name="creator">Fox, Ian</field><field name="description">Methods for the determination of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)

associate pollutants such as Total Suspended Particulate matter (TSP), Particulate
Matter with an equivalent aerodynamic diameter less than 10 micrometres (PM10)
and lead concentration were also reviewed to determine trends. Motor vehicle
emissions appear to be the source of the PAHs and differences between the types
and concentrations of PAHs detected at central business district sites verses
suburban sites were noted. Wind erosion, biomass burning, motor vehicle emissions
and industrial processes are sources of particulate matter in the atmosphere. Lead
comes mainly from motor vehicles emissions in the ACT with some lead possibly
from the burning of lead contaminated fuel. TSP and lead concentrations have
decreased since air quality monitoring began in the early 1980s. PM10 concentration
may also have fallen but the data set for PM10s is to small to draw any firm
conclusions. Only TSP lead concentrations displayed a seasonal pattern. The ACT
air pollution Act 1984 has placed restriction on the burning of fuels to improve air
quality in the ACT. The air quality in regards to TSP and lead is improving.
However, the only strong links between the Act and decreased pollutant
concentrations is the introduction of unleaded petrol and the decrease of airborne
lead concentrations.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">PAHs</field><field name="subject">Total Suspended Particulate matter</field><field name="subject">TSP</field><field name="subject">motor vehicle emissions</field><field name="subject">fuel</field><field name="subject">air quality</field><field name="subject">lead consentrations</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.125220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The marine and terrestrial ecology of a northern population of the Little Penguin, Eudyptula minor, from Bowen Island, Jervis Bay</field><field name="creator">Fortescue, Martin</field><field name="description">The breeding success of the Little Penguin was significantly higher in northern
populations compared with documented southern colonies. Several southern colonies
including Phillip Island in Victoria and colonies in Tasmania, have been characterised by
poor breeding success, increasingly later commencement of breeding, and declining
populations. This study aimed to compare and contrast the ecological attributes of a
thriving northern population with other documented colonies. I collected long term data
on breeding success (1987 to 1997) of the Little Penguin on Bowen Island, and related
variability in breeding success to ocean currents and climate patterns, foraging behaviour
and diet, nesting habitat, and inter-specific and fisheries competition. The benefits of
successional changes to nesting habitat on Bowen Island since active habitat management
commenced in 1989 were examined, including the importance of burrow depth, aspect,
distance to water from the burrow, and vegetation type on breeding success of the Little
Penguin.
Morphological measurements of east coast penguins indicated a north-south
cline, similar to that described in New Zealand. The Little Penguin was larger at higher
latitudes. Whilst adults were sedentary and displayed a high degree of nest site fidelity,
juveniles dispersed widely in their first three years, but then returned to the colony,
sometimes to their natal burrow, to breed. This appears to be an adaptive mechanism,
which selects for high quality nesting habitat. The study confirmed earlier findings that
mature vegetation assemblages, namely woodland and forest, support higher breeding
success than structurally simpler grassland and herbland habitat. This may contribute to
observed differences in breeding success between northern and southern colonies,
because many of the southern colonies have degraded nesting habitat.
Most important to the diet of the Little Penguin were clupeoids, which dominated
the fish species of Jervis Bay. The substantial clupeoid resources were targeted by the
tuna fishery for bait, in the same areas and coinciding with maximum demands (chick
raising and fledging), as penguins. The potential quantity of baitfish taken from Jervis
Bay was over 10, 000 tonnes per year, which was well beyond the quantities raising
concerns in other regions, although the fishery remains unregulated. Nevertheless, the
foraging range of Bowen Island penguins was smaller than has previously been
described Little Penguins on Bowen Island had a heavy reliance on relatively shallow
waters of the Bay, within 5 km of the island. Daily foraging distances exceeding 20 km
coincided with low breeding success, sometimes below that required for population
replacement. Greater daily foraging range during the breeding season in southern
Victoria may explain in part why these populations are declining.
The principal mechanism for nutrient enrichment of Jervis Bay waters was the
East Australia Current (EAC). This is a large and powerful, warm water boundary
current of 250 km diameter and 1000 feet depth, which promoted slope water intrusion
through upwelling along the New South Wales coast during the study, particularly
during the penguin breeding season. The EAC effects northern colonies, but less so
southern colonies.
The Bowen Island colony was prone to periodic breeding failure, which was
related to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, indicated in Australia
by the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). ENSO warm events, corresponding with
negative values of the SOI, depressed the EAC and caused downwelling, leading in some
seasons to increased breeding failure. There was a correlation between both fledging
success and adult mortality, and the SOI. The mean breeding success of the Bowen
Island colony, at 1.46 chicks per pair over the ten-year study, was the highest recorded
for the Little Penguin, and the population was increasing.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine ecology</field><field name="subject">terrestrial ecology</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">Little Penguin</field><field name="subject">Eudyptula minor</field><field name="subject">Bowen Island</field><field name="subject">Jervis Bay</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.125940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meditation and mental health</field><field name="creator">Fowler, Lesley</field><field name="description">The claims of the traditional texts and teachers of Buddhist meditation include the enhancement of mental health.

interrelationships between innovation in nursing education,
professional attitudes and wastage from nursing. Five groups of
students who participated in innovative nurse education courses in
A.C.T. hospitals in the 1970's were surveyed by a self
administered questionnaire which gathered biographical data as
well as attitudinal information. Their responses were compared
with those of students who had undertaken a traditional nursing
course at an A.C.T. hospital in the same period.
The findings of this study suggested that the instrument used may
provide a better measure of satisfaction with nursing than of
professional attitudes. One of the unexpected findings from the
survey which suggested the need for further study was that many of
those who had undertaken further nursing study indicating apparent
commitment to continuing education in a chosen career would not
encourage others to enter nursing. Another was that those who
indicated greater career choice commitment may in fact be those
who felt unable to obtain alternative employment.
It was found that innovation in hospital based nurse education
courses attracted different people and produced graduates with
different attitudes to professional issues,who followed
different career pathways compared to graduates of traditional
nurse education courses. Innovative courses appear to have
attracted older and better qualified entrants and to have
increased the likelihood of graduates being promoted. Respondents
from the innovative courses showed increased interest in
continuing education and Professional Association activity than
their control group colleagues. They were more frustated with the
traditional role of the nurse as the selfless, dedicated worker
and were less commited to their career choice, overall these
findings perhaps indicated a level of dissatisfaction with nursing
higher in the innovative course graduates than in the control
group. These findings may support Brief's contention (1976) that
expectations raised during the educational process, if not
fulfilled, will lead to wastage.
wastage from nursing was intimately linked with dissatisfaction
with work conditions in nursing. Those who had permanently left
nursing had more frequently left for work related reasons and
undertaken non-nursing study than those who had left and returned
or who had never left. Those who left for work related reasons
were less likley to return and less likely to choose nursing again
if given the chance than those who left for other reasons.
Findings about the institutionalisation of innovation in nursing
education were difficult to identify with certainty, since time
lapse alone could explain many of the findings. Attitudes to the
Professional Association were more favourabe in respondents from
the later intakes into the innovative courses than from the
earlier. Given the recent increases in industrial activity in
nursing, this finding is consistent with time lapse. Later intakes
also demonstrated greater commitment to continuing education than
earlier. This too can probably be explained by the greater
availability of such facilities in more recent times.
In a period of shortages of nurses prepared to work in the health
care facilities of Australia, and of changes in the educational
preparation of nurses, the findings of this study relating to
attitudes and wastage should be used as the basis for future
workforce planning.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">innovative nurse education courses</field><field name="subject">wastage</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">nursing education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.132455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The amalgamation of Chevalier College, Bowral, and Elm Court, Moss Vale : two years of preparation</field><field name="creator">Franzmann, John</field><field name="description">In January 1975, Chevalier College, Bowral, and Elm Court,
Moss Vale, schools for boys and girls respectively situated six kilometres
apart, began discussions about extending their present combination in the
senior school to full co-education in a fully combined high school.
Chevalier would become the senior partner and take over administration
of the combined school.
In 1975, support was sought from religious communities,
teaching staffs and parents involved, and detailed planning began
in several committees.
The next year brought conflict. For reasons so frequently
associated with resistance to change, such as loss of power and
identity, intensified by thoughtlessness from Chevalier, the Elm
Court community began to resist and work against the amalgamation.
The diocesan education authorities, appealed to by the local sisters,
suggested an alternative proposal to replace the amalgamation.
However, after further consideration by the superiors of the
sisters at Elm Court, and helped by more careful consideration from
Chevalier, the project finally went ahead.
The major decisions concerned with the amalgamation were made
by the superiors of the two religious orders concerned, and then by the
school headmaster, assisted by his councils. There was very little
real involvement of the local community of parents, or of the students.
With the crisis successfully weathered, prospects seem bright
for 1977, especially if the lessons learnt during the conflict are
remembered.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school amalgamations</field><field name="subject">Chevalier College</field><field name="subject">Bowral</field><field name="subject">Elm Court</field><field name="subject">Moss Vale</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.142627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Addiction and subjectivity : concepts of personhood and illness in 12 step fellowships</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into ways of seeing 12 Step fellowships. The
latter provide a popular but controversial means of recovery from various
addictive behaviours. The conceptual basis of 12 Step fellowships is the idea
that addictions are an illness or disease, and this idea has become the focus
of the negative critiques of 12 Step fellowships. Concepts of illness and
disease are closely related to concepts of personhood. What 12 Step
discourses construct as 'illness' can also be understood as a condition
characterised by failure of human capacities for agency, choice, and
responsibility. How we understand 12 Step discourses of addiction, illness,
and recovery will depend greatly upon the concepts of personhood, illness,
and knowledge that inform our view.
In order to investigate the concepts that make diverging views of 12 Step
fellowships possible, this study develops post-Enlightenment concepts of
personhood, illness and knowledge. I use these concepts as a lens with which
to examine the negative critiques, and to provide a more positive reading of
12 Step fellowships and illness concepts. In doing so, this thesis aims to
show, first, that a positive view that can articulate the value of 12 Step
fellowships to 12 Step members is possible, and second, that 12 Step
fellowship discourses are philosophically interesting and challenge modern
western notions of the self and its capacities.
The thesis has six chapters. Chapter One presents an overview of the study,
and introduces the basic concepts and practices of 12 Step fellowships.
Chapter Two presents an epistemology called perspectivism which provides
my research methodology as well as a means of analysing the
epistemological assumptions at work in the negative critiques of 12 Step
discourses.
In order to understand how the capacities of the self may fail, and how such
failures might be remedied, Chapter Three presents a post-Enlightenment
theorisation of personhood as constituted, embodied, and socially embedded
subjectivity. This theorisation enables us to examine how embodied selves
may be constituted with diminished capacities for agency, responsibility,
and choice, and permits the construction of an account of addiction that
explains why addictive disorders are a significant social problem in
contemporary western societies. Finally, this theorisation enables us to
investigate the concepts of personhood that inform the negative critiques.
Chapter Four investigates how concepts of illness inform the negative
critiques, and shows that it is possible to understand terms such as 'illness'
and 'disease' in a non-medical sense. Arguably, such understandings are
better able to illuminate the connection between the notion of illness and
recovery practices in 12 Step discourses of addiction.
Chapter Five uses the conceptual framework provided by Chapters Two,
Three, and Four to present a positive view of 12 Step fellowships and
discourses. The three key features of this view are, first, that 12 Step
fellowship discourses describe addictions as an illness of the self; second,
they provide a phenomenology of the sick self; and third, 12 Step recovery
discourses and practices are consistent with the notion that the constituted
self is limited, and can be reconstituted or changed through practice of the
12 Step recovery program. Together, these three key features show us that
12 Step fellowships provide a valuable social resource for people with limited
capacities for self-regulation to help themselves and each other.
Chapter Six considers the implications of this more positive view of 12 Step
fellowships in terms of the primary and secondary aims of this thesis.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">12 Step fellowships</field><field name="subject">addiction</field><field name="subject">illness</field><field name="subject">personhood</field><field name="subject">perspectivism</field><field name="subject">subjectivity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.143358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A tale of two schools : two organizational patterns for catering for the gifted</field><field name="creator">Freney, Peter J.</field><field name="description">During the past decade, an increase in activity associated
with the education of the gifted has been evident. This
study provides a social and evaluative framework from
which to view two organizational means of making
educational provision for gifted students. In-class
provision in one school is compared statistically and
descriptively with a partial withdrawal system in another.
The Stake evaluation model was used to provide a focus and
classification system for the collection and processing of
naturalistic data. Group tests of ability, attainment
and attitudes were administered in order to obtain some
more objective data.
Evolutionary changes in the schools during the twelve
month period make for difficulties in comparison; the
reasons for the changes occuring highlight the
difficulties which classroom teachers have in
understanding and coming to grips with teaching gifted
students. Any advantage in terms of student outcomes was
weighted towards the school with in-class provision. The
writer postulates that this was due to the collective
responsibility, or ownership of the program, assumed by
the teachers in this school, as opposed to the situation
in the other school, where only one teacher, the
withdrawal teacher, was prepared to assume this
responsibility. This study will provide valuable insight

parenting education in the ACT for indicators of
effectiveness and needs. Users (n = 207) and providers
(n = 7) were surveyed for information on educational and
administrative aspects of the service. An original
design questionnaire was based on the PRECEDE framework
(predisposing, reinforcing and enabling factors in
educational diagnosis and evaluation) and the social
model of health. Items were drawn from the relevant
literature, concerning individual, social and service
delivery elements of the health fields concept
interpreted for pregnancy, childbirth and parenting.
Individual factors were related to Maslow's hierarchy and
the valuing approach to health education. The provider
survey covered information on organisational elements,
comprising inputs, processes, products, outputs and
outcomes of childbirth education.
The study comprised a literature review, cross-sectional
non-experimental surveys of users and providers, and a
needs assessment combining information from each of the
three sources. Descriptive statistical techniques,
analysis of variance and valuing analysis were used to
extract information on effectiveness indicators and needs

from the user data. Comparisons were made between
present and past users, and between women of different
ages, experience of pregnancy and preferences for public
or private methods of education for childbirth.
No evidence was found of individual differences in the
women's attitudes, beliefs and values that could be
attributed to education. However, users expressed strong
approval and positive views of the service and its
providers. The level of personal health skills,
confidence and emotional preparatiqn they achieved
through childbirth and parenting education did not fully
meet their expectations.
The survey also found that the organisation of childbirth
and parenting education has not developed professionally
like other health services. Service goals and objectives
are ill-defined; planning and coordinating are inadequate
for an integrated maternal health care system. The
service's main resources are its highly motivated and
dedicated teachers and clients. Several recommendations
are made for educational and administrative measures to
enhance service effectiveness within present
organisational constraints, based on the needs identified

system within the Sydney metropolitan water supply network and are both
shallow, well mixed, polymictic water bodies. After construction in 1973,
land use activities within the catchments changed from low intensity grazing
to more intensive practices such as dairying, particularly on the northern
foreshore of Wingecarribee Reservoir, and vegetable farming around Fitzroy
Falls Reservoir. The change in land use practice raised concerns about the
possible impact on water quality of the reservoirs. This study sought to
differentiate between the influence of catchment effects, inter-reservoir
transfers and seasonality to enable an assessment of long term trends in
water quality to be made.
Data collected on a monthly basis by the Water Board between October
1973 and December 1985 were assessed and representative or 'indicator'
variables for the different influences were selected. Classification of the
phytoplankton to create sample clusters followed by discriminant analysis of
the abiotic data were performed to rank the 'indicator' variables
The classification analyses indicated that time of sampling was more
important than site differences in determining clustering and that both
Wingecarribee and Fitzroy Falls Reservoirs were well mixed and similar. The
influence of chronological changes following the initial filling of the
reservoirs, seasonality and inter-reservoir transfers were detected in the
clustering patterns. Changes attributable to land use activities within the
catchments were not detected. The reduction in concentrations of variables
from high values following the initial filling of the reservoirs was the
main influence regulating clustering between 1974 to 1982 and the influence
of seasonality on clustering was most apparent during 1976 and 1978. The
assessment of the influence of inter-reservoir transfers was restricted
because of limited data.
Seasonal periodicities and ongoing changes in the phytoplankton and
physical and chemical data over the study period were assessed as a means of
interpreting and verifying the analysis results.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wingecarribee Reservoir</field><field name="subject">Fitzroy Falls Reservoir</field><field name="subject">phytoplankton</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">Sydney metropolitan water supply network</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060711.092625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In search of appropriate techniques for teaching speaking skills to Chinese tour guide students</field><field name="creator">Fu-xiang, Wang</field><field name="description">With the rapid development of the tourism industry

Emydura krefftii inhabiting the Townsville Area of Tropical North Queensland. Two sites
were located in the Ross River, which runs through the urban areas of Townsville, and two
sites were in rural areas at Alligator Creek and Stuart Creek (known as the Townsville
Creeks). Earlier studies of the populations in Ross River had determined that the turtles
existed at an exceptionally high density, that is, they were superabundant, and so the
Townsville Creek sites were chosen as low abundance sites for comparison.
The first aim of this study was to determine if there had been any demographic
consequences caused by the abundance of turtle populations of the Ross River. Secondly, the
project aimed to determine if the impoundments in the Ross River had affected the freshwater
turtle fauna. Specifically this study aimed to determine if there were any difference between
the growth, size at maturity, sexual dimorphism, size distribution, and diet of Emydura krefftii
inhabiting two very different populations.
A mark-recapture program estimated the turtle population sizes at between 490 and
5350 turtles per hectare. Most populations exhibited a predominant female sex-bias over the
sampling period. Growth rates were rapid in juveniles but slowed once sexual maturity was
attained; in males, growth basically stopped at maturity, but in females, growth continued
post-maturity, although at a slower rate. Sexual maturity was at 6-7 years of age for males,
which corresponded to a carapace length of 150-160 mm, and 8-10 years of age for females,
which corresponded to a carapace length of 185-240 mm. The turtles were omnivorous,

Land-use and primate conservation : conflicts and solutions in Tana River National Primate Reserve, Kenya</field><field name="creator">Gachugu, David Mukii</field><field name="description">This study is based in Tana River National Primate Reserve (TRNPR), Kenya. The
reserve, established in 1976 to protect remnant patches of riverine forests from
increasing human pressure is home to two endemic endangered primate subspecies,
Tana River Red colobus (Colobus badius rufomitratus) and Tana River Crested
mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus galeritus). Habitat encroachment through indigenous
farming and forest uses was thought to be one of the causes of drastic colobus and
mangabey population decline after 1975. This study aimed at; generating information
on the impact of these human land-uses on the habitat, this would facilitate the
preparation of management recommendations which would improve the chances of
survival of primate habitats without compromising the welfare of indigenous people.
Using 3 sets of aerial photographs and a geographic information system, information on
land-use changes over time has been generated. A 3 month field work generated
information on agriculture, forest uses and other relevant socio-economic information.
Results from the study indicate that: (i) human population has increased by more than
two-folds between 1969 and 1991; (ii) this has not corresponded to a net increase in
forest area decrease or farm area increase; (iii) there has been a net increase in area
under forest and decrease in area under agriculture; (iv) spatial and temporal changes in
forest area explain colobus population crash observed between 1975 and 1985, (v)
indigenous farmers interviewed prefer a compromise, where they are allowed controlled
access to land within the reserve. They showed a keen knowledge of conservation costs
and benefits and cause-effect processes between humans and the environment.
Management recommendations advocate measures that encourage indigenous people to
be partners in conservation.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">monkeys</field><field name="subject">humans</field><field name="subject">primate conservation</field><field name="subject">Tana River National Primate Reserve</field><field name="subject">Kenya</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">Tana River Red colobus</field><field name="subject">Colobus badius rufomitratus</field><field name="subject">Tana River Crested mangabey</field><field name="subject">Cercocebus galeritus galeritus</field><field name="subject">land-use</field><field name="subject">habitat encroachment</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060711.121336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The significance of the role of non-governmental organisations in development in India</field><field name="creator">Gali, Priya Antony</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis examines the various factors which
influence the role of NGOs in development in India. Despite the centrality
of NGOs to the development process in the projects examined, little effort
has been made to look at existing experience in terms of what works and
what does not work in actual practice. This study attempts to analyse the
importance and effectiveness of NGOs through the documentation and
analysis of the experiences of five NGOs. The five NGOs are: CERTH
India and RDI, in the union territory of Pondicherry; ASHA and GRAM, in
Krishna and Adilabad districts respectively in the state of Andra Pradesh;
and PMDS, in the South Arcot district of the state of Tamil Nadu.
These five organisations have spent the five to 15 years organising their
respective client communities. The local organisations that have come
into existence through their efforts have reached a stage at which village
units have federated and are displaying self-management skills to varying
degrees. Specific dimensions of the NGOs examined in this study/
include: influencing factors related to their communities and
environments; objectives, strategies, structure and functioning, focusing
on community participation, vulnerable groups, empowerment,
sustainability, the importance of participatory evaluation and participatory
research in an NGO; administration and accountability of NGOs; and
enabling relations and collaborations which have to be fostered between
government and NGOs on the one hand, and global institutions and
NGOs on the other.
The main approach used in this study was the use of In-depth, openended,
informal interviews and discussions based on pre-planned
questions, with a range of NGO staff and members of the organisations.
Direct contact with some of the beneficiaries, a literature review, and
project reports and records also aided the study.
The results showed that strategies and techniques used by the NGOs are
valuable for attaining self-reliant development. Holistic development is
best achieved when the organisation aims at transforming all the
important dimensions of people's lives through the process of collective
reflection and action on the forces that presently prevent them from
developing.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-governmental organisations</field><field name="subject">NGOs</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">holistic development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060711.122120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information communication and employee reports : trade union views</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Brian</field><field name="description">The communication of information between employers
and employees is gaining increased attention in the theory
and practice of industrial relations. The views of trade
unions on aspects of information communication have been
neglected despite the ability of trade unions to affect the
success or failure of attempts by employers to communicate
with their employees. The purpose of this research report
is to establish some tentative conclusions as to trade union
views on information communication in general, and the more
specific method of communication involving employee reports.
Findings of the report are based on data collected
by means of a mall questionnaire survey involving all unions
affiliated with the Labor Council of New South Wales in May,
1979. Analysis is performed manually using non parametric
tests in accord with the nominal characteristic of the data.
The most significant finding of the report is that
the majority of trade unions are in favour of employers
issuing employee reports. This view is not affected by the
size of the unions, the public sector concentration of the
unions, nor the political ideology of the unions. Trade unions
also believe that the most important information for
inclusion in employee reports is safety and health information,
closely followed by future employment levels and prospects,
pay and conditions, and balance sheets.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">employers</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">trade unions</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">employee reports</field><field name="subject">Labor Council of New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060711.132133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of effective teaching skills : with particular reference to a Singapore context</field><field name="creator">Seng, Gee Chiau</field><field name="description">This study sets out to analyse the teaching skills of an

Australia today. This action research study concerns learning and teaching with
participants in a government labour market program which was established to address
these two issues.
The study was based on three cycles of action research with six groups of participants.
The main objective of the research evolved to consider whether critical thinking and
action learning can enhance self-concept and environmental education for unemployed
young people. The research provides a positive response to this problem, although
certain limitations are noted. Conclusions are drawn in five areas. Three of these are
from the first cycle of action research. These relate to environmental attitudes,
knowledge and action; approaches to environmental education and learning; and the
impact of unemployment, peer pressure and mass culture. Two conclusions are drawn
from the second cycle of action research. These relate to the integration of action
learning and critical thinking strategies into the learning and teaching; and the
individual participants' life history and prior knowledge and experience of
environmental issues.
Recommendations are made concerning professional development and support for staff
working in the area, and the planning and implementation of programs. The major
recommendation is for the integration, where appropriate, of integrated critical thinking
and action learning strategies, through all aspects of the training and project work. This
recommendation draws on evidence from a number of areas where these approaches are
shown to be beneficial. These include the potential for emancipation and improved selfconcept,
and the contribution to environmental education.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landcare</field><field name="subject">Environment Action Program</field><field name="subject">unemployed young people</field><field name="subject">ACT.

developing policy. At the school level issues of curriculum, faculty groupings and
structure, strategy for staff allocations and resourcing of faculties, often results in
debate before being decided upon. So often valuable time and resources are wasted in
argument, disagreement and political activity.
This study has been designed to determine what actually happens in the decision
process, with the subject of the study a single committee. The aim of the study is to
determine the style of policy development that took place and what influences
affected the decisions made.
The study is in two parts. The first section develops a Conceptual Framework and
research questions to categorise, summarise and organise data collected from policy
development processes. The Conceptual framework was designed to permit analysis
of the major components of the stages of Problem Structuring, Generation of
Alternatives and Recommending Policy Actions. The second section in includes
further Research Questions to determine whether the process applied to developing
policy was Rational, Nonrational (Incremental/Political) or a Mixed Model type.
The research method used was naturalistic and qualitative in nature and in the context
of a case study.
The main findings were that a Mixed Model of policy development was used by the
Committee with elements of both Rational and Nonrational process evident from the
research data.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">policy making</field><field name="subject">policy development</field><field name="subject">schools</field><field name="subject">rational</field><field name="subject">nonrational</field><field name="subject">mixed model</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.092715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Overseas students and library use : a study at the Australian National University and the University of Canberra of patterns of use and difficulties encountered</field><field name="creator">Githiomi, Jane</field><field name="description">The present study attempted to investigate the usage of libraries by overseas
students. The research was carried out in two universities in the ACT, namely,
the Australian National University (ANU) and the University of Canberra (UC).
The study investigated two main aspects: the use of institutional as well as other
libraries in the ACT, and the difficulties encountered in utilising institutional
libraries. These two aspects were also treated as the dependent variables.
Relationships between these two dependent variables and the following
characteristics, which were regarded as the independent variables, were tested: the
institution attended (ANU or UC), having had library orientation in the
institution attended, previous use of libraries, mediums of instructions in
previous educational institutions, level of study, year of study, period of time
spent in Australia, gender, and age.
The research used survey methodology. A questionnaire was sent to a sample of
521 overseas students and a response rate of 72 percent was obtained.
With regard to the use of institutional libraries, it was found that most students
visited their libraries more than once a week. The three most used library
facilities were borrowing books, use of library staff for assistance and the short loan
service, while the three least used facilities were inhouse information sheets,
abstracts and indexes, and CD-ROM databases. The three most used libraries in the
ACT in descending order were the ANU library system, the National library of
Australia, and the University of Canberra library.
Difficulties encountered in utilising institutional libraries included difficulty in
utilising library facilities, difficulty with library rules and regulations, difficulty in
looking for required materials in the libraries, unsuccessful library visits,
difficulties as a result of English being a second language, difficulty following the
layout of the libraries and perception of the libraries' atmosphere.
Relationships were found between some of the independent variables and the
dependent variables. In some cases, the findings were expected while in other
cases they were unexpected. With the unexpected findings, it is possible that one
or more independent variables, other than the ones under consideration,
influenced the findings thus leading to surprising results.
The study concludes with recommendations and suggestions for further research.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">library use</field><field name="subject">Australian National University</field><field name="subject">University of Canberra</field><field name="subject">overseas students</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.093327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being a boy in a primary school</field><field name="creator">Glenn-Hume, David</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a poststructuralist methodology and leads to a Foucauldian analysis of
power, subjectivity and discursive practices for a group of twelve boys in a Year 3 and 4
classroom.
The thesis is written in a poststructuralist way, and as such, it is experimental. It
experiments with a writing style that encourages the critical engagement of the reader in
deconstructing the text. The personal subjectivity of the author is placed in the
foreground risking a vulnerability that is not apparent in theses generally.
The thesis describes the structure and practicalities of research in a primary school
classroom using a video camera to collect data. Transcripts were made from videotapes
of a school day and interviews with the boys. These were analysed for the frequency of
use of Foucault's "disciplinary techniques" using qualitative research software.
Furthermore computer analysis assisted the extraction of "mini-narratives" from the
transcripts. These "mini-narratives" are used to lead a description of the subjectivity of
the boys and their positioning in the discourses of schooling and hegemonic masculinity.
A picture emerges of a young male subjectivity caught up in the dilemmas of concurrent
positioning in both schooling practices and hegemonic masculinity practices. It is
proposed that boys often see their available positionings as limited by schooling
discourse to "positive-female" or "negative-male". Hegemonic masculinity discourse
limits available positioning to "positive male" or "negative-female". Positioning by the
boys in these discourses is depicted as rapidly changing to the extent that inconsistencies
and confusions arise for boys. The "mini-narratives" use the transcribed voices of the
boys to tell of the challenges and practicalities of being a boy in a primary school.
Recommendations are made that include moving beyond dualistic ways of subject
positioning. The recommendations include ideas for teachers to involve themselves and
their students in developing new ways of speaking about gender difference.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">boys</field><field name="subject">poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.095746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond baby sitting : a study of after school care services in the ACT from the perspective of care providers</field><field name="creator">Glyde, Jo</field><field name="description">The increased demand for Out of School Hours Care (OSHC) has been linked to changes
that have occurred in the family structure and work habits. OSHC programs operating
on school sites under the management of a committee of parents and school
representatives provide parents with one option to meet the needs for care of primary age
children.
This study examined the issue of OSHC from the perspectives of workers involved in the
provision of services in government school sites in the ACT. Data were gathered by way
of semi-structured interviews with nineteen coordinators from sixteen After School Care
(ASC) centres. The data were analysed to find similarities in the experiences of workers
interviewed. Extracts from the interviews are presented in the findings to illustrate the
perceptions care givers have about their work and areas where changes can be made to
improve the quality of ASC services.
The study provides information on the factors affecting the provision of quality services
and suggests possible directions for future planning and research in this area. The
findings indicate that the care givers interviewed perceived their role as a positive
influence in the lives of children and families. Care givers sought to provide relaxed
environments for children after the school day. Many centres operated with the strong
support of parents, schools and management committees. The findings suggest that ASC
centres can and do operate successfully on school sites in the ACT and that care givers
were generally happy with the level of service provided. However, variability in the
facilities and support provided to centres was noted.
The study concludes that real improvement to the quality of programs and support of
workers is dependent on the introduction of nationally recognised standards in the
provision of ASC.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Out of School Hours Care</field><field name="subject">OSHC</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">After School Care</field><field name="subject">ASC</field><field name="subject">care givers baby sitting</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.100543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary school libraries in the Australian Capital Territory 1975 : provision in relation to schools commission policy and planning</field><field name="creator">Goodman, Doreen M.</field><field name="description">The basic purpose of this study is to analyse in
general terms Schools Commission policy and planning
in regard to the development of library resources and
services for Australian primary schools in both the
government and non-government education systems. The
core of the study is a survey of the provision and
needs of primary school libraries in the Australian
Capital Territory, based on the Schools Commission
Guidelines for library services in primary schools.
The survey is not an end in itself, but is a means
of appraisal of the school libraries program of the
Australian government as viewed at the grass roots
level in one particular area.
The report falls into two sections. Section I
is an introductory section which gives firstly an
overview of the work of the Federal government in
the development of school libraries and services
between 1968 and 1975. The introductory section also
analyses the development of the Schools Commission
guideline standards for primary school libraries,
and explains the role of the standards in relation
to both the 'needs' criterion of the Commission's
educational program and the equitable distribution
of government funds. The standards are not absolutes
in terms of precise structural specifications to be
applied in all circumstances, but rather an affirmation
of possibility in relation to a given ambit.
It is in Section II that the data from the survey
of the primary school libraries in the Australian
Capital Territory is analysed, and some comparisons
are made with the Monash University study of provision
and needs in primary school libraries carried out in
1975. The objectives of the ACT survey are not, however,
oriented simply to a factual statement of provision
and needs, but also to highlighting the instrinsic and
recurring administrative problems associated with the
provision of library resources services in schools.
Issues raised by the survey relate to differentiated
staffing patterns, obsolescence of materials, centralised
versus decentralised collections, tolerable loss rate
for books, custodial attitudes of teacher-librarians,
teacher attitudes to the library, production and use
of audiovisual materials by teachers and students,
community use of school libraries, identification of
needs by individual schools, availability of central
support services for selection and processing of
materials, funding for resource provision.
In regard to conclusions the report does not
attempt to offer anything but tentative suggestions,
because of the range of variables in most cases, which
could not be eliminated or controlled in a survey of
this. type. However, some factors do emerge which could
be the basis for more detailed analysis, such as the
nature of obsolescence in regard to school library
materials, and the relationship between types of library
service and the 'open' or traditional1 structure of
the school program. There is one factor which the
survey does show quite clearly, namely the gap that
exists between policy decisions taken at the national
level and the implementation of that policy at the
local level.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schools Commission</field><field name="subject">primary school libraries</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">library services</field><field name="subject">teacher librarians</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.105516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Years 11 and 12 English curriculum in the A.C.T 1984</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Phillipa</field><field name="description">In 1976, following the recommendations of the Campbell Report, school-based course development and assessment
replaced the New South Wales Higher School Certificate
courses and public examinations. Under the auspices of
the A.C.T. Schools Authority, the A.C.T. Accrediting
Agency took control of administering the new system.
Nine years after the system was introduced, the benefits
of the new system were very clear in the area of English
curriculum at Years 11 and 12 level. To a considerable
degree, the hopes of the Campbell Report have been
fulfilled in terms of providing students with greater
freedom of choice and flexibility in the selection of
options in an English course composed of a number of term
or term equivalent units. Assessment instruments have
become much more wide-ranging. Teacher/student
relationships have become less authoritarian. Teaching
strategies and learning approaches have generally made
students more active participants in the learning process.
The field study drew heavily on English course documents
in the senior secondary colleges, presenting an overview
of the workings of the English curriculum. Because
courses are being continually reaccredited, it was
necessary to set the curriculum overview at a particular
time, in 1984. As the A.C.T. is a small education system
in Australian terms, it was possible to gain some concept
of the whole picture, although 428 term units is not an
inconsiderable number.
The field study, because of its significant data base,
poses more questions than it answers. It does, to a
degree, present "what is", or rather "what was" in the
1984 English curriculum at Years 11 and 12 level in A.C.T.
colleges.

verbal memory suitable for use with children aged 5-10 years.
Subjects were 204 Canberra school children. They were
divided into six age groups, 5-10 years inclusive. Each age group of 34
children contained equal numbers of males and females.
The main memory test involved free recall of a word-list over
several learning trials and two delayed recall trials. This format allowed
the assessment of a range of memory functions including immediate
memory, learning and delayed recall following an interference trial. These
aspects of memory are of known diagnostic significance and are necessary
for satisfying the basic requirements of a comprehensive assessment of
memory functioning. In addition, given that this is a study of verbal
memory, precautions were taken to maximize the likelihood that words
included in the word-list would be encoded solely within the verbal
modality.
Results showed that tests of immediate memory and learning
differentiated between age groups. There were no developmental
differences in retention as measured by recall decrement following
interference. Also, there was no convincing evidence of sex differences for
any of these three measures, with the possible exception of the ten year
old group.
For practical and clinical purposes, the distribution of scores
for each age group on each of these measures is described. In addition,
expected scores of individual children of a given age measured in monthly
increments and confidence intervals for these scores were presented for
measures of immediate memory and learning.
Measures of intelligence for this sample of children were
also recorded.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">verbal memory tests</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.115035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The expanding role of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade : 1952 - 1993</field><field name="creator">Gould, Gillian</field><field name="description">This research essay examines the emergence and development of the
Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and
its attempts to influence foreign policy. Established as the Joint
Committee on Foreign Affairs in 1952, it was the first committee to
have a specific portfolio alignment. The purpose of the committee was
to ensure that a considerable number of parliamentarians could become
informed about foreign affairs issues.
The establishment of a committee for such a purpose was surprising in
that proponents of parliamentary reform at that tune were strongly
advocating that a comprehensive system of committees be created for
the purposes of financial scrutiny of government expenditure and
consideration of legislation. Against this background it is interesting
that the new committee was not given - and indeed showed no intention
of assuming - the role of scrutinising the activities of the Department
of External (and later, Foreign) Affairs.
It is also interesting that Prime Minister Robert Menzies instigated the
committee despite the fact that the government - and particularly the
Minister for External Affairs R G Casey - feared the committee might
go beyond its terms of reference and attempt to exert influence on
government policy. Consequently the government imposed severe
restrictions on the committee's activities which resulted in the
Opposition steadfastly refusing to participate in the work of the
committee for 15 years. Once some of these restrictions were removed,
the committee began to operate as a bipartisan committee in 1967 and
promptly set about attempting to influence government policy in foreign
affairs. Casey's worst fears were realised.
Over the years the brief of the committee expanded into the areas of
defence and trade. Eleven of the committee's reports address significant
defence issues and since 1987 the committee has conducted extensive
inquiries into trade matters. For the purposes of this research essay
however I have focused on the development of the committee's interest
and influence in the area of foreign affairs.
Chapter One of this essay describes the background of parliamentary
reform which resulted in the establishment of a comprehensive system
of committees within the Australian Parliament. Against this
background the emergence of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs
is outlined in Chapter Two. Chapter Three identifies the major trends
in the work of the committee while Chapter Four examines the
influence and some of the mechanisms through which the committee
has exerted pressure on foreign affairs policy. The conclusions of my
research are addressed in Chapter Five.
This research essay is based on an analysis of official committee
documents which address foreign affairs issues from 1967 to the
present. The major sources for the essay therefore are the reports of the
committee, government responses to those reports and parliamentary
debates. Other works consulted include academic journals and
monographs. I have also gained numerous insights into the powers and
limitations of committees through informal discussions with members
of various committees and colleagues. To these people I am indebted for

subjects aged between 5 years 7 months and 6 years 3
months, using A.R. Luria's model of brain function as
the theoretical basis of the study. A factor analysis
of the results of six psychometric tests administered
to all subjects indicated the presence of two distinct
factors. These were hypothesised to represent the
separate contributions of simultaneous and successive
synthesis. Further separate factor analyses, of the
six psychometric tests and tests of M-Space (derived
from the work of R. Case) and tests of standard school
assessment tasks (that were also administered to the
subjects), were performed. The results indicated that
although both modes of synthesis are available to
children of this age, simultaneous synthesis is not
a potent factor in school learning.
A further exploratory study was carried out using the
same 91 subjects. Subjects were given a series of
verbal subtraction problems requiring understanding of
mathematical relationships, and randomly assigned to
two presentation groups. One group received pictorial
information in addition to the verbal presentation.
The other group received concrete materials. A multiple
regression analysis was performed on the whole group
using factor scores for simultaneous and successive
syntheses (derived from the factor analysis of the six
psychometric tests) as independent variables and criterion
test scores for the verbal subtraction problems as the
dependent variable. The analysis indicated that although
neither aptitude for successive synthesis nor aptitude
for simultaneous synthesis had predictive value for this
kind of probelm solving, simultaneous synthesis was
possibly the predominant mode of information processing.
Further multiple regression analyses performed on each
of the presentation groups indicated an interaction
between successive synthesis and the modes of presentation
of information. Due to the small numbers of
subjects in each presentation group this result was
inconclusive.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain function</field><field name="subject">Luria</field><field name="subject">psychometric tests</field><field name="subject">simultaneous and successive synthesis</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">M-Space</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.125740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of primary school children's clay modelling techniques</field><field name="creator">Grace, Tim</field><field name="description">Children in their final years of primary schooling tend to emphasize the
use of detail and the production of naturalistic representations, when
modelling the human figure with clay. Children of this age rarely
construct clay figures which are noted for their dynamic quality in terms
of finish, proportion, or pose.
This study examined the effect of using a "formative" modelling
technique on the clay models made by 11 year old children. Involved
in the study were two groups of 11 year old children. Both groups of
children undertook a pre-test, a post-test, and a series of clay
modelling activities similar to other activities described in most primary
school art curricula. The experimental group of children were
instructed in the use of a "formative" modelling technique in which
children develop their clay figures from a single mass of clay and
refrain from constructing the figures by a combination of separate
parts. The control group received no instruction.
Brown's Modified "Secondary" Characteristics Rating Scale was used
to identify differences between pre- and post-test clay figures.
Results suggest that the "formative" modelling technique did not induce
a different approach to the modelling of finish, proportion, and pose in
the clay figures made by boys and girls 11 years of age. However,
there was evidence of a gender difference.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary school children</field><field name="subject">clay modelling</field><field name="subject">Brown's Modified Secondary Characteristics Rating Scale</field><field name="subject">formative modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.130505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The isolation, growth and survival of thermophilic bacteria from high temperature petroleum reservoirs</field><field name="creator">Grassia, Gino Sebastian</field><field name="description">The microbial ecology of 45 high temperature (&gt; 50 &#176; C) petroleum reservoirs was
investigated by isolating and characterizing bacteria that were present in their produced
fluids. Initial work was aimed at selecting a suitable high temperature petroleum
reservoir for the study of natural microbial populations. Experimental work then
focussed on establishing the physico-chemical conditions that prevail in the selected
reservoir and on developing media and enrichment conditions for the isolation of
microorganisms indigenous to the reservoir. The ability of reservoir bacteria to grow
and survive under the physical and chemical conditions found in the selected reservoir
was used to assess the likelihood of an indigenous origin for these bacteria.
The petroleum reservoir selected for study was the Alton petroleum reservoir (SW
Queensland, Australia). It was established that most of the physico-chemical conditions
in the Alton reservoir had remained unchanged since oil recovery began. The stability
of redox conditions (90 mV) in the reservoir over its operating life was identified as an
important factor in the coexistence of strict aerobic and strict anaerobic bacterial
populations within the reservoir. An important change that has occurred in the Alton
reservoir over its operating life because of oil recovery was an increase in water pH
from 6.41 to 8.42 as a result of carbon dioxide loss (1.36 atm to 0.0134 atm) from the
reservoir.
Development of novel enrichment procedures that simulated Alton reservoir conditions
led to the isolation of previously unreported aerobic and anaerobic populations of
thermophilic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria isolated were identified as either endosporeforming
heterotrophic bacteria from the genus Bacillus or nonspore-forming
heterotrophic bacteria resembling members of the genus Thermoleophilum. All aerobes
grew on carbon sources such as acetate and n-heptadecane that are normal constituents
of the reservoir. The anaerobic bacteria isolated were characterized as sheathed
fermentative bacteria from the order Thermotogales or non-sheathed fermentative
bacteria. In parallel studies, the natural microbial populations in other reservoirs were
investigated and I concluded that fermentative microorganisms were common
inhabitants of high temperature petroleum reservoirs. The isolation of fermentative
bacteria from these high temperature petroleum reservoirs established that fermentative
bacteria are a fourth major microbial group, together with hydrocarbon-oxidizers,
sulphate-reducers and methanogens, to be reported in petroleum reservoirs. The
fermentative bacteria use organic nutrients and carbohydrates, but not contemporary
crude oil as the principal nutrient source within reservoir waters.
The thermophilic bacteria isolated from Alton petroleum reservoir demonstrated growth
characteristics such as temperature (optima 50-70 &#176; C and range 37-85 &#176; C), pH (optima
6.0-9.0 and range 5.0-9.0 and salinity (optima 0-15 g per litre and range 0-30 g per
litre), that were consistent with conditions encountered in the Alton reservoir
(temperature 75 &#65533; C, pH 8.5 and TDS 2.7 g per litre). The isolated bacteria also
demonstrated a number of characteristics that might enable them to survive adverse
conditions that could be encountered in a petroleum reservoir environment. The
characteristics that contribute to aerobic bacteria surviving in and overcoming periods
of oxygen limitation include well-documented processes such as sporulation, by
Bacillus spp., and microaerophily. The characteristics that contribute to fermentative
bacteria surviving were: (1) a natural tolerance to reservoir physico-chemical
fluctuations, (2) an ability to remain viable when metabolic activity was suppressed to
very low rates by the growth-limiting conditions imposed, and (3) possible formation of
viable ultramicrobacteria (UMB). Formation of UMB (bacteria smaller than 0.3 |im) by
thermophilic bacteria has not been reported previously.
The recovery of thermophilic UMB by filtration from the Alton reservoir water
indicates that these bacteria occur in natural habitats. This study found the formation of
thermophilic UMB and their survival characteristics differed considerably from that
reported for the mesophilic, marine bacterium Vibrio sp. DWI. Unlike mesophilic
marine bacteria, thermophilic bacteria did not always respond to nutrient deprivation by
forming UMB and that these UMB did not show any increased ability to survive in the
face of adverse conditions. Although the formation of UMB as part of routine cell
growth and division was not demonstrated directly in this study, circumstantial
evidence suggests that they form part of a natural life cycle. The exact conditions that
result in UMB formation and their role in survival remain unresolved.
The capacity of nonspore-forming indigenous populations from Alton to survive sudden
shifts in environmental conditions that might result from common oilfield operations
was poor. Such operations were demonstrated to be inhibitory or lethal to Alton
reservoir bacteria. It also was concluded that such oilfield operations suppress
indigenous microbiota. However, the impacts of most oilfield operations within a
reservoir are likely to be confined to the immediate area surrounding injection and
producing wells. Minimizing the localized effects of oilfield practices on indigenous
reservoir populations will lead to the better management of undesirable microbial
activity in reservoirs such as H2S formation (souring) and facilitate development of
better microbially mediated oil recovery process. This study showed that selected
reservoir isolates possess characteristics which are suitable for in situ biotechnological
applications such as microbially enhanced oil recovery (MEOR). Characteristics
favourable for enhanced oil recovery include a capability for UMB formation, which
would enable better dispersion, and resistance to high concentrations of reservoir
components such as calcium, magnesium, strontium, heavy metals and hydrocarbons.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermophilic bacteria</field><field name="subject">petroleum reservoirs</field><field name="subject">microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">Alton petroleum reservoir</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.131412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sino-Soviet conflict and the economic and political ramifications for Indochina since 1975</field><field name="creator">Gray, Alan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the relationship
between the Sino-Soviet conflict and contemporary events in
Indochina. I have yet to find a satisfactory analysis of
this relationship. Of course there have been innumerable
specialized books on related subjects, (such as the Sino-Soviet
conflict, or Soviet and Chinese aid and trade policies with
Indochina) but as far as I can gather, no study has focused on
the Sino-Soviet conflict and its relationship with the Indochina
countries of Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea (Cambodia).
By the very nature of the topic, I am forced to place
limitations on the scope of this paper. Firstly, by necessity,
it will concentrate on events which have occurred in Indochina,
since the United States withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975. This
I hope will prevent the paper from becoming a long winded narrative,
Secondly, I have tried to place this study into a broader analytical
framework, consequently I have placed little emphasis on
describing events.
A final caveat is necessary. The outside observer is often
tempted to impose a great deal of rationality - or his own notion
of what is rational - on a foreign policy process, which, in
reality, may be marked by ambiguity, contradictions and
idiosyncracies. I have tried to guard against this by allowing
different notions of rationality and by a blending of different
rationality concepts that characterize the countries dealt with, (former President Thieu of South Vietnam for example, consulted
his horoscope so as to make better policy decisions; his
astrologer was a high ranking intelligence officer, a former
head of the South Vietnamese Central Intelligence Agency.) 1.

A variety of previously published analysis schemes

- range and scope of the scheme;
- the relevance of the scheme to practising teachers;
- feasibility;

The Sussex scheme (Eraut et al, 1975) was the analysis of junior science curriculum materials.
This scheme was used in an analysis of I.S.C.S.,
"Probing the Natural World" materials.
A simplified framework for the analysis of

of using I.S.C.S. materials, a quasi-experiment was

C. G. Weston (1886-1935), horticulturalist and arboriculturalist : a critical review of his contribution to the establishment of the landscape foundations of Australia's National Capital</field><field name="creator">Gray, John Edmund</field><field name="description">My thesis research concerns Thomas Charles George Weston (1866-1935). Its principal
focus is his landscape vision for Australia's national capital in its founding days and his
innovative horticultural and arboricultural work in that vision's execution. Between 1913
and 1926 his work involved reversing, by afforestation planting and conservation measures,
the existing process of degradation of the site's landscape. He also achieved for the
new city a densely planted landscape using indigenous and exotic trees and shrubs.
Weston's pioneering work made a significant contribution to Canberra's contemporary
'city in the landscape' image.
Part of my research is about understanding the context of Weston's earlier professional
experiences in Britain and New South Wales in the period 1878 to 1912. A brief
insight into his personal life and career shows how the people he worked for, the skills he
acquired, and the type of landscapes he worked in shaped his approach to his landscape
activity at Canberra. Of particular note are the valuable influences of David Thomson
and Joseph Maiden, respected figures in botany and horticulture in Britain and Australia
respectively.
My research on Weston's achievements in Canberra demonstrates his technical and
professional thoroughness. I have documented all his work on a project-by-project basis
to provide accurate reference material for on-going professional practice and research.
His afforestation and conservation work from 1913 onwards and his urban planting in
the crucial 1921 to 1926 period reflects the depth of his training and skills and understanding
of landscape. Analyses of disputes between Weston and others including Walter
Burley Griffin demonstrate the soundness of his professional judgment.
I have concluded that Charles Weston had a clear vision of what he wanted to achieve,
the necessary skills and experience to achieve that vision and a thorough understanding
of the national capital site. He also possessed the necessary personal qualities to achieve
his vision which responded sensitively to the aspirations of Australians for their national
capital. Largely because of Weston Canberra will remain a highly significant step in the
development of Australian landscape architecture.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thomas Charles George Weston</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">landscape design</field><field name="subject">horticulture</field><field name="subject">arboriculture</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.154510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The phytoplankton community in Chaffey Dam, focusing on the influence of light on the growth and photophysiology of the cyanobacterium anabaena circinalis</field><field name="creator">Green, Damian William</field><field name="description">This research investigated the factors influencing the structure of the phytoplanktori
community in Chaffey Dam, which is located in sub-tropical Australia. In particular, the
research aimed to determine the influence of light at time scales ranging from seconds to
seasons, on the growth and photophysiology of the cyanobacterium Anabaena circinalis.
On a large scale, field monitoring programs between 1987 and 1997 indicated that the
phytoplankton community of Chaffey Dam was dominated by colonial or relatively large
phytoplankton that move either with the aid of flagella or can be positively buoyant. Diatoms
contributed only a minor component, which may be the result of the reservoir being stratified
for much of the year. Several of the dominant taxa bloomed in each of the seasons during the
eleven year period, with some blooms lasting &gt;9 months, indicating that environmental
variability between seasons can be low. In contrast to other studies, A. circinalis was more
likely to grow and bloom during the cooler months (March-October). A two-year intensive
monitoring program (1995-1997) identified a seasonal progression that was similar in both
years. Chlorophytes occurred in spring, Ceratium in mid summer, a relatively clear period in
February, A. circinalis in March and cryptomonads in winter.
On a smaller scale, short-term (2-3 day) in-situ and laboratory enclosure experiments found
that the light and nutrient requirements of the dominant taxa varied. In comparison to most
other phytoplankton, A. circinalis cells disappeared at very rapid rates when supplied
irradiances &lt;10 (umol photons m-2 s-1. Over several days of darkness, the filaments broke
apart and the cell numbers declined. The experiments also showed that at certain times, field
populations of A. circinalis were subject to high losses at all irradiances.
Laboratory studies investigating the influence of inter- and intra-daily changes in light
availability showed that the growth rate of A. circinalis was not affected by the frequency of
daytime light:dark cycles, indicating that the rate of water mixing will not have major
influence on its growth if the total daily light dose is maintained. It was also found that
A. circinalis cultures did not accumulate large reserves of energy in the form of carbohydrate,
other than that required for one night. This strategy may enable the colonies to have a high
level of buoyancy each morning so that they float quickly to the surface waters and obtain
sufficient light each day to minimise losses. However, this strategy limits the ability of
A. circinalis to grow and maintain vital cell processes during extended periods of low
irradiances and may be a factor causing them to be susceptible to cell breakdown.
Weekly measurements of algal growth rates in Chaffey Dam identified two factors that may
have acted singly or simultaneously to influence the development of A. circinalis blooms
during 1996 and 1997. The blooms developed during a 4-6 week period when the mean
irradiance in the surface mixed layer (SML) was sufficient to prevent high losses. Secondly,
the blooms developed when soluble phosphorus in the epilimnion was relatively high but
soluble nitrogen was low. This may have favoured A. circinalis, which has the potential to fix
atmospheric nitrogen. The decline of A. circinalis blooms was correlated with a deepening of
the SML and a reduction of the mean daytime irradiance within the SML. Their decline did
not appear to be related to nutrient limitation or to changes in zooplankton concentrations.
This research also developed a physiological technique for tracking daily changes in the mean
daytime irradiance of A. circinalis and for estimating cell growth rate. This method is based
on chlorophyll-a fluorescence quenching analysis of the state transition mechanism, which
regulates light availability between the photosystems. The mean daytime irradiance of
A. circinalis showed a strong relationship with the degree of non-photochemical quenching
(qn), whereas the relative change to the maximum fluorescence showed a strong relationship
with cell growth. It is anticipated that this method will provide a useful research tool for
determining the relative importance of light and other factors on the net growth of
A. circinalis and other cyanobacteria.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chaffey Dam</field><field name="subject">cyanobacterium Anabaena circinalis</field><field name="subject">phytoplankton</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060712.155533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental evaluation of fox control and the impact of foxes on lambs</field><field name="creator">Greentree, Carolyn</field><field name="description">Baiting with sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) to protect lambs (Ovis aries)
from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes L.) has become more frequent in NSW and other parts
of Australia during the last 10 years despite the lack of reported evidence evaluating
the effects of fox baiting on lamb survival. NSW Agriculture has developed fox
control recommendations aimed at minimising impact, but these guidelines have not
been tested experimentally. Defining the extent of a pest problem and the
effectiveness of pest control are key components of a strategic approach to vertebrate
pest management as it is the damage of pests that justifies their control.
This thesis describes an experimental evaluation of the recommended practice
of fox control in NSW. The effects of three levels of fox control were tested in the
experiment; no treatment, baiting once a year before lambing (the recommended
practice) and baiting three times a year (thought to be the maximum farmers would
instigate). Each treatment had two replicates. No previous manipulative experiment
using synchronous controls and matched replicates has been undertaken to test the
effects. The study quantifies the level of fox predation on healthy lambs and the level
of predation on lambs that had other causes including illness and mismothering
contributing to this fox predation. It also examines the response of the fox
population, lamb predation and lambing outcomes to different levels of fox control.
The cost effectiveness of fox control is examined in relation to lamb predation and an
investigation of the optimum level of fox control is begun. The experiment also
provides the first chance to consider the examination of multiple response variables
and the scale of field ecology experiments required to recognise a significant response
and avoid a Type II error due to between replicate variability even with tightly
controlled site selection criteria to standardise experimental sites, and with the
synchrony of experimental control and treatment surveys.
The study occurred on five sheep properties near Boorowa (34&#176;28'S,
148&#176;32'E) and Murringo (34&#176;18'S, 148&#176;3 1'E) in south-eastern Australia. The terrain
was undulating to hilly with a maximum elevation of 660 m above sea level. The main
agricultural enterprises in the district are Merino wool, fat lamb and beef cattle
production and winter cereal cropping. The native vegetation of Eucalyptus
woodland has been mostly cleared, though remnant patches occur. Most of the area
is now sown with pasture of Phalaris tuberosa, Lolium spp. and clover Trifolium
spp.. The experimental properties grazed self-replacing Merino flocks, primarily for
wool production, so lamb survival was vital to the economic operation of the farm.
Over 50 selection criteria including lamb survival rates, ewe fertility and bloodline,
sheep management practices, climate and habitat features that affect lamb survival,
past fox control practices and prey species were used to select sites Sites were
representative of most sheep farming properties in the region, but were also extremely
similar in factors that affected fox abundance and ewe and lamb survival, thus
minimising variation between replicate sites.
The manufactured meat baits used to poison foxes contained 3 mg of sodium monofluoroacetate (compound 1080). A replacement baiting program was carried
out in 1995 and 1996. Fox control programs were carried out over the experimental
units and adjacent buffer zones covering approximately two fox territories,
approximately 6km2, around the lambing paddock under study. The recommended fox
control practices described by NSW Agriculture also included neighbouring farmers
taking part in an extended group baiting program. In all the area baited at varying
intensities totalled 3400 km2. Synchronised lambing with neighbours was a further
recommended practice to reduce fox predation and was carried out on these sites.
Lambing occurred during a six to eight week period in late winter on all sites, a
practice known as 'spring lambing', and on many surrounding properties so a surplus
of lambs was available to foxes over a relatively short time.
The benefits of fox control were measured directly as enhanced lamb survival
derived from differences in lamb marking rates between ultrasounded flocks of
approximately 1000 ewes and the predation of lambs was measured from over 2000
lamb carcases post-mortemed in 1994, 1995 and 1996. A mean of 138 lambs were
expected at ultrasounding from 100 ewes and 113 lambs per 100 ewes were alive at
lamb marking.
There was no significant (P&gt;0.05) effect of fox control on lambing
performance (the number of lambs per 100 ewes that lambed) Fox predation was
inferred as the cause of lamb death in a minimum of 0.8% and a maximum of 5.3% of
lamb carcases during 1995 and 1996. There was a significant (P&lt;0 05) effect of fox
control on the minimum possible percentage of lamb carcases classified as healthy
lambs killed by foxes, with the percentage declining from 1.50% (no fox control), to
0.90% (fox control once per year) to 0.25% (fox control three times per year). There
was also a significant (P&lt;0.005) effect of fox control on the maximum possible
percentage of lamb carcases classified as healthy lambs killed by foxes with the
percentage declining from 10.25% (no fox control), to 6.50% (fox control once per
year) to 3.75% (fox control three times per year). The observed results were used to
estimate the number of treatment replicates needed to be confident of detecting an
effect of predator control on lamb marking performance. The estimated numbers
were very high if small effects were to be detected. No significant correlation
between the fox density and the minimum and maximum possible number of lambs
carcases classified as killed by foxes was found. Bait uptake was monitored as were
the costs of fox control.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fox baiting</field><field name="subject">fox control</field><field name="subject">lambs</field><field name="subject">pest management</field><field name="subject">south-eastern Australia</field><field name="subject">farms</field><field name="subject">sodium monofluoroacetate</field><field name="subject">compound 1080</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060713.101158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A well-composed body: anthropomorphism in architecture</field><field name="creator">Drake, Scott</field><field name="description">Since the writings of Vitruvius in the first century AD, the use of the human body as a
metaphorical and symbolic referent has provided what is perhaps the most prolific trope for
architectural theory. The image of &#65533;Vitruvian Man,&#65533; with limbs outstretched to touch the
circle drawn from its navel, took on particular significance during the Renaissance, as
architects such as Alberti, Filarete, di Giorgio, Colonna, and Serlio published their own
interpretations of Vitruvius&#65533; Ten Books. For these writers, the body, as microcosm, was
the best available means for representing the order of the cosmos, the world as a whole.
Yet just as the idea of the body as architectural referent was being reinterpreted, the body
itself was being transformed by Renaissance anatomy. The unity and integrity of the body
was jeopardised as anatomists studied the body through the dissection of corpses. The
published results of these studies, the most notable being Vesalius&#65533; De Humani Corporis
Fabrica, were highly influential, with the anatomical methods of observation and partition
emerging as the fundamental tenets of modern science. Several centuries later, the
transformation of the body from a symbol of the world to an object amenable to scientific
observation and control was all but fully realised, as the discoveries of Pasteur were put to
use in the conquest of disease. These changing medical conceptions of the body led to
concomitant transformations of the sense of self, as the body as object was increasingly
divorced from the operations of the mind, in both its conscious and unconscious forms.
This thesis will examine how these changing conceptions of the human body have been
interpreted within architectural theory since Vitruvius. Beginning with the idea of ornament
as trope of sacrifice, it will examine how interpretations of the relation between the body as
whole and as part have affected ideas of architectural composition. Further, it will examine
the ethical implications of the trope of building as body, such that a building which reflects
the proportions of a &#65533;well-composed&#65533; body (Francesco di Giorgio), is itself an injunction to
&#65533;composure,&#65533; or appropriate behaviour. It will argue that modern architecture, while
rejecting classical anthropomorphism, was nonetheless influenced by ideas and practices
arising from anatomy. Then, in contrast to the object-body of anatomy, the thesis will
examine phenomenological and hermeneutical conceptions of the body, which interpret the
body as lived. From Merleau-Ponty&#65533;s study of perception to Scarry&#65533;s reading of the
significance of pain, the contribution of the body to the sense of self will be explored, giving
rise to a renewed conception of anthropomorphism as the manifestation not only of human
form, but of human sentience. Further, to the modern fragmentation of both the body and
architecture will be opposed integrative strategies of selfhood, such as the formation of
narrative identity (Ricoeur), the engagement with a community through practice (MacIntyre),
and the idea of the &#65533;monstrous&#65533; body (Frascari). These strategies will be used to explore
ways in which the form of the body can be understood other than in purely material terms,
and how this is translated into architecture.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anthropomorphism</field><field name="subject">human figure</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">human body</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060713.101839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FAULTSIM : an educational simulator</field><field name="creator">Greethead, J.

the number of Aboriginal homeland communities being
established throughout the Northern Territory.
While educational services commenced to many homeland
communities as early as 1972/3, such services did not
commence in the Elcho Island area until 1983/4. Since this
time educational services have been provided to eleven
homeland communities in the Elcho Island area. Of the eleven
educational programs established, five continued to operate at
the end of 1989.
It is established that homeland schools in the Elcho Island area
differ significantly in characteristics of student enrolment,
frequency of student attendance and in the homeland school's
ability to continue to function as a viable community initiative.
On the basis of the data presented in the study, the following
four levels of classification of homeland schools is established;
highly functional homeland schools,
moderately functional homeland schools,
minimally functional homeland schools, and
homeland schools that have ceased operating.
It is revealed that enrolment and attendance data, traditionally
utilised by government authorities to prioritise the allocation
of limited resources between competing homeland
communities, is in fact a poor indicator for assessing a
homeland community school's long term viability.
This study identifies the following three sociological
characteristics as being strongly correlated to the long term
viability of homeland schools in the Elcho Island area;
land affiliation,
parental residency, and
family mobility.
From the analysis of the data, three recommendations are
proposed;
1. In assessing the long term viability (functional status) of a
homeland community school, educational administrators should
analyse the three sociological indicators;
land affiliation
family mobility, and
parental residency
as an alternative to the more traditional method of relying
primarily upon enrolment and attendance data.
2. In the allocation of scarce resources, especially resources
of a fixed capital nature, to homeland community schools,
priority be given to those homeland community schools that fit
the profile of a moderate to highly functional homeland school.
3. Minimally functional homeland schools need access to
resources in order to provide the educational programs
requested by the local community. Resources provided for this
category of homeland school need to be easily re-located
should the educational program be suspended at the homeland
community.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal communities</field><field name="subject">Elcho Island</field><field name="subject">educational services</field><field name="subject">homeland schools</field><field name="subject">outstations</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060713.105348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An explorartory study on the use of automatic data processing in school administration and its applicability for use in the administration of Charnwood Primary School</field><field name="creator">Griffin, John K.</field><field name="description">The study examines the use of automatic data processing
in educational organisations for the purpose of determining
the feasibility of using some ADP applications
in the administration of a large urban ACT primary
school.
Educational managers working in primary schools are
required to make decisions which draw upon information
concerning the student population, school curriculum,
school personnel and general school administration.
An analysis of the decision making areas of Charnwood
Primary School is undertaken and the information
required for making each decision is identified. The
concept of using a database to provide some of this
information is explored and suggested as being an
effective means of managing student data.
Some equipment options which would enable a primary
school to implement a database and provide word processing
facilities are examined within a context of limited
resources. The capacities and advantages of using
computer equipment which is presently accessible to
schools are outlined, along with the feasibility of
employing the services of a data processing agency.
The conclusion is reached that there are a number of
ADP applications applicable for use at Charnwood Primary
School, as well as a number of other computer based
facilities, such as word processing and plant management,

school or some aspect of its operation which is carried out by the
teachers and other interested members of the school community. When
the decision to evaluate and the control of the evaluation are at the
school level a complex, dynamic situation is created. The teachers in
the school concurrently have roles as evaluators and as those being
evaluated, as well as continuing in their other normal teachers' roles.
The history of educational evaluation in the United States of
America, the United Kingdom and Australia is traced. An outline is
given of the developments in the more traditional methods based on
measurement of achievement of objectives on the one hand, and on the
'informed judgement of experts' on the other. It is suggested that
improvements in both methods have led to a constructive method of
evaluation with its roots in both traditions. Some checklists and
guidelines for planning evaluations are also reviewed.
Interviews were carried out in an A.C.T. high school which had
completed an evaluation almost a year earlier. Twenty people were
interviewed: some teachers, some parents and a member of the
Evaluation and Research Section of the A.C.T. Schools Office. All
had been involved with or affected by the evaluation.
If an evaluation is initiated and controlled at the school level
many new complexities are introduced into the situation. The process
of the evaluation becomes of paramount importance. The way the
evaluation is initiated and planned, the way information is collected
and analysed, and the way decisions are arrived at are uppermost in
participants' minds. Probably the early stages are the most crucial in
establishing the climate and structure for the evaluation, and in
developing participants' skills. The effects on staff relationships,
staff/parent relationships and the general climate of the school are
what the participants are most aware of. There usually are outcomes
of a school based evaluation arising from recommendations, but these
often are more subtle than those of a traditional evaluation by
outsiders. Changes may also occur during the evaluation, rather than
at the end after the presentation of a report as was more traditionally
the case.
There is a place for school based evaluation in Australian schools,
but it should be recognised as a complex process which may involve
participants in new roles in an extremely dynamic situation.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school based evaluation</field><field name="subject">educational evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060713.115416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental impacts on spawning and survival of fish larvae and juveniles in an upland river system of the Murray-Darling Basin</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Kylie</field><field name="description">Six rivers within the upper Mumbidgee catchment were sampled for larval and juvenile
fish. The rivers represented both regulated and unregulated flow regimes and varied widely in
size. There was wide variation in the larval fish communities supported by each river, both in
terms of the species diversity and total abundance of fish sampled. The highly regulated reach
of the Mumbidgee River sampled during this study had the highest numbers of native
species and native individuals of any river sampled.
In the two rivers selected for further study, the Murmmbidgee and Goodradigbee, there was a
high level of inter-annual consistency in the species composition within the reaches sampled,
despite considerable change in the temperature and flow regimes of both rivers. This indicates
that at least some spawning of those species sampled may occur each year, regardless of
environmental conditions. Estimates of the relative abundance of each species sampled
changed markedly between years, and it is argued, on the basis of growth information
contained in the otoliths, that differential survival of larvae and juveniles was largely
responsible for this shift in relative abundance.
Otolith microstructure provided information on the date of spawning and early growth patterns
of all species sampled in the upper Mumumbidgee catchment. In addition to determining the
age and thus 'birth-date' of an individual, the effect of a particular event or series of events has
on growth, and subsequent survival, is permanently recorded in the otolith microstructure.
This enables accurate back-calculation and correlation to management actions or natural
events. No other research tool has this ability to retrospectively assess, on a daily basis, the
impacts of management actions on condition and subsequent survival of fish larvae.
Species sampled could be separated into three groups based on spawning requirements; those
linked with flow, those linked with temperature and generalist species that appear to have river
independent cues, such as photoperiod or moon phase.
Patterns in growth rate during the early life history stages enabled quantification of the
consequences of variation in environmental conditions on the survival and recruitment of
various species. Growth was not always highly correlated with water temperature, in fact, for
mountain galaxias, high temperatures appear to negatively affect larval condition and
subsequent survival. Conversely, carp exhibited a strategy more consistent with common
perceptions, with growth and survival increasing with increasing temperature.
The study uncovered spawning and growth patterns that were unexpected. Age analysis of
western carp gudgeon demonstrated that they had undertaken a mid-winter spawning, when
the water temperature in the main channel was far lower than that at which spawning was
previously recorded for this species. Redfin perch from the unregulated Goodradigbee River
exhibited growth rates exceeding the published upper limits for this and other closely related
species. This growth could not be correlated with either temperature or flow, indicating that
there are additional factors that dominate growth rates of redfin perch in the Goodradigbee
River.
The proportion and abundance of native species alone is not necessarily indicative of a
'healthy' or pristine system; some native species may be positively affected by river
regulation, at least as juveniles. Comparison of the current larval fish community with likely
pre-European fish communities does provide an indication of change to the system. The
results of this study suggest that larval fish growth rates can be strongly influenced by
environmental conditions, thus providing a powerful tool for monitoring future change and the
factors which cause it.
This study has demonstrated the value of larval and juvenile fish age and growth information,
derived from otolith microstructure techniques, for many aspects of river management.
Current river management priorities for which these techniques provide unique information
include the determination of environmental flow regimes and the control of undesirable exotic
species such as carp.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental impact</field><field name="subject">fish larvae</field><field name="subject">Murray-Darling Basin</field><field name="subject">Murrumbidgee River</field><field name="subject">Goodradigbee River</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">mountain galaxias</field><field name="subject">Galaxias olidus</field><field name="subject">carp</field><field name="subject">Cyprinus carpio</field><field name="subject">redfin perch</field><field name="subject">Perca fluviatilis</field><field name="subject">Australian smelt</field><field name="subject">Retropinna semoni</field><field name="subject">western carp gudgeon</field><field name="subject">Hypseleotris klunzingeri</field><field name="subject">gambusia</field><field name="subject">Gambusia holbrooki</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060713.121419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of coastal zone management</field><field name="creator">Guerinoni, Stephen C.</field><field name="description">The coastal zone is a valuable resource which provides a diversity
of benefits. The difficulties facing the coastal zone tend to fall
into three categories:
(1) Pressure and conflict on resources. The beach residence
value, an indicator of land use pressure, implies that, of the
Australian states, New South Wales' coastal zone is under
the greatest pressure. Associated with population is
development pressure. Many forms of development are not
compatible, hence conflicts of interest can arise.
(2) The dynamic nature of the coast. That is, the physical and
biological aspects of the coastal zone are in a state of flux.
The dynamics make predictions for management controversial.
(3) Organisational problems. The lack of direction, lack of coordination
and fragmentation of management leads to ad hoc
management of this valuable resource.
This evaluation identified and confirmed the relevance of coastal
issues which led to the enactment of the Coastal Protection Act,
1979. The coastal issues investigated were: coastal erosion
and development; coastal erosion and protection works; coastal
land degradation; degradation of coastal habitats, fish and wildlife
resources; recreation opportunities; pollution; and increasing
population pressure and competition betweeen alternative uses.
The administrative arrangements for management of the issues
were investigated. A broad range of coastal issues were evaluated
using a mix of indicators with standards of comparison to measure
progress. Management tools, policies and strategies used to
address the issues were investigated. Finally prescriptions to
further address the issues were made as was how to implement
the prescriptions.
The evaluation noted: increasing coastal population and
development pressure; numerous examples of conflicts of interest;
complex and often bewildering administrative arrangements for
coastal zone management; widely varying levels of performance
by agencies; and a lack of direction and co-ordination from State
authorities. The principal conclusion was that strategic planning
needed to be undertaken through a lead coastal agency. The
lead agency should clarify and improve direction, co-ordination
and co-operation in coastal management. This should improve
the effectiveness of management and reduce the incidence and
duration of conflict among the different and competing coastal
values. This evaluation of the effectiveness of coastal management,
at a State level, should not only assist New South Wales but
also other States in the management of this valuable resource.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coastal zones</field><field name="subject">Coastal Protection Act</field><field name="subject">coastal development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060713.130610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of locus of control on parents and their sons in a parent-tutor remedial reading program</field><field name="creator">Guggenheimer, Sally</field><field name="description">This study describes the development and evaluation
of a parent training model to test if a correlation
exists between effective tutoring and locus of control.
The model utilized parents of boys previously referred to
the Educational Clinic for reading difficulties. The
parents became the major treatment resource for
remediating reading problems of their 8 to 11 year old
boys. The venue was a local public library where a
series of five lessons and three follow-up sessions were
held with both parents and their sons present over a six
month period. Reading strategies to develop the
utilization of contextual clues were introduced and
practiced at these sessions.
Control group children from a variety of schools in
Canberra were selected to match the 21 treatment children
by the criteria of chronological age and pre-test results
on an objective word recognition test.
The parents were pre- and post-tested using the
Rotter I-E Scale while all boys were given the IAR Scale,
the Neale Analysis of Reading, ACER Word Recognition, a
Goodman-Eurke Miscue passage and the Survey of General
Reading Attitude.
Analysis of results indicated that sample size
limited the number of significant results obtained. No
significant results between I-E ratings and dependent
variables were found. The tutor's and spouse's initial
I-E perceptions were correlated at p=.08. Correlations
between tutor final I and subject final I ratings were
nonsignificant but positively correlated. The initial
and final I-E ratings of tutors were correlated at the
p&lt;.0l level. A negative correlation significant at p=.0l
or better was noted between tutor behaviours and reading
speed gains. This was also true of correlations between
speed and both accuracy and comprehension (at p&lt;.02 or
greater). A trend to greater gains on all reading
measures (at p=&gt;.2 or higher) favouring the treatment
group (when compared with the control group) suggests
that a tutor programme based on improving reading
comprehension may be of value to the clinic-referred
retarded reader.
A more comprehensive study bypassing the problems of
sample size and differing causes for reading retardation
is outlined using the n=l paradigm. Both locus of
control and motivational factors of tutors and learners
will be investigated.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parent training model. locus of control</field><field name="subject">remedial reading programs</field><field name="subject">primary school boys</field><field name="subject">reading difficulties</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060713.131705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study looking for factors that are related to the poor attendance of Aboriginal primary age children</field><field name="creator">Gunn, Sheena</field><field name="description">This is an exploratory study that tries to isolate those factors that specifically relate to the
poor attendance levels of Aboriginal primary age children. The study took place in the
North-West Region of the NSW Department of Education. It was conducted by a member
of the Home/School Liaison Team which had been set up to address the problem of
non-attendance in NSW schools.
After considering both overseas and Australian studies relating to non-attendance at
school individual, family and school-based factors were looked at. One school was
targeted as a case study and students from other schools in the North-West Region were
randomly chosen to participate to attempt to broaden the results.
The student and a care provider were interviewed individually and each student's teacher
completed a questionnaire and student profile sheet. Where possible, interviewing was
performed by an Aboriginal person to allow the interviewee to feel more comfortable.
To get further details of school-based factors, all Public Schools in the North-West Region
with Aboriginal enrolments were sent questionnaires to be filled in by a staff member
in a promotions position and classroom teachers within that school.
The major finding of the study was the significance of the previous attendance history of
the student, thus indicating the necessity for early intervention if prevention of poor
attendance patterns is to occur. The targeting of the beginning years of schooling and
the introduction of parent education programs about the importance of these early years
are recommended.
Other areas found in this study to be related significantly to poor attendance were a
competitive class climate, the socio-economic background of parents, parent employment
history, parent educational background, single parent families, overcrowding and peer
group influences.
The study confirmed what many researchers had found: that school absenteeism is a
problem with many contributory factors and each student needs to be looked at
individually. Each case needs to be dealt with on its own merits.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school attendance</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal primary age children</field><field name="subject">absenteeism</field><field name="subject">North-West New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060713.132349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christian schools and parental values : a case study in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Gwilliam, John W.</field><field name="description">In the western world the Protestant Christian

phenomenal growth over the past twenty years and
it continues to grow.
Mostly, the parents of children who attend these

thesis seeks to find the reasons why parents are
choosing Christian Schools and not government ones
as they themselves attended.
A variety of values are examined ; religious,
academic and pastoral, and as the reader will discover,
while it is not easy always to make a clear distinction
between these values, some trends are so strong that
the researcher believes that some valid conclusions
may be drawn.
A considerable amount of data was collected
by the use of two surveys done at the Trinity Christian School at Wanniassa,and one survey conducted among
parents of the O'Connor Christian School at Lyneham.
The Biblical Values Survey provides an interesting
over-view of the perceived achievement of a Christian
School while the Choosing a School Survey clearly
shows why these parents are dissatisfied with government
schools and what they expect their child will gain
from a Christian School experience.
A computer analysis was done on one block
of data which highlights the need for Christian
School administrators to be aware of the various
priority areas which do exist in the minds of the

free conversations, interview-questionnaires and regular
interviews during the English program. The data show that the
process of building up the mental lexicon is slow, long and
complicated. For adult learners coming from different English and
job backgrounds, full time classroom learning is the biggest and
most important source of L2 word input. It is also in this
environment that the word storage and recall mechanisms are
most facilitated. The L2VA process varies according to individual
learners at different levels, with different learning goals,
motivations, determination, areas of interest and word learning
methods.

with special attention to the main problems encountered by teachers of
English at the main language institutions in the light of the literature and

The first chapter is the introduction of the study. It covers the aim and scope
to be achieved in the study, and explains the sources of data to be used for
the study. Terminology of some phrases and abbreviations for convenient use
are also given.
Chapter 2 focuses on general ELT developments. Major trends in ELT and
their practices are brought into discussion. Then in the light of the literature
in ELT, the teaching of writing is taken into consideration. Being an
important component in ELT, the teaching of writing has to satisfy this need
of learners - the need for effective communication - without overlooking
correctness, accuracy and other features of good writing. However, there is
no single approach that can provide a perfect answer to all the learners'
problems.
Chapter 3 discusses the teaching and learning situation in Vietnam in three
stages from 1959 to 1986. It is made clear that the situation is not satisfactory
due to the methods, techniques, materials and the quality of teachers. Then
special investigation is made into the writing area. It is discovered that
complex writing is avoided because of the teachers' low standard and their
methods and techniques in teaching written English. Improvement courses
have been held, but they did not include writing programmes for teachers.
Chapter 4 analyses the main problems affecting the teaching of writing in
Vietnam, such as teachers' unawareness of language appropriateness and
correctness, their difficulty at discourse level and lack of cultural knowledge.
Teachers' misconceptions about errors and lack of methods and techniques in
dealing with errors also result in ineffective teaching.
In Chapter 5 some recommendations are made for teaching writing to
inservice teachers in the upgrading course. They focus on the methods and
techniques to be used in such a writing course. Some techniques for
composition correction are also suggested. Unfortunately, there is no single
book that is ideal for such a course. A selection of current writing
coursebooks is given in the hope that teachers will find material to suit the
needs of their students in them. The last recommendations are for teaching
academic writing which involves more sophisticated skills than writing on
general topics.
Finally the writer makes some comments on her own work and suggests
further research into the writing area.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">ELT</field><field name="subject">written English</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060713.164330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time and modality in Vietnamese : a contrastive study of Vietnamese and English</field><field name="creator">Ha, Nguyen Hong</field><field name="description">The present study is an attempt to give a description of

It is hoped that Vietnamese students might find in this
work some kind of help that may facilitate their study
of English grammar as regards time and mood.
In chapter 1, the author presents a brief history of
foreign language teaching in Vietnam, and the role of
English as a foreign language in the country at present.
He also discusses problems confronting Vietnamese teachers
and students in teaching and learning English and states
the aims of the study. Next, the structure of the Vietnamese
verb-phrase is discussed, with a view to giving
the reader some idea of how auxiliaries operate in
Vietnamese.
In chapter 2, a description of temporal expression in
Vietnamese is presented, with emphasis on the uses of the
so-called "time auxiliaries". Also, time adverbs, time
clauses and questions with time in Vietnamese are
discussed.
Chapter 3 deals with modal expression in Vietnamese. In
this chapter special attention is given to the uses of
the modal auxiliaries. Attempts are then made to describe
the so-called "attitudinal disjuncts" and conditional
sentences in Vietnamese.
In chapter 4, implications for teaching time and modality
in English to Vietnamese students are given. The author
suggests some teaching points, which, through the present
contrastive work, are likely to be some of the most

curriculum document entitled The Melbourne Religious Education Guidelines for Primary Students in the Archdiocese of Melbourne
has attracted strong criticism from various members of the Roman
Catholic community. This adverse criticism has prompted me to
undertake an evaluation of the 1984 edition of this document.
To enable me to analyze the document, both theologically
and educationally, I have constructed classifications of theologies
and education models. These classifications have been used to
identify the dominant theological basis of the suggested curriculum
and the religious education model used in its implementation.
My analysis established that the theological basis of
the document was Propositional, tempered by some of the characteristics
of Heilsgeschichte theology. The content of the program
contained both secular and religious material but, since they
were not integrated, they gave the impression of two separate
syllabi, used independently of each other.
The methodology commenced with the students' experience
but proceeded to the transmission of doctrinal religious knowledge.
The language used in the expression of aims and goals contained
characteristics of Heilsgeschichte theology and the Kerygmatic
model of religious education. It was, therefore, seen to be in
tension with the teaching methodology which emphasized transmission
of doctrine, thus causing internal tensions and inconsistencies.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Melbourne Religious Education Guidelines for Primary Students</field><field name="subject">archdiocese of Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Roman Catholc community</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="subject">religious education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060714.094921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recent administrative reform in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Hai, Peter Nguyen Van</field><field name="description">Since the introduction in 1986 of Doi Moi program, a Vietnamese form of
Perestroika, which was designed partly to reduce the role of state bureaucracy
in the system, major economic reforms have been carried out in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV). However, while Vietnam's economic reforms
have generated considerable interest, its limited political reforms, especially in
the area of public administration, have not been a central concern among
political scientists, historians and researchers. In their efforts to revitalise the
state bureaucracy, reformers in Vietnam now recognise the importance of well
qualified bureaucrats, and they inevitably have to face the old issue of how best
to attract, motivate, train and retain public servants for a better government.
This paper, based on the search through the maze of official documents in
Vietnamese language, describes the SRV's political institutions, provides an
overview of Vietnam's administrative system against the backdrop of the
country's economic and political reforms, highlighting institutional interactions
induced by reform imperatives, discusses recent administrative reforms
emanating from the amended 1992 Constitution, and evaluates the effectiveness
of current administrative reform strategies. Comments will also be made on
. The roles and functions of central agencies in Vietnam
. Policy making processes and paradigms
. The 'emerging' dichotomy between policy and administration
. The 'ministerial department' a la Vietnamienne
. Machinery of government changes
. Human resource management initiatives
. The 'career service' nature of the Vietnamese public service, and,
. Central versus provincial governments.
Vietnamese Public Service is an important question and worthy of investigation
because of the increasingly close bilateral relationship between Australia and
Vietnam. Many Australian investors who have often been annoyed by
unnecessary delays caused by bureaucratic red tape and corruption, are now
keen to learn more about the policy making style of Vietnamese bureaucrats.
Vietnam still displays many deliberate trappings of a country run in a highly
centralist fashion. Its reorganisation strategy of the state's administrative
system will continue to bear the socialist imprints. Dr David Marr of the
Australian National University contends that layer upon layer of bureaucratic
influence, from Chinese Neo-Confucian to French Third Republic to Soviet
Stalinist, can be seen in Vietnam today. This paper argues that Vietnam's
political and cultural legacies will continue to exercise significant influence, as
they have in the past, on its public service's structures, strategies and ethics.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Doi Moi</field><field name="subject">bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">Socialist Republic of Vietnam</field><field name="subject">SRV</field><field name="subject">public administration</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese Public Service</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060714.115805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the School Library Association in Canberra and District : the first decade 1971-1981</field><field name="creator">Haigh, Colleen</field><field name="description">This study traces many of the highlights which occurred during the first decade of the
history of the School Library Association in Canberra and District (SLACAD). The
roots of this association lie deep in the history of school libraries and teacherlibrarianship
in Australia. Many SLACAD members belonged to other state school
library associations and to the Australian School Library Association (ASLA)
confederation since the establishment of these associations in the 1960's. These
teacher-librarians have been dedicated in their attempts to further the cause of school
libraries and their teacher-librarianship profession. The decade covered by this study
embraces the greatest period of expansion in the development of school libraries seen in
Australian history. During this decade the A.C.T. established an independent education
system and it took many years for the A.C.T. Schools Authority administration to
finalise its organisation. SLACAD members were anxious that school libraries in the
A.C.T. should keep pace with school libraries in other Australian states and this study
documents the constant efforts of its members to obtain improvements in school
librarianship. Teacher-librarians in the A.C.T. have continued to maintain a close
liaison with ASLA and many A.C.T. teacher-librarians have held executive office in
ASLA. SLACAD has hosted seminars and conferences and this study documents
numerous submissions and reports which were a necessary feature of the expanding
A.C.T. school library association milieu.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School Library Association</field><field name="subject">SLACAD</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">school libraries</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">teacher-librarians</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060714.120926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The situational language intervention programme (SLIP) : the theoretical background and outline of the programme</field><field name="creator">Hall, Phillip</field><field name="description">The general aim of the thesis is to show how The Situational Language Intervention Programme (SLIP) was formulated in order to include the
critical factors of: the cognitive abilities and linguistic
characteristics of the intellectually handicapped; pragmatics, semantics
and syntax and the four models of language acquisition; the criteria
that guide language intervention programme development; the use of
precise and systematic teaching methods that stimulate the use of
language in the students' environment. The general objective of both
SLIP and this thesis is to show how to increase moderately to severely
intellectually handicapped adolescents' language-communication through
the appropriate use of the forms of language applied to its functions in
a specific range of situations.
Chapter Two of the thesis is concerned with the cognitive abilities of
intellectually handicapped people and the implications of intellectual
handicap on communication and language development. In addition it
discusses, stage by stage, the positive and negative markers of language
acquisition. These markers illustrate to the teacher the signs of
linguistic retardation at each stage of language learning.
The contents of Chapter Three provide an outline of the four models of
language acquisition, i.e. Pragmatic, Semantic/Cognitive,
Psycholinguistic/Syntactic and Behavioural. Those models contribute to
our understanding of how language develops and illustrate to us the
complex nature of language acquisition. In addition, this discussion
documents the past and current research viewpoints and draws our
attention to the limitations that existing theories have in providing a
"full&#65533;blown" model of language acquisition. Furthermore, Chapter Three
is stating that the recent analysis of language-training for
communication disordered and intellectually handicapped students has
shown that a more balanced study of the semantic and pragmatic factors in
language acquisition is emerging. This chapter is urging teachers to
re-analyze, re-evaluate and modify their language intervention programmes
by integrating the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic factors.
Both the contents of Chapters Two and Three are demonstrating that it is
necessary to address the theoretical viewpoint and academic findings both
of which are important aspects of the role of the interventionist. They
have to be addressed if the teacher is to make judgments concerning the
efficacy of different models in attaining certain goals. Such factors
govern the utilization and integration of certain approaches and
procedures.
The contents of Chapters Four and Five discuss how the language
interventionist can lead the intellectually handicapped student into
increased language usage and communicative competence. Chapter Four is
concerned with the current critical issues and developments in:
curriculum and programme design for the moderately/severely
intellectually handicapped adolescent; criteria to guide programme
development and direction of language intervention; direct instruction
techniques; augmentative communication systems and their basic programme
guidelines.
Chapter Five outlines the framework of the Situational Language
Intervention Programme (SLIP) which was designed and implemented by the
author. The content and procedures utilized by SLIP are greatly
influenced by the contents of Chapters Two, Three and Four. This
influence is demonstrated in the discussion concerning SLIP's: aims and
objectives; content and design decisions; selection of forms to be
taught; sequencing; teaching procedures and methods of instruction.
Chapter Five also discusses the implementation of SLIP.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Situational Language Intervention Programme</field><field name="subject">SLIP</field><field name="subject">intellectually handicapped students</field><field name="subject">language acquisition</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060714.121516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Stanford-Binet Scales : a comparison of Form L/M and the Fourth Edition</field><field name="creator">Hamer, Anne</field><field name="description">The Stanford-Binet: Fourth Edition represents a new dimension in intelligence testing
from the traditional Binet Scales. Based on a 3 level hierarchical model this represents a
significant departure from the age scale format of previous revisions. Several abbreviated
batteries are suggested. This study uses the "Quick Screening Battery" consisting of four
subtests (Vocabulary, Quantitative, Pattern Analysis, and Bead Memory). Results are
presented as Standard Age scores (SAS) for fifteen subtests in four Areas (Verbal Reasoning,
Quantitative Reasoning, Abstract/Visual Reasoning and Short-term Memory), and
the global 'g' Test Composite score. Thirty kindergarten children randomly assigned to
two groups took both the Stanford-Binet: Fourth Edition and the Stanford-Binet: Form
L/M in a counter balanced design. Nine hypotheses and one question are discussed. Statistical
calculations for data analysis were arrived at through SPSSX/PC V2.0 (Noursis
1988). Correlations between Form L/M IQ and the Test Composite (r = .72), Verbal
Reasoning (r = .71) and Abstract/Visual Reasoning (r = .41) reached significance at
0.05 or better. Other correlations showed similar trends as that found in the literature.

Curriculum Consultancy Section of the ACT Schools Authority over the
period of the first decade of its existence.
It considers the move to establish a new and different education
system; the important reports which gave impetus to that move; first
the Currie Report (1967.), Report on an Independent Education
Authority for the Australian Capital Territory and the three further
reports which kept the spirit of the Currie Report alive, i.e. the
Neal-Radford Report (1972.), the Campbell Report (1973.), and the
Hughes Report (1973.). The study emphasises the haste with which the
new system was finally established; that there was not time to develop
a 'coherent, imaginative and suitable plan' (Currie, 1967, p.9.) and
that staff resources were inadequate. As Beare (1978.) has noted, 'At
no time in its first four years was the Schools Office given the
manpower needed merely for maintenance functions let alone for
development activities ... .' (p.80.)
The curriculum issues that arose in planning this new system and the
curriculum context within Australia are considered prior to a close
examination of the development and operation of the section during the
decade; the pressures which affected it and the changes which occurred
This examination as the main body of the study falls easily into three
periods; The First Years; The Middle Years of the First Decade; and
the Final Years of the First Decade; each period coinciding with the
period of tenure of one of the three principals the section has had in
those ten years. Throughout this main body of the study the major
recurring themes affecting the life of the section are closely
followed, i.e. the conflict within the system, the diversity of
demands and the difficulties of meeting those demands, the difficulty
of defining role and function and the problems of leadership.
In conclusion the study reflects on these recurring themes and
examines the changes which have occurred over the decade, e.g. the
changes in role and function, the shift in orientation to consultancy,
the changes in selection and professional development of consultants,
the concentration of consultants in priority areas and the developing
cohesiveness of the consultancy section. Finally the study addresses
the future; consideration is given to the stage in the life cycle of
an organisation that the ACT Schools Authority is at currently and to
the effect that this may possibly have upon the undoubtedly troubled
future of the Curriculum Consultancy Section.
The study draws on the documents available; on interviews with people
who have worked in the area and also on the extensive body of
literature which is available.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum Consultancy Section</field><field name="subject">ACT Schools Authority</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060714.154658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of CALL and implications for Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Hananto,</field><field name="description">Computers have begun to be exploited for English
teaching purposes by some Indonesian teachers.
Unfortunately, the potential of the computer is not fully
realized. There is also a danger that the computer is
misused. For example, the computer use is limited to
delivering exclusively dri11-and-practice exercises. It
is, therefore, very essential for Indonesian EFL teachers
to explore avenues for improving the computer use.
The aim of this study is explore how CALL (Computer
Assisted Language Learning) is used in the ACT in order
to encourage and improve the use of CALL in relation to
English teaching in Indonesia.
In this study, the different theories of CALL are
reviewed. This is followed by a description of how CALL
is utilized in the ACT. This CALL survey is offered as a
model for comparison. Since CALL is still considered a
controversial issue, students' and teachers' attitudes
toward CALL are also investigated. Finally, implications
and suggestions are put forward for Indonesian EFL
teachers and educational authorities. Important insights
from the survey are emphasized. Necessary information
which was not found in the survey, such as the latest

learners is reported with focus on how they deal with the expression of
number in English (singular/plural; definite/indefinite) through a cloze
exercise and a translation excercise. This research investigates the
hypothesis that some NP environments facilitate the distinction between
singular and plural, count and mass, and that the context in which a noun
is used can provide positive clues to the choice of number in nouns. It
has been found that transfer of Vietnamese NP structures into English
occurred where the NP environment was not obviously countable or
uncountable, i.e., it has no conspicuous structural signals for number
determination. Transfer was also found where an NP was taken from its
context. The analysis of learners' errors gives some insight into ways in
which the teaching of the number expression can be made more effective
and beneficial for Vietnamese learners. A number of activities were
suggested, which enable the teacher to exploit the advantages of NP
environments to convey the syntactic-semantic properties of number to
learners. Communicative practice of NP structures (e.g., in a
conversation or a role play activity) can make learners aware of different
aspects of the number expression in English. It is argued that the
pragmatic aspect of the number expression is most important as in use,
the syntactic and semantic properties of the category of number are
unified to achieve communicative purposes.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese learners</field><field name="subject">number expression</field><field name="subject">NP</field><field name="subject">noun phrase</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060720.122923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The introduction of privacy legislation to Australia as a case study in policy making</field><field name="creator">Harding, Ian M.</field><field name="description">The basis of this study was my belief that the introduction of the present privacy
legislation had been done in such a "try and see" manner. To me, the whole process
"begged" for a much closer look to try to understand the rationale behind successive
governments' decisions on this policy initiative.
I begin my look at the process from the 1960s as this is when general public concern for
the security of personal information was high. I then move to the introduction of the
proposed Australia Card and its demise and then to the present. Then, with reference to
the "classic" policy analysis authors, I show that the implementation of federal privacy
laws in Australia was an excellent example of how not to go about convincing the
public the new laws would offer the protection they, the public, sought. I also explore
the reasons behind negative lobbying by certain non-government sector interests to
demonstrate how this sector has influenced government thinking.
As an example of the study of a policy issue this thesis shows the effect a lack of
planning, and a terrible lack of communication, can have on the introduction of any new
legislation. Much of this is due to the fact that the real issue behind the introduction of
privacy legislation was that of increasing taxation revenue and not the protection of
individuals' privacy. The privacy legislation was the "sweetener" the government
believed was needed to satisfy the general public's concerns so that the government
could achieve the desired result for its taxation revenue policy.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">privacy legislation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">policy making</field><field name="subject">Australia Card</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060720.124331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community colleges in Australia</field><field name="creator">Hart, Gaye</field><field name="description">The North American community college model has received
increasing and significant attention in Australia in recent
years, particularly since the visit to Australia by Professor
John Dennison in 1974. The community college concept has
come to be seen as having much to offer for Australian
education. Professor Dennison suggested that a network of
community colleges be established throughout Australia and
his influence is reflected in almost every major educational
report published since his visit.
The interest being given to the concept combined with attempts
and proposals to develop community colleges raises a number
of questions: is there a consensus of opinion in Australia
about what is meant by 'community college'? why has the
concept achieved such widespread popularity? how important
is the educational rationale for community colleges when
compared with the economic rationale? does Australia need a
new type of post-secondary educational institution?
The evidence suggests that the characteristics of the North
American community colleges as summarised by Dennison have
been readily accepted by many in Australia as educationally
desirable goals. There has, however, been very little
questioning or analysis of whether a new type of institution
is necessary as a means of achieving these goals: there has
been even less research into the practicality and
feasibility of implementing an educational model conceived
and developed in another country into the Australian system
of post-secondary education.
An examination of the relationship between education and 'the
community', attempts to implement the community college model
in Australia and the complex legislative and funding arrangements
resulting from intricate Commonwealth/State relations in
education suggest that the North American community college
model cannot be developed in Australia without extreme
difficulty and frustration. Reference to the provision of
post-secondary education in this country indicates that
with the exception of some non-metropolitan areas, opportunity
already exists to meet the educational needs of individuals
and communities. In non-metropolitan areas, unable to
support each of the three existing types of post-secondary
educational institutions educational needs are not well met
and there is a need to consider the establishment of multipurpose,
multi-level educational facilities in these areas.
Should such an institution be established it is unlikely that
it could or would replicate a North American community college.
It is concluded that whilst current questioning of the
quality and quantity of post-secondary suggests that there may
be a need to restructure or rationalise the system any
proposal for implementing the North American community college
system can only be based on an inadequate knowledge of the
Australian system of post-secondary education and/or an
inadequate knowledge of the history, purpose and organisation
of community colleges.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">North America</field><field name="subject">community colleges</field><field name="subject">John Dennison</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">post-secondary education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060720.125029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The primary principalship in the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory : a study of the changing role and procedures for promotion to the position</field><field name="creator">Hawkins, Clive Richard</field><field name="description">This study researched two major aspects of the primary school principalship in the
Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory viz., (1) How current trends in
educational governance have affected the role of the principal, and (2) Assessment and
selection procedures used for promotion to the principalship in the present educational
environment.
The context of the study has been outlined by presenting a brief historical and
organisational overview of public education in both Territories, along with an
examination of the literature on recent trends and issues in educational governance and
promotion procedures.
The research methodology used to examine the questions posed in this study is
qualitative or descriptive in nature. The data was collected through the use of a semistructured
interview technique and represents the ideas, opinions and perceptions of a
specially targeted group of principals and aspiring principals from both education
systems.
The findings demonstrated that many aspects of the role of the primary principalship in
the N.T. and A.C.T. are changing, due to a new set of values in educational policymaking
and increased political control. There was a high degree of similarity between
respondents in each Territory in regard to how the role is being reshaped.
It was also found that the level of support provided by both systems to assist principals
in coping with the changes has been inadequate and that the changes have led to a
degree of conflict and new job-related pressures for most primary school principals.
It was concluded that assessment and selection procedures should be rigorous and
demanding, commensurate with the significance of the position. In this regard both
educational systems need to improve present procedures by addressing perceived
weaknesses. To this end assessment centres may have a role to play.
Finally, further implications of the conclusions are addressed in terms of the necessity
for thorough preparation and training of aspirants to the principalship to enhance their
chance of selection and help them cope with the new expectations and demands of the
position. This responsibility should be shared between the aspirant, professional
associations and the employing education department.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">principals</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">NT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">promotion</field><field name="subject">public education</field><field name="subject">educational governance</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060720.142102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Classroom encounters and mathematics curriculum change : a single-site school improvement study</field><field name="creator">Hawthorne, Wendy</field><field name="description">In November, 1986, Mrs Lorna Ireland; Principal of Junee Primary School in the
Riverina Region of New South Wales; approached a Senior Lecturer in Mathematics
Education at Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education in Wagga Wagga; seeking
his involvement in a project aimed to assist teachers at the school with their
mathematics teaching. In addition to the planned involvement in 1987 of this
mathematics educator, the school was also to be a pilot school for the trialling of a
strand of the New South Wales Education Department's Draft Mathematics Curriculum
and a participating school in the numeracy component of the federal government's
Basic Learning in Primary Schools program.
This study documents the mathematics education activities which involved Junee
Primary School teachers in 1987. It focuses on the RMIHE involvement in the school
but considers this in the context of broader mathematics curriculum activity. The
process of change is described within a theoretical framework derived from a review
of relevant literature.
The research methodology employed is fundamentally ethnographic and relies on the
collection of qualitative data to derive descriptions of people and events. The data
analysis relates to curriculum change, the role of the change agent and the role of
mathematics educators in school mathematics programs. A discussion of outcomes
highlights the strengths of an approach to curriculum change which had its genesis in
the school rather than in some external agency. The generation of problems and issues
and the resolution of these are features of the analysis which tracks the progress

influence the development and formation of
religious attitudes in students. While there is an
increasing body of knowledge and indepth research
evolving regarding this field of study there is
little done in the Third World and it is the first
done on students at Betikama, Kukudu and Aore
Adventist High Schools.
It is an "ex post facto" study and examines the
effects of a number of variables-- school, age,
gender, level of schooling, religion, parent's
religion, religious practices, parent's schooling,
country of citizenship, student future plans,
number of years at school, the type of school,
school life and school climate-- on the religious
attitudes of students attending selected high
schools.
The significance of the study lies in attempting
to identify those factors which assist in the
development of propitious religious attitudes in
students. The modus operandi of the schools in
the study is to encourage students to adopt a
world view and lifestyle that is consistent with
the tenets and practises of Christianity as
espoused by Seventh-day Adventistism. It is the
purpose of this study to contribute to the
identification of factors which would assist in
the achieving of this objective.
Those variables which were most significant in the
formation of attitudes toward religion were
related to the School Climate and School Life as
perceived by the students. Other findings related
to variables investigating Student Background,
Personal Characteristics, Student Religious
Practices, and Family Background. These results
apparently found some variables to be significant
while others appeared not to be as significant.
The research seems to suggest that educators and
administrators must be aware of the influence of
various school experiences on the development of
religious attitudes in students. If they want to
succeed in their objectives, then school
programmes, school curriculum, extra-curricula
activities, teaching methods and teacher example
should promote student worth, through such aspects
as fair treatment, consistency, seeing students
as individuals and nuturing caring environments.
Further research may include identification of
factors which seem to override the importance of
gender and age on the religious attitudes of the
students in the study. It may also be worthwhile
to identify those facets of school life and
climate which are most conducive to the
development of positive attitudes toward religion.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">religious attitudes</field><field name="subject">Solomon Islands</field><field name="subject">Vanuatu</field><field name="subject">Adventist high schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060720.153301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Botanic gardens as outdoor museums</field><field name="creator">Henderson, D.

Concepts of poverty, basic education and literacy appropriate to South
Pacific countries are developed and relationships among them are
examined as preliminary steps to data collection and analysis. The
data for the thesis comes from programs of aid to basic education that
were running in or have commenced since 1985 and consists of
formal evaluations and reviews, the opinion of expert panels and
anecdotal evidence from individuals. Analysis of the data is
conducted in two stages; first, criteria by which to judge the success
of programs are developed and applied to the data, and second, the
common components of successful programs are identified.
The 'components of success' are then used to develop approaches that
aid agencies could employ in analysing program proposals and/or in
developing programs in basic education that have a poverty focus.

thirty four full-time teachers in a Catholic school in

between the levels of participation they wanted and the

The result of the study show that the levels of
participation, both teachers' desired participation and
actual participation are not always significantly correlated
to the levels of Organizational Health they perceive.
Such significant relationship between the levels of
participation and the levels of Organizational Health only
occur in some areas of decision making and some dimensions
of Organizational Health. In addition, satisfied teachers

in the Teaching of English as a Second Language (TESL) have had
far-reaching consequences. In these situations, the consequences are
compounded when the teacher is a L3 speaker of English teaching
English to students who are predominantly L2/L3 speakers. Such
consequences were explicitly stated in a number of reports, reviews
and observations (Elley, 1979; Chamberlain, 1987; Laws and Horsley,
1988; The Ministerial Taskforce, 1989) and others.
Issues relating to quality of education and quality of English teaching
were frequently addressed and questioned. The author's experience
as a teacher of English, Head of the English Department at
Titikaveka College and English Adviser for secondary schools led to
a growing concern and need to delve into these problems at both the
primary and secondary levels. In the absence of research in this
important area, the author sought to conduct investigation in four
schools. The author was further motivated to conduct research as a
result of a number of recent changes within the education system.
Major concerns were firstly, the introduction of the Grade 6 National
Examination in 1991; secondly, the change-over from the South
Pacific English Option paper to a full New Zealand English paper in
the New Zealand School Certificate (NZSC) Examination in 1989; and
finally, the introduction of the New Zealand Bursary Examination in
1992. The question foremost in the author's mind was how
adequately were the schools equipped to implement such changes
given an array of major constraints.
In this study, it is hypothesised that, most of the problems related to
TESL in the Cook Islands stem primarily, and mainly from the poor
quality of teachers in the classroom. This does not deny the
existence of problems which emanate from other factors which
impact on TESL, such as the language policy and curriculum, the
adequacy or inadequacy of teaching resources, and whether indeed
they are appropriate and the kinds of teaching methods which
prevail. These are all acknowledged as contributing factors. The
argument presented in this study, is that, while these are
contributing factors, they are considered not as important as the
teacher factor.
The thrust of this thesis recognises the teacher as the most important
classroom resource, the "key" factor which ultimately determines the
quality and indeed the success or failure of an education system.
This is true in the particular context of the Cook islands where
teaching-learning resources, by its broadest definition, are very
limited. In terms of the quality of the teacher's resourcefulness, this
in turn is determined by his/her level of education and the kind of
training received.
Underlying the thesis presented is the contention that if the teacher is
well-educated and highly-trained, then teaching and learning for the
child make the possibility of attaining Level IV, the highest stage in
Beeby's paradigm more likely. That is, teaching which stresses
meaning and understanding, problem solving and creativity and the
catering of individual differences (Beeby 1966: 72). Needless to say,
the converse is more likely to happen, where and when teachers
have had very limited education, inadequate and inappropriate
training.
In accordance with the purpose as outlined in Chapter 1, this study
comprises 6 chapters and a conclusion. Chapter 1 discusses the
nature of the problem from a number of interrelated dimensions,
which have to varying degrees impacted on the teaching of ESL in
the Cook Islands. The chapter concludes by stressing the purpose
and relevance of the study in terms of educational, economic and
social significance.
Chapter 2 reviews and discusses, from a historical perspective, the
literature as it relates firstly to the teaching of English in the Pacific
but more specifically the teaching of English in the Cook Islands.
The chapter then discusses the theoretical development and research
in the teaching and learning of ESL in an attempt to arrive at a
theoretical framework.
Chapter 3 presents the research instruments and procedures used to
gather and analyse the data. In the main, office sources, classroom
observations, questionnaires and interviews formed the basis for
eliciting data.
Chapter 4 draws together the major findings of the study. The
limited size of the sample placed some restrictions on the analysis of
results derived from this study. Nevertheless, the analysis identified
some significant trends upon which conclusions can be drawn.
The last two chapters, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 deal with the
interpretative aspects of the study with the intention of arriving at
valid recommendations to the problems identified.
In summary, the study found that the teacher in the Cook Islands
context is the key factor in the process of teaching and learning of
ESL. When the teacher is well-educated and adequately trained, then
the possibility of quality teaching and meaningful learning becomes a
reality for the student.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teaching of English as a Second Language</field><field name="subject">TESL</field><field name="subject">Titikaveka College</field><field name="subject">Cook Islands</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060721.123442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coping in an open-plan high school : a comparative study</field><field name="creator">Hewat, Pat</field><field name="description">In this study an attempt was made to consider the behaviour
of students in a new open-plan High School as a specific example
of an interaction between man and his environment. In the first
two chapters a brief review was made of research and theories
that were thought to be relevant to this.
In the last part of the study a research project which
involved a comparison of 'coping' and 'non-coping' students was
described.
The teaching environment in the chosen High School during
the first term of 1976 appeared to be a 'Progressive - Open
type' of teaching environment. After the first tern it changed
and became increasingly more traditional.
Significant differences in scholastic behaviour between
the two groups of students at the end of the first term indicated
that:-
1. The coping group tended to have a more internal locus of
control than the non-coping group.
2. The students of the coping group tended to plan for
professional careers whereas those of the non-coping group
tended to plan for non-professional careers.
3. On the whole the coping group tended to have realistic
career aims in terms of their general ability.
(ii)
If. The students of the coping group tended to have higher
I.Q. scores than those of the non-coping group.
There were no significant differences between the coping
and non-coping groups in terms of their attitudes towards the
High School nor in terms of the attitudes of their parents.
Both groups of students tended to state that 'doing well
at school' was important to them and to record positive or
neutral attitudes towards the High School for both themselves
and their parents.
Significant differences in behaviour were found between
'internal' and 'external' students that support Rotter's theory
regarding goal values. Internal students who planned for
professional careers tended to be in the coping group whereas
internal students who planned for non-professional careers
tended to be in the non-coping group. In the case of the
'external' students no significant differences were found
between the type of career aims and coning.
The change to a more traditional type of teaching environment
appeared to benefit the 'external' students.
At the end of the third terra there was a significant increase
in the numbers of 'external' students classified as coping,
but in the case of the 'internal' students no significant increase
was found.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">open-plan high school</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">non-coping</field><field name="subject">teaching environment</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060721.143133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study into teachers' inclusion of the Christian perspective in the classroom</field><field name="creator">Hewitt, Ian Andrew</field><field name="description">Trinity Christian School is a Christian parent controlled school which was established in
1980 with eleven students and one teacher. The current enrolment of the school is some
six hundred and forty students. In 1991 the Trinity Christian School Vision Statement
was written. This 'Vision Statement' gives an outline of the direction Trinity Christian
School should be heading. It also gives a brief outline of the purpose for the school's
existence.
At the present time Trinity Christian School is beginning to expand into a school of
some seven hundred and eighty students and is also undergoing a process of whole
school review. It is therefore a significant time in which to study how the Trinity
Christian School Vision Statement is being implemented within the school, particularly,
within the Secondary section of the school.
The focus of this study is to observe what if any, a selection of secondary teachers at
Trinity Christian School are including in the classroom which would reflect the Trinity
Christian School Vision Statement. In particular, to look for the inclusion of a Christian
perspective as is defined in the Vision statement'.
To undertake this study a naturalistic inquiry methodology was selected in which a
range of field study techniques were adopted, especially from the field of ethnography.
A range of data was collected from the following sources: curriculum statements; the
Christian perspectives outline; teaching programs; lesson observations; teacher
interviews; student interviews; student workbooks; and teaching resources.
From the data collected for this study there is much evidence to demonstrate the
teachers' inclusion of the Christian perspective in the classroom at Trinity Christian
School. The manner in which this is included varies between cases, much as the
teaching style of each individual teacher varies.
Teachers' Inclusion Of The Christian Perspective In The Classroom
How the Christian perspective is included also varies according to the subject and the
unit being taught. For instance, to include a Christian perspective in the teaching of the
Theories of Creation and Evolution' in Science is of course going to be far easier than in
the teaching of 'Products and Factors' in Mathematics.
A key implication for Trinity Christian School, is that the consistency of the
documentation could be improved. If this was done, then a greater inclusion of the
Christian perspective in the classroom could be provided to challenge the students more
than at present. This could be achieved if the Christian perspective were incorporated in
many more aspects of the classroom than was observed in this study. In this way the
students would have modelled to them the Christian way to live in many more of the
situations which arise in the classroom.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trinity Christian School</field><field name="subject">vision statement</field><field name="subject">inclusion</field><field name="subject">Christian perspective</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060721.145513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical thinking : an investigation of its perceived use in educational and organisational settings</field><field name="creator">Hewitt, Stephen</field><field name="description">The key purposes of this study were to determine the extent that people purport to
utilise critical thinking in educational and organisational settings; second, to examine
the forces that encouraged and discouraged critical thinking and third, to identify
strategies and environments that encourage and foster critical thinking.
The literature examined shows that the use and teaching of critical thinking has been
well represented in educational settings. However, upon an initial review of literature
within organisations it appeared that the term critical thinking was not commonly
used. While critical thinking occurred within organisations it tended to be defined as
problem solving and decision making approaches.
The model of critical thinking which underpinned this research was that of Stephen Brookfield (1987). Brookfield's model was tested through the design of the
methodology. A total of ninety three surveys were completed by students at the
University of Canberra from the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Management.
Thirteen individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a selection of
these students.
The data suggested that critical thinking occurred both within educational and
organisational environments. One of the main impediments to the use of critical
thinking was the availability of ample time and the respondents claimed that they had
more time to apply critical thinking during their studies rather than at work. The
respondents identified strategies such as brainstorming, role playing and modelling
behaviour as some of the approaches that would increase the likelihood of the use of
critical thinking at work and study. An unanticipated finding was that individuals
applied a different interpretation in the application of critical thinking within
organisations compared to educational settings.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical thinking</field><field name="subject">Stephen Brookfield</field><field name="subject">University of Canberra</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060721.150358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An implementation of a curriculum framework : a case study</field><field name="creator">Hicks, June</field><field name="description">A Home Economics Curriculum Framework was developed

government institutions and took over full funding responsibility
for universities and colleges of advanced education from the
States. This study investigates the process of funding tertiary
institutions and the somewhat different position and importance
in the funding process of technical and further education
colleges compared with universities and colleges of advanced
education is clarified and explained.
The influence of the changing economic circumstances of the
late nineteen seventies upon the level and method of funding
is considered. The role of the Tertiary Education Commission
as a major influence within the funding process and its role
in decisionmaking is outlined and its power acknowledged.
The Federal Government attitude to the level and pattern of
funding tertiary education has altered significantly since
1974. To illustrate the extent and nature of changed
government priorities,trends in funding and the implications
of such trends are examined and analysed. From this data
emerging problems as universities and colleges of advanced
education face the difficulties of expenditure restraint
are identified. It is noted that not all the effects of
restraint have negative consequences, in fact there may be
some positive benefits to be derived.
The field study investigates the currently increasing demands
for our tertiary institutions to be more accountable for the
public funds they spend. Questions associated with the demand
for accountability- the difficulty of defining what is meant
by accountability; accountability for what, to whom, when,
how and why in relation to the funding of tertiary education
are discussed, associated problems and possible solutions
highlighted.
Finally, some reflections upon the process of funding tertiary
education are expounded and conclusions are drawn from the

undertaken at the Auckland City Art Gallery during the period January to
August 1983. It has been divided into three parts with six associated
appendices.
Part one discusses the functions and facilities of the Conservation
Department. The functions being classed into two main categories, that
concerned with the Auckland City Art Gallery and that concerned with
National Conservation. The facilities of the Department are not only the
equipment and materials of the Conservation studios but the equipment and
design around the Gallery that facilitate the task of the conservators
whether it be through treatment or by preventative means. Part two
covers the programme of work carried out. As indicated in Part one, the
conservation department has many other functions apart from the treatment
of works of art, and as a member of the department during my internship, I
was involved in a number of these which are discussed in this section. This
includes packing, meetings and visits to other institutions.
Part three deals with the conservation treatments carried out. Section one
summarizes the methods and materials used, section two lists the works
treated in the order that they were begun, and section three covers the
condition and treatment reports for each work.
Finally, six appendices have been included which augment information in the
text such as a description of the present renovations to the Auckland City
Art Gallery and a brief history of conservation in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">painting conservation</field><field name="subject">Auckland City Art Gallery</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060724.094401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art education in New South Wales, 1850s to 1930s, with particular reference to the contribution of Joseph Fowles, Frederick W. Woodhouse, and John E. Branch</field><field name="creator">Hilson, Muriel M. L.</field><field name="description">This study aimed to uncover information about an area on which
little published material is available, that is, the area of art
education in New South Wales prior to 1940. Because of the lack of
published material, much of the information used in this study had
to be sought in annual reports on education made to the New South
Wales Parliament over the years concerned, and in the educational
journals of the period. Some very useful original documents and
letters were found in the Mitchell Library and in the New South Wales
Archives.
It was established that drawing first became part of the curriculum
in a few public schools in Sydney in 1854, and that by 1869,
drawing was taught in all the primary schools of New South Wales.
The drawing system which was introduced was based on the very
structured and utilitarian programme of the Department of Science
and Art in South Kensington.
The first Drawing Master in New South Wales was Joseph Fowles,
who had arrived in Sydney from England in 1838. Joseph Fowles was in
charge of drawing in the public schools of New South Wales from his
appointment in 1854 until his death in 1878.
The other two important figures in art education over the period
covered by this study were Frederick W. Woodhouse, who was Superintendent
of Drawing from his arrival from England in 1889 until his resignation in
1903, and John E. Branch, who was in charge from 1903 until his death
in 1933.
This study found evidence that the Department of Science and Art
in South Kensington played an essential part in establishing the
programme of art education in New South Wales from the 1850s until well
into the twentieth century.
With regard to the contribution made by the three individuals
mentioned in the title, the study found that while they played an
important role in overseeing the teaching of drawing in the schools,
they were not influential in the sense of being able to impose any
individual philosophy of art education on the system.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art education</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">with particular Joseph Fowles</field><field name="subject">Frederick W.

they enter primary school around five years of age. The progress of this
literacy development typically has been from the child's spoken language
into reading. In this approach writing emerges out of reading experience.
Montessori's theory suggests that children can come to literacy via
writing, specifically via the sounds of the alphabet. Her approach rests on
the view that the alphabet can represent the sounds of spoken language.
Given the sounds/symbols to write the child can learn to map spoken
language to print. As children explore the print system in writing they will
build up knowledge and understanding sufficient to support easy access to
reading.
According to Montessori the pre-school years offer an optimal time for
this development to occur. She maintains that where literacy acquisition
emerges out of spoken language via writing into reading the potential for
creative written expression may be more available to the child than where
the progression is first into reading. In this latter approach the thoughts
and conventions of other writers (reading) may limit the child's
expression.
Theoretical issues regarding young children's capacities to learn as well as
issues surrounding the writing/reading precedence are discussed.
To examine the process from children's spoken language into writing, a
series of naturalistic observations were carried out in three Montessori
classes. Children's progress from oracy to literacy and the learning
environments which facilitated this process are documented and discussed.
In presenting the children's learning environments an informal exposition of
Montessori's approach to language learning at the pre-school level is given.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pre-schools</field><field name="subject">Montessori</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="subject">spoken language</field><field name="subject">oracy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060724.131835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An individualized CELL Listening Comprehension Program: making listening more meaningful for Thai learners of English</field><field name="creator">Puakpong, Nattaya</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research project was to examine theories of learning, theories of teaching, and theories of listening comprehension with a view to developing and testing a computer-enhanced listening comprehension system for English as a Foreign Language within the Thai university system. In addition to carrying out an in-depth literature review, factors contributing to difficulties in the listening process were also carefully examined in order to build a sound foundation for dealing with listening comprehension. A brief history and analysis of Computer Assisted Language Learning were presented together with a review of some computer programs with the aim of determining their characteristics. An Individualized CELL Listening Comprehension Program was then developed on the basis of four theoretical frameworks: the Constructivist approach, the need to use authentic spoken passages, reduction of cognitive load and response to learner differences.
The system was then used by twenty students of Suranaree University of Technology (SUT), Thailand for a period of fifteen weeks. Students were volunteers from different proficiency levels. SUT midterm and final examinations were employed, in part, to observe the effect of the program on proficiency levels. The SUT examinations, which were usually in a multiple-choice format, tested students on minor details through short, simple conversations. These tests might not fit entirely within best practice for listening but they seem to be a common way of measuring listening development in several educational contexts. Pretests and posttests examining global ideas and specific details in written and multiple-choice formats were then developed so as to provide a more accurate gauge of improvement in listening skills. Log files were kept in order to scrutinize in detail students&#65533; interactions with the system. Questionnaire and interview techniques were applied to seek out students&#65533; attitudes towards the program.
The results revealed that the participants performed better than their peers in the same proficiency levels in SUT midterm and final examinations although the difference was not at a statistically significant level. However, posttest scores were better than those of pretest at a statistically significant level in most aspects except in case of the global ideas. The log files revealed that all students tended to focus on the word level by attempting to understand and decode every word in the transcriptions. This fixation is likely to explain the low global ideas scores. Analysis was complicated by the fact that some students were not able to use the

program frequently enough, usually because of unexpectedly heavy schedules. However, the data extracted through questionnaires and interviews showed that most students demonstrated a positive attitude towards the various features of the program and felt that use of the program had improved their listening skills. In addition to findings relating to the development of listening comprehension, the study revealed that the majority of students felt that they did not think listening comprehension and, more generally the study of English, was sufficiently important to spend time on. This interesting but shocking discovery needs to be attended to immediately as it may have a strong effect on how Thai students prioritize their learning of English, and how this may impact on the levels of proficiency which they might subsequently attain.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">listening comprehension</field><field name="subject">English as a Foreign Language</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Computer Assisted Language Learning</field><field name="subject">CALL</field><field name="subject">Suranaree University of Technology</field><field name="subject">SUT</field><field name="subject">second language learning</field><field name="subject">CELL</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060724.135729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interaction in the second language classroom : power and the presence of communicative constraints</field><field name="creator">Hilton, Linda</field><field name="description">This theoretical thesis investigates the effects of communicative constraints within
a second language (L2) classroom with the purpose of developing ways of
exploiting and modifying these constraints to improve L2 learning.
This investigation incorporates the identification of hierarchical structures,
teaching and learning practices which constrain L2 learning within the classroom.
The hierarchical structures of institutional power relations and the authority of the
teacher guide set goals and assessment. However, L2 learners may have different
expectations to those of their teachers. Therefore, in the presentation of an
understanding of classroom genre, this thesis analyses the inherent logic or
common fallacies of thinking and practice within L2 classrooms and further, the
individual experience which each L2 learner brings to the classroom situation.
This thesis examines classroom constraints which prevent L2 learners from
developing an appropriate range of experiences to enable them to participate in
authentic social interaction. Cultural, linguistic and educational disciplinary
views are engaged in the description of these substantive problems.
L2 learners invariably experience difficulties in communication when they interact
socially within their L2 culture, outside the classroom. Learners often lack the
experience to express self-purpose within cultural genres because previous
classroom learning may have been based upon situation-specific and context-determined
patterns of communication and practice.
Such patterns and practices are an inherent part of the classroom because the
classroom is a specific genre itself and consequently classroom talk is very
different from talk in other places.
This thesis develops alternative hypotheses which incorporate critical findings
pertaining to L2 classroom practices. Further, a project for realistic solutions to
L2 learning is offered. These solutions have been developed from the recognition
that learning a L2 in a classroom-based situation is a process which lacks the
diversity of everyday societal life.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communicative constraints</field><field name="subject">second language</field><field name="subject">classroom practices</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060724.140733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Open education : identification and illustration of the concept</field><field name="creator">Hine, Alison</field><field name="description">The main aim of this field study is to review, analyse and
interpret the research literature on open education. The study
also attempts to define and illustrate the concept open education.
In addition the study has aimed to produce a set of resource
materials which illustrate open education, namely, what it is
and how it is manifested in schools.
From an initial empirical review and content analysis of
the research literature, it is apparent that certain common themes
emerge when defining the concept of open education. In an attempt
to ascertain, clarify and derive meaningful conclusions, eight
themes have been derived from the scan and content analysis of
the literature. The work of appropriate authors has been discussed
and analysed within this framework. The eight themes identified
from the literature defining the concept of open education are:-
(a) Aspects of implementation of 'openness' and open
schooling;
(b) Open space, open planning, the focus on spatiality
and openness in architecture;
(c) Philosophy of Open Education;
(d) Goals of Open Education;
(e) The Origins of Open Education in Australian Schools;
(f) Assumptions and Beliefs of Open Education;
(g) Characteristics and Criteria of Open Education;
(h) Descriptions, Anecdotal definitions and interviews
concerned with Open Education.
These themes are discussed individually with reference to the relevant
authors.
From the analysis and discussion of the relevant research
literature, it would appear that it is not only plausible but
possible to define the concept of open education. The defining
characteristics of open education are identified through:
- the degree of openness of a school program;
- the focus on spatiality and openness in architecture;
- the philosophical goals, assumptions and beliefs intrinsic
in the concept of open education;
- the observable characteristics and criteria manifested
by open education.
The concept open education cannot adequately be defined in
terms of a statement but in terms of observable sets of criteria
which are present at varying times and in varying degrees ranging
backward and forward along a continuum of degree of openness.
Open education can therefore be defined by assessing the extent to
which a specified set of criteria are present or absent. An aspect
of the curriculum may then be ranked with respect to those defining
characteristics of open education. Even though the content may
vary, the specified set of criteria remain intrinsic and inherent
in the concept.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">open education</field><field name="subject">open schooling</field><field name="subject">open space</field><field name="subject">open planning</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060724.141259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ethnography of teacher perceptions of cultural and institutional practices relating to sexual harassment in ACT high schools</field><field name="creator">Hinson, Sandy</field><field name="description">This two year, topic-oriented ethnography documents teacher perceptions of
cultural and institutional practices relating to sexual harassment in 12 co-educational,
government ACT high schools. Participants include over one hundred and forty
teachers, seventy eight of whom have contributed formal interviews.
Through analysis and triangulation of ethnographic interviews, participant
observation data and school and Departmental documents, the study identifies cultural
and institutional practices which, according to teacher perceptions, contribute to:
&#65533; encouraging sexual harassment;
&#65533; discouraging reports of sexual harassment; and
&#65533; discouraging implementation of sexual harassment policy.
Emerging cultural and institutional practices include blame attribution, silencing
and gender construction which contribute to the marginalisation of some female
teachers (in terms of their career); some female students (in terms of their education)
and some male students who are perceived to be "gay" (in terms of their friendship
groups).
The usefulness, limitations and capacity to explain sexual harassment of a range
of theoretical approaches are discussed. These approaches include Attribution, Role,
Reproduction and Feminist theories. It is argued that, although accounting for the
majority of sexual harassment, these theories are limited in their ability to fully account
for:
a) all kinds of sexual harassment practised in ACT high schools;
b) the relationship between sexual harassment and other kinds of harassment
in ACT high schools; and
c) the extent to which some women teachers appear to support the practice of
sexual harassment.
Emerging Poststructuralist Feminism is proposed as a potentially useful
theoretical framework for explaining and responding to sexual harassment in ACT high
schools.
It is hoped that this study will contribute to informing the decision making of
those responsible for developing and/or implementing sexual harassment policy in ACT
high schools, including teachers, school counsellors, principals, and administrators.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sexual harassment</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">Poststructuralist Feminism</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060724.141946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A discussion paper based on six months employment at the Australian Museum, Sydney - with particular reference to preparation for the Abelam Gallery</field><field name="creator">Hinton, Graham</field><field name="description">From November 30th, 1981 to May 28th, 1982 I was
employed at the Conservation Laboratory of The Australian

under Sue Walston's supervision, for two weeks in July
1982 and worked on two private projects at Conservation Art
and Library Services, Leichhardt. During my time at The
Australian Museum preparation for the opening of a major
gallery, "The Abelam - a people of Papua New Guinea" was
concluded. A large proportion of my work at the Museum was
related to this event.
The Australian Museum places a high priority on
environmental monitoring of storage areas and one of my
duties was to participate in this monitoring programme.
Shortly before the opening of the new gallery, flooding
was discovered in two showcases in the Aboriginal Gallery
affecting some sixty artefacts. The entire conservation
staff was involved in emergency procedures, removing the
objects to a stabilising environment until further work
could be carried out. As the work load occasioned by the
Abelam Gallery eased, I was placed in charge of the followup
work on the flood-damaged artefacts.
The contract with Australia Post was to prepare
moulded fibre-glass backings for a collection of Aboriginal
bark paintings. This plus my work at Conservation Art and

competency standards and their implementation in the professions. The
study was conducted with the aim of informing policy development and
implementation in Namibia in this area by drawing lessons from the
Australian experience. It set out to identify the factors that influenced
the implementation of this policy in Australia, the importance of these
factors and the strategies employed by implementors to enhance
successful implementation. The study is grounded in policy
implementation theory.
Twenty professions have been involved in developing and implementing
competency standards in Australia under the guidance and with the
support of a national government organisation called the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR). The main objectives of the
Australian government in implementing this policy were the
improvement of migrant skills recognition and the achievement of
recognition for professional qualifications across state and territory
borders.
Time and budgetary constraints would not allow the involvement of all
the professional groups in this study, so four groups were selected based
on their size and progress made in developing and implementing the
standards. The groups ranged from a very large professional group
(more than 250 000 members) to a very small professional group
(approximately 3 500 members). Eleven respondents from NOOSR and
the professional groups participated in the study. Data was gathered by
structured interview, a rating schedule and document analysis.
The study found that there were seventeen factors that influenced this
process as perceived by the respondents. These factors were classified
into five categories: technical, political, economic, administrative and
political, and then placed on a matrix with the levels at which they
exerted their greatest pressure: external, internal to the professional
body, and on the steering group. This classification of factors gave
indications of the types of strategies and the level of intervention which
may address implementation problems best. The study compiled a list of
the factors in order of importance as rated by the respondents. This
ranking showed that leadership was the most important factor, followed
by experience and expertise of the steering group and the need for and
appropriateness of the standards for the professions. The study also
found that the Australian government employed inducement, capacity
building and facilitation strategies to enhance the successful
vii
implementation of the standards, while the professional bodies
employed mainly staff development and training as strategies.
The study concluded that Namibian policy makers and implementors
can draw the following lessons from the Australian experience:
1. there is a need for a balance between pressure and support from
government;
2. there is a role for a national implementation plan;
3. the main attraction of national competency standards is still the
many uses it can be put to and the many purposes it serves for
different organisations;
4. assessment strategies need to be considered from the beginning;
5. the methodology of using a representative steering group to lead
standards development is one of the best features of the Australian
approach;
6. Over time, the original objectives of the policy became low priority
for NOOSR and the government;
7. the classification matrix can be used as a planning tool; and
8. the ranking of the factors indicates the importance of organisational,
technical and economic factors.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">competency standards</field><field name="subject">Namibia</field><field name="subject">policy development</field><field name="subject">National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition</field><field name="subject">NOOSR</field><field name="subject">professional qualifications</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060725.095855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">English and Vietnamese political news dicourse : a contrastive analysis in terms of stucture, lexis and syntax</field><field name="creator">Hoa, Nguyen</field><field name="description">The present study is one of the first attempts undertaken to
study English and Vietnamese news discourse on a contrastive
basis. More specifically, it investigates the structure, the
lexical and syntactic features of English and Vietnamese
political news discourse.
It is hoped that the results of the study may help the Vietnamese
teacher and student to make better use of newspapers in the
process of English language teaching and learning. In addition, it
is hoped that the study may benefit the journalist, to some
extent, because it is generally assumed that if the knowledge of
news discourse structure, the linguistic features and the factors
involved are professionally known and shared, this will
facilitate news discourse production and comprehension.
The study reveals two different strategies used by English and
Vietnamese political news writers. English news writers
predominantly employ the IP structure pattern whereas
Vietnamese news writers employ BTN (Background-to-News).
Lexically, English newspapers use more lively, vigorous language,
metaphors, puns and hyperbole. In contrast, the occurrence of
serious, formal language is a very pronounced feature of
Vietnamese newspapers. This is the area where Vietnamese
students of English often have difficulty, as is indicated by the
survey. The greatest syntactic difference is sentence order,
namely, English news stories often use S + V + (O) + (A) while
their Vietnamese counterparts use A + S + V + (O) +. The other
difference is that English news paragraphs are mostly single
sentence paragraphs as disctinct from their multi-sentence
Vietnamese ones.
Chapter One is an introduction explaining the rationale, the
methods, and the data for analysis, of the present study.
Chapter Two is concerned with the theoretical background to the
study. It deals with such concepts as cohesion, coherence,
structure, relevance, text and discourse.
Chapter Three provides a contrastive overview of English and
Vietnamese newspapers, essentially in terms of ownership and
the approach to news.
Chapter Four examines the different structure patterns used by
English and Vietnamese reporters and journalists.
Chapter Five and Six study the different lexical and syntactic
features of English and Vietnamese political news discourse,
respectively.
In chapter Seven, a comparison of English and Vietnamese
political news discourse is given, which is based on the analyses
presented in chapters Four, Five and Six. In addition, it presents
the results of a survey of comprehension difficulty encountered
by Vietnamese students studying English now at the University
of Canberra, and looks at some discourse strategies involved in
news discourse production and comprehension.
The last chapter offers some implications for TEFL in Vietnam,
which are based on the author's own experience and results of a
survey. The author hopes that these implications may be of some
help to the practising teacher as well as the student.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">political news discourse</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">journalists</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">lexis</field><field name="subject">syntax</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060725.100742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the ESP teacher</field><field name="creator">Hoa, Nguyen Thi</field><field name="description">The demand for English for Specific Purposes (ESP) in Vietnam is very

analysis of the different types of interrogative
sentences in English and Vietnamese including their
structures and meanings. It is also hoped that the result
of this study will be of some use to English teachers in
Vietnam in their classroom teaching and in their preparation
of teaching materials. It may also be useful to Vietnamese
students who are learning English, especially when
learning the English interrogative mood.
Hitherto, there have been different models of
description of language, but the systemic model is considered
to be one of the most comprehensive, since it is
able to bring out the functional uses of language and can
be used to describe any language. For this reason, the
systemic model is adopted in this paper to describe the
two systems of the English and Vietnamese interrogative
mood.
The varieties of the two languages, English and
Vietnamese, from which examples are taken for analysis
in this paper, are Southern British Standard and Standard
Vietnamese ranging from colloquial to literary.
Throughout each chapter, the examples are numbered
in consecutive order. Examples in Vietnamese are
presented with a slash mark ( / ) placed between lexical
items to facilitate the matching of Vietnamese with the
literal English translation which follows. The literal
translation is followed by a freer English translation
enclosed in quotation marks.
The study consists of five chapters. In the
first chapter, the author begins by summarizing different
views on the nature of language and their applications
in language teaching and learning, and then presents
a short introduction to systemic linguistics and a brief
sketch of systemic grammar.
The second chapter is about the English interrogative
mood. This description of the English interrogative
mood is largely based on the ideas on Mood presented by
D. J. Young, lecturer in English in the University of
Wales Institute of Science and Technology in Britain.
In the third chapter, an attempt is made to provide
a detailed description of the different types of
interrogative sentences in Vietnamese.
Chapter four moves to a contrastive analysis
which consists of a textual and then a systemic comparison
and contrast of the two interrogative mood systems in
English and Vietnamese.
A recapitulation of what has been done in the
previous chapters and some suggestions for the preparation
of teaching material and the teaching of English interrogative
sentences to Vietnamese students are presented in
chapter five, which is the last chapter of the study.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interrogative sentences</field><field name="subject">English interrogative mood</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">systemic model</field><field name="subject">systemic linguistics</field><field name="subject">systemic contrastive analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060725.105609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mosquito habitats and predation efficiency on mosquito populations in Ginninderra Wetland, Canberra, Australia</field><field name="creator">Hoa, Vu Minh</field><field name="description">The ecology of mosquito populations in relation to weather conditions,

were found. Temperature was a major climatic factor in determining
the abundance of mosquito populations in the wetland. First
collections and subsequent development of mosquitoes in Ginninderra wetland are likely to depend on local weather conditions each year.
The wetland proper was not a suitable habitat for mosquito breeding.
Tall emergent vegetation may have obstructed oviposition and
predation was also important in limiting colonization by mosquitoes.
Instead, isolated temporary waterbodies which were free of predators,
such as ground depressions, tyre tracks, domestic waste containers,
were the most important habitats for mosquitoes adjacent to the
Ginninderra wetland.
Field experiments found that predation of mosquito larvae by
mosquitofish Gambusia qffinis and notonectids Anisops was more
efficient in sunlight than shade and this was affected by the height of

the Mandarin prosody presents major difficulties. One particularly problematic aspect of the
Mandarin prosodic system, and the one singled out for research here is the acquisition of tones
by second language (L2) learners of Mandarin. This thesis involves a literature review and a
description of an experiment conducted for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of a new
teaching method for educating students in Mandarin prosody generally, but especially with
regard to "tones."
Most studies investigating the acquisition of Mandarin tones by L2 learners have treated tones
as separate from other aspects of Mandarin prosody such as stress, loudness and duration. The
teaching method examined in this thesis, however, takes an alternative approach. Here the
acquisition of Mandarin prosody is approached as a complex dynamic that has tones as an
integral part.
The aims of the study are twofold: (1) to identify the principal problems encountered by most
learners in order to discover the causes of recurrent error patterns and, (2) to find out how a
multi-sensory approach, which in this study was called the Somatically Enhanced Approach
(SEA), might influence the acquisition of Mandarin prosody in these areas.
The experiment involved 22 adult Australian students studying Mandarin in the first three
months of language training. The experimental component of the study consisted of an
evaluation of two groups of students&#65533; oral conversations. The two groups of students were
divided into a control group and an experimental group. The control group was trained in a nonmulti-
sensory but communicative approach in 2001 and 2002. Their results are compared with
those of a test group and with a group of students trained in the multi-sensory communicative
approach (SEA) in 2003 and 2004. The test materials consisted of short dialogues that were
likely to occur in everyday communication. Data was collected from each group, once during
the first half of the first semester of study in each year.
The findings of the experiment were that the order of difficulty of the four Mandarin tones was
found to be similar for both the experimental and control groups of students. However, the order

of difficulty differed from what has been reported by previous researchers. This suggests that
the input and the type of task used to collect data might exert a significant influence on the
learning of tones. In other words, the performance of subjects in the dialogues suggests that in
the initial stages of learning, the major cause of errors was first language (L1) interference
rather than the physical "difficulty" of articulating particular phonemes (or any features of
Universal Grammar). Therefore, by using a multi-sensory approach (SEA) to the learning of
Mandarin, it may be possible to considerablly lessen the influence of learners&#65533; L1 from the
outset.
Finally, a number of suggestions for improving the teaching of Mandarin prosody are made and
future research directions outlined. Some salient suggestions for teaching of Mandarin prosody
that arise from the research are:
(1) To use movement and gesture in the early stages of learning to enhance students&#65533; perception
and production of Mandarin. This approach provides students with useful memory tools for
learning both in class and in self-accessed learning;
(2) To teach Tone 3 not as a full Tone 3 but as a low level tone. This should not be done solely
through a simple verbal explanation but through a combination of movement and gesture,
provision of visual and auditory feedback and a large amount of exposure and perception
training so that Tone 3 is recognised as a low level tone rather than a full Tone 3. By so doing
confusion is reduced between the various realizations of Tone 3 during the initial learning
stages; and
(3) To caution students about the common error patterns caused by interference from their L1.
This should be supplemented with opportunities for students to observe their own production of
Mandarin and then experience how physically they can find ways of reducing the interference.
A qualitative analysis of interview and question data obtained from this research also revealed
that the extensive use of computer enhanced language learning and SEA work well together, not
only efficiently conditioning students to the phonology of Mandarin, but dramatically changing
students' strategies in learning and increasing their learning opportunities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mandarin prosody</field><field name="subject">Madarin language</field><field name="subject">second language learning</field><field name="subject">Somatically Enhanced Approach</field><field name="subject">SEA</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">multi-sensory learning</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060725.120903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological and cultural factors related to methodologies to Hanoi Foreign Languages Teachers' College students</field><field name="creator">Pham, Khai Hoan</field><field name="description">With the increasing contact between Vietnam
and English speaking countries and the growing demand
for foreign language professionals in the last decades,
the teaching of foreign languages, especially English,
has gained considerable prominence in Vietnamese
education. However, English has been taught in Vietnam
for a relatively short time, there are significant
deficiencies in this area. If these deficiencies are
to be addressed then methodology is a crucial variable
worthy of examination.
Many of the EFL teaching (Teaching English
as a Foreign Language) methods developed in the last
twenty years are unfamiliar to a great number of the
Vietnamese teachers, although they may be introduced
to Vietnam in the near future. In this study a historical
overview of language teaching development is provided.
Since language teaching methods are products of
Western experience, a scrutiny of their relevance
to the Vietnamese teaching situation is necessary. In
particular it is important to focus on the psychological
and cultural appropriateness of different methods to
the Vietnamese settings. A number of most crucial
psychological issues such as the learner's motivation,
aptitude, personality and learning style are discussed
together with some social and cultural influences
which may affect the learner's psychological attributes,
The study also provides a specific investigation of
the psychological attributes of Vietnamese students
and a number of cultural problems faced by this type
of learners in their English learning process. Finally
some practical, though tentative, suggestions are made

English is one of the most important qualifications of a
foreign trade executive who needs English as a means of
communicating with English speaking people in various
business activities. At present, the responsibility for
training students of commerce mainly rests with Hanoi Foreign Trade College. English language teaching in
general, and the teaching of speaking skills in particular

with designing a communicative syllabus for the teaching

The term gazumping refers to a practice by which a vendor accepts a purchaser's offer to purchase land or property, and before exchanging contracts, withdraws from the existing agreement in order to accept a higher price from another purchaser.
This thesis proceeds on the assumption that gazumping is an undesirable practice, particularly from the prospective purchaser' perspective. The practice of gazumping initially boomed in a volatile property market with constantly rising house prices and where demand exceeded supply. A purchaser who believes he or she has secured the purchase of his or her desired property may suffer emotional stress and significant costs which cannot be recovered when the vendor reneges on his or her agreement.
The thesis notes that gazumping occurs at the pre-contractual stage in the sale of property because there is no legally binding relationship before the formal exchange of contracts. The thesis posits that the existing law in various Australian jurisdictions offers inadequate protection to prospective purchasers of property. The thesis examines the inadequacy of existing legal doctrines and remedies in addressing the problem of gazumping at the pre-contractual stage and arrives at the conclusion that existing legal doctrine is inadequate. The thesis notes legislative and other measures in response to gazumping in Australia and other common law jurisdictions and concludes that these too were inadequate in not going far enough to eliminate or reduce gazumping. The competing merits of these approaches are considered.
The thesis establishes that the solution to gazumping lies in an early protection of the purchaser&#65533;s interest in land. This is because as soon as an agreement is enforceable the purchaser acquires an equitable interest and in the event of any breach of the agreement by the vendor, the purchaser, as a general rule, can obtain either damages or specific performance.

The thesis raises seven key recommendations for law reform aimed to minimise the occurrence of gazumping and to provide the purchaser with tools against the practice of gazumping. It considers that the recommendations can minimise the undesirable practice of gazumping where the current law is inadequate and also achieve several other objectives.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gazumping</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">pre-registration rights</field><field name="subject">land sales</field><field name="subject">contracts</field><field name="subject">property market</field><field name="subject">pre-contract deposit</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060725.124549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Herbage production modelling and assessment in the arid rangelands of Central Australia</field><field name="creator">Hobbs, Trevor J.</field><field name="description">The management and sustainable use of Central Australian rangelands for
livestock production and conservation requires improved knowledge of the
temporal and spatial distribution of primary production in this region. To provide
such information, this thesis investigated methods that could rapidly and efficiently
estimate regional herbage biomass production in these arid landscapes. Two
different approaches were examined, using (1) ground-based or (2) satellite-based
data sources.
Soil moisture and herbage growth data were collected over several growth
seasons and five landscape types in Central Australia, and the data used to develop
a model of soil moisture balance and herbage production for the region. The
model has few parameters and only requires inputs of rainfall and potential
evaporation to predict daily soil moisture and plant growth. Moisture loss in the
0-500 mm soil profile was modelled using a negative exponential function that
depends on available soil moisture and is driven by potential evaporation. The
growth of herbage, whilst soil moisture is above wilting point, is a linear function
of actual evapotranspiration, with the decay of plant material represented by a
logistic curve through time.
Soil moisture, herbage biomass and species composition assessments made
at hectare and square kilometre scales at four locations within Central Australia
were examined to determine if a small sample area could be used to accurately
describe the soil and plant conditions at a landscape scale. Moisture levels of the
0-200 and 0-500 mm soil profiles from nine samples were analysed for the
beginning and conclusion of a growth season, whilst herbage biomass and species
composition from 50 samples were compared at the end of the growth season.
Results suggest that mean soil moisture levels determined in a 1 ha area are
comparable with mean values in the surrounding 1 km2 area. Herbage biomass
and species richness for a square kilometre can be assessed at a hectare site for
some landscape types, but a larger sampling area (&gt; 1 ha) is recommended for
most rangeland assessments.
Satellite data (NOAA-11) were examined for their potential application in
assessing primary productivity in Central Australia. Several image correction
techniques were tested to minimise the adverse effects of atmospheric
contamination and illumination. Two measures of atmospheric moisture: (1)
radiosonde data and (2) temperature differences between bands 4 and 5 of the
NOAA satellite (split-window) were used to explain variations in NOAA-11
normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) on inert desert sites. The splitwindow
approach provided the best single factor relationship (r2=0.63) and, when
combined with scattering angle (illumination) effects, up to 81% of the variation
in NDVI data could be explained.
Field measurements of herbage biomass were correlated with four growth
indices derived from NOAA-11 NDVI data. The influence of preflight and sensor
degradation calibrations of Bands 1 and 2, and atmospheric correction techniques
were also tested. Correlations between temporal sums of NDVI and herbage
biomass data were relatively poor (r2&lt;0.42) and unsuitable for herbage
assessment in Central Australia. However, correlations between atmospherically corrected
and background-adjusted maximum NDVI data and observed herbage
biomass were strong (r2=0.91), that will allow primary production in the arid
rangelands of Central Australia to be assessed rapidly and efficiently using

surveys for stream-breeding frogs in the montane forests of south-eastern Australia.
Areas with suitable climate for some of these species were first determined by
bioclimatic modelling. Landscape and habitat preferences were then determined for the
four species commonly found in far East Gippsland, along with an assessment of survey
techniques from which effective survey protocols were developed.
The climate of localities at which five stream-breeding species had been previously
found was modelled using BIOCLIM, and maps of the predicted potential distributions
having similar climate were developed. Litoria phyllochroa was found to occur in
coastal to alpine areas from Melbourne to Nowra, and potentially further inland, in areas
with relatively low temperatures and low summer rainfall. Litoria lesueuri had a
slightly larger known and predicted distribution, covering a wide range of values for the
temperature and precipitation parameters. Both species had predicted areas inland from
Melbourne and the Blue Mountains where they had never been recorded, probably
largely due to land clearing. The rare Heleioporus australiacus had a slightly more
northerly distribution, closer to the coast and adjacent ranges from Central Gippsland to
just north of Sydney, with a generally warmer climate and large range of average annual
precipitation values. Litoria citropa occupies an even narrower area along the coast,
extending slightly further north again, with a climatic profile of few extremes but with
relatively high rainfall particularly in summer. The rare Mixophyes balbus had a more
northerly known and predicted narrow range along the NSW coast, just extending into
Victoria and Queensland, characterised by the subtropical influence of higher summer
rainfall. The southern extension into far East Gippsland appears to have an extreme
sub-climate, and is hence considered highly susceptible to climate change. Future
monitoring sites for these species can now be systematically chosen to include their full
climatic range, so that any negative effects of climate change on amphibian populations
may have a greater chance of detection.
Four species were found commonly enough in the far East Gippsland study area for
more detailed study - the three stream-breeding specialist species, L. phyllochroa,
L citropa, and L. lesueuri, along with Crinia signifera which was not restricted to
streams but commonly found along them. Three species, L. phyllochroa, L citropa and
L. lesueuri, were not found at the few higher altitudes sites on the Errinundra Plateau,
however they may have been restricted by habitat requirements other than altitude.
Litoria phyllochroa was otherwise widespread, but preferred larger in-stream pools and
backwaters for breeding with overhanging vegetation for perch and call sites. The other
three species preferred stream reaches characterised by wide bedrock outcrops and
associated wide break in the tree canopy, which may allow their preferred perch sites on
rocky substrates to retain heat after sunset. Litoria lesueuri tadpoles were found in both
unconnected and connected pools, and the common association of this species with
bedrock outcrops may explain its range being largely restricted to granitic substratum
where these outcrops mostly occurred. Litoria citropa preferred reaches with bedrock
and boulder outcrops, although frogs used both rocky and vegetative substrates as perch
sites, with tadpoles caught in both unconnected pools and backwaters. Crinia signifera
tadpoles were mostly restricted to unconnected pools, with frogs generally only detected
within or very close beside these.
Habitat models varied in their predictive ability, from 67.5% for L. phyllochroa frogs to
92.7% for L. lesueuri tadpoles. Models developed from normally-distributed habitat
variables by discriminant function analysis were generally more predictive than those
from logistic regression analysis. The occurrence of frogs and tadpoles of
L. phyllochroa, L. citropa and L. lesueuri can be predicted by the measurement of five
habitat variables along a 50m reach: average width between the banks, average channel
width, an average of the maximum depth of channel cross-sections along the reach,
channel slope, and proportion of the stream length as pools. The occurrence of
C. signifera along reaches can be predicted with the additional measurement of the
proportion of the banks covered in ferns, the maximum cross-sectional channel depth
along the reach, and the number of unconnected pools.
Several different techniques for surveying frogs were compared for the four species
commonly found along the streams. Probability of detection models were derived for
each species for each technique, which allowed calculation of the statistical confidence
of detecting a species that actually occurred at a site for any given number of surveys.
For transect-based techniques, models were also developed which allowed
determination of the minimum number of surveys required without detecting a species
to be 95 percent statistically confident that the species did not occur there, for various
transect lengths. This level of confidence can be obtained for the four common species
by four surveys using the reliable night encounter technique along 500m stream
transects, during the period from Ocotber to March, with air temperatures above 10&#176;C.
The application of habitat models to select favourable 50m reaches for survey also
generally improved the detectability of each species.
Timer-activated tape recorders, which automatically recorded the calls of frogs for many
consecutive nights at a site, were very efficient at detecting all species except the quietcalling
L. lesueuri. Night encounter surveys along stream transects detected all species
from a reasonable effort, and dip-netting for tadpoles was also effective for most
species. Active visual encounter surveys were less reliable, and day encounter surveys
detected few frogs but provided some additional data when other activities were being
performed along the streams.
The findings of this study have important implications for future amphibian surveys and
monitoring undertaken in East Gippsland and the south coast of New South Wales. If
the standardised survey techniques recommended by this study are used in
Environmental Impact Assessments, their results can be objectively assessed and
defended. The use of habitat modelling and improvement in survey reliability can also
be used more efficiently to find sites with populations suitable for monitoring. The
likely amount of effort required by a long-term monitoring program can also be
determined so as to largely overcome daily variations in the detection of each species.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">survey protocols</field><field name="subject">stream-breeding frogs</field><field name="subject">Far East Gippsland</field><field name="subject">habitat modelling</field><field name="subject">montane forests</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060725.150009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fraud against governments in Australia : reviewing rational and political decision making processes</field><field name="creator">Holmes, Mark Edward</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rational decision making</field><field name="subject">political decision making</field><field name="subject">fraud</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">governments</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060725.150531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a syllabus for teaching reading comprehension to Vietnamese students of interpreting and translating at the Hanoi Foreign Languages College</field><field name="creator">Hong, Le Thi</field><field name="description">Much research on reading comprehension has been done with native readers
in mind; however, this study deals with reading comprehension problems for
non-native readers - Vietnamese students of English.
The study begins with a description of the interpreters and translators
training at the Hanoi Foreign Languages College. Based on the aims and
objectives of the training course the study emphasises the importance of
teaching reading skills to Vietnamese interpreter and translator students in
the first, second and third year.
To deal with this problem, the study overviews relevant theoretical issues of
reading skills presented in current literature with the purpose of relating
these to the realities of teaching reading in a particular context in Vietnam.
The study then looks at the main problems of teaching reading skills in the
English Interpreter Department at the Hanoi Foreign Languages College.
Focus has been placed on the analysis of some difficulties encountered by
Vietnamese students reading English in an attempt to answer the pertinent
question 'Why is it difficult for Vietnamese students to read English?'
Consequently, the study considers ways in which the teaching of reading
skills to Vietnamese students of interpreting and translating may be
improved. The study is also concerned with the selection and development of
materials and then proposes a reading syllabus in order to promote more
rapid and efficient progress in the teaching of reading skills.
Finally, the writer makes some suggestions about how to improve the

The social background and the problems of teaching and learning
English in Vietnamese high schools are discussed, including the
students' goals in learning English in high schools; the teachers'
qualifications and the methods of teaching commonly used; the
coursebooks and how they are used; learning facilities, and the
attitudes and policy decisions of education authorities.
To develop effective solutions to these problems, it is
necessary also to know the background to teaching and learning
English in Hanoi Foreign Languages Teachers' College.
In-service training is of vital importance in the education of
all nations. A review of what other people have done in this field
is included with particular reference to the problems which are
relevant to the situation in Vietnam. Given the constraints of
funding and work procedures, a short full-time in-service course
would be the most practicable for the Vietnamese situation.
A survey of the needs of high school teachers in their
professional development has been carried out and is discussed in
relation to the priorities to be given to various components of an
in-service syllabus. The priorities were found to be: to improve
the language, teaching techniques and awareness of a communicative
approach to teaching and learning language of high school teachers
in Vietnam.
These priorities having been identified, the study considers:
iv
1 - the syllabus model.
2 - the development of specific goals.
3 - the development of content.
4 - possible modifications of the syllabus in the future.
The solution to the problem of professional development must
take into account not only the work of internationally known
authorities, but also the needs of Vietnamese teachers. The

The study considers the need to improve the teaching of

made recommendations for the improvement of primary mathematics
teaching and the opinions and findings of mathematics
educators. The study examines the state of the art of
in-service models and examines those models previously used.
The study notes the failings of the in-service models past and
present and examines elements within these models which have
proven to be beneficial albeit in part. Throughout the study
particular attention is given to recent studies concerned with
implementing and sustaining change.
The model designed for the in-service of the primary mathematics
teacher, MINC (Mathematics In-service Network Course) is based
on an examination of models past and present. Components and
provisions that have met with success in these models were
included in the design.
The in-service model developed and described in this study
includes four major components input from course leaders and
teachers, reflection, feedback and the opportunity for teachers
to work with others from the same school and neighbouring
schools (networking).
A major section of the study examines the responses of
participants to an evaluation questionnaire given at the
completion of the first in-service course, MINC 1 and the
second, MINC 2.
Data collected from the responses of participants to the
questionnaire were analysed to see if there were differences in
responses from teachers based on such factors as sex, the MINC
network, the level to which participants had studied
mathematics, the year level they taught and expressed confidence
in teaching mathematics.
In conclusion, the study reflects on the evaluation of the

S.</field><field name="description">Aims of the Study : 
This report aims to describe the central issues confronting
education systems today, with reference to contemporary
developments in the Australian Capital Territory, drawing
attention, specifically, to the problems of Special
Education sub-systems and tracing the development of this
sub-system in the A.C.T.
Background to the Report :
Bureaucratic practices and role perceptions persist in
systems which are attempting to solve problems emerging
from increasingly demanding environments which are growing
rapidly in complexity and turbulence.
Where these practices are related to the servicing aspect
of the organization they may increase efficiency in those
functions which can be subjected to mechanistic control.
Dysfunction can be avoided if safeguards are built into the
organizational framework to allow adequate communication,
co-ordination and co-operation in servicing the needs of
those in primary roles.
Special Education, Guidance and Counselling Services were
established at a time when bureaucratic administrative
practices prevailed in educational systems. Closed system
structures were deemed then to be appropriate organizations
for mechanistic approaches to human problems.
This approach was apparent in the categorization of educational
needs on aetiological and psychometric data. The
growth of Special Education classes, aimed at securing homogeneous
target populations for specialised programmes,
characterises this period.
The persistence of the bureaucratic model in an inappropriate
environment has resulted in the fixing of certain aspects
of the primary task and role. Further, it has placed
some important aspects of decision making, namely, needs
assessment and the determination of criteria for child
placement as well as the actual placement of children, outside
the scope of the school in the centrally administered
sub-systems of Guidance and Special Education. This has
resulted in instances of teachers in mainstream classes in
the A.C.T. exhibiting reluctance to propose children for
special placement at a time when the beneficial effects
of specialized interventions could be maximised. It has also helped to institutionalise prevalent views of
lock-step educational programming. This creates dilemmas for teachers as they attempt to integrate children who are
developmentally or educationally retarded as judged by this
criterion, and it presents barriers to the availability
of specialized technical assistance to children with
learning disabilities placed in mainstream classes.
The climate of education in the A.C.T. is one of increasing
openness. In mainstream education parents, teachers,
principals and personnel within the Schools Office are
beginning to assume new roles' as a result of confrontations
and compromises. This process is also evidenced in the
Schools Authority's Council and Standing Committees. This
level of openness is not yet discernible in Special Education
which in many ways appears to be operating in a closed
system.
Outline of the Study :
The ensuing chapters expand these main points in the following
manner:
Chapter 2 describes major issues faced by education systems
today as they attempt to develop organizational structures
to maximise technological developments and pursue goals
congruent with modern educational philosophies. It draws
attention to contemporary developments in the A.C.T. with
preference to problems faced by Special Education sub-systems.
Chapter 3 traces the development of Special Education
services in the A.C.T. It refers to the initial impetus
and growth shared by all elements within the larger system.
(i) up to the establishment of the Interim A.C.T.
Schools Authority;
(ii) Special Education since the establishment of the
Interim Authority.
Chapter if enumerates the main factors which have led to the
dissipation of this impetus and describes some new
initiatives and trends which have emerged.
Chapter 5 overviews theoretical, organizational and technical
solutions which have been proposed to overcome the problems
identified in Chapter 2 and shared by all systems as they
become increasingly open to rapidly changing environments,
and indicates some principles on which a sound policy for
Special Education in the A.C.T. might be based.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">bureaucratic model</field><field name="subject">administrative practices</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060726.165542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biogeochemical techniques for environmental monitoring and mineral exploration : a case study at the Temora Gold Mine</field><field name="creator">Huang, Xiaoyan</field><field name="description">Biogeochemistry has been utilized successfully in Australia as a regional or fellow-up
geochemical exploration techniques in the arid terranes of Australia. This Master's
study is based on the biogeochemistry approach, which relies on the chemical analysis
of plant tissues to obtain information on the geology and geochemistry of the
underlying rocks. The project involved the systematic sampling and chemical analysis
of plant materials and the supporting soils to establish the suitability of using
particular tree species for environmental monitoring and their potential as a sample
medium in geochemical exploration in the vicinity of the Temora Gold Mine, NSW,
Australia.
Working on 168 plant tissues (leaves, twigs and bark) in 54 plants species from 8
families at the three sites of background area, mineralized area and tailings area, and
54 supporting soil samples from three strata of 0-5 cm, 20-30 cm, and 30-40 cm,
found that there was a good agreement between soil geochemistry and plant
geochemistry on the result of a strong geochemical association between Au and As.
The As-Au pattern was suggestive of the presence of the Au-As mineralization.
Black cypress pine (Callitris endlicheri) LEAVES show a higher ratio of Asminjn/Aumin
in the mineralized area than ASbkg/Aubkg in the background area, up to 7 times. The
research finding suggests that the LEAVES of Black cypress pine (Callitris
endlicheri) have a potential to be a biogeochemical sample medium as better
indicators for Au. Golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha) BARK and Yellow box (E.
melliodora) BARK appear to be better indicators for Au but more research is required.
The most occurrence of anomalies of As, Au, Sb, Cu and Fe were found in Red box
(E. polyanthemos) BARK. Red box (E. polyanthemos) BARK may have the potential
to be an Au indicator in the area when Red box (E. polyanthemos) is present.
Results on test-tolerant plants show that Eucalyptus species: Red box (E.
polyanthemos), Coral gum (E. torquata), and Yellow box (E. melliodora) have a
higher rate of uptake trace elements from the tailings soils. Therefore, Eucalyptus
family generally adapted to metal-rich soils and can be used as cleaning-up indicators
and environmental monitors for the tailings area of metal contaminated soils in the

searching on the Internet using middleware search agents, namely, Personalised Search
Agents (PSA). The PSA acts between users and search engines, and applies new and existing
techniques to mine and exploit relevant and personalised information for users.
Much research has already been done in developing personalising filters, as a middleware
technique which can act between user and search engines to deliver more personalised results.
These personalising filters, apply one or more of the popular techniques for search result
personalisation, such as the category concept, learning from user actions and using metasearch
engines. By developing the PSA, these techniques have been investigated and
incorporated to create an effective middleware agent for web search personalisation.
In this thesis, a conceptual model for the Personalised Search Agent is developed,
implemented by developing a prototype and benchmarked the prototype against existing web
search practices. System development methodology which has flexible and iterative
procedures that switch between conceptual design and prototype development was adopted as
the research methodology.
In the conceptual model of the PSA, a multi-layer client server architecture is used by
applying generalisation-specialisation features. The client and the server are structurally the
same, but differ in the level of generalisation and interface. The client handles personalising
information regarding one user whereas the server effectively combines the personalising
information of all the clients (i.e. its users) to generate a global profile. Both client and server
apply the category concept where user selected URLs are mapped against categories. The
PSA learns the user relevant URLs both by requesting explicit feedback and by implicitly
capturing user actions (for instance the active time spent by the user on a URL). The PSA also
employs a keyword-generating algorithm, and tries different combinations of words in a user
search string by effectively combining them with the relevant category values.
The core functionalities of the conceptual model for the PSA, were implemented in a
prototype, used to test the ideas in the real word. The result was benchmarked with the results
from existing search engines to determine the efficiency of the PSA over conventional

searching. A comparison of the test results revealed that the PSA is more effective and
efficient in finding relevant and personalised results for individual users and possesses a
unique user sense rather than the general user sense of traditional search engines.
The PSA, is a novel architecture and contributes to the domain of knowledge web information
searching, by delivering new ideas such as active time based user relevancy calculations,
automatic generation of sensible search keyword combinations and the implementation of a
multi-layer agent architecture. Moreover, the PSA has high potential for future extensions as

science concept forces. A government preschool in the A.C.T. was the
setting for the study.
The research methodology consisted of pre and post interviews
conducted before and after a teaching sequence using an interactive
approach to teaching science (Biddulph and Osbome 1984). Interviews
were audio taped, work samples were kept and lessons and discussions
were audio taped during the teaching sequence.
This study examined three factors associated with young children's
understandings of the science concept forces. First, it documented
young children's understandings prior to any formal teaching in this
area. It was found that most children did hold views about the areas of
forces such as pushes and pulls, inertia, friction and gravity. Some of
these views are generally recognised by the scientific community as
being scientifically correct answers.
Second, this study sought to reveal if these prior views were changed
or reached a higher conceptual level after the experience of a three
week interactive teaching sequence on forces. It was found that in all
cases changes in language indicating higher level understandings, the
use of scientific terms and more detailed responses indicated that it
was possible and relevant at the early childhood level to teach the
concepts of forces.
A third aspect of this study sought to identify teaching strategies which
would effectively teach forces to very young children.
It became clear in this study that as young children already have views
about the concepts of forces it is possible to build on these views with
correct scientific knowledge and thus empower the young child in an
area of science which research has indicated may cause problems for
older learners.
It is therefore proposed that early childhood is a crucial time for
teaching correct science concepts in the area of forces.
This thesis has shown that young children, particularly those 4-5 years old, have
already formed views of forces, some scientifically correct and it is proposed that
building on this existing knowledge will empower the child in later learning in the
areas of physics and mechanics.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science concept forces</field><field name="subject">science education</field><field name="subject">preschools</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">physics</field><field name="subject">mechanics</field><field name="subject">early childhood</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060731.131000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proposed EAP and ESP syllabuses for Vietnamese students going to study overseas</field><field name="creator">Ngoc Hung, Nguyen</field><field name="description">The increasing number of economic and cultural aid programmes for
Vietnam to reconstruct its war-torn economy in recent years from the
United Nations Development Programme and other international and
governmental organizations has created a great demand for English language teaching and learning in Vietnam. The language problems
that face Vietnamese scientists and technicians working in these aid
programmes have been a major concern of many educational
institutions in Vietnam and a reason for the author of this Study
Report to take up this study.
Chapter one of this study covers major stages of development of the
teaching of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and various factors
that influence the teaching of ESP.
Chapter two discusses some current issues in the teaching of ESP in
Vietnam with special reference to course organization, syllabus and
material design at the Hanoi Foreign Language College. It also
points out some misunderstanding and misconception in the teaching
of English to Vietnamese scientists and technicians.
Chapter three looks at major language problems that Vietnamese
students meet when they go to study at different colleges or
universities in English speaking countries. A close investigation
will be carried out over a number of Vietnamese veterinary doctors
studying at the university of Queensland in Australia.
Chapter four is concerned with the selection of suitable syllabus
models for ESP/EAP courses at HFLC and also attempts to work out
appropriate syllabuses for EAP courses for Vietnamese students going
to study overseas.
The final chapter suggests some further considerations for
organizing ESP/EAP courses at HFLC especially for material
production, ESP teacher training and ESP testing.
It is hoped that this Study Report will give language teachers in
the ESP Department at the Hanoi Foreign Languages College a clearer
picture of what ESP is all about and provide some guidelines for
successful organization of teaching ESP and EAP to Vietnamese
students.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">English for Specific Purposes</field><field name="subject">ESP</field><field name="subject">Hanoi Foreign Language College</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060731.132843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Errors in English by Vietnamese adult students</field><field name="creator">Hung, Vu</field><field name="description">This study is mainly concerned with the common errors
Vietnamese adult students make in learning English as a
second/foreign language.
Using the tools of contrastive analysis and error analysis,
the researcher decribes and examines certain areas of similarity
and difference between English and Vietnamese on some
grammatical aspects, and then analyses the errors made by the
Vietnamese students in two different learning contexts and at
different levels of proficiency.
This studies consists of six chapters :
Chapter 1 introduces the position of English in Vietnam at
present, raises the problems encountered in the teaching and
learning of English in Vietnam, and states why this study is
necessary.
Chapter 2 is the summary of the main theories of second
language acquisition and some of the principal studies of
Vietnamese grammar.
Chapter 3 discusses the techniques of contrastive analysis
and error analysis, which provide bases for the comparative
study in Chapter 4 and the error analysis in Chapter 5.
In Chapter 4, a contrastive study is undertaken of eleven
aspects of English and Vietnamese grammar, which serves as
the basis for the discussion in Chapter 5.
Chapter 5 presents an analysis of the common errors
Vietnamese students make in two different learning contexts in
Vietnam and in Australia. It also discusses the various strategies
the students use in order to achieve language proficiency.
Finally, some conclusions concerning the attitude towards,
and the treatment of, errors are mentioned in Chapter 6. It also
provides suggestions for further study in the subject area.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">adult students</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">error analysis</field><field name="subject">grammar</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060731.141007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compensation for Commonwealth Government employees 1901-1980 : an admnistrative history</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Ronald William</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workers' compensation</field><field name="subject">employees</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Government</field><field name="subject">administrative efficiency</field><field name="subject">Woodhouse Committee</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060731.142102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The conservation and demography of the Southern Corroboree Frog (Pseudophryne corroboree)</field><field name="creator">Hunter, David</field><field name="description">The documented decline of amphibian populations over the past two decades has increased
attention towards amphibian conservation. Much of this attention has been focused on testing
hypotheses as to the causal factors of these declines, however providing convincing data to
support any of these hypotheses has proved difficult. The testing of these hypotheses and the
implementation of endangered species recovery programs has been restricted by a lack of
knowledge of the ecology and population demography of amphibian species that have
suffered dramatic declines.
This thesis presents aspects of the research phase of the recovery program for the Southern
Corroboree Frog, Pseudophryne corroboree, a species that declined to very low numbers
during the early 1980's. In particular, this research aimed to determine the distribution,
abundance, population dynamics and demography of this rare species. A complete
reassessment of the conservation status of P. corroboree was undertaken and the nature of the
persistence of this species across the landscape was analysed. Temporal trends in abundance
and its relationship with population size were also investigated. Early life-history
survivorship and recruitment to metamorphosis were studied at the scale of individual nest
sites and populations, and the adult male population age structure and annual mortality were
investigated using skeletochronology.
The shout/response survey technique was used to survey and monitor the number of breeding
male P. corroboree during this study. This method was found to provide consistent results
when the surveys were conducted over a short (two week) period during the peak breeding
season in January. Neither time of day, nor the number of males present at a pool, was found
to influence the level of responsiveness of male P. corroboree to the shout/response
technique. Variation in the number of responding males to the shout/response technique
through the breeding season, assessed at a single site over two seasons, was unimodal with the
peak responding period occurring during the last two weeks of January during both the 1998
and the 1999 breeding seasons.
A systematic survey covering 213 sites across the entire historic distribution of P. corroboree
found this species to be persisting at 79 sites. The majority of these sites were in the northwestern
portion of the species former range, around the Jagungal Wilderness area, while no
extant sites were found in the south-eastern portion of the species former range in the Smiggin
Holes and Perisher Blue ski resorts area. The overall abundance of males at persistent sites
was extremely low, with 92 percent of sites having fewer than ten responding males. Only
one site was found to support greater than fifty responding males. A logistic regression
analysis found the persistence of P. corroboree to be associated with increased number of
pools within a site, decreased distance to nearest extant population and geographic position
(latitude and longitude) in the landscape. While annual variation was observed in the number
of breeding males for individual sites, there was no overall trend for an increase or decrease in
the number of males, regardless of population size. The average annual extinction rate for
local populations was five percent during this study, with those populations becoming extinct
having very few breeding males (between one and three) during the previous season.
Embryonic and tadpole survivorship was monitored for individual nests at three sites across
three years. Recruitment to metamorphosis for P. corroboree was characterised by high
variation in survivorship between nest sites, populations and years, while overall recruitment
for nest sites was skewed towards lower survivorship. Average nest survivorship to
metamorphosis across all sites and years was ten percent but the skewed nature of this
survivorship meant that the majority of nest sites attained very low or no survivorship. The
low proportion of nest sites that did attain high survivorship provided the greatest contribution
to overall recruitment. The levels of embryonic and tadpole mortality observed in this study
would be providing a considerable contribution to the regulation of current population sizes.
The greatest level of early life-history mortality was observed during the late autumn/winter
egg and tadpole stage, with high survivorship during the summer and early autumn egg stage
and the post-winter tadpole stage. The estimated sex ratio for seven populations, based on the
number of eggs within male nest sites, indicated that for most populations, regardless of
population size, there was a greater proportion of females to males. In general, the estimated
sex ratio of smaller populations showed greater annual variation and had a lower average
number of females to males than the single large population.
Tadpole surveys conducted across remnant populations during both 1998 and 1999 found
recruitment to metamorphosis to be very low for the majority of populations. A third of all
populations during both years attained no recruitment to metamorphosis, with those
populations that did attain recruitment typically having fewer than 20 tadpoles. While sites
with more frogs generally recruited more tadpoles, there was no strong relationship between
population size and the number of tadpoles recruited per male at the scale of either pool or
site. There was also no significant difference in recruitment levels between the two years.
Tadpole surveys across breeding pools within the single large population also found very low
tadpole abundance. There was no strong relationship between the number of male frogs at a
pool and the number of tadpoles per male and there was no significant difference in tadpole
abundance between the two years. Based on the low density of males at pools and sites
(typically less than five), and the skewed nature of nest survivorship identified from
monitoring individual nest sites, it seems likely that both deterministic and stochastic factors
are influencing recruitment levels in remnant populations of P. corroboree.
This study determined that adult male P. corroboree could be accurately aged using the
technique of skeletochronology, and this technique was used to determine the adult male
population age structure for three populations. The results indicated that adult male
P. corroboree can reach sexual maturity from metamorphosis in three years, but the majority
of individuals take four years. The oldest individual identified in this study was nine years
old from metamorphosis. The adult male age structure at the single large site showed very
little annual variation, whereas the two smaller populations showed highly pulsed age
structures from one year to the next. The size of adult males was found to be a poor predictor
of age. Annual adult male survivorship, calculated by following cohorts from one year to the
next, was 55 percent. Based on this calculation of annual adult male survivorship, it seems
likely that the initial decline in P. corroboree involved increased levels of adult mortality.
The results of this study indicate that the persistence of. corroboree in the wild is precarious
in the short-term. For this reason, it is recommended that efforts be undertaken to secure this
species ex situ. Attempts to increase population numbers in the wild would greatly benefit
from determining the factor(s) that have caused the decline in this species, however, failure to
do so should not preclude field experimental management aimed at developing technique to
increase the size of remnant populations. This is because it is likely that small population
stochasticity is contributing to the current regulation of population size and it is possible that
the factors that caused the decline in this species cannot be removed from the environment.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amphibian populations</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Southern Corroboree Frog</field><field name="subject">Pseudophryne corroboree</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">Smiggin Holes</field><field name="subject">Perisher Blue</field><field name="subject">tadpoles</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060731.143131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cross-cultural study on the way in which speakers of Vietnamese and speakers of English issue, accept and decline spoken invitations</field><field name="creator">Huong, Dang Thi</field><field name="description">In this field study report, the author investigates behaviour
associated with inviting in order to see if there is any effect on the
language used across cultures due to factors such as status, age,
gender in actual social interactions.
Chapter one gives a brief introduction to the important role of the
English Language in the world in general, and in Vietnam
nowadays in particular, and a review of Teaching Methods which
have been used in Vietnam so far.
Chapter two will deal with the theoretical background, language
competences including linguistic competence, sociolinguistic competence and communicative competence. In addition, speech
act theory , face work, distance, power in relation to status, age
and gender as well as reviews research on the differences between
spoken and written are also discussed.
Chapter three defines the structure of an invite with its social and
cultural characteristics focussing on the natural structure of a
spoken invitation.
Chapter four describes research and data analysis of the issuing,
accepting and declining of spoken invitations used by Vietnamese
speakers of Vietnamese (VSV).
Chapter five contains the data analysis of the issuing, accepting
and declining of spoken invitations used by Australian speakers of
English (ASE).
Chapter six discusses the comparison of Vietnamese and
Australian spoken invitations, the main difference being found in
the use of much more direct forms used in VSV as opposed to more
tentative forms preferred by ASEs. Directness of form, however,
does not reflect a lack of politeness, which is conveyed to a much
larger extent by other prosodic and paralinguistic features.
Chapter seven is a brief cross-cultural investigation of the spoken
invitations of Vietnamese learners speaking English. This shows
up a degree of cross-cultural interference and offers some
implications for the classroom.
Chapter eight contains a summary and conclusion. The results
of the study may suggest that Vietnamese learners of English need
to be taught not only linguistic competence but also communicative
competence with an emphasis on cultural and social factors.
Spoken invitations which really have some function in actual
interactions need to be incorporated in the program for teaching
spoken English.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">invitations</field><field name="subject">linguistic competence</field><field name="subject">sociolinguistic competence</field><field name="subject">communicative competence</field><field name="subject">spoken invitations</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060731.161630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of aspects of educational leadership in a religious teaching order</field><field name="creator">Hurley, C.

religious teaching orders has not been the subject of much research.
This field study examines the criteria by which the Provincial Superior of the Marist Brothers in the Sydney Province of Australia decides
on the appointment of his principals. In order to establish an evaluation
of these criteria, the concept of leadership in general and educational
leadership are first examined as described in literature. From the
literature a model is chosen against which the leadership of the founder
is examined since the spirit of the founder, in this case, Marcellin Champagnat, still pervades the present day members of the order he
established. The beginnings of the work of the Brothers in Australia
were also important as the pioneers brought with them the spirit of
the founder and were responsible for a quality of leadership in difficult
circumstances, a quality which has become a feature of the work of
the Brothers. It is evident that the present provincial superior
is imbued with the spirit of the founder and that he has succeeded
in interpreting the criteria laid down in foundation in terms which
are relevant to education today. Certain constraints and factors, special
to a religious teaching order bring about features of leadership which
are not found in lay schools.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marist Brothers</field><field name="subject">Provincial Superior</field><field name="subject">Sydney Province of Australia</field><field name="subject">educational leadership</field><field name="subject">religious teaching order</field><field name="subject">Marcellin Champagnat</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060731.162220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meeting the need for business English in the new Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Huyen, Tan Thanh</field><field name="description">As a result of the New Economic Reform in Vietnam, the need for more
business people proficient in the English language is constantly growing.
This need requires the Hanoi Foreign Trade College, which is officially
charged with the training of business people for the whole country, to
devise relevant curricula for short courses in Business English.
The purpose of this report is to examine some major theoretical and
practical issues in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and in syllabus
design that can provide course designers at the Hanoi Foreign Trade
College with a deeper insight into the problems essential to the
development of their work.
The report consists of five chapters:
(i) Chapter One is the Introduction. It gives the background to the
study, pointing to changes in Vietnam and the role of the HFTC in
adapting to meet the new need created by these changes.
(ii) Chapter Two deals with the methodology employed in the data
collection and discusses its findings.
(iii) Chapter Three looks at some major theoretical issues in English for
Specific Purposes with a view to applying this theory to the practical
needs for Business English in Vietnam.
(iv) Chapter Four is directly concerned with the planning of the short
courses in Business English for Vietnam which are the central focus
of this study.
(v) Chapter Five is the Summary and contains recommendations for
future development of the proposed short courses.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business English</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Hanoi Foreign Trade College</field><field name="subject">English for Specific Purposes</field><field name="subject">ESP</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060801.105057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Task overlap of librarians and library technicians : a study comparing the duties of librarians class one and library technicians grades two and three in special libraries in Commonwealth Government Departments and Statutory Authorities in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Hyland, Margaret</field><field name="description">The present study attempted to measure the overlap of tasks being
performed by Librarians Class One and Library Technicians Grades Two
and Three in special libraries located in Commonwealth Government
Departments and Statutory Authorities in the ACT. Overlap was also
measured between the two groups in libraries with six or more staff,
since size of library could have affected the results; and between
graduates (those employees with university or college of advanced
education degrees or graduate diplomas in library and information
science), and nongraduates (those without such qualifications).
To measure the overlap, a task list questionnaire was devised based
on task lists utilised in other research studies or which had been
the outcome of professional workshops. Work level guidelines and
position classification standards developed by pertinent Australian
employing authorities and the Library Association of Australia were
also used.
Results suggested that there may be considerable overlap in work
being performed by Librarians Class One and Library Technicians
Grades Two and Three in the nominated libraries. Of the eight
functional areas of library work into which the task list
questionnaire was divided, only two areas, Reference, and Current
Awareness and User Services, resulted in proportions of the groups
tested being assigned the tasks in significantly different
proportions. For the six other functional areas, representing 125 of
the 160 tasks Librarians Class One and Library Technicians Grades Two
and Three performed the same tasks in similar proportions. Testing
for size of library and qualifications of respondents made very
little difference to these results.
Conclusions drawn from the present study are limited because the
questionnaire ignored the level of importance and the time occupied
in completing these tasks. Other constraints occurred in relation to
conclusions which could be made. The questionnaire methodology as
utilised by the present study is more likely to evoke responses to
what is there; and it does not identify what should be done or how
well tasks are performed. The study is limited to special libraries
within Commonwealth Government Departments and Statutory Authorities
and is confined to three levels of staff only, Librarians Class One
and Library Technicians Grades Two and Three.
Despite these limitations, it seems clear that the levels of staff
included in the present study are often assigned tasks on the basis
of what tasks have to be done, rather than with regard to matching
level of task to level of position within the boundaries of the work
level guidelines; and this situation is also true of the larger
libraries with six or more staff.
These results have implications for those involved in educating
professional librarians and library technicians, for the
interpretation given by the profession to the meaning of
professionalism and for staff relations between librarians and
library technicians. Debate by the profession concerning the roles of
librarians and library technicians is an issue demanding urgent
attention.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">librarians</field><field name="subject">library technicians</field><field name="subject">special libraries</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Government Departments</field><field name="subject">Statutory Authorities</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060801.120814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consumer behaviour on the internet : a critical analysis of the extensive decision-making process of online holiday travellers</field><field name="creator">Hyun, Yongho</field><field name="description">Both tourism destination marketing and the characteristics of holiday travellers have
recently undergone radical changes driven by the rapid progress of computer technology. In
particular, the advent of the Internet has had a great impact on holiday travellers as well as
on the development of tourism promotion and distribution channel strategies.
While holiday travellers benefit from the characteristics of Internet use, for example,
unlimited information retrieval, flexible accessibility, and direct interactivity with
destination marketing organizations (DMOs), the Internet provides DMOs with the critical
factor of an increase in operational costs incurred by running all possible online promotional
activities and online distribution channels.
This paper attempted to discover which Internet functions are popularly used by
existing/potential online travellers or which ones are not by testing the Canberra Tourism &amp; Event Corporation (CTEC) web site. As a result, this research intends to provide CTEC with
a way to operate its website cost-effectively, which can also lead to increasing the usage
satisfaction of CTEC web visitors. Online travellers visiting the CTEC website were
surveyed through non-probability self-selected web survey by using segmentation procedure;
two key online travel groups: direct and indirect online access groups.
Based on the research methodology, this study has discovered several findings. Firstly,
CTEC web visitors preferred to use the CTEC website for the purpose of gathering travel
information rather than that of online booking or reservations for travel products on the
CTEC website. Secondly, comprehensive travel information tailor-made to online
individuals was found to be desirable through interactive online activities, while the
multimedia, booking, and comparability function were not significant in helping the CTEC
online visitors choose the travel destination. Based on their preferences for particular
Internet functions, it is evident that web visitors wish to have comprehensive and tailormade
online travel information and interaction with the CTEC. Finally, it was revealed that
the demographics of the CTEC web visitors were very similar to Internet users identified by
previous researchers. Therefore, this study provides insights into website development
strategies.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">holiday travellers</field><field name="subject">online distribution channels</field><field name="subject">Canberra Tourism and Event Corporation</field><field name="subject">CTEC</field><field name="subject">websites</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060801.130043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education planning in the Maldives : a small island state's perspective</field><field name="creator">Ismail, Ibrahim</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the appropriateness of the current secondary school curriculum in the Republic of Maldives within an overall context of
national education and development planning. Emphasis is placed on
access to secondary education by all.
In pursuing this aim, data was gathered on aspects of the economy and
demography of the country as well as government policy on education. Data
was also gathered on student performance in the period 1985&#65533;1992, and
subsequent employment characteristics of graduates.
The framework of analysis adopted for this thesis encompasses the
special problems faced by Small Island States in their efforts to provide
education for their people. Links between education planning and
development planning are explored in depth.
The analysis of the data established that the current system of
education contributes to increasing social inequalities. Further, it was
established that this system cannot be sustained in the long term. It has been
argued in this thesis that this system of education could, in the long term,
contribute to the demise of national and cultural identity. Hence, it has been
argued that the current curriculum is inappropriate for the people of the
Maldives at this juncture.

both the mentally ill and the mentally retarded (i.e. the mentally disordered),
citizens of the Australian Capital Territory.
The study begins by describing the historical background which
has affected current mental health care; the timespan stretches from
the nineteenth century when both the mentally ill and the mentally
retarded were institutionalised in the asylum, to the present time,
with the preferred community centred therapy and 'normalisation' of
the mentally disordered. It is explained that current mental health
theories recommend that the role of the psychiatric hospital (formerly
asylum), should be that of a crisis intervention centre only.
The effects of the carefully framed Lunacy Acts of the 19th
century are explored in relation to civil rights, as well as the
roles played by doctors and lawyers in asylum care.
The development of physical treatments, the emergence of psychiatry
as a discipline, the catalytic effect of World War II and then
the discovery of psychoactive drug therapy culminated in the writing
of the Mental Health Acts of the 1950's. The subsequent shift of
power from lawyers to doctors in the implementing of these Acts is
explained in relation to the civil rights of affected individuals as
is the effect of tensions which still exist between these two professions.
Current mental health care within the ACT is described, and
potential which exists for infringement of the civil rights of the
mentally ill and the mentally retarded is highlighted.
Recent and current frameworks for mental health care are critiqued, and
it is argued that improvement could be made to the latter by developing
a mental health model, in which the need for monitoring
civil rights is stressed.
Against this background, an analysis is made of the ACT Mental Health Ordinance (1981). The need for the new Ordinance is explained,
and the Ordinance is then examined in relation to its effect upon
mental health care in the ACT, and upon civil rights.
In conclusion, a summary is made of the findings of the study,
and inferences are drawn for the future of mental health care and for
civil rights of the mentally disordered in the ACT.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">mentally ill</field><field name="subject">civil rights</field><field name="subject">ACT Mental Health Ordinance</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060801.131221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fine art conservation in the conservation unit of the National Library, Canberra</field><field name="creator">I'ons, Anne Helena</field><field name="description">WORK PROGRAMME FOR THE PAINTING INTERNSHIP 1982,UNDERTAKEN

1. TREATMENT PROJECTS
Four paintings in category 1, requiring urgent conservation
treatment.
The paintings are part of the National Library's Historical
Collection, and reflect differing historical and aesthetic
significance. Technically, the major conservation problems
present in these four paintings represent conditions often
found in aged, neglected and previously restored works of
art. The diversity of treatment procedures required
presented an ideal opportunity for study assessment and
practical application of contemporary conservation methods.
2. CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT
18 miniatures on ivory, held as components of various
collections within the National Library.
A complete survey of the condition of all the miniatures
was undertaken. Treatment proposals were compiled, proposed
and completed.
Detailed reports on all aspects of the conservation work
undertaken on both the paintings and the miniatures is
1
presented with this dissertation.
3. STORAGE PROJECTS
This work centred on the stabilisation of over twenty
paintings, involving reframing techniques, the making of
new stretchers, and correct storage within the Library
compactors. Supervision of the display and hanging of
exhibitions was also undertaken, along with packaging of
material for external exhibitions.
4. GENERAL ASSISTANCE WITH CONSERVATION PROJECTS
This work involved many aspects, from photography, object
survey, consultation with visitors, general laboratory
maintenance, ordering and I.C.C.M. Bulletin production.
During the interim period between painting Conservator
appointments, I was able to maintain the ongoing programme,
treating several category 1 works.
5. VISITS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS, MEETINGS AND CONFERENCES
During the internship, I visited and later worked for, four
months in the Fine Art Conservation Laboratory, of the
Australian War Museum, where I have been appointed as
Assistant Conservator. Visits to other institutions have
included the National Gallery Conservation units, the
National Archives in Mitchell, and the Gallery of N.S.W.,
Sydney.
Meetings attended have included I.C.C.M. functions, the
Museums of Australia Association meetings (I am a member of
that organisation), and the October 1982 Museums Association
2
Conference held in the National Library, Canberra. I
intend visiting Conservation Laboratories in South Africa
during my coming visit in December 1982.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fine art conservation National Library of Australia</field><field name="subject">NLA</field><field name="subject">conservation projects</field><field name="subject">conservation management</field><field name="subject">storage projects</field><field name="subject">treatment projects</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060801.131909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of baby boomer women and their expectations of menopause</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Barbara Ann</field><field name="description">This is a study of a generation of women who are about to enter the
climacteric period of their life, the menopause. Born between the years
1946 and 1956 they have been the object of continuous scrutiny by various
interest groups. Because they are seen to be unique, many acronyms and
titles, the most noted being the 'Baby Boomers' have been attached to
them. The women of this generation have been classed as a Very active'
generation, leaving a clear mark on society and the re-emerging women's
movement. As they near menopause they are approaching a stage that
could be seen as their last reproductive transition. For many women
there is no cultural ritual, nor a single story to guide them through this
period They are however not without advice. The 'big voices' of the
drug companies, the medical system and the media, all tender their
guidance as the dominant voice. These women have been told what to
do by experts throughout their whole lives. It seems 'expert advice' on
their reproductive phases have been penned mostly by men in the
interests of treating, controlling and saving them. Control of their body
remains a key struggle, both physically and linguistically.
The purpose of the research was to study the expectations of this
post-war, Baby Boom generation of menopause. The study shows that
some women have made decisions to embrace non-medical help and
accept menopause as an inevitable transition, while others are willing to
consider medical help to enhance their 'quality of life '. Believing it is
time to look after themselves, it seems many women will take a
pragmatic view and accept medical opinion that the menopause is a
deficiency disease, even if this requires them to become part of the
consumer driven/drug company push for a 'symptom free' menopause.
They wish to remain untroubled and express a willingness to do
whatever they need to fulfil this. Their fervent hope is that the
menopause will not upset their career, family or 'life'. Consequently a
large majority of these women will think about or actively pursue
hormone replacement therapy.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">menopause</field><field name="subject">baby boomers</field><field name="subject">reproductive phases</field><field name="subject">hormone replacement therapy</field><field name="subject">HRT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060801.142823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the relationship between young people's job seeking behaviour, self esteem and their esteem needs</field><field name="creator">James, Narissa</field><field name="description">In this study the relationship between young people's job
seeking behaviour, self-esteem and their esteem needs was
investigated. Young unemployed job seekers attended a four day
personal development workshop (known as Positive Choices).
The design of the study was a pretest-posttest control-group
design. All participants completed a four part questionnaire,
including a demographic data sheet, job seeking behaviour scale,
(revised from Feather &amp; Rowley, 1987 job search scale) esteem
needs questionnaire and the Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory.
The results showed self esteem scores increased for the young job
seekers who participated in the Positive Choices Intervention. A
negative correlation was reported between self-esteem scores and
job seeking behaviour for all participants. In addition the job
seeking behaviour scores increased for the young job seekers after
their participation in the Positive Choices Intervention. In terms of
esteem needs, no differences were reported between esteem needs
for the participant and control groups indicating that the importance
of esteem needs remained unchanged. Furthermore, negative
correlations were found between the length of time the young job
seeker had been unemployed and their self-esteem scores, as well as
between the job seeker's educational attainment and self esteem
scores. The results suggests that changes in job seeking behaviour
is related to changes in the young job seekers' self esteem.
Suggestions for future research is discussed. Implications on
counselling and a model for working with young job seekers is
offered.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">young people</field><field name="subject">job seeking</field><field name="subject">self esteem</field><field name="subject">unemployment</field><field name="subject">Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory</field><field name="subject">Positive Choices Intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060801.150339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The primary school as an emotional arena : a case study in collegial relationships</field><field name="creator">Jarzabkowski, Lucy M.</field><field name="description">The thesis is an exploratory and descriptive study focusing on the emotional
dimensions of collegial relationships in a primary school. The research is timely given
the current pressures to develop cultures of collaboration and shared leadership in
schools today. The study concentrates on the non-classroom work of teachers and
investigates three particular areas of school life: the collegial practices of staff; the
emotional milieu of teachers' work; and the contributions of members towards an
emotionally healthy staff community.
An interpretive tradition has been used in conducting the research, thus giving voice to
the perceptions of research participants about their work. The research was conducted
as an ethnographic case study. Data were gathered largely through participant
observation and interviews. The researcher visited the school on a regular basis
through the course of one school year, averaging over one day per week working in the
school. Eighteen staff members were formally interviewed, the principal and assistant
principal on several occasions. Extensive fieldnotes and interview transcripts were
created and, aided by NVivo, a computer package for the analysis of non-statistical data,
data were broken down into categories and resynthesised to bring to life a picture of the
lived reality of collegiality for staff members in a primary school.
The study adds to new knowledge in several important ways. First, it allows for a
reconceptualisation of teachers' work. It shows how many different practices
contribute to a collegial culture within a primary school and demonstrates how the
social and emotional dimensions of collegiality are significant in the development of
professional relationships. Second, the study develops an understanding of emotional
labour for school personnel and contributes importantly to a broader picture of how
emotional labour can be practiced, particularly for the sake of collegiality. It is posited
that different kinds of emotional labour exist within the school setting, and that
emotional labour in schools may be different from that in some other service
organisations. The study explores bounded emotionality as a cultural practice among
staff, suggesting that it allows expression of emotions about classroom work while at
the same time constrains negative emotional displays so as to build and maintain
community. The study suggests that the principles of bounded emotionality, as they
operate within the primary school, present both benefits and burdens for a collegial
staff, but may encourage an emotionally healthy workplace.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">collegial relationships</field><field name="subject">emotional dimensions</field><field name="subject">professional relationships</field><field name="subject">emotionality</field><field name="subject">emotions</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060801.160123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching adaptive behaviour to 'behaviour problem' high school students : an exploratory study</field><field name="creator">Jasinksi, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to determine whether the
Adaptive Behaviour group intervention effected a greater
immediate positive change on 'poorly adapted' student locus
of control, self esteem, group evaluation and perceived
behaviour than Helping Skills, Relaxation Training or No
Intervention group after eight weeks.
The three independent variables - Adaptive Behaviour, Helping Skills and Relaxation Training Group Interventions
- were devised and led by the Researcher and two school
counsellors respectively.
Measurement of the dependent variables was by the use
of the following instruments pre-test and post-test: Locus
of Control Scale for Children (Nowicki Strickland 1972);
Coopersmith Self Esteem Inventory (Coopersmith, 1982); and
researcher designed questionnaires.
A pre-test post-test group design was used in the
study. The subjects were years 7-9 High School students
identified by Student Year Advisers and the Assistant
Principal Student Welfare as being 'poorly adapted' and
'well adapted' to the school environment. Students were
randomly allocated - in year groups - to the intervention
and control groups.
Results indicated no short term significant positive
change in locus of control for any intervention or
controlgroup; no short term significant positive change in
self esteem for any intervention group; no significant
correlation between locus of control and self esteem scores
for any intervention group; positive pre and post-test
group evaluations for all groups; some positive short term
change in teacher and student perceptions of student
behaviour in regard to all three interventions. In some
cases students' behaviour in the experimental group (Group
A) was perceived more positively by teachers and students.
Some recommendations for further research are:
replication of the study over a longer period of time with
some modification to the experimental programme, the

Island States, the role of the mass media and their
developmental processes began to be examined. This was
of particular interest due to the obvious lack of a
sufficient native media infrastructure to meet the
demands of an indigenous population who were being
introduced to a new world sphere and system.
The main problem of mass media development in the
Pacific lies in the fact that the nations in this area
are still relatively behind in the basic structures of
media participation. They lack technological knowledge
of the various forms of media, the basic training and
skills, and, moreover, the monetary means to address such
deficiencies in the media. The outcome of this
circumstance has been that Pacific media have become
increasingly dependent upon the Western, industrialized
nations such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
Such dependence on these foreign nations has given
rise to the question of 'cultural imperialism'. The
aforementioned countries have a large influence in the
Pacific through the unequal relaying of communication and
cultural products and in the ownership of mass media
agencies. This history of foreign based, imported
culture has manifested itself in increased urbanization,
social disruption, and greater commodity dependence and
consumerism in the Pacific.
This study will therefore be an attempt to analyse
the media development processes of the Pacific by using
Fiji as a case study. The critical analysis will come
from Wallerstein's World System perspective. Further, it
will be shown how Fiji's historical, involvement in the
'capitalist world economy', and her history of racism in
the political and communication aspects of her society
have helped shape her present media system. The
underlying premise of the argument, will be that these
factors have not been beneficial to achieving mass media
development based on self-sufficiency, nor on harmony
between the ethnic groups of Fiji.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Pacific Island States</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">cultural imperialism</field><field name="subject">mass media</field><field name="subject">cultural products</field><field name="subject">Wallerstein</field><field name="subject">World System Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060801.161408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Propaganda and public information campaigns : a case study of the 1991 Australian census communication campaign</field><field name="creator">Jiggins, Stephen</field><field name="description">Jowett and O'Donnell observe that 'there is a clear revival of interest in
the important role of propaganda in many aspects of modern life, not
necessarily related to international intrigue or military campaigns' (1992, p.
xi). This thesis has examined the 1991 Census communication
campaign (ABS 1991a) for evidence of propaganda intentions and
strategies.
Propaganda is clearly a pejorative term and its application to a particular
campaign could imply a covert attempt at manipulation by the authority
behind the campaign&#65533;the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). As the
author was responsible for the development, implementation and
evaluation of the 1991 Census communication campaign and had
privileged access to a range of sources, a reader might expect detailed
references to internal files which reveal conscious decision-making to
mount a propaganda campaign. This is not the case. An analysis of
the 150 working files associated with the campaign revealed no support
for such a hypothesis; there was no evidence of decision-making with the
intent of implementing propaganda strategies. Similarly, during interviews
with senior ABS managers, these managers categorically rejected the
notion that the Bureau conducted a propaganda campaign and pointed
to the fact that all procedures were cleared through both the Federal
Parliament and the Privacy Commissioner.
The hypothesis explored by this thesis is that despite this lack of
conscious direction, propaganda processes are evident in the way the
ABS conducted the communication campaign for the 1991 Census. The
perspective of the thesis is closely aligned to that of Altheide and Johnson
who locate propaganda as the bridge between 'organisational image
and reality' (1980, p. 4). Altheide and Johnson regard propaganda as an
insidious phenomena based on impression-management through the
'rigorous pursuit of scientifically valid procedures and standards' (1980, p.
229). The end result of this impression-management is that certain 'facts'
are presented to the exclusion of all others. This thesis argues that
impression-management strategies are evident in the way the ABS
conducted the communication campaign for the 1991 Census. The
processes of impression-management are subtle and do not reside in
such sources as internal files. The process operates through the
internalised ethos and corporate values inculcated in the minds of senior
staff within the Bureau and is best conceptualised as a mindset, reflected
in outcomes. I have used the term mindset to cover the process of
converting abstract values into specific guides for action&#65533;fora discussion
of this process see Hall (1977, pp. 69 - 83).
This mindset is well-illustrated by the issue of compulsion&#65533;the obligation
to complete a census form. At one level the ABS procedures are
impeccable: cleared through the federal parliament and the Privacy
Commissioner&#65533;and it is this form of discourse that is documented in
internal files. The procedures do not, however, enable respondents to
make an informed decision about whether the census is compulsory and
about the ramifications for non-compliance. The mindset operating here is
based on the value of the census to the ABS&#65533;the census is good for the
ABS&#65533;it generates revenue and legitimises the role of the organisation.
The thesis presents data which establishes that there is a significant gap
between the organisational image of the census (in the corporate mind of
the ABS) and that perceived by householders. The mindset of the ABS
is clearly evident in the procedures adopted on this issue.
The main finding of this thesis is that many of the processes underlying
the development of the 1991 Census communication campaign were
subtle environmental influences. These reflected the internal dynamics of
the ABS, and its ability as an institution to control the communication
environment through addressing the needs of other major organisations,
such as the media, and the release of selective information to specific
target audiences. In this context, institutional dynamics, more than
decisions by individual managers, influenced the conduct of the campaign.
The process of propaganda, therefore, is implicit in the 1991 Census
rather than explicit&#65533;a distinction, in terms of process, drawn by Pearlin
and Rosenberg (1954) in their examination of propaganda techniques in
institutional advertising.
It should also be acknowledged that whilst the author did have privileged
access to information, there is no information contained in this thesis that
would not be publicly available. The majority of primary sources are
reports published by the ABS or papers delivered by Bureau staff at a
range of fora. Permission was sought from the ABS for assistance in
obtaining access to information and this was readily granted.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Bureau of Statistics</field><field name="subject">ABS</field><field name="subject">census</field><field name="subject">communication campaign</field><field name="subject">propaganda</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060801.162048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Literature in EFL teaching : the application for advanced Chinese learners</field><field name="creator">Shao, Jing-Fen</field><field name="description">This field study report covers three major areas:
1. the general significance of using literature in
advanced Chinese EFL class
2. the approach to literature in the language classes
3. criteria for the selection of texts for advanced
Chinese EFL learners
The general significance of using literature in
advanced EFL classes is that 1) literature has human relevance
in that literature broadens the mind and promotes
personal development; 2) literature provides a useful
vehicle for teaching second language skills; 3) wide
reading in literature will help in developing communicative
competence, because literature provides knowledge about
culture and examples of language in discourse.
In searching for an ideal accroach to incorporating
literature into language teaching, a thematic approach to
Australian literature is proposed, the advantages of which
have been discussed in detail. A sample of a thematic
unit on "images of woman in early Australian literature"
illustrates how to use a thematic approach in China's social
context. This study argues for the inclusion of poetry for
its linguistic and cultural values. A sample lesson on
teaching "The Man from Snowy River" is given.
Finally the study points out that ethical values, linguistic and stylistic appropriateness of the texts,
student interest, and the background knowledge required
should be the main concerns in selecting texts for
advanced Chinese learners. A list of suggested texts in
thematic grouping is given.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">poetry</field><field name="subject">English as a Foreign Language</field><field name="subject">language teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060802.153945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of statistics to the mesoscale study of wind speed and direction in the Canberra region</field><field name="creator">Johnson, M. E.</field><field name="description">The temporal and spatial variability in wind speed and
direction was investigated in a study of the mesoscale wind
fields in the Canberra region. The statistical description of
the winds was based on twelve months of three-hourly data at
seventeen sites obtained in a joint program carried out by the
Division of Land Use Research, CSIRO, the National Capital Development Commission, and the Bureau of Meteorology.
The statistical analysis proceeded in stages. The first
two stages were concerned with the determination and
examination of averages and measures of dipersion. Information
on the temporal variability in regional wind, defined as the
average of the winds at the seventeen collection sites,
provided the first insight into the important determinants of
winds in the region. The data were then categorized on the
basis of the information thus obtained, and the averages over
time for each site were analysed in each category. The
variation between sites revealed the extent of the spatial
variability in the region.
For each category, for each site, there were
perturbations around the average state, and in the last stage
of the study, the analysis examined how the perturbations were
related across sites using correlation coefficients.
Generalized Procrustes Analysis was used, followed by the
extensive use of cluster analysis.
Linear modelling techniques were used at all stages of
the study, not only for wind speed, but also for wind direction
which is an angular variate and thus required different
modelling procedures. The models related the variables of
interest to terrain features such as position, elevation and
surface roughness. These models allowed an informed judgement
to be made on the likelihood of accurately estimating the winds
at other locations in the region using interpolation
techniques.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wind speed</field><field name="subject">mesoscale</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">Generalized Procrustes Analysis</field><field name="subject">cluster analysis</field><field name="subject">CSIRO</field><field name="subject">National Capital Development Commission</field><field name="subject">Bureau of Meteorology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060802.154807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GPS heighting : the effect of the GPS antenna phase center variation on height determination</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Gary Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the effect on height determination of the antenna phase centre

Keith</field><field name="description">The Field Study Report records the establishment of a
theoretical model for examining aspects of complex
innovations, the application of that model to the
Commonwealth Participation and Equity Program in the ACT
government sector using an historical perspective, and the
drawing of conclusions occasioned by that, application.
Based on the literature of the management of change,
educational administration and educational politics as well as the history of the program, it is argued that
specific groups of factors influencing the delivery and
impact of the program may be identified and their effects
described, with a view to guiding future delivery of major
educational reform programs.
The theoretical model for classifying and examining the
relative importance of the factors is a synthesis based on
the work of the researchers Hoy and Miskel (1982), with a
major additional component, prompted by writers in the
field of educational politics. The method of application
also allows the discussion of two further underlying
propositions. These are;
(a) That the modes of delivery employed by the ACT Schools
Authority for PEP evolved during the course of its
implementation;
(b) That the program had a discernible impact, in terms of
its aims, but this impact, was modified qualitatively and
quantitatively by the process of mutual adaptation and by
other factors external and internal to the program.
In a series of linked steps, the thesis examines the
literature, drawing out a grouped collection of factors
potentially influencing the program, describes the
context, modes of delivery, aims and outcomes of PEP,
categorises the identified factors according to their
apparent relative influence, and uses these learnings to
make predictions and conclusions about PEP and future
system-wide reform initiatives.
It is concluded that the underlying propositions of the
thesis are confirmed. It is also argued that the study has
highlighted the predominant influence of political
factors, most groups of management factors and factors
related to school organisation, whereas other factors are
of lesser importance in moulding program delivery
strategies and shaping program outcomes. As well, the
thesis concludes that the particular framework adopted for
the study possesses considerable potential for use in a
variety of future research, and that the introduction of
the factor-based structure as a means of carrying out
historical research helps promote rigour, objectivity and
credibility where there is a reliance on the involvement
of a participant-observer to provide reflective data.
In relation to PEP itself, it is concluded that the
process of mutual adaptation and the influence of the
multiplicity of factors ensured that the higher-order
program outcomes such as institutionalisation of new
curriculum definitions, the development of negotiated
student, management and teaching/learning strategies and
attitudinal changes about, the purposes and ownership of
education, were modified even more significantly than the
outcomes which could be measured in quantitative terms.

upon rational models of policy analysis and delivery, to suit complex postmodern
implementation environments. A theoretical model suited to implementing and
evaluating major education reform initiatives was devised. Called the 'Multiple Discourse Model', it was grounded in systems theory, containing elements
reminiscent of social systems, organisational and structural functionalist research,
especially that of Hoy and Miskel (1982)1. However the model was also designed
to incorporate a parallel naturalistic analysis reminiscent of postmodern critical
pragmatic approaches, such as those explored by Cherryholmes (1994)2. Over a
period of five years, this model was developed through an evaluation of the
implementation of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy (AEP) in the Australian Capital Territory government secondary schools
sector.
The distinguishing feature of the study's methodology was its multiperspective
analysis, an approach suggested by Mclaughlin (1987)3 to take account
of the differing communities of discourse which exist in a reformist policy
implementation environment.
To operationalise the research problem, dimensions of policy effectiveness
were articulated. These were addressed through a comprehensive set of research
indicators, extracted from the AEP's national policy goals and the local strategic and
operational plans. Data aimed at judging the effectiveness of implementation were
collected from multiple sources using multiple research instruments. These data
were analysed in three stages using a purpose-designed computer program which
could cross-reference between the four interacting dimensions of research
indicators, research instruments, data sources, and potential variables modifying
policy/program outcomes.
It was found that this model produced clear conclusions about the
effectiveness of AEP implementation in the delimited sector, within the framework
of the AEP's own policy assumptions. The model also provided insights into critical
issues which are generalisable to the national context, such as the power of cultural
hegemony and the socio-political predicament of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander dispossession. As a methodology, the model was found to have a number
of technical advantages, including its capacity for focussing on selected areas of the
implementation environment, its provision of access to multiple levels of detail
amongst data and its possession of mechanisms for monitoring its own internal
validity.
The evaluation case study, used as the vehicle for the Multiple Discourse
Model's development, demonstrated that best-practice administration was in place
which enhanced short and medium-term policy/program outcomes. However, the
study's findings also suggested that a fundamental disjuncture existed between the
AEP's policy/administration paradigm and the conflicting assumptions of the primary
target communities, reinforcing the findings of Sykes (1986)4. The research results
suggested that despite measurable successful inputs, the planned long-term
outcomes of the AEP will not necessarily be achieved. No significant administrative
structures or actions were apparent which could resolve this lack of synchrony at the
interface between government delivery systems and 'grass roots' Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander community values. This raised doubts about whether any
systems approach, however well refined, could be socially useful not only for
evaluation, but also as a basis for reform policy and public administration in a
postmodern pluralist democratic setting. The evaluation was therefore used as a
locus for theoretical reflection as well.
A new policy paradigm is suggested, based on a power-sharing 'theory of

communities of Lake Macquarie, which is a heavily industrialised area of NSW, where
notably high trace metal concentrations have been reported previously. Initially a suite
of organisms was collected from a seagrass bed (Zostera capricornia) in the southeastern
section of the lake to investigate the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of
selenium. All organisms contained selenium, with sediment-dwelling organisms
containing the highest Se concentrations. No consistent pattern of significant Se-metal
correlations with Cu, Zn and Cd was found. Biomagnification of Se was evident, as
concentrations increased from sediments and water to flora (algae and seagrass) to
bivalves to Crustacea. However, this trend was not continued to the higher trophic
groups of invertebrate predators and teleost fish.
The bivalve Anadara trapezia was further studied. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors
affecting the accumulation of Se were examined. Gender and mass were assessed in a
single day study, followed by a temporal investigation of the effect of gender,
reproductive cycle, temperature and salinity on Se accumulation. Gender had no effect
on the accumulation of Se in A. trapezia. Se was present in all tissues (adductor,
blood, foot, gills, intestine and mantle) and not immobilised or stored in a specific
tissue, indicating that it plays a structural role in the tissues of A. trapezia. Se burden
increased relative to size (shell length and dry mass) suggesting that Se is metabolically
controlled within the organism. Se concentrations were found to fluctuate temporally
because of: food availability in response to water temperatures; the reproductive cycle;
and associated metabolic activities responding to temperature changes and food
availability.
Subcellular selenium associations in A. trapezia were examined to assist in the
understanding of the fate of Se in marine tissues. Most of the Se was associated with
proteins, suggesting that Se has a metabolic role in this marine organism. Proteins
are intrinsically associated with the lipid bilayer of the cell membranes. A number of
proteins (94, 85, 43, 36.5, 30, 23.4, 17.4 and 15 kDa) were separated by SDS PAGE
from ethanol fractions. Determination of the Se concentration within individual
proteins was not possible because the ratio of Se to protein was too low for further
analysis.
These findings indicated that Se plays a metabolic role in the tissues of the marine
organism A. trapezia. The biochemical regulatory mechanism responsible for
maintaining Se concentrations within the tissues is currently unknown.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">selenium</field><field name="subject">seagrass</field><field name="subject">lake Macquarie</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Anadara Trapezia</field><field name="subject">trace metal concentrations</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060802.172608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy formulation and decision making in the ACT technical and further education system</field><field name="creator">Jolliffe, Ray</field><field name="description">This study attempts to trace the locus of responsibility for the
decision making associated with policy determination in the
Australian Capital Territory further education system. Generally
the study is restricted to the decade of the Seventies, during which
period the administrative organisation of the system moved from the
large, centralised New South Wales State technical education system
to a small, regional system with local control.
In chronological sequence this field study considers the content and
effect of a number of reports, files and papers generated during
this period under study, and shows the nature of influences on the
emergence and structure of the A.C.T. further education system. In
particular, the shift of responsibility for policy determination,
and executive management of the system, is followed through as a
function of the recommendations contained in the various documents
considered.
By tracing the movement of executive responsibility through the
early years of operation of the A.C.T. further education system it
is possible to detect the focus of power and influence within and
imposed upon the system, and to consider the decision-making
strategies adopted in the determination of policy. From these it is
possible to extrapolate and assess, to some extent, the stage of
evolution which has been reached and possible directions in which
"natural selection" factors may influence further developments.
This field study should provide a first step, at least, toward the
association and amalgamation of many documents which have (or should
have) significantly influenced the nature of the present A.C.T.
further education system. The study concludes with some discussion
of current issues and suggestions for further (related) research.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">policy formulation</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">technical education</field><field name="subject">further education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060803.120454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A formative evaluation of selected aspects of the resource teacher program in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Jones, Peter J.</field><field name="description">This study describes an evaluation of some aspects of the
Australian Capital Territory Resource Teacher Program
during 1985. The Resource Teacher Program was an
Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority initiative
whereby an additional specially trained teacher was
allocated to a school to assist with fulfilling particular
needs which the school had identified.
The study used two techniques to collect information,
questionnaire and interview. The questionnaire data was
analysed and provided response frequencies of all 263
respondents in relation to students, teachers, parents and
schools in each of the sixteen schools in the Program.
Interviews were also conducted to allow for those involved
in the Resource Teacher Program to make a direct
contribution to the study's information base.
Aspects of two theoretical education evaluation approaches
were used as the basis of the study's theoretical
framework. The TenBrink model was used, working from
required judgements through to recommendations. Aspects of
Stake's approach to educational evaluational were also used
to enable identification of issues and to facilitate input
of the Resource Teacher Program's participants.
It was shown that students who had been involved in the
Resource Teacher Program benefitted in the areas of
academic progress, behaviour modification programs,
previously unmet needs and gifted and talented programs.
Teacher benefits were in the areas of in-school curriculum
and advisory support. Parents who had been involved in the
Program had benefitted by developing an increased
understanding of current educational practice and how to
help their children. Schools had benefitted through better
use of school counsellors, increased parent participation
and improved teaching resources.
The identification of issues which required consideration
in order to enhance the Program's effectiveness were of
major importance in this study. These included the Resource
Teachers' role definition, Resource Teacher stress, school
commitment to the Resource Teacher Program, evaluation of
the Program, the training program, the notion of secondary
school resource teachers and the Australian Capital

Teacher Program.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">resource teacher program</field><field name="subject">ACT Schools Authority</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060803.130214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The efficacy of a reading recovery program or an extra lesson program in comparison to no intervention for children having difficulty reading in their second year at school</field><field name="creator">Judd, Mariane</field><field name="description">The purpose of the study was to investigate the efficacy of a 'Reading Recovery' or an
'Extra Lesson' program in comparison to no intervention for children having difficulty
reading in their second year at school.
'Reading Recovery' is an intervention program developed by Marie Clay to assist
children who are showing signs of having difficulty learning to read after the first year
at school. 'Reading Recovery' uses a whole language approach. The assumption is that
given a second chance in a 1:1 structured learning environment, with a trained
Reading Recovery teacher, the child will learn to read at an age appropriate level.
The 'Extra Lesson' intervention is based on the paradigm of Rudolf Steiner's concept
of education, which is a holistic developmental approach. The assumption is that there
is a relationship between learning and development in the first seven years of the
child's life. The 'Extra Lesson' assessment tests for and identifies developmental
difficulties within the first seven years of the child's life and skills testing clarifies if
the child has any significant learning difficulty. The 'Extra Lesson' intervention is a
1:1 program, based on a holistic developmental perspective of Rudolf Steiner, to work
with the child's difficulties.
The efficacy of both interventions was evaluated by using a case study design with
embedded forms of analysis and a pre-test post-test non equivalent control group
quasi-experimental design to measure the changes in the children's reading skills,
processing speed, short term auditory memory and awareness of body geography.
Follow up tests were administered 10 months after the post-tests. Case studies have
been used to present the data collated for individual subjects and graphs were used for
the analysis of group data.
All the subjects showed an improvement in reading skills from the pre to the post-test.
At follow up all the subjects tested continued to show an improvement in reading
skills. Both interventions were shown to affect the subjects reading skills. A
comparison of groups showed a slight measurable difference between the 'Reading
Recovery', 'Extra Lesson' and Control group, with the 'Extra Lesson' showing a
slightly larger improvement in sight word recognition. The treatment and Control
groups' Writing Vocabulary increased from the pre to the post-test. The 'Reading
Recovery' and Control groups' Writing Vocabulary decreased and the Extra Lesson
group continued to improve at follow up.
All the groups showed an improvement in short term auditory memory at the post-test
and the Control and 'Extra lesson' groups continued to increase slightly at follow up
and the 'Reading Recovery' group remained relatively constant. All the groups had
relatively constant scores on Processing Speed from the pre to the post- test and at
follow up. Neither intervention showed a measurable effect on Processing Speed.
All the groups showed an improvement in graphical representation of body geography
at the post-test and at follow up. The 'Extra Lesson' group showed the largest
improvement at the post-test and long-term. The 'Extra Lesson' intervention had a
positive and measurable effect on graphical representation of body geography after the
intervention and long-term.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading recovery</field><field name="subject">extra lesson</field><field name="subject">Marie Clay</field><field name="subject">Rudolf Steiner</field><field name="subject">reading difficulties</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060803.131535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marital separation : an experimental investigation of the efficacy of a self-help guide</field><field name="creator">Jones, Rosemary</field><field name="description">The present study examined the efficacy of a self-help

The experiment demanded firstly a thorough investigation
of two major areas viz.(a) the new Family Law Act and its

Governance in Australian Universities. A number of ITSM frameworks have been proposed
however, IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and Control OBjectives for Information and related
Technology (COBIT) have been most widely accepted and implemented internationally and
within Australia.
The research reported in this thesis was undertaken to shed light on the issues related to ITIL
adoption and implementation within Australian universities. To date academic research in ITIL
adoption and implementation has not been extensive as it is comparatively a new framework,
especially within Australian universities.
The theoretical framework proposed in this thesis has IT service management as the central
concept, implementing IT Governance to align the university and technology. This framework is
used to examine the experience of ITIL adoption in seven Australian universities, plus a detailed
case study on one university&#65533;s experience.
This research reveals a complex web of factors relating to ITIL implementation including; the
pre-implementation process; processes implemented; order of implementation; hiring external
expertise;, tool selection;, staff training; ongoing assessments; managing cultural change;
managing learning curve and resource strain. The findings provide an insight into practical
lessons for other Australian universities or similar organisations considering implementing IT
Governance through IT Service management frameworks. The method used in this research may
be useful for other organisations and researchers analysing universities and similar organisations
implementing ITIL. IT Governance and IT service management frameworks are diverse and

education, and specifically, in the context of Australian secondary students studying
English. The purpose of this research is to contribute to change in the way assessment
of learning is conducted in view of the shift of educational values from content based
towards a more goal-orientated process. Therefore, we begin this study with the
premise that educational values should not only inform assessment in terms of
outcomes and accountability as specified in national guidelines. They should also
support a pedagogic process which helps to develop in students a heightened sense of
the value of their own contributions to the community, academic and otherwise.
The intellectual context of this study begins with an overview of most prominent
educational theories. We illustrate John Dewey&#146;s view that education should not only
prepare one for life, but should also be an integral part of life itself. Dewey insisted
that education was based in experience and that educational institutions should
therefore honour and build on students&#65533; experiences. Piaget believed that children are
quite sophisticated, active thinkers and theorists. Vygotsky saw all learning,
knowledge, and experience had a social basis. Together these three theorists
emphasize the active role of students as individuals (Dewey and Piaget) or a group
(Vygotsky). Further, as society&#146;s values shift from the Industrial Age to an
Information Age, there is a growing expectation for individuals to be active and
informed citizens, with the ability to exercise judgment and the capacity to make
sense of their world. In response to these issues, we conclude that the teaching and
assessment processes must support these kinds of requirements.
We examine literature related to learning theories and assessment with the objective
of ascertaining and illustrating aspects which they share and which, in our view,
hamper the development of learning environments enabling exploratory and critical
learning. We argue that when assessment criteria predetermine the learning
outcomes, this results in teaching models where students&#146; learning needs are also
predetermined. This process alienates students from their sociocultural context which
shapes them and from which they derive their identify and the sense of their own
value. Consequently, students become an object of pedagogic tools, rather than
rightful participants in the lives of their various communities.
Against the background of these reflections, we set out in this study to investigate
how learning and assessment can be linked together. To this end, we develop the
concept of an Exploratory Learning Environment. In order to articulate the
framework of such an environment, we draw on a number of principals generally
associated with humanist/constructivist/postmodern approaches to learning and
assessment. In the course of this work we argue that students&#146; ways of knowing, and
how they learn, cannot be divorced from their individual, and yet socially
(interactively) constructed (negotiated), cultural experiences (terms of reference). The
philosophy of the Exploratory Learning Environment can be described as promoting
engagement and construction, thus supporting learning through experience, inquiry,experimentation and critical reflection.
Consequently, in the Exploratory Learning Environment we seek to integrate
pedagogic task construction and students&#146; expectations. To this end, we concentrate
our research on strategies, or tools, enhancing students&#146; critical forms of engagement
in their community. We aim for the academic knowledge, which they construct as a
result, not to serve arbitrarily constructed performance indicators, but the students
themselves and the community which they engage. Regarding assessment, our
objective is to ascertain the diversity of conflict-generating concerns which students
take into account in order to motivate the kinds of socially responsible solutions that
they create and, as a result, the kinds of relationships which they want to establish.
This approach to assessment allows us to focus students&#146; learning on developing
critical thinking skills whose validation comes from students&#146; own evaluation, rather
than from an abstract source of authority.
This arrangement of creating learning environments rich in tools enhancing students&#146;
critical forms of engagement we carry out using two classes of Year 10 and one class
of Year 8 students in two secondary schools. Results from the study demonstrate
significant advantages that can be gained when assessment is not limited to the
measure of a &#145;product&#146;, but is based in pedagogy enabling critical negotiation. For
example, students developed a sense of ownership of their learning task, felt
motivated to explore conflicting issues, and, interestingly, valued the assessment
process and looked forward to learning about the quality of their performance.
In summary, the theoretical reflections conducted in this study and the experiment
conducted within the Exploratory Learning Environment model, together, provide
valuable and reliable evidence supporting the need for a critical evaluation of the
currently existing relationship between teaching and assessment. Further, this thesis
offers examples of solutions in which this link can be fostered. It demonstrates that,
when students are empowered to learn by critically linking academic and other forms
of knowledge residing in their community, the assessment process become a
meaningful tool to them and they become involved in their assessment.
At the same time, teachers learn to reduce the grip they hold on the learning and
assessment processes. They do so by adopting the role of a facilitator of the students&#146;
negotiation process. This is very different from the traditional teaching practices
where the learning process is restricted, rather than enhanced, by assessment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">secondary school students</field><field name="subject">John Dewey</field><field name="subject">Piaget</field><field name="subject">Vygotsky</field><field name="subject">Exploratory Learning Environment</field><field name="subject">ELE</field><field name="subject">rubric</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060804.112632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination and comparison of some syntactic areas of the oral langauge behavior of mildly intellectually handicapped children and normal children</field><field name="creator">Jones, Robin Glyn</field><field name="description">Some syntactic aspects of the oral language of 20
mildly intellectually handicapped, 20 normal seven year
old and 20 normal ten year old children were examined
in order to determine the comparative development of
the mildly intellectually handicapped children and some
of the difficulties they might experience. The language
was classified into 24 categories for various types of
analysis. These types included traditional counts and
an examination of the types of subordination as well as
of non-conventional usage. In addition, Developmental Sentence Scoring (Lee : 1974) was used to assess the
maturity of personal pronoun and main and secondary
verb usage. The sentence repetition technique was
employed as a means of assessing competence in a variety
of later-developing structures. Questions were designed
to assess ability in other specific syntactic areas.
Analysis of variance was used to compare group scores
and determine if any significant differences occurred.
Several significant differences did occur. The findings
provided strong evidence that the language of mildly
intellectually handicapped children is more like that
of children of the same chronological age than it is
like that of children of the same mental age and that
it is less mature than the former. These handicapped
children experience considerable delay in the
development of pronouns and verbs and have a high
incidence of non-conventional usage.
This study also provided evidence of the continuing
language development of normal primary age children.
Some methods of sampling and analysing oral language
were found to be of particular value. Of these the
sentence repetition technique seems promising both as
a research tool and as a classroom instrument for
assessing individual children's language competence.
The importance of this and similar research lies in
its implications for educational programming.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oral language</field><field name="subject">intellectually handicapped</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">Developmental Sentence Scoring</field><field name="subject">syntactic</field><field name="subject">language development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060804.115605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservastion biology of the pink-tailedd legless lizard Aprasia parapulchella</field><field name="creator">Jones, Sandra Raelene</field><field name="description">This study arose from a conservation dilemma between the need to
conserve a population of the endangered pink tailed legless lizard, Aprasia
parapulchella and crucial upgrading of Canberra's sewerage treatment plant.
The study focused on conservation biology and how it could be applied to the
management of A. parapulchella. As little biological information was available
on A. parapulchella, research was focused on obtaining data that would be
beneficial in the conservation management of the species. This included the
dietary and habitat requirements, population status and structure and population
relocation and habitat restoration.
A. parapulchella was found to occur in low relative densities at all sites
(maximum 9.1 lizards per 1000 rocks turned, Mt Taylor). Populations of the
species appear to be larger than has been considered previously, however
numbers are still below 500 individuals per site. Sexual dimorphism is present in
the species with females achieving longer snout-vent lengths than males. Sex
ratios were equal in all sites, however average size of lizards was different at the
four main study sites, indicating differences in population structure. The life
history of A. parapulchella can be summarised as long-lived, late maturing (3rd or
4lh year of life) with a low reproductive rate (single clutch of two eggs per year).
A. parapulchella is a dietary specialist feeding on about 11 different
species of ants. Interestingly, the lizards also live with the same species that they
feed upon. By far the most important species in the diet and homesite
requirements of A. parapulchella is the ant Iridomyrmex rufoniger. A.
parapulchella shows positive selection towards the species in homesite choice, is
found most commonly in the nests of this ant, and selects its brood over the
brood of other ant species in diet experiments. In addition this ant was
represented in the diet of A. parapulchella more commonly than any other ant.
The relationship between ants and A. parapulchella appears to be unique and the
mechanisms of this specialisation require further investigation.
The vegetation associations where A. parapulchella occur are different
across the range of the species. Sites at Bendigo and West Wyalong support
mallee communities, while in the ACT region, Bathurst and Tarcutta, A.
parapulchella appears to be a habitat specialist, being found most commonly in
sites dominated by grass species, both native and introduced. A. parapulchella
lives beneath rocks in grassland sites. Rocks that the species uses for homesites
are commonly between 100 and 150 mm wide, 120-220 mm long and 50 and 150
mm thick. There were significant differences between the sizes of rocks used at
different sites and between different seasons. Rocks used by females were
significantly larger than rocks used by juvenile lizards. Twelve other species of
reptile were found to use rocks in grassland sites, with rocks partitioned within
the community on the basis of size and shape.
An experimental relocation of A. parapulchella was conducted to try to
determine ideal habitat conditions for the survival of relocated individuals.
Unfortunately of the 114 lizards released, only 15 were recaptured. Although
recaptures were low, trends indicated that treatments of Themeda triandra and
very high rock densities had the highest survival rates. Key habitat variables
were reinstated at the Lower Molonglo Dam site however restoration is
preliminary with more time needed for the habitat to be suitable for occupation
by A. parapulchella.
What started as a situation that was likely to have a deleterious impact on
A. parapulchella has been turned into a conservation success story. Without the
involvement of ACT Electricity and Water, much of the basic biology of A.
parapulchella would still be unknown. The findings will now form a solid basis
from which to effectively conserve A. parapulchella. The project provides an
example of the conservation success that can be achieved between industry and
conservation partnerships.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">pink tailed legless lizard</field><field name="subject">Aprasia parapulchella</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060804.120523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and current principals' perception and expectations of the administration of a large Catholic education system</field><field name="creator">Joy, Geoffrey</field><field name="description">This study traces the development of the system of Catholic systemic schools in the Archdiocese of Sydney from early colonial times to the
present, and analyses the perceptions and expectations that a sample
of secondary school principals in the System had of the systems
level administration in 1985.
The development of Catholic schools in the penal colony of New South
Wales was extremely slow. The first Catholic school was opened in
1817, and from 1833 to the 'free, secular, and compulsory' education
act in New South Wales in 1880, denominational schools received some
government grants.
When 'state-aid' was withdrawn in 1880, the wonder of education
history in Australia was that a separate Catholic school 'system'
emerged. This was brought about in large measure by the ability of
the Bishops and Clergy to activate the Catholic community, which had
been generally apathetic religiously and educationally, and by their
recruiting teachers who were members of Religious Congregations both
from abroad and locally.
The Religious carried the Catholic Schools 'system' in Sydney for
some seventy-five years (1880-1955). However, the recruiting of
Religious teachers declined from the 1950s. This, together with
rapid increases in school population, widening of the curriculum,
decreased class sizes and lighter teaching loads brought on a crisis
of survival for the Catholic schools. It was averted by the
reintroduction of 'State-Aid' and the recruiting and training of lay
teachers. Following the Karmel Report of 1973, Commonwealth
Government grants and programs grew many fold. In order to cope with
the new organisational complexities, including both financial and
educational accountability requirements of the government, many of
the Catholic schools, which had previously been organised on an
individual parish or Religious Congregation basis, joined together to
form systems. These Catholic Education Office systems (or CEO
systems) rapidly developed administrative bureaucracies. The Sydney
CEO System is the largest in Australia with nearly 6000 teachers and
over 110,000 pupils.
In this process of building an organisational system, the vital role
of the school principal is changing. This study examines the
responses of twenty-four secondary school principals, in the interview
situation, to questions on their perceptions and expectations of
the systems level administration.
The researcher has analysed the data in the light of some of the
literature on motivation theory and theories about complex
organisations and has suggested some facets of the systems level
administration that need to be addressed if the system is to grow in
effectiveness.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Archdiocese of Sydney</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060804.121438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of humanistic and traditional teaching methods in a college of technical and further education</field><field name="creator">Judd, Annemarie M.

teachers in Australian schools to the organisation of sporting
activities for students. As a result, School Sports Associations were
formed in most Australian States early this century. These
Associations provided intra state and inter state competition on a
limited scale.
It was not until the early 1970's that any co-ordinated effort
was made to bring together all the States' and Territories' activities.
Regular meetings of Association Secretaries led to the formation of
the Australian State Secondary Schools Sports Council in 1973.
This was the beginning of a new era in secondary school
representative sport in Australia. The creation of a forum for States
to discuss matters of mutual interest resulted in a greater awareness
within school communities of the benefits provided by sporting
activities.
This generation of interest eventually led to the formation of
the Australian Secondary Schools Sports Federation in 1977. This
body, representing all States and Territories became identified as
the controlling body of secondary school sport in Australia and has
continued to develop this role over the years.
Since the formation of the Australian Secondary Schools Sports
Federation, there has been significant growth in representative
sporting activities, greater liaison and improved relations with
community groups and systematic generation of relevant policies aimed
at the betterment of school sport.
After several years of operation, the role of the Federation
was supplemented by the establishment of the Australian Schools Sports
Council. This body represents both Primary School and Secondary School
Sports Associations throughout Australia. After considerable effort,
the Council was successful in obtaining Commonwealth Government funding
for the employment of a National Executive Director to work full-time
on the promotion of school sport.
The years 1977-1983 saw dramatic growth in school sporting
activities in Australia. Many problems were encountered some of which
were ultimately solved. Other problems continue to occupy those who
work within the organisation and their solution would appear to be the
main task for the future.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">representative sport</field><field name="subject">School Sports Associations</field><field name="subject">Australian State Secondary Schools Sports Council</field><field name="subject">Australian Secondary Schools Sports Federation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060804.124742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The comparative effectiveness of two behaviour modification techniques</field><field name="creator">Kalnins, Sharyn</field><field name="description">Using a reversal design with two primary school aged

during which time the child was taught to "stop, look,

links to business accounting and business accounts concepts, and economic
theory. The current trend in national accounting work is to carry out
the task based on a framework which functions as an integrated general purpose
statistical information system. The principal constraints to
this approach are data availability which is a function of the standard
and serviceability of the country's national statistical system, and
general conventional accounting principles. It is submitted that one of
the important properties that a system of national accounts should
possess is inherent flexibility in order to allow such a system to
respond sensitively to developments in economic theory and specialized
needs/demands.
Even though the development of certain national accounting principles
can be traced back to the seventeenth century, national accounting
generally is a twentieth century invention, with the development of the
SNA as a very major breakthrough. One of the SNA's most valuable contributions
is its provision of a consistent and comprehensive framework in terms of
national accounting concepts, definitions and principles.
The application of the conventional national accounting principles
to Tonga and other developing countries has been confronted with many
conceptual and statistical problems. The existence of imperfect national
price systems in developing countries has led many critics to question
the validity of national income estimates for such countries. It has
been submitted that such imperfection of national price systems has been
essentially a function of constraints on commodity and factor movements.
It is argued however that many such restrictions cannot be applied
with significant force to the case of Tonga and that there exists great
validity and usefulness in making national income estimation.
Non-market portion of total production in the economy of Tonga is
significant. Its estimation for national accounting purposes is faced
with the conceptual problems of setting appropriate boundary of production
and imputation. The recommendations of the SNA with regard to the
former are endorsed for national accounting practice in Tonga with
special attention to transactions such as the unilateral provisions of
free and/or partially paid services by Tongans to government and church
authorities. Due to the predominantly agricultural character of the
Tongan economy and the existence of a partial subsistence sector, certain
conceptual problems arising from the need to make clear distinctions
between production and consumption, and saving and investment in accordance
with the Keynesian framework are bound to prevail with regard to national
accounting in the Kingdom. There are also the problems associated with
any attempt to distinguish the various factor shares of national income.
Recommendations and comments concerning possible means of minimizing
these problems or perhaps putting such, problems into some balanced
perspective, are presented.
Statistical problems faced with national accounting work in Tonga
are generally associated with the inadequacy and unreliability of basic
national accounting statistics, and the shortage of appropriate material
and human resources. While most of the statistical problems can be
substantially alleviated by more liberal direction of resources to the
process of data collection and national income estimation, some of the
statistical problems like the conceptual problems would persist in Tonga
as long as the general standard of the Kingdom's national statistical
system is low and the general state of under-development prevails.
A close scrutiny of the general performance and structure of the
Tongan economy, current and anticipated future needs/demands for various
national accounting statistical series, and current and anticipated
future status of data availability, suggests that a system of national
accounts for Tonga which could bring out the important economic characteristics
and inter-relationships of important sectors in the economy would be
considered as very desirable. With the increasing complexity of the
Kingdom's economy and associated increasing diversity of needs/demands
for appropriate statistical series, it is felt that a system of national
accounts which offers greater disaggregation of important aggregates and
which views the production sector at some component levels such as
"Agricultural", "Non-Agricultural, Non-Financial" and "Financial"
production sub-sectors even though it is a diversion from the general
recommendations of the SNA, would merit a high level of serviceability.
A system of national accounts which is essentially based on a
system of sector accounts with the incorporation of the above stated
partitioning of the production sector is therefore proposed for Tonga.
The proposed system also consists of sets of supplementary tables and
aggregative accounts which aim at providing essential supplementary
information via the adoption of different classification systems or
appropriate aggregations of information exhibited in the sector accounts.
Issues concerning suggested future expansion of the proposed system to
include appropriate input-output matrices and flow of funds tables and
the need for a proper development and application of an appropriate
social accounting matrix (SAM) for Tonga are also discussed.
The proposed system of national accounts for Tonga is relatively
comprehensive and possesses inherent flexibility which is a reflection
of its primary inheritance from the SNA. Even though it might take
some time before the proposed design can be implemented in full, its
relative comprehensiveness would automatically serve a lot of useful
purposes e.g. its explicit facilitation of attention to gaps in the
existing data series. The implementation of the proposed system is
regarded as a feasible long term project for the Tonga national statistical
agency. The extent to which it can be implemented in the very near future
given Government's acceptance, would depend heavily on the priority level
the Tonga Government attaches or would attach to the task of developing
and improving the Kingdom's national accounting system.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">national accounting</field><field name="subject">national accounts</field><field name="subject">Kingdom of Tonga</field><field name="subject">Tongan economy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060804.131143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A survey study of grade six students' atitudes towards science in selected schools of Papua New Ginea</field><field name="creator">Kappey, J. R.</field><field name="description">This survey study on students attitudes towards science was conducted in
Papua New Guinea. It involved 200 randomly selected grade six students in
eight selected community (primary) schools (4 urban and 4 rural) of four
provinces.
There were six research questions to focus the study.
The instruments consisted of 9 Students Background Questions, 9 interview
questions, 43 Students Science Attitude Questionnaire Items, and a 20-item
cognitive test. The former three sets of instruments were trialled in two
schools. The test questions were not trialled as they were trialled
previously in several schools within PNG.
The 43 Likert-type items were divided into five categories - curiosity,
enjoyment, science learning, perceived achievement, and relevance. Each
category was assigned 10 items, with the exception of perceived
achievement which had three items. About half of the the statements in a
category were negatively worded. A student had to put a tick in a box next
to a statement according to his or her feelings. The choices were given by
the five-point scale - Strongly Agree (SA), Agree (A), Hot Sure (NS),
Disagree (D), and Strongly Disagree (SD) along with three laces (smiling,
uncertain and frowning) which were added as interest,
From the twenty five students in a study school, a group of 6 students (3
males and 3 females) was randomly selected for face to face interview.
The responses in the items associated with the five categories (dependent
variables) were used to assess various student characteristics (independent
variables) of parent and home background (i.e. parent educational levels
and language use at home), gender (male and female), biogeographical
location (urban and rural), and level of performance in standardized
cognitive test (above average, average and below average).
Statistical techniques of correlation coefficient, analysis of variance and
factor analysis were used in analysing the responses but the results were
not clear due insufficient trialling and test of reliability with the limited
period in which the data had to be collected. As consequence, chi-square
test (contingency tables) was used as alternative statistical test to
determine significant differences in responses to the items at 0.05 level.
With the exception of perceived achievement, student responses to the
items on the categories were generally and satisfactorily positive. The
mean levels of attitudes in the categories were not as high as one may
expect (Table 5.1).
Relatively, few of the items associated with student independent variables
showed significant differences.
There was generally no significant differences in parent and home
backgrounds (i.e. language use and parent educational background). Urban
students tended to be more positive than the rural students, but. this not
could be generalised due to a small number of items with significant
differences.
Male students showed more positive attitudes to science than female
students, but this was limited to a small number of items.
The students with above average scores in the cognitive test showed more
positive attitudes to science than those of average and below verage scores.
However, the number of items were quite small, and therefore could not be
generalised.
Points of improvement in the practice of teaching and future research in
attitudes to science are recommended. For instance, the present officially
prescribed time of 40 minutes per week for science should be changed to
1.5 to 2 hours after further investigation. The reason for this is that it
requires some preparation before actual lessons begin (e.g. collecting
materials by groups) and the students are generally slow.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papua New Ginea</field><field name="subject">PNG</field><field name="subject">student attitudes</field><field name="subject">science</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">Likert</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060804.131924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Promoting critical thinking in language learning through computer-mediated collaborative learning: a preliminary investigation</field><field name="creator">Thadphoothon, Janpha</field><field name="description">This thesis proposed a framework for conceptualizing critical thinking in language
learning. A learning environment where collaborative learning and network
technology were combined &#8722; computer-mediated collaborative learning (CMCL) &#8722;
was set up. The main aim was to study the potential of the learning environment in
promoting critical thinking (CT) in language learning. The proposed framework of
CT in language learning had three aspects: (1) communication, (2) reasoning, and
(3) self-reflection.
The study was a qualitative one that took place between June 2003 and January
2004. Three case studies were undertaken that involved up to 90 participants,
comprising students, teachers, volunteers, and the researcher. All were members of
an online learning community, the Bamboo Enterprise. Students worked in groups
that investigated environmental problems. The student projects were grouped into
three case studies: (1) Using Collaborative Environmental Projects to Promote
Communicative Language Learning and Computer Skills, (2) Using Environmental
Themes in Computer-Supported Cooperative Learning to Prepare ESL Students for
Academic Study in the Australian University Environment, (3) Promoting
Communicative Language Learning Through Computer-Supported Cooperative
Learning. Findings were based on analyses of five sources of data: (1) interviews
with the student participants; (2) teachers&#146; comments and opinions; (3)
questionnaires; (4) students&#146; overall group work; and (5) online discussions.
The investigation found that, overall, the CMCL environment with its particular
framework had the potential to promote CT in language learning. However, it had
both strengths and weaknesses. The strengths were that it promoted the
communicative use of English, encouraged critical thinking in action, and extended
the students&#146; potential to learn a second language. It also encouraged the appropriate
use of technology. More importantly, this CMCL environment showed itself to be a
viable method of learning and one in which both students and teachers can be
empowered. However, along with these advantages, some avenues for improvement
were evident. The study found that the students&#146; grammatical accuracy was low,
despite their rich vocabulary and ability to use complex language structures. Some
students found working in groups challenging and some never acquired the
necessary web skills. Access to the Internet was not always adequate for this type of
project. In sum, the students needed more support, especially at the task level, when
using this method of language learning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical thinking</field><field name="subject">language learning</field><field name="subject">learning environment</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">reasoning</field><field name="subject">self-reflection</field><field name="subject">Bamboo Enterprise</field><field name="subject">University of Canberra</field><field name="subject">UC</field><field name="subject">internet in education</field><field name="subject">second language learning</field><field name="subject">Dhurakij Pundit University</field><field name="subject">collaborative learning</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060804.141259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in the structure of demersal fish communities of the South Eastern Australian Ccontinental Shelf from 1915 to 1961</field><field name="creator">Klaer, Neil L</field><field name="description">Haul-by-haul steam trawler catch and effort data for 1918&#65533;23, 1937&#65533;43 and 1952&#65533;57,
which covers a large portion of the history of steam trawling in the Australian South
East Fishery, were examined in detail for the first time. There were 64,371 haul records
in total. The catch-rate for all retained catch combined shows a strong decline overall,
with a brief recovery during World War II, probably due to increased retention of
previously discarded species. The fishing fleet moved to more distant fishing grounds
and deeper waters as the catch-rate declined. The catch-rates of the main commercial
species followed a similar pattern in a number of regions within the fishery. The catchrate
of the primary target species &#65533; tiger flathead (Neoplatycephalus richardsoni) &#65533;
dropped considerably from the early, very high, catch-rates. Chinaman leatherjacket
(Nelusetta ayraudi) and latchet (Pterygotrigla polyommata) &#65533; species that were
apparently abundant in the early years of the fishery &#65533; virtually disappeared from
catches in later years. The appearance of greater catches of jackass morwong
(Nemadactylus macropterus), redfish (Centroberyx affinis), and shark/skate during the
war and afterwards was probably due to increased retention of catches of these species.
The disappearance of certain species from the catch may be due to high fishing pressure
alone, or to a combination of fishing pressure, changes in the shelf habitat possibly
caused by the trawl gear, and environmental fluctuations.
Catch-rates in weight per haul per species were standardised to annual indices of
abundance using a log-linear model. Standardised annual index trends for flathead,
latchet and leatherjacket indicate a strong to severe decline over the period covered by
the data. All species showed seasonal patterns, but the peak season varied depending on
the species. The distribution of standardised catch-rate by area also differed greatly by
species, and no single area showed consistent differences across all species. Day trawls
caught more flathead, redfish and latchet, while night trawls caught more morwong and
leatherjacket. Moon phase had less influence on catch-rates than the other factors
examined. Correlation of annual index trends with a number of annual mean
environmental factors was examined and no strong correlations were found.
Annual catches of the major commercial trawl species on the SE Australian shelf were
estimated from recorded total trawl catches, catch species composition from subsamples
and estimates of the rate of discarding. These annual catches, standardised
indices of abundance and biological population parameters were used in single-species
stock reduction models to estimate absolute biomass trends. Biological population
parameters and the biomass estimates were used to calculate management reference
point fishing mortality rates F0.1, Fspr30 and Fmsy. Results showed that simple plausible
population models can be constructed that account for catches over the long period of
time from 1915 to 1961.
Simple mass-balance ecosystem models were built for the demersal community of the
SE Australian shelf for 1915 and 1961 using the Ecopath software. Model inputs were
consistent with a more comprehensive SE marine ecosystem model in development by
CSIRO. The models demonstrate that biomass estimates produced by the single species
stock reduction models can be consistently integrated into simple plausible massbalance
ecosystem models.
Modern stock assessments for the main commercial species in this fishery today mostly
used data collected since about 1985. Abundance indices and total catch estimates from
this study have been used in the most recent assessments for tiger flathead and
morwong, allowing construction of the exploitation history for these species spanning
almost 100 years. Use of the historical information has increased confidence in the
estimates of the modern stock assessments &#65533; particularly management reference points,
and has allowed us to quantify changes in fish abundance that have simply been
documented anecdotally in the past.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">demersal fish</field><field name="subject">South East Australian Continental Shelf</field><field name="subject">fish communities</field><field name="subject">Australian South East Fishery</field><field name="subject">ecosystems</field><field name="subject">tiger flathead</field><field name="subject">Neoplatycephalus richardsoni</field><field name="subject">jackass morwong</field><field name="subject">Nemadactyllus macropterus</field><field name="subject">trawling</field><field name="subject">catch-rate</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060804.154133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conserving urban cultural landscapes : a critical examination of social values in landuse planning decisions</field><field name="creator">Kaufman, Pamela E.</field><field name="description">Increased development pressure in inner city areas of many Australian and North
American cities has resulted in the loss of locally valued cultural landscapes.
Accompanying this process is palpable concern by local residents that their values have
not been taken into account. While architectural and historical values are well
recognised by heritage and planning practitioners, less tangible social values are often
ignored.
This thesis argues that a gap has formed between the process through which people
interact with place and the process of landuse planning. The aim of the research is to
critically examine this gap. Pyrmont and Ultimo, an inner city redevelopment area of
Sydney, provides a context of rapid social and physical change. Open-ended,
unstructured and semi-structured interviews with residents of Pyrmont and Ultimo, and
professionals involved in planning and development provide insight into perspectives
about the consideration of social values in landuse planning.
The results indicate that the loss of valued places may have physical and social
implications on people and place including loss of local character and identity,
increased conflict, resident anxiety and disillusionment with planning processes.
Residents and planners develop strategies for coping, but these do little to improve
limited information flow and understanding. Bridging the gap between the two
processes calls for a stronger link between heritage conservation and planning, in
addition to planning reform. The research suggests the need for formal landuse
planning to recognise the value of situational knowledge and social significance, rather
than rely on technical expertise and physical fabric. Efforts spent on refining methods
for identification and assessment of social value may be better directed towards
developing and improving methods for integrating the concept of social value into the
planning framework.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural landscapes</field><field name="subject">landuse planning</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Pyrmont</field><field name="subject">Ultimo</field><field name="subject">urban development</field><field name="subject">social value</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060807.125523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of remnant patches of Eucalyptus open woodlands on
               the composition, quality and production of native pastures on
               the Southern Tablelands</field><field name="creator">Katijua, Mutjinde</field><field name="description">Clearance of Eucalyptus woodlands has resulted in soil deterioration and lost
agricultural production, due to wind erosion, salinity and soil acidity. Despite
increasing efforts to reverse these trends through Landcare and other revegetation
and agroforestry programs, there is a lack of experimentally-based information
about the effects of trees on native pasture performance.
The study was carried out in a temperate environment (Southern Tablelands, New
South Wales). The altitude at the study sites ranged from 740 to 880m and the
aspect at the experimental plots varied from SE to SW. The nearest site was 16 km
from Canberra Airport and all sites were situated within similar rainfall isohyets as
Canberra Airport. Thus climatic conditions were expected to be similar. Climate
records at Canberra Airport indicate that January is the hottest month with mean
maximum temperature of 27.7 &#65533;C and July is the coldest month with a maximum of
11.1 &#65533;C. Rainfall in the area ranges from 37.5 to 66.0 mm monthly average in June
and October respectively. The main tree species in the study area were Eucalyptus
pauciflora, E. melliodora and E. mannifera. Furthermore, Poa labillardieri, P.
sieberiana, Themeda australis, Danthonia penicillata and Microlaena stipoides
were the most abundant pasture species on the experimental plots. Species of clover
(Trifolium spp.) were also abundant among the herbs.
This study used pasture assessment techniques to quantify the effects of remnant
patches of Eucalyptus open woodlands on the composition, quality and biomass
production of herbaceous understorey vegetation. Microclimate and soil nutrients
were also compared under trees and in the open. In addition, consumption by
vertebrate grazers under Eucalyptus trees and in the open was compared. Tree
density and basal area were compared with herbage standing crop.
Remnant patches of Eucalyptus open woodlands modify the microclimate by
reducing wind reaching the understorey vegetation. However no significant effects
on ambient air temperature and relative humidity were recorded. The effect of trees
on soil moisture was contingent to differences between the four sites and soil depth.
Despite a 13% higher soil organic matter in the top 15 cm of soil under trees, soil
total nitrogen and total phosphorus did not differ from that in the open. Surface soil
pH values were lower (by 0.2 units) under the trees.
No significant effect of trees on pasture species richness was found. However the
classification of quadrats on the basis of species presence showed a distinction
between species composition under trees and in the open at one of the four sites.
vi
The contribution of pasture species to total dry weight on plots under trees and in
the open did depend on the particular species involved and was also contingent to
differences between sites. However at the sites where Vulpia bromoides and Poa
sieberiana were abundant, the two species dominated the biomass under trees.
Whereas Microlaena stipoides var. stipoides dominated the biomass under trees at
two sites and in the open at only one of the four sites.
Pasture total N content differed between sites. Two of the sites had significantly
higher (5.9% and 19.7%) N content under trees. On the contrary, pastures at one site
contained 18.7% higher N content in the open. The total P content was 18% higher
in pastures under trees. Overall, the pasture standing crop under trees was 15% less
than in the open during August to May. Vertebrate grazers consumed about the
same amount of pasture under the trees and in the open at the four experimental
sites.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus open woodlands</field><field name="subject">native pastures</field><field name="subject">Souther Tablelands</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">remnant patches</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060807.130528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systemic cybernetic counselling approach with women who have bulimia nervosa</field><field name="creator">Kayrooz, Carole</field><field name="description">This study examined the effectiveness of a systemic cybernetic counselling approach
with 3 females with bulimia nervosa. Bulimia nervosa is a relatively recent
diagnosed condition (1980). Thus, little is known about the efficacy of different
treatment approaches. The systemic cybernetic counselling approach (White; de
Shazer) which informs family therapy represents a potentially powerful form of
treatment in that it allows a complex construction of the problem.
The research design employed a multiple (3) single case study approach with
embedded units of analyses. The 3 women, aged 17 to 27, were seen over a 2-3
month period for 4-8 one hour sessions. Predicted patterns of non-equivalent
dependent variables were compared with empirically based patterns over time.
Continuous (including pre-, post-treatment and long-term follow up) assessment of
frequency of bingeing/purging was established as well as ratings on other dependent
variables - psychometric measures (Eating Disorders Inventory, Beck Depression
Inventory, Coopersmith Self Esteem Inventory), affective self reports and reports by
others.
Results show that all three clients eliminated bingeing/purging by post-treatment.
Two clients maintained this improvement on all dependent measures at long-term
follow up. The most marked improvements were associated with the least severe
pre-treatment scores.
In the case where the whole family attended counselling sessions, the number of
sessions was reduced.
On the basis of the results, systemic cybernetic counselling procedures hold promise

first of these is a settlement (1904-1916) dominated by the
eclectic concerns of the New Education movement. It is
argued that this settlement was a fragile arrangement held
together by the rhetoric of prominent educationists but
that it did not operate effectively at the classroom level.
The contradictions inherent in it, and the bureaucratic
resistance to which it was subjected, as well as the
practical difficulties faced by teachers, meant that the
settlement disintegrated into crisis when teachers'
frustrations were further aggravated by the effects of the
Public Instruction (Amendment) Act of 1916 and popular
perceptions of declining standards. The hardships caused
by the First World War heightened the difficulties under
which teachers were expected to work, adding to the
turmoil. The crisis which began in 1916 and continued until
Peter Board resigned, was characterized by a preoccupation
with retardation and a growing interest in intelligence and
achievement testing. The third and final chapter examines
the wider social, economic and political concerns of the
period and explores the connection between events in
society and those in the schools.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Peter Board</field><field name="subject">New Education movement</field><field name="subject">Public Instruction Amendment Act</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060807.132229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Report on the use of a draft manual for diagnostic procedures in reading</field><field name="creator">Kemp, D. M.</field><field name="description">The Field Study was designed to investigate some aspects of
content validity of a specially designed Draft Manual for Diagnostic Procedures in Reading. A copy of the Manual is available separately,
but relevant sections of it are appended to this Report.
The Draft Manual for Diagnostic Procedures in Reading
(D.M.D.P.R.) was issued to seventeen students enrolled in the
Graduate Diploma in Special Education. These students were completing
the unit, Curriculum Design in Language and Reading. The
D.M.D.P.R. was compiled as a trial testing instrument which could
be used by the students in their course-work on diagnosis of reading
difficulties. The manual contains three sections, listed below,
which are germane to this study. This Report will focus upon the
procedures of testing which were taught and practised in, and the
results obtained from, trial testing by the writer and the students
within the framework of the Curriculum Design in Language and
Reading (C.D.L.R.) unit.
The three sections of the D.M.D.P.R. which are the subject of
this study are:
1. Diagnostic Procedures in the Assessment of
Reading Readiness.
2. A Rationale for the Measurement of Reading
Performance.
3. The Principles, Procedures and Application
of Miscue Analysis in the Diagnosis of
Reading Difficulties.
The Report will describe and analyse the findings obtained
from Sections 1 and 3. in which information has been obtained from
the course participants in their use of the D.M.D.P.R. Section 2,
an article on theoretical issues in diagnosis of reading processes,
was included in the D.M.D.P.R. to explain to the participants the
rationale of miscue analysis techniques. The explanatory and
descriptive nature of that section will be referred to in this
Report for reference purposes only.
Report on Section 1
Section 1 of the D.M.D.P.R. is a series of five tests which
were designed to trial a method of assessment of the developmental
language and reading status of children aged between 5.6 and 7.5
years of age. The children were rated by their teachers in language
and reading development on a five-point scale, which ranged from
extremely poor, to below average, average, above average, and
excellent.
The tests were administered to nearly 200 children and data
was obtained from 137 of these.
The children comprise a sample who have been exposed to one,
two or three years of reading readiness training and reading
teaching in a wide variety of programs and systems.
The primary purpose of designing the tests was to use
criteria of performance which do not commonly appear in standardized,
normative tests of reading readiness and reading development.
The rationale of the tests was stated in the D.M.D.P.R.
The Report reviews this rationale in Chapters I and II and
the results obtained from the application of the trial tests in
Chapter III.
Report on Section 3
Section 3 of the D.M.D.P.R. proposes a system of diagnostic
testing in reading, known as Miscue Analysis.
The Report attempts to review, in descriptive terms, the
patterns of error behaviour in reading which can be illustrated by
the miscue analysis technique, and to describe the systems of analysis
developed by the writer and unit participants in their investigations
of 130 children who were described as low proficiency readers. This
review is contained in Chapter IV.
Because the miscue analysis technique is diagnostic in purpose,
it would be inappropriate to describe the Section 3 program as
experimental or empirical. Several insights into the uses of the
miscue analysis technique were developed progressively in the C.D.L.R.
unit and these procedures and uses will be the subject of the report.
In summary, the overall purposes of the study were therefore
two-fold:
1. to provide a group of specialist teachers in training
with a manual of diagnostic procedures appropriate to
the assessment of children's reading progress in early
and later stages of reading development; and
2. to assess experimentally the validity of original test
materials to be used in early reading stages, and to
appraise descriptively the efficacy of a diagnostic
procedure in reading in later reading stages.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Draft Manual for Diagnostic Procedures in Reading</field><field name="subject">DMDPR</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">curriculum design in language</field><field name="subject">reading performance</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060807.144533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of necessary skill areas and perceived skill deficits in Australian educational administrators</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Robin B.</field><field name="description">This field study is the result of observations of
stress and disquiet among educational administrators.
Two survey instruments, one to a population of
A.C.E.A. members in five states and two territories
of Australia, and a refined survey to administrators in
two Metropolitan West Inspectorates in N.S.W. were employed.
An attempt was made to look at perceived deficits,
in areas considered necessary skills for educational
administrators, over variables of state, sex, age,
level of institution, government/nongovernment systems,
status, tenure and educational administration qualifications.
From the outset it was realized that the nature of
the study would have to be essentially to generate
directions of future specific research since there was
little Australian research in the areas being surveyed.
This became more obvious as data was collected and
possible causes for stress, perceived deficits, and
the related poor morale multiplied with each set of
comments received.
The only conclusion that could be unequivocal
was that the areas of administrator morale, training,
selection, support, style and role perception are
urgently in need of in-depth research as are the
effects on educational institutions of policy processes,
socio-political factors and community expectations.
Even with a wider literature search it becomes
obvious that there is a need for researchers to
rethink theory in terms of social realities and
human and socio-political possibilities rather
than continue building theories which have little
or no effect on the education received by an
Australian student in the 1980's.
It is equally evident that the solution for
the obvious administrator malaise and powerlessness
expressed by respondents is in their own hands via
a quest for excellence in education, relevance to
society and socio-political understanding.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian educational administrators</field><field name="subject">educational administration</field><field name="subject">ACEA</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060807.152031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Middle schooling program in public schools of Canberra Australia (an exploration of practice in the light of theory)</field><field name="creator">Rafiq, Mah-i-Laqa</field><field name="description">Middle schooling, although a contested phenomenon, has established its position on the huge
landscape of secondary education. The philosophy of middle schooling claims that middle school
has the best organisational structure for meeting the (educational, emotional, social and
psychological) needs of adolescents1. This study is an attempt to see how successful schools of
the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are in implementing the middle schooling program with
respect to the General Design for a Whole School Approach to School Improvement (Hill &amp;
Cr&#65533;vola, 1997), which is used as theoretical framework for the evaluation. The three schools
selected through purposive sampling for this study are considered exemplary for their
implementation of programming consistent with the essential elements of middle schooling.
The literature has recognised that, during last two decades, policy makers, educators, innovative
reformers, and private foundations have manifested enormous commitment and interest in favour
of the middle schooling program. The findings of this study indicate that, with certain
adaptations, each of the three sample schools are implementing the salient features and
characteristics of effective middle schools identified in the General Design and discussed widely
in the literature. Each sample school is making its best efforts to improve the teaching and
learning environment better to meet the needs of adolescents and is implementing middle school
philosophy in accordance with the design. It is unlikely that any school can achieve "perfection"
in all of the areas identified in the selected design (Hill &amp; Cr&#65533;vola, 1997), and the possibilities for
improvement are always there. Certain significant issues related to students&#65533; security and
connectedness are identified as requiring some attention by the school organisation.
The main question of this study&#65533;how responsive middle school reforms are in the enrichment of
the physical, social and emotional growth of adolescents&#65533;has largely been answered positively
in this study. Based on the findings of this study it is concluded that the middle schooling
program is not a wasted effort on the landscape of secondary education in Australia. The results
of this study have certain implications for policy makers, educators and researchers. These
include recognition of the need for teacher training programs to provide teacher training with a
greater understanding of the teaching and learning needs of adolescents and the need for
educators to make extra efforts in making the school environments safe, secure and inviting for
adolescents. Longitudinal studies will be required to determine the long-term outcomes of the
middle schooling program, as claimed by the proponents of the middle schooling movement.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">middle schooling</field><field name="subject">public schools</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060808.120614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the process?  A study of learner autonomy, interaction &amp; technology-enhanced language-learning environments</field><field name="creator">Turk, Deborah</field><field name="description">Is it possible for technological &#65533;spaces&#65533; to be created that can provide a community
atmosphere &#65533; one in which learners are not restrained by pre-determined syllabi and have the
ability to direct their learning according to their own interests, pace and goals? If so, it would
be notable to discover which kinds of interactions might be possible, or might eventuate, and
how the participants in such a learning &#65533;space&#65533; would organize themselves. Also of interest
would be the kinds of power structures that emerged through participant interaction, the
direction/interactions undertaken by the participants and the improvements that could be made
in order to respect and accommodate the differences between learners in a social online
learning space.
In order to further study this hypothesised need to investigate these questions, this researcher
developed an online, English as a Second/Foreign Language learning environment for
advanced adult learners of English. She reviewed the appropriate literature in order to theorise
how to commence this research direction and investigated various learning platforms and
software tools. The result was the development of a multiplatform environment which
consisted of a content management system and a 3D microworld. Tools, exercises and content
were developed and/or gathered as starting points for learners and the various software had to
be learnt in order to orient others on their use. Finally, the environment was trialed over a four
week duration with a group of advanced to native speakers of English (volunteers) and the
results have been presented in this thesis for discussion.
The trial, entitled the ILE Project, attempted to study the problems involved in the technical
development of such spaces, to observe the interactions between the learners in a 3D
microworld and uncover issues relating to its implementation. Some issues raised by the
project concerned techno-literacy, personality-driven interaction differences and
organizational power shifts within the 3D community. This thesis closes with an argument
that redefines the notion of the learner autonomy, proposes certain modifications to both the
pedagogic and technical structure of the online environment and discusses the issues raised in
this research. The latter discussion would require further re-conceptualization of the spaces,
stakes and support structures that educators can create/provide in an attempt to improve online
language learning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learner autonomy</field><field name="subject">language-learning environments</field><field name="subject">learning strategies</field><field name="subject">Integrated Learning Environment Project</field><field name="subject">ILE Project</field><field name="subject">online learning</field><field name="subject">interactive learning</field><field name="subject">language learning</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060809.131915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' perceptions of the impact of inservice courses and their preferences for particular models of inservice</field><field name="creator">Kemp, Rosslyn J.</field><field name="description">The need for inservice training of teachers has increased as the
nature of schooling changes, and underlying philosophies,
structures and theories undergo revision. An understanding of
how teachers perceive inservice courses may assist in designing
inservice programs which best meet the needs of education
systems, schools and individual teachers.
This study examined teachers' perceptions of inservice as it
affects them in their schools, and their acceptance of different
content and structures of inservice models. It also examined
different groups within the teacher sample, to establish whether
differences in gender, the area of teaching they are involved in,
their years of teaching experience, or the number of inservice
courses they attend affect their perceptions.
The subjects for the study were a group of Kindergarten to Year
12 teachers from randomly sampled schools in the Western
Region of New South Wales Department of School Education.
The survey was completed by 304 respondents and a randomly
selected sub-sample participated in a semi-structured interview.
Results of the study shows generally that teachers do value the
impact of inservice courses, both in the classroom and on their
own sense of professional development, and that they have
preferences for particular content and models of inservice

1989 to 1993. A review of the scholarly literature found that the
chaebols were very powerful, but were widely disliked and distrusted by
members of the Korean public. As well as controlling many Korean
businesses, the chaebols influence the media industries through direct
and indirect control. With such influence, and their effort to improve
their image after the Seoul Olympics, the researcher expected rather
favourable images to be reported in the selected press. A total of seven
foreign and domestic newspapers and magazines were selected for the
study, which represented various ownership and readership
characteristics. Hypotheses were established on the basis of the evidence
in Chapters 1 and 2 of the power of the chaebols, and of their recent
concern to improve their public images. Quantitative content analysis
was then used to investigate significant differences in each selected
source in relation to the resource dependencies of the selected
newspapers and magazines. Each source was compared and analysed to
investigate its distinctiveness and their dependencies due to limited
resources. Also, some qualitative content analysis was incorporated to
further investigate the ways the Korean chaebols were reported.
The research found that rather unfavourable images of the
chaebols were often reported in the press, both Korean and overseas.
They were favourably described as a contributor in developing in the
Korean economy, but were unfavourably described as socially
destructive. Our results often contradicted our hypotheses. Also, some
significant difference and similarities of reports about chaebols were
found especially between the Korean and non-Korean press. The more
complex situation revealed by our results was addressed using
Turow's(1984) Resource Dependency Theory. Overall, the study
supported the more complex picture put forward by the Resource Dependency Theory rather than the somewhat simplistic view that sees
ownership as the main influence on media outlets.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Korean chaebols</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">press treatment</field><field name="subject">Resource Dependency Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060810.102157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The audio-tutorial method in biology teaching and an evaluation of its use</field><field name="creator">Khan, Abdul Ghaffar</field><field name="description">The present study is an introduction to the Audio-Tutorial
approach to instruction for teaching Biology and associated
fields and an evaluation of its use.
The audio-tutorial system way introduced in the Biology class
at Goulburn College of Advanced Education in Spring 1975. The 16
students who enrolled in the Introductory Biology course had no
prior knowledge that a self-paced individualized method would be
used. The method of course presentation was based on the audio-tutorial
approach to learning introduced by Professor Postlethwait
at Purdue University. The course material was divided into 10
Study Units each accompanied by a unit quiz. The text was
'Biological Sciences' by Keeton (1972).
For each Study Unit a 'Student Study Guide' and an 'Exercise
Notebook' were prepared by the author in advance. The Study Guide
gives explicit objectives which the students have to achieve and
the activities designed to achieve them. When the student has achieved the objectives, he will take a unit quiz. The instructor
gives help when needed and administers and reviews each unit quiz
with the students as soon as the quiz is completed.
The Study Unit III entitled 'Molds, Yeasts and Mushrooms' was
taught to two groups of 8 students each, chosen at random from
the 16 students who enrolled in Biology course 904111, one
continued using the audio-tutorial system and the other was taught
by a conventional method. The instructional time was one week.
The cognitive achievements of these two groups of students was
compared through a pretest-post test approach. The audio-tutorial
system did substantially better. Data of this experiment are

against the crippling influences of conventional morality. The autobiography of the
late medieval Johannes Faustus is interwoven with the third-person story of the
twentieth-century figure Sybil Wagner. In their different historical contexts they fight
against abuse, violence and depression in order to gain the ultimate objectives of
sexual fulfilment, professional success, and a harmonious relationship with self and
others.
Part I describes the two characters' first encounters with love and death. It shows how
their indomitable spirits cope with the hypocrisy of the adult world, with the confusing
experience of their adolescent bodies, and the puzzling moment of losing their
virginity. Part II describes their respective attempts to find out who they are and what
they want. The structural parallelism between a male and a female Faustus from
different social and historical backgrounds invites the reader to think about the barriers
of historical and gender difference.
Both narrative strands engage in a sophisticated play with the ambiguities of the
archetypal story of transgression and allow for a number of different interpretations of,
for instance, the nature and role of immaterial forces such as the devil. Both narrative
strands portray a credible or 'realistic' framework for the uncanny elements of the
Faustus narrative and thereby explore the borderlines between conventional and
subjective reality.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">novel</field><field name="subject">creative communication</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060811.153839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes towards art competitions of senior secondary art students and teachers</field><field name="creator">Knight-Mudie, Karen</field><field name="description">Growing concern for the popularity of art competitions

external goal of winning a prize may demonstrate that
many students and teachers have not fully considered
the adverse implications of extrinsic rewards on
learning strategies relevant to artistic behavior. On
the other hand the benefit of exhibitions of student
art work appears to be overshadowed by the prevalence
of art competitions.
This study surveys attitudes and perceptions of art
teachers and secondary senior art students towards art
competitions supported by the school.
Subjects include secondary senior art students and
teachers from selected Brisbane Independent Schools.
It appears that participation in art competitions is more frequent in these schools. Results may prove

A.</field><field name="description">This study examined the observed effects of horse-riding which took
place as an extra-curricula activity within the school day. The three
children in the case study were primary aged students from a Canberra
primary school who have an intellectual disability requiring high
support. The criteria for selection was on the basis of how long they
had taken part in the horse-riding programme. The three children
were either just about to start or had just started the programme and
had no previous experience with horses or horse-riding.
The aim of the study was to explore the effects that the horse-riding
programme had on the children's behaviour, attitudes and the way
they communicated when riding. The children's behaviour was
observed in the different settings of the school and the stables
environment. Certain individual behaviours were observed and
recorded on a weekly basis for an eight week period. Audio-recordings
of behaviour took place as well as interviews both before and after the
eight week period, from teachers, riding instructors, helpers, and
parents.
Whilst the case study could not be said to be large enough to be
representative of all children with intellectual disabilities attending
this horse-riding programme, in general some common themes
relating to counselling emerged which corresponded with other
studies referred to in the literature. These include positive effects such
as a general sense of well-being and a feeling of success whilst being in
control of the horse. An emerging empathy and closeness of each
child with their particular horse was observed over time, which
appeared to lead to increased communication. This took place whilst
the children were talking or communicating to the horse or in the
presence of the horse.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">extra-curricula activity</field><field name="subject">primary school children</field><field name="subject">intellectual disabilities</field><field name="subject">horse-riding programme</field><field name="subject">Canberra</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian CApital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060814.095655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study to examine the informal teaching of syntatic structures to grade 8 students to improve reading comprehension</field><field name="creator">Knudsen, Paul</field><field name="description">Kenneth Goodman's view of the reading process

consequently deserves high priority in training and pedagogy. The
current pedagogical literature gives little attention to tone production
on the saxophone. The mouthpiece is the link between the player and
the saxophone. This study examined the effect of the normal
mouthpiece pitch and the pitch range produced on the saxophone
mouthpiece on alto saxophone tone quality .
In this experimental study, recordings were made of forty-three
student alto saxophone players who performed tasks consisting of three
saxophone mouthpiece exercises and four short musical phrases on the
saxophone.
The tape recordings were used to provide a spectral analysis of the
tone samples by Fast Fourier Transform Analysis, and to allow
qualitative analysis by five expert judges. The judges used a
saxophone listening profile to provide qualitative evaluation of the
recordings.
Cluster analysis produced three groups of subjects according to
combinations of the mouthpiece pitch and range produced. The mean
sustained mouthpiece pitch and mouthpiece range of the groups were:
Cluster 1 - 790 Hz and 550 cents; Cluster 2 1023 Hz and 150 cents:
and Cluster 3 - 820 Hz and 1203 cents.
Analysis of variance was used to test for statistically significant
differences between the clusters. Discriminant analysis was used to
identify other variables which contributed to the formation of the three
clusters.
The quantitative analysis of both mouthpiece and saxophone tones
provided no insight into the spectra of the student subjects.
The qualitative analysis using bipolar descriptors provided valid
criteria which could be applied consistently for the analysis of student
saxophone tone. A Tonal Index was computed from the judges' ratings
in order to test for differences in tone between the clusters.
Analysis of variance tests showed significant differences in the tone
produced by the clusters on both the mouthpiece and the saxophone.
The tone produced by Cluster 3 was significantly different to that
produced by Clusters 1 and 2 at the p &lt; .05 level.
Discriminant analysis identified the use of saxophone tone models
(through comparative critical listening) and small group performance as
significant predictor variables (at the p &lt; .05 level) in the formation of
the clusters.
The results of this study suggest that tone production on the alto
saxophone is improved through the development of control on the
mouthpiece. It was concluded that routine practice with the
mouthpiece can serve in the development of a flexible and responsive
embouchure and oral cavity and that students need to develop a
mental concept of saxophone tone as part of the development of tone

for two ESL Korean children's writing (recounting task) in terms of accuracy, fluency
and attitudes. Three different error-correction methods - written comments focusing on
meaning by researcher (Case1), direct and global error-correction focusing on form by
researcher (Case2) and self-directed error-correction using check lists by subjects
(Case 3) - were applied over a period of 7 months. Thirty pieces of recount writing per
subject were collected (10 pieces per case) and analysed by structured criteria of
fluency and accuracy. Through participant observation, the subjects' changing attitudes
were recorded in notes and video tapes.
The results of the analysis showed that for Subject B, who was 7 years old and a more
advanced writer of English than Subject A, self-directed error-correction using check
lists (Case 3) was the most effective method in relation to both fluency and accuracy as
well as attitude. Yet, for Subject A who was 5 years old and an early beginner in her
writing, Case 1 seemed to be more effective in terms of fluency and attitude and Case 3
was likely to be more effective in terms of accuracy. In discussion, the method of error
correction / feedback, the issue of ownership in children's writing including errorcorrection
and the necessity of process writing were highlighted in the light of the

to enable parents to assist their own children in literacy. The children had
previously been identified as experiencing difficulties in acquiring the
skills of literacy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of
the parents' intervention on the children's achievements in literacy, and to
assess the quality of the programme by examining particular subskills taught
in the course. The methods of assessment were also evaluated for their
appropriateness for the circumstances.
The thirty nine children in the study were the sample of fifty two children
for whom there was complete information. Parents of these children began
the programme in July 1985 or in March 1986. They attended a course of ten
sessions over thirteen weeks in a semester. The following semester they
were allocated to a teacher who was a post graduate or fourth year degree
student in education, and given individual assistance from six to ten
sessions, and longer if necessary.
Aspects of oral reading, comprehension, writing and spelling were tested at
the beginning of the programme and again in November 1986, and the results
compared. Observational records were also kept and changes evaluated. In
addition, oral reading was measured at the end of the parents' course, and
before individual assistance commenced. Case studies were built up for
every child, and the findings grouped to observe the effect of the
intervention on the population.
The results showed that the programme achieved its aim of giving parents the
skills to assist; their own children in the acquisition of literacy. The
content of the course and the subskills taught were also justified by the
outcomes. Furthermore, the method of evaluation revealed specific and
succinct information on which to base the intervention and to monitor
progress.
The research took place over 18 months, during which time teaching and
progress were continual. A longitudinal study over several years would
confirm the results of the research.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Canberra College of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">CCAE</field><field name="subject">Australian Schools Commission</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060814.144057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurses' attitudes towards active voluntary euthanasia : a survey in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Kitchener, Betty Ann</field><field name="description">In a country such as Australia which claims adherence to democratic values, it would
appear important that policies and laws on such a controversial and value laden issue
as active voluntary euthanasia (AVE), need to have at least some basis in public
opinion and in that of relevant professional groups. It has been argued that public
opinion may be of limited value due to the public's lack of experience and exposure to
this issue. The opinions of people with more exposure to and reflection on the ethical
issues surrounding euthanasia need to be ascertained. Nurses are one group who
have prolonged involvement with the care of dying or suffering people and their
families. Nurses in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) could be a particularly well
informed group because of the ongoing open debate resulting from four proposed
laws on AVE in this Territory since 1993. The overall purpose of this thesis was to
identify the attitudes of nurses in the ACT towards AVE.
This thesis was supported by a study which provided information on four aspects of
nurses' attitudes towards AVE. Firstly, the attitudes of registered nurses in the ACT
were compared to those of other nurses, medical practitioners and members of the
general public in Australia. Secondly, the associations between characteristics of the
nurses and their attitudes were investigated. Thirdly, the legal conditions which
nurses believe should be in a law allowing active voluntary euthanasia were identified.
Finally, the arguments nurses put forward to support their attitudes towards AVE
were analysed This thesis does not attempt to evaluate the ethical arguments
proposed, merely to reflect the views put forward.
A postal survey was carried out in late 1996 of 2000 randomly selected registered
nurses from the Australian Capital Territory. Responses were received from 1218
nurses (61%).
Attitudes of Nurses:
A majority of nurses who responded, supported AVE as "sometimes right", be it
homicide by request (72%) or physician assisted suicide (71%). A slightly smaller
majority of nurses believed the law should be changed to allow homicide by request
(69%) and physician assisted suicide (67%) under certain conditions. If AVE were
legal, 66% of the nurses indicated they were willing to be involved in the procedure.
Only 30% were willing to assist patients to give themselves the lethal dose, while 14%
were willing to administer the lethal dose to the patient. Comparing these results with
previous surveys, it appears that nurses are less in favour of AVE than the general
public but more in favour than medical practitioners.
Associations between Characteristics of Nurses and Attitudes:
Those nurses who were more likely to agree that the law should allow AVE, were
under the age of 40 years, agnostic, atheist or of the Anglican religion, to have less
contact with terminally ill patients, to work in the area of critical care or mental health,
and to take less interest in the issue of AVE. Palliative care nurses were the only
subgroup without a majority in favour (33%). There is other evidence in the
euthanasia literature indicating that nurses and doctors are less in favour of AVE than
the general public. Taken together with the present findings, it may be concluded that
attitudes towards AVE are more favourable in people who have less contact with the
terminally ill.
Legal Conditions in an AVE Law:
The conditions most strongly supported in any future AVE law were "second
doctor's opinion" (85%), "cooling off period" (81%), "patient must have unbearable
protracted suffering" (80%), "doctor must inform patient about illness and treatment"
(78%) and "patient must be terminally ill" (63%). There was only minority support
for "patient not suffering from treatable depression" (42%), "patient administers or
assists to administer, the fatal dose themselves" (32%) and "patient over a certain
age" (7%). Support for a change in the law to allow AVE was 38% for a young man
with AIDS, 39% for an elderly man with early stage Alzheimer's disease, 44% for a
young woman who had become quadriplegic and 71 % for a middle aged woman with
metastases from breast cancer.
Arguments Supporting AVE Attitudes:
The most common argument in support of AVE was that people should have the right
to control their own lives and thus be able to decide for themselves when and how
they wanted to die. The most common argument against AVE was that of the slippery
slope in which it is feared that the boundaries which society puts on killing will be
extended.
Conclusions: 
This inquiry pinpoints the discordance between attitudes towards AVE and the legal
status of AVE. Parliamentary representatives need to consider the current attitudes of
their constituents, and especially those of relevant health care professionals towards
AVE. It is important that a nursing perspective is represented in any law legalising
AVE and that the role of the nurse is clearly described in relevant legal acts. Future
research would also be beneficial to investigate further the association between the
experience of nurses working in a palliative care setting and AVE attitudes. There
needs to be further debate about the legal conditions required in any future AVE bills.
given the lack of support from nurses for some conditions which have been included
in proposed AVE laws. Furthermore, it would be valuable to carry out surveys of the
opinions of other health practitioners in order to inform legislators. These results
form a baseline to examine the changes in attitudes towards AVE over time and
change in the legal status of AVE.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active voluntary euthanasia</field><field name="subject">AVE</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060814.145314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of seabird by-catch in the Australian Fishing Zone using Japanese longline fishery observer data</field><field name="creator">Klaer, Neil E.</field><field name="description">Data collected by Australian observers, combined with logbook data supplied by
all Japanese vessels fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone were used to estimate
the total seabird catch and catch rates (and associated variances) within the
Australian Fishing Zone by season and area. The species composition of subsamples
of captured seabirds was used in conjunction with the estimates of total
by-catch to provide estimates of by-catch by species.
The total by-catch of all seabird species by Japanese longline within Australian
waters was estimated to be 2,981 (cv 17%) for the 1992 fishing year, 3,590 (cv
15%) in 1993 and 2,817 (cv 19%) in 1994. However, the observed seabird bycatch
may underestimate the total number of seabirds killed by 27%. The increase
in total seabird by-catch between 1992 and 1993 is partly due to the use of
monofilament nylon longline gear by two vessels in 1993, and the decrease from
1993 to 1994 was mainly due to a corresponding reduction in fishing effort.
For the three years examined, 78% of the total seabird by-catch was albatrosses,
with black-browed albatross (Diomedea melanophrys) and shy albatross (D.
cauta) caught in the greatest numbers. Catches of yellow-nosed albatross (D.
chlororhynchos), wandering albatross (D. exulans}, and grey-headed albatross (D.
chrysostoma) were also substantial. The proportions of individual species caught
showed considerable inter-annual variability.
Most seabirds caught and killed by longline fishing are captured during line
setting. Data collected by the observers were also used to determine the influence
of various environmental factors and mitigation measures on seabird catch rates.
Generalised linear models were used to determine the statistical significance of
the effect of each factor on the seabird catch rate. Results show that the
environmental factor that has the most influence is whether line setting was
carried out at night or during the day. For the data examined, the chance of
catching seabirds during day sets was five times greater than for night sets. For
night sets, the chance of catching seabirds during the full half-phase of the moon
was five times greater than during the new half-phase.
Other environmental factors with significant effects were the area and season
fished. Wind, cloud and sea conditions were not found to have a significant
influence. Considerable variation in the seabird by-catch rate among vessels was
found, which is probably due to differences in their implementation of mitigation
measures, as well as the clumped distribution of seabirds by area and time. Interannual
variation in the by-catch rate was found to be statistically significant but
the differences among years was small in comparison to other factors.
An examination of the influence of mitigation measures for sets made during the
day in summer in the Tasmanian area showed that the level of bait thawing and
unidentified factors related to individual vessels were most significant in
determining the seabird by-catch rate, followed by the use of a bait throwing
device. It was not possible to examine the influence of the use of bird scaring tori
poles and lines as these were used during all sets examined in detail. For this data
set, the amount of cloud cover had an influence, while moon phase, sea conditions
and wind strength did not.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seabird by-catch</field><field name="subject">Australian Fishing Zone</field><field name="subject">Japanese longline fishery observer data</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060814.150108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching of English as the second language with particular reference to a Singapore context</field><field name="creator">Kwei, Lai Chin</field><field name="description">This study sets out to examine the language teaching situation of
100 secondary (high) school teachers who are teaching English as the
second language (EL2) in the vernacular schools in Singapore.
The data was collected by means of questionnaires. Questions asked
included the teachers' personal particulars, classroom deviations,
methodology, and preference to teach English as the first language instead
of as the second language. Also considered were their suggestions and
recommendations. Based on the data and the notions of language learning
and teaching strategies, various proposals relating to these areas are
discussed.
Chapter One contains a short outline of the study and its
significance with an overall view of Singapore's education system
emphasizing the bilingual policy. The terminology of English as the first
language (EL1) and English as the second language (EL2) is clarified for
Singapore's local context. This is followed in Chapter Two by a review
of the relevant literature, for example, in the various aspects of second
language learning, the approaches to language teaching and language learning
in relation bo the school curriculum. A discussion on the advantages and
limitations of mail questionnaire and the principles involved in questionnaire
design is also included in Chapter Two, The design of the study
(Chapter Three) involves a discussion on the format of the study and the
protypical procedure.
Chapter Four can be said to be the culmination of the study. It
gives an analysis and interpretation of the data collected from the 100
questionnaire returns. The discussion of Chapter Five is based on what
was discovered in the data, for example, teachers' training, their size of
classes and workload, their methodology and their attitude and suggestions.
An evaluation of the study and the problems involved in the study are also
mentioned in Chapter Five. From the data available, it can be concluded
that the EL2 teaching situation is far from satisfactory. Therefore
various changes are necessary. In Chapter Six, proposals and suggestions
for research are recommended.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school teachers</field><field name="subject">English as a Second Language</field><field name="subject">EL2</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">bilingual policy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060814.151323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the Korean ethnic press in Australia 1985-1990 : an analysis of the backgrounds of editors and publishers and news content</field><field name="creator">Kwak, Ki-Sung</field><field name="description">The present study examined the role of the Korean

The study sample consisted of six Korean ethnic

were identified in interviews with the editors and

quantitative and qualitative content analysis.
The principal finding of this study was that none of
Shoemaker's (1987) theoretical statements about how
economic factors shape news content could be applied to
the Korean ethnic press in Australia. Despite their
reliance on commercial sources for their economic
survival, all six papers devoted more space to issue oriented
news than to event-oriented news, and were not
responsive to their readers and advertisers in
Shoemaker's terms. Journalistic professionalism as
discussed by Henningham (1989) also was treated as a less
important factor by Korean ethnic newspaper staff. Rather
the professional identity of the ethnic press editors and
publishers was grounded in the culture of their local

school climate as an educational issue of major importance
is being recognised in the more recent schooling
effects literature, the actual concept remains somewhat
elusive and vaguely defined. A severe lack of knowledge
and need for study into the area, particularly of primary
school climates, is also evident.
The actual concept of climate is thus discussed
and analysed and evidence in support of the need for its
assessment is presented. Past measures used for climate
assessment are then reviewed with the aim of selecting
an appropriate instrument to identify school climate
perceptions of primary school students in this study.
Here a new area of school climate information - the
quality of school life - was introduced. The Quality of School Life Questionnaire which enabled differentiation
between a number of climate dimensions, was selected as
being the most appropriate instrument for minor modification
and use in this study. The refined version titled
School Life was administered to 587 students from 23
classes in 12 A.C.T. primary schools.
Data was analysed to provide detailed information
concerning students' views of the positive and negative
aspects of their school climate. To determine the
validity of these results and to strengthen the study as
a whole students with very high/very low school climate
perceptions were then interviewed. This enabled more
detailed discussions of these students' perceptions of
school life. Also, it enabled examination of the
possibility of employing school counsellor intervention
techniques at both the school and personal levels aimed
at assisting such students in coping more adequately in
their school systems.
The results indicate that school climate assessment
can provide important information which could be utilized
by school counsellors. In this Study, such assessment
led to actual identification of the high/low quality
areas in school climates and led to identification with
reasonable accuracy of individual students not coping in
their existent climates.
Thus the possibility and the value of school
counsellors working towards 'individualizing' school
climates through either modifying the actual climate or
climate dimension/s to better match student needs, or
through employing intervention techniques aimed at helping
individual students not coping in their particular school
climates is examined and emphasized.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school climate</field><field name="subject">primary school students</field><field name="subject">Quality of School Life Questionnaire</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060815.120659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New order government policies concerning the Indonesian Chinese : policy communication and the role of Bakom PKB</field><field name="creator">Kodhi, Silvester</field><field name="description">The present study deals with the nature of the New Order Government policies toward

consider the policy communication framework toward the Indonesian Chinese ethnic
group in Indonesia, and discuss the New Order Government policies, and the role of the
Bakom PKB within this framework.
Two case studies are used to iluminate the role of Bakom PKB in channeling the
pembauran policy from the government to the society vice versa. In the case of settling
the citizenship status of Chinese descent, the role of Bakom PKB in assisting the New
Order Government in formulating and implementing the pembauran policy is obvious
right from its establishment. While in the case of the development and implementation
of kemitraan (partnership) policy, the Bakom PKB only has a public relation function.
The development and implementation of kemitraan policy is carried out by the
organisation/association/institutions which are included in the pembauran policy
communication networks.
There are also discussions on the New Order Government policies concerning the
Indonesian Chinese in the period 1966 - 1996, and the communication networks that

magnesium concentration, redox potentials and dissolved oxygen
concentration than did Giralang Pond. Water temperature was a minimum
of 4 &#176;C in the winter and reached a summer maximum of 30 &#176;C
Giralang Pond had more organisms but fewer taxa than Ginninderra

high numbers of two numerically dominant species Calamoecia sp. and
Micronecta sp.. More organisms were found in vegetated habitats of
Ginninderra Wetland than open water habitats. The number of

first government senior secondary system in Australia to design their
own curricula and assess their own students under the general direction
of their own college boards and within broad system guidelines.
An Accrediting Agency was set up to approve the courses of study
devised by the colleges, determine assessment procedures, arrange
certification of students' attainments and negotiate acceptance of
students' qualifications with tertiary institutions and employers.
All but one of Canberra's private schools teaching to senior
secondary level also joined this accreditation system.
This field study traces the genesis and development of the A.C.T.
schools accreditation system, and looks in detail at its implementation
at system and college level.
After a brief introduction there is an outline of innovation principles
relevant to the topic. To avoid repetition the literature review and
the development of the accreditation system are treated together in
Chapters 3 and A. Chapters 5 and 6 deal with the establishment and
implementation of accreditation, with particular emphasis on the
Accrediting Agency and Dickson College (used as an example of the
system at college level). In 1979 a major review of the work of
the Agency was undertaken by the Selby Smith Committee; Chapter 7
analyses the recommendations of that Committee. The final chapter
of this study examines some of the major issues of accreditation,
particularly its innovative aspects.
Although this study analyses the accreditation system in some detail,
it is intended to be descriptive rather than evaluative. Information
was obtained mainly from primary sources: official reports, studies

are the desired qualifications of the language teacher
and the program for teacher-training at the college. At
the same time, the first year students of English
are studied in terms of previous learning experience
and motivation.
The next stage brings together institutional
needs and methodological options in a discussion of an
appropriate syllabus for the first year.
1 . The syllabus aims and objectives : that is,
the production of proficiency in the four language skills,
especially the oral skills of speaking and listening.
2. The syllabus content : the general principles
as well as the actual selection of various functions and
topics.
3. The method : examination of an eclectic
method and the teacher's roles in the classroom as well
as the guidelines for more effective teaching.
4. Evaluation: the functions of and the techniques
for evaluation.
A sample of a language unit of the syllabus
follows the discussion of constraints.
After a general discussion of the teaching of
each of the four skills, the study comes to some of the
techniques for developing the oral skills of speaking
and listening, the main objectives of the first year
syllabus.
It is intended that this field study will
contribute a small part to the growing understanding
of the syllabus design which, for a long time, has been
so controversal an issue at the Hanoi Foreign Languages
Teachers' College.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hanoi Foreign Languages Teachers' College</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">syllabus</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060815.142225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of psycholinguistic abilities to reading achievement in a clinical population : a pilot study</field><field name="creator">Langham, Anne Letitia</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psycholinguistic model</field><field name="subject">reading achievement</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060815.142852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the purpose of schooling : a personal clarification</field><field name="creator">Lanyon, Madeleine</field><field name="description">This investigation was prompted by a personal concern about what I
perceived to be unacceptable practices and outcomes in senior
secondary schooling in the Australian Capital Territory. For me, an
unacceptable practice and/or outcome is one which could be said to
contribute to social control by dominant elites. Liberation, in the
sense of the acquisition of personal autonomy based on reason, and
equality, in the sense of parity of esteem or the right of people to
develop differently but within the parameters of concern for others,
are the goals I seek in relation to education and schooling. They are
goals which are ascribed to by many teachers, and which partially
underpin the major reports which prompted and continue to influence
supposedly reformist or progressive moves in secondary schooling in
the Australian Capital Territory in the 1970's. However, an examination
of the framework of these reports suggest that they concealed - non
too deeply - contradictions and invalid assumptions which wider
examination shows to be common also to what we can call the dominant
or liberal educational framework. This framework of ideas, beliefs,
assumptions, values and practices, has come under strong attack in
recent years by those educationists, sociologists, historians and
philosophers whom we can call Marxian. That is, those people who
seek to understand and transform their world within a consciousness
largely informed by those theories and insights which were first given
major prominance by Karl Marx. It is a consciousness which I share. In
my investigation of schooling, and of my part in it, as a teacher, I
have come to the point where I think that the beliefs, assumptions,
and practices associated with the dominant educational ideology do
contribute to the formation of a distorted consciousness; that is,
people in schools do not perceive that they are oppressed, and that
public schooling does not work in what I consider to be the interests
of most people. I believe, therefore, that radical change is needed.
If we assume that the capitalist mode of production and, consequently,
its concomitant set of social relations, are likely to persist in
Australia, we can also assume that radical change will be very difficult,
and a long term goal. However, I believe that teachers can play a
significant role in the development of a more liberating and egalitarian
form of schooling for all children. First, teachers have to develop a
more critical view of the schooling process and in this way enable
themselves to move beyond the limits set up by the traditional and
dominant, liberal ideological framework. They have to develop a
pedagogy based on the concept of consciousness-raising or critical
thinking. This study represents the efforts of one teacher to do just
that.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">senior secondary schools</field><field name="subject">educational ideology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060815.160121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social work and racism : a case study in ACT Health</field><field name="creator">Larkin, Christine M. A.</field><field name="description">A Feminist Action Research methodology was used as a
collaborative process with five ACT Health social workers
based at the Community Health Centres and four at the
Woden Valley Hospital. The primary purpose of the study
was to investigate, both through critical reflection and
action in their work setting, the participants' relevance
or otherwise to Aboriginal people in the ACT and region.
Behind this is the question of how encapsulated social
work is by racism. The impetus for the study arose from
my unresolved concerns regarding these issues, having
been a social worker in ACT Health for 6 years, to 1990.
Decisions on how to proceed involved a process of ongoing
consultation between the participant social workers and
myself. Exploratory meetings were held in March and
April, with an ongoing program being held 2-3 weekly from
June to September, followed by a review in December. Most
gatherings were specific to the Woden Valley Hospital or
Community Health settings. However two half-day workshops
were held for all the participants. All the sessions from
June were taped. Aboriginal leaders were consulted, as
were several managers in ACT Health.
The phenomena of institutional, cultural and personal
racism were addressed by the social workers through
discussion, exercises, and anti-racist initiatives in
their work setting. They found that significant time
restraints presented an example of institutional racism
working against their good intentions. Another dimension
arose from implicitly racist education in social work
courses when most of the participants undertook their
undergraduate courses in the 1960s and 1970s. Aspects
related to professionalism such as its language and
separation of a personal and professional self were
indicative of cultural racism. Stories of personal racism
were shared, in the context of raised awareness leading
to changing those attitudes and behaviours.
The fact that the study took place in 1993 - a watershed
year for Aboriginal/white relations in Australia - seemed
to lead to greater momentum for the project. The social
workers found that participation in this study increased
their knowledge of, and their confidence - both actual
and potential - in interaction with Aboriginal people.
However, they also understood these to be just small
steps towards greater justice for the indigenous people.
An outcome of the project has been involving some
colleagues in similar anti-racist actions to those the
social workers participated in during the time of the
study. The action research project has continued on in
different ways, beyond 1993, despite my withdrawal as
'the researcher' who took the initiative.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Feminist Action Research</field><field name="subject">social work</field><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT  Health</field><field name="subject">Community Health Centres</field><field name="subject">Woden Valley Hospital</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal people</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060815.160708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of metal fabrication curriculum Bougainville Copper Limited</field><field name="creator">Larkins, Adrian</field><field name="description">This is an evaluation study of a Metal Fabrication curriculum developed for

and achievements of the Commonwealth's Parliamentary Standing
Committee on Public Works (Public Works Committee - PWC),
and assesses its utility to parliament. The PWC originated in
1913 as a permanent committee of parliamentarians established to
examine government proposals for public works, and report on
them to parliament. Its purpose is to provide detailed data on
works proposals in order to allow informed voting. In the process
parliament also achieves a degree of control over government
- ministers and public servants. Unlike most parliamentary
audit of government expenditure, the PWC scrutinises proposals
before works are built. It is a joint, statutory, scrutiny
committee.
The proper role for parliamentary committees in general is the
checking of government, through influence, criticism, scrutiny,
and publicity. The PWC is assessed against this role through an
analysis of its legislation and operation, and interviews with
involved parliamentarians and bureaucrats. Criteria used include
adequacy of evidence obtained, precision and clarity of
reports, and degree of influence on government and acceptance of
recommendations. In these terms the PWC has little effect in
controlling policy making by the executive government - cabinet
and ministers. Moreover, specific amendment of its act together
with the consequential effects of nominally unrelated
legislation, have reduced the scope of Committee activities to
an estimated less than half of all Commonwealth public works.
This trend is continuing under current policies of corporatising
departmental activities and excluding the resulting statutory
corporations from PWC examination. These moves prevent parliament
playing its proper role in the governance of the country.
However, within the ambit of its powers, the PWC generally rates
highly against the above criteria, and exerts a significant
degree of parliamentary control over government administration -
the public service - in the implementation of public works.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Commonwealth's Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works</field><field name="subject">PWC</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060816.155712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisations and change : a comparative analysis of seven Australian water authorities</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, A.

to improve the adjustment of students transferring to a new high
school part way through the year by the introduction of a buddy
scheme. During the period between March 7th and September 18th,
1978, 54 new students were randomly allocated to an experimental
group (i.e. paired with a buddy) or to a 'no buddy' control group
for three weeks from the date of their enrolment.
The buddies consisted of 12 volunteers from each of years
seven to ten, who attended four training sessions with the
counsellor (four for each form). The training centred round a
discussion of their feelings and needs when encountering new school
situations and led to a delineation of practical things which could
be done to help new students. Emphasis was also given to
communication skills.
After the new students had been at the school for a
month (or 20 school days), they completed L.S. Wrightsraan's School
Morale scale and a student questionnaire which provided two
measures of adjustment, viz. the students' perception of whether
or not they had formed new friendships and their 'adjustment' to
school. At the end of their first two months, the number of days
absent (apart from those for sickness) were noted.
There was no significant difference between the adjustment
of transfer students in the experimental group compared to the
control group as measured by the four outcome measures. That is,
there was no significant difference between the two groups as
measured by School Morale scores, their perception of the formation
of new friendships, adjustment to school (a questionnaire
measurement) or the mean number of days absent.
Buddies with effective communication skills were successful
in helping new students make a satisfactory adjustment to their new
school. The continuation of the scheme was favoured both by the
buddies and by the transfer students. Buddies felt that the scheme
helped new students to settle in more quickly to the classes and to
make friends. Transfer students felt that the scheme helped them
to learn about the school very quickly, to meet the teachers and to
make friends.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">buddy scheme</field><field name="subject">adjustment</field><field name="subject">high school transfer students</field><field name="subject">School Morale scores</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060816.165315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A psycholinguistic analysis of oral reading miscues of students and teachers' college in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Leamy, Noela M.</field><field name="description">The Review of the Five Year Education Plan (1976-1980)
carried out by the Institute of Applied Social and Economic
Research (IASER,1979) presented thoroughly researched, factual
information regarding the standard of education in Papua New
Guinea. The Review stated that there had been a decline in
standards of education. It claimed that "there [was] the
greatest need for a more highly skilled and dedicated
professional group of teachers" (IASER,1979:61) and that
considerable dissatisfaction had been noted at community level
because of the "reported evidence that many Grade 6 leavers
[were] illiterate" (IASER,1979:24).
Since English is the nationally prescribed language of
instruction at all levels of education, the standard achieved
in English is particularly important. It has been shown that
the skills students have in the use of English "stand out as
contributing most in overall academic prediction" (Ord,1971:8).
It is also claimed that a psycholinguistic analysis of oral
reading miscues following the taxonomy of Goodman (1968,1971,1977)
enables the researcher to examine the subject's total language
competence and that such an analysis can reveal the degree of
bilingualism achieved by second language learners (Allen,1976).
The purpose of this study was therefore, to examine the oral
reading of a large sample of first-year students at Teachers'
College in Papua New Guinea.
It was hypothesised that a pattern of strengths and weaknesses
would emerge from the study of oral reading miscues (Goodman and
Burke,1971). It was further hypothesised that an examination
of the actual problems that were revealed by an analysis of the
miscues would provide evidence to be used as the basis for
recommendations to be formulated regarding the teaching of
Reading in the Community Schools of Papua New Guinea and also
regarding remedial and developmental emphases that might prove
beneficial to students in the Teachers' Colleges.
On the basis of this research it would appear that students
at College level do have "serious reading problems" (Price,1973:
15) and that they are unable to read text judged to be College
level with understanding. Students seemed to have achieved a
certain degree of oral fluency in reading which could be the
result of their skill in using the grapho-phonic and syntactic
cueing systems. However, this fluency was found to cloak a lack
of understanding of content. There was evidence that students
achieved a relatively low level of comprehension when the readings
contained concepts that were familiar; however, when the concepts
contained in the passage were unfamiliar, the scores for Comprehension
were significantly lower. During the retelling of passages read
orally, students gave evidence of a relatively low level of
facility in English expression. It was judged to be doubtful
that in the period of their training those students could acquire
the command of oral English considered indispensible for their
profession in an education system where the English language is
the medium of instruction.
The students tested were the products of the present
national policy of education through English from Grade One.
While changes regarding the optimum academic level of students
to be accepted into Teachers' Colleges, necessary inservicing
of College Staff, appropriate Courses in Educational Psychology
and English Language Method have been recommended, these can
only be seen as remedial. In order to effect the desired
change at the Teachers' College Level it would seem necessary
to introduce change at the level of the Community Schools in
the language of initial literacy.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psycholinguistics</field><field name="subject">oral reading miscues</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">teachers' college</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060816.165908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of visual information processing to interpretation of graphs</field><field name="creator">Lee, Beth</field><field name="description">The aim of this field study was to investigate the relationship between

quality and increased nutrient loads in coastal and inland waterways. Management of
this problem depends on knowing which sources of faecal matter are the cause and
what is the degree and extent of the pollution. Bacterial indicator organisms have long
been the principal method used to test water samples for faecal contamination.
However, none of the currently used bacterial indicators on their own are source
specific enough to distinguish different sources of faecal matter. The use of faecal
sterol biomarkers in conjunction with existing bacterial indicators offers a new way to
distinguish sources of faecal contamination.
This study investigates the sources of faecal sterols, the relationship of coprostanol to
existing bacterial indicators of faecal pollution, the degradation of faecal sterols and the
problem of determining the sources of faecal contamination and the distribution of
faecal contamination using faecal sterol biomarkers. 5p-Stanols (i.e. faecal sterols)
were found to be significant constituents of human, herbivore (i.e. cows, sheep etc.)
and pig and cat faeces. Human faeces contained 73 &#177; 4% coprostanol in relation to
the sum of coprostanol and 24-ethylcoprostanol and primary treated effluent contained
86 &#177; 0.4% coprostanol. Herbivore faeces contained 38 &#177; 4% coprostanol and 62 &#177;
4% 24-ethylcoprostanol whereas pig faeces contained 50 &#65533; 5% of each compound.
Both birds and dogs faeces contained either trace amounts of 5B-stanols or they could
not be detected. Notable differences were observed in the abundance of Closthdium
perfringens spores between the faeces of birds and domestic pets such as cats and
dogs. The above differences were subsequently exploited to distinguish faecal
contamination in Lake Tuggerah. An examination of the relationships between
coprostanol and bacterial indicator concentrations from several environments revealed
that 60 and 400 ng L of coprostanol corresponded to currently defined primary and
secondary contact limits for bacteria measured as either thermotolerant coliforms or
enterococci in the environment.
Four degradation experiments showed faecal sterols and related sterols such as
cholesterol decay at similar rates. An induction period was observed in all
experiments which meant that simple exponential equations to describe the rate of
decay of coprostanol were inadequate; a complimentary log - log transformation of the
data was used and the equation:
Y = l-Exp(-Exp(time x -0.01 + temp x -0.158 + 3.33)) x 100
was derived where Y equals the predicted percentage of coprostanol remaining over
time at a given temperature. In terms of persistence in the environment, Clostridium
perfringens spores &gt; coprostanol &gt; enterococci &gt; thermotolerant coliforms.
Two field studies were undertaken to highlight the use of faecal sterols. In the Lake
Tuggerah study, the results indicated that faecal contamination of receiving waters in
the Tuggerah Lakes during rain events was significant, but was not derived from
human faecal matter; rather it appears to be principally derived from native birds and,
to a lesser extent, domestic pets. In the Derwent Estuary study, based on the
distribution of the faecal biomarker coprostanol, the mid estuary and parts of the upper
estuary (from Newtown Bay to Taroona), were found to be severely contaminated by
sewage. In summary, the use of faecal sterols to trace faecal contamination were found
to be an invaluable addition to the tools water managers use to investigate faecal
pollution.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">faecal waste</field><field name="subject">pollution</field><field name="subject">sterols</field><field name="subject">biomarkers</field><field name="subject">coprostanol</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060816.172519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indonesian satellite technology : a case of technology transfer</field><field name="creator">Leigh, Sally-Anne</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">technology transfer</field><field name="subject">satellites</field><field name="subject">developing nations</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060817.090742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images of technology in organisation and society contexts</field><field name="creator">Leivesley, Robert</field><field name="description">An original project for a taxonomy of organisation-technology became over time
an exploration of some of the meanings and contexts of technology. The
exploration began with the critique of selected instances of landmark
theorising and empirical research on the technology concept.
The critique raised issues in epistemology and methodology which caused this
writer to address the philosophy of the social sciences and the philosophy of
technology at certain points: the question of technological determinism;
language and metaphor; ideology; construct validity. Chapters One and Two
of this thesis reflect the quest for connections in meta-theory, as the
remaining chapters reflect the quest for meanings and contexts of technology
in organisation and society.
The case studies of landmark theory and research on technology led into more
of a generic enquiry into the nature and claims of a contingency theory of
organisation and management. An analysis of landmark cases and of contingency
theory suggested that a formalist or empiricist approach to technology and
organisation had produced no clear conceptualisation of technology, nor of any
other contextual or performance factors. No panacea for organisation-design
has emerged from this quarter.
A rather broader arena of the division and re-combination of labour was then
approached. Analysis suggested that technology and the division of labour are
not mere surrogates of managerial control but arenas continually contested by
organisation and society participants. They are not givens with resident
characteristics to be read out but occasions of choice ongoingly negotiated.
Whereas the thesis began with notions of a static and cognitivist taxonomy it
developed into a study of certain images of technology, with the valencies of
technology deriving from its various contexts of meanings and matrices of
values. The thesis concludes with the view that formalism of much
contemporary organisation-theory needs to be amplified by a broadly
phenomenological understanding.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">organisation theory</field><field name="subject">philosophy of technology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060817.100531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A report on the initial use and evaluation of an introductory text for teachers of primary mathematics</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Gillian M.</field><field name="description">A series of Guides to mathematical content, instructional
strategies, appropriate materials and sources of further reading, in
the form of booklets, was prepared for use in courses in Primary Mathematics Curriculum for undergraduate and Diploma in Education
students. These booklets were intended to take the place of lectures
in the course and act, when discussed in workshops, as initial input
material for the course.
The booklets were prepared also because there is no text
currently available which is suitable for this course. Texts recommended
for courses at other Colleges were examined and whilst many of them are
useful, none is ideal.
It is impossible to isolate the effect of the use of the Guides
from the impact of the course as a whole. Actually, then, the
effectiveness of the total course was assessed as it made use of these
written materials. Teaching procedures for the course are described in
the body of the study.
Undergraduate students were tested, before and after the course,
for mathematical concepts functional at the primary level, their beliefs
about teaching mathematics, and their attitude towards mathematics.
Twelve students were videotaped whilst presenting a number concept
before and after the course and ten other students were interviewed at
the conclusion of the course. A survey was sent to associates* to assess
the effect of the course on each student's teaching of mathematics in
the schools. Diploma in Education students undertook only the first two
sets of tests because their course was very short.
Analysis of the data indicates that the course, making use of these
Guides in place of lectures, was effective. A significant gain in
understanding was made on the test for mathematical concepts by both
groups; a significant change in beliefs about teaching mathematics at
the primary level was found in both groups; there was a significant gain
with the undergraduate group in the ability to present a number concept;
survey forms returned by associates for undergraduate students
showed some increase in the use of concrete materials and the amount of
mathematics taught in the second half of semester; and students who
were interviewed showed that they had realized, at least, what theories
and procedures were being advocated in the course. Suggestions for
changes and improvements in the course are made as a result of this study.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary Mathematics Curriculum</field><field name="subject">education students</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060817.101328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective reading for senior high schools in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Li, Te-yuan</field><field name="description">Reading has always received a great deal of
attention at both junior and senior high schools in
Taiwan. However, reading ability of English after six
years' learning is not satisfactory. The main problem is
that students do not read for the main idea nor for the

reading skills, even at the college level, are limited to
referring to the dictionary and analyzing sentence
structures. The purpose of the present study is to
explore this area; in particular, to determine the causes
of and to provide solutions to the problem of reading
difficulty by conducting a content analysis.
This study focuses on a content analysis in four
areas:(1) Analysis of reading comprehension questions,
(2) analysis of gradation of readability, (3) analysis of
gradation of structures, and (4) comparison of cohesive
ties between Chinese and English written texts using
similar topics.
The text samples to be examined included two areas:
(1) Book Six of The Standard English Textbook. This is
the final volume of the series currently prescribed for
senior high schools in Taiwan, and (2) three texts

Robert B. Kaplan (1966), having analyzed the rhetorical
behaviours of several linguistic groups, claims that different
cultures develop different rhetorical conventions, which
influence the non-English native speaker's way of writing in
English. Recent years have witnessed many developments in
language teaching as a result of research done in sociolinguistics,
yet the implication of Kaplan's finding for EFL
teaching is still unexplored. This paper thus intends to
examine this issue of "cultural differences in the nature of
rhetoric" by comparing the Chinese linguistic system with the
English linguistic system in terms of rhetorical organization
in exposition. The following aspects are to be discussed.
In the first place, an introduction delineates the need
for this Study, its aims, scope and sources of data.
After the Introduction, there is a brief review of the
EFL composition teaching in China and the influence of overseas
composition teaching in foreign language institutes in China
today.
An attempt is then made to study Kaplan's theory by
exploring both Chinese and English rhetorical patterns; and
devices. The emphasis of this chapter is on a comparison and
contrast of expository modes and strategies in the two
rhetorics.
Having studied rhetorical principles in a broad
sense, the report narrows its focus to the differences in
their use of English rhetorical devices between Australian
English native speakers and foreign language learners from
China; the material studied is a selection of compositions
produced by Chinese students and rewritten by Australian
students.
The final section contributes practical suggestions
for EFL composition teaching in foreign language institutes
in China.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese foreign language institutes</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">composition</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">English as a Foreign Language</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060817.130655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Chinese EFL students' social and communicative competence : two teaching strategies</field><field name="creator">Li-Cheng, Gu</field><field name="description">This Field Study Report aims to advocate that the
target culture should also be taught while teaching the
English language to Chinese students. Chinese students
are learning English to communicate and socialize with the
English speaking people. But learning only the English
language is not enough for this purpose. They have to
learn the way the English speaking people express
themselves, their value judgements, and their customs.
In the review of literature, many linguists like Chastain
and Rivers share this same opinion.
English teaching in China started more than one
hundred years ago. The traditional teaching method still
has some influence. The present curriculum appears a
little unbalanced. Some of the teaching materials are
found to be inadequate to teach the target culture.
To illustrate some cross-cultural interferences, a
survey questionnaire was conducted among some Chinese
students and some Australian students. The data obtained
from the survey indicated some selected problem areas for
the Chinese students in talking with the native speakers
of English.
Two teaching aids were designed. One is a fifteenminute
video tape, the other is three simulation exercises.
They demonstrate several cultural conflicts between the
English speakers and Chinese English learners. Both the
video tape and the simulation were trialled among the
Chinese students. They proved to be relatively effective
in teaching the target culture.
The trialling convinced this writer that it was
possible for a teacher of English to prepare teaching aids
such as video and simulation exercises. However, this
may be very time consuming. But the result of the trialling
proved that it was worth the time and effort.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese students</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">English as a Foreign Language</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">teaching strategies</field><field name="subject">social competence</field><field name="subject">communicative competence</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060817.131527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing performance confidence : a holistic training strategies program for managing practice and performance in music</field><field name="creator">Liertz, Carmel</field><field name="description">The thesis aims to address a perceived gap in the training and development of
music performers, namely the lack of a practical strategies framework for
developing performance confidence, especially self-efficacy (situational selfconfidence)
in music performance. To this end, a Training Program with Training
Manual was designed to assist musicians in the management of practice and
performance, using a framework of six integrative mental and physical strategies
taken from Sport Performance and applied to Music Performance. Five musicians
trialed the Training Program for five weeks. Five individual case studies were
constructed to explore and interpret the musicians' practice and performance
experiences before and after using the Training Program / Manual.
Analyses of in-depth interviews and a follow-up questionnaire revealed that the
Training Program had produced positive changes in mental and physical
behaviour, along with increased concentration ability and coping skills in stressful
situations, resulting in a sense of control in performance. A cross-case analysis
revealed that the shared issues of significance for the musicians were
Concentration, Stress and Lifestyle Practices, and Sense of Control in practice and
performance.
This qualitative study demonstrates that a training program addressing the
lifestyle context of music performance is beneficial for practice and the lead-up to
performance. Confidence in playing ability develops, when practice and
performance are perceived to be effectively self-managed and practice becomes a
positive experience. The findings of this study suggest the need for a holistic
approach to music performance, based on awareness of the mind-body
connections involved in performance.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">musicians</field><field name="subject">music performers</field><field name="subject">performance confidence</field><field name="subject">situational self confidence</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060817.132817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different teachers for different students? : The relationship between learning style, other student variables and students' ranking of teacher characteristics</field><field name="creator">Lipscombe, Trevor</field><field name="description">This study examined the influence of selected student
variables (learning style , age, sex, nationality
(birthplace), academic achievement, and social class) on the
ranking of twelve teacher characteristics. 246 ACT TAFE
Associate Diploma in Business students formed the sample.
Results were compared with a similar study by Travis (1987)
of secondary students in Canada and USA.
The extent to which different groups of students prefer
different teacher characteristics has important implications
for the growing practice of student rating of teachers'
effectiveness. This practice (operating under a psychometric
paradigm) currently assumes that any differences of opinion
between student raters are the result of student
carelessness (random error) or bias (systematic error). The
possibility that these differences of opinion are the result
of systematic variation, based on differences between
students, is not countenanced.
This study demonstrated significant (p=&lt;0.05) systematic
variations on four of the six variables studied (age,
academic achievement, nationality and social class) in the
way that respondents ranked one or more of the teacher
characteristics. Comparisons with Travis's results showed
marked differences both in the overall ranking of the twelve
teacher characteristics and in the influence of student
variables on the ranking of individual teacher
characteristics. While Travis also showed that some student
variables influenced the ranking of teacher characteristics,
different relationships are evident. Travis's respondents
emphasised the importance of good, supportive relationships
with their teachers, while in this study, instrumental
characteristics were preferred. This suggests a range of
preferred characteristics across student populations.
Within both studies there is a wide range of opinion as to
the importance of all twelve teacher characteristics. More
than half of the present sample also suggested a range of
additional characteristics which they believed influenced
their learning. These findings support the view that
different students prefer different teachers. They suggest
that some student variables may have a greater influence
than others (e.g. academic achievement level) and that there
may similarly be more agreement on some teacher
characteristics (e.g. Knowledgeablity) than others.
Users of student ratings of teacher effectiveness should be
aware of the paradigmatic limitations of aggregated student
scores. Validity might be improved by using teacher
characteristics which raters agree are important and by
grouping raters for influential student variables.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">teacher characteristics</field><field name="subject">learning styles</field><field name="subject">Travis</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060817.141319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perceived role of school autonomy as a means of controlling significant areas of governance in A.C.T. secondary schools, as seen by the three major administrative components at the completion of the inaugural year of the new educational system</field><field name="creator">Livermore, Ramon Edwin Dixon</field><field name="description">The main purpose of the study was to ascertain the
perceived attitude of system administrators, school board
lay members and teachers in promotion positions to the
degree of school autonomy to be developed as a means for
controlling significant areas of governance in A.C.T.
secondary schools. Sub-problems related to the main
problem were:
1. What are the perceptions of the system administrators,
school board lay members, and teachers in promotion
positions regarding -
(a) the preferred distribution of control to be exercised
by each group?
(b) the perceived attitude of each group of the two other
groups perceptions of the preferred distribution of
control?
2. What are the areas of governance in A.C.T.
secondary schools, where opinions of the three groups
indicate conditions of latent, perceived, and felt-manifest
conflict existing between any two of the groups involved?
3. What areas of governance have the highest level
of perceived concern as indicated for all respondents and
each group separately?
4. Is there any relationship between the degree of
perceived professional orientation of promotional teachers
and,
(a) the amount of school teaching staff control desired,
(b) the level of concern,
(d) the number of conflicts perceived? 
Data were collected with a two-part questionnaire.
The first part was designed to study policy formulation
and was administered to 237 potential respondents. The
second part was modified from Corwin's (1970:370)
professional orientation instrument and was administered
to 175 potential respondents.
Control graphs were used to present the distribution
of control that was preferred by each group, for each of
the twenty-four areas of governance. Balance of control
graphs were used to present the relative location on the
total control spectrum of firstly the three groups of
desired distribution of control and secondly how each
group perceived variations in the distribution of control
between the three groups.
Criteria was established to enable an analysis of
conflict conditions in terms of latent, perceived and
false-manifest conflict. The degree of concern, over
disagreement in each area of governance, was ascertained
by using a five point "Likert" scale.
An analysis of the data indicated that all groups
desired a shift in the balance of control from the previous
administrative dominance-primacy position. However, there
was a significant difference between the three groups
perception of where the new balance should be established.
In particular, teachers in promotion positions were loath
to conceed very much control to the newly established
school boards.
The apparent extent and nature of the conflict varied
among the groups. In terms of latent conflict, five cases
were identified relating to teachers, four cases were
identified relating to system administrators, and three
cases were identified relating to school boards. In terms
of perceived conflict, three cases were identified relating
to teachers, two cases were identified relating to school
boards, and no perceived conflicts were identified in the
case of system administrators. In terms of felt conflict,
thirteen cases were identified relating to school boards,
nine cases were identified relating to system administrators,
and seven cases were identified relating to teachers. In
the terms of possible felt-manifest conflict, eight cases
were identified relating to school boards, six cases were
identified relating to system administrators and four cases
were identified relating to teachers. The areas of
governance concerned with staffing were prominent in many
of the conflict situations identified.
The areas of governance indicating the highest level
of concern were directly related to the areas identified
as having possible felt-manifest conflict. The principle
area of concern was the appointment of promotion teachers
to individual schools.
The study did show a high correlation between a high
level of professional orientation and a desire for increased
school teaching staff dominance-primacy. This indicated
some consultations were acceptable by professional
orientated teachers although ultimate policy formulation
should stay with the school teaching staff. The significance
of this finding, while lending some support to the open
professional model developed as an ideal in the study,
seemed to be counteracted by the limited role perceived
for school boards by teachers involved in the study. This
result tended to imply that the shift in the balance of
* control as far as teachers were concerned, should be
towards a closed professional model rather than towards
an open professional model argued for as the ideal model
for teacher professional development.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school autonomy</field><field name="subject">school governance</field><field name="subject">educational administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060818.130641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whole language and teachers' perceptions of their classroom practice in reading and writing</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Narelle J.</field><field name="description">In NSW during the last decade there has been strong interest in
promoting theories that espoused a naturalistic and wholistic
approach to the teaching of reading and writing.
One such theory is the Whole Language Approach to teaching
reading and writing. The work of Brian Cambourne is integral to
this approach and his theory is that the principles of how young
children learn to become successful talkers can be applied to how
children best learn to become successful readers and writers.
This study was concerned with the teachers' perceptions of their
classroom practice and whether these perceptions - relating to
the teaching and evaluation/assessment of reading and writing -
reflected a whole language approach or a non-whole language
approach.
The results of this study indicate that although teachers perceive
that they predominantly favour classroom practices that are
considered as whole language, they still employ some practices
that are not considered to be whole language. Also, some
perceptions of classroom practice indicate that not all whole
language strategies are popular with teachers.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Whole Language Approach</field><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="subject">writing</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">classroom practice</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060818.131449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese architectonic code : a semiotic study of shop signs in Sydney's Chinatown</field><field name="creator">Lo, Elsa</field><field name="description">This study aims to furnish a semiotic reading of Sydney's Chinatown by
analysing the environmental meanings codified in that particular context.
The basic unit of analysis is the shop sign. Some features underlying sign
formations in Sydney's Chinatown are identified and the communication
process involved in its organisation of meanings and space is explored.
The thesis is organised into three parts. The first part gives an
introduction to the background of study and examines theories on
architectural semiotics and its relation to visual communication. It consists
of three chapters. Chapter 1 defines the scope of the study and outlines the
objectives and goals of research. Chapter 2 focuses on two related fields of
architectural semiotics, viz. semiotics of objects and semiotics of space.
Evaluation of semiotic approaches and behavioural science approaches to
the study of objects and space is made. Some of the theories discussed are
applied to give a profile of shop signs from a visual semiotic perspective. In
Chapter 3 a description of the methods of research and an outline of the
analytical framework of this study are given.
The two chapters of Part Two provide some background information
on various conceptions of "Chinatown". Chapter 4 discusses the
development features of Chinatowns in North America, which reveal that
there are divergent perceptions of Chinatowns. Chapter 5 describes the
development of Sydney's Chinatown and underlines some of its distinctive
features.
In Part Three the results of the study are presented. Chapter 6 focuses
on the codification of meanings realised in Sydney's Chinatown. Chapter 7
is concerned with elements of sign formations and examines the
communicative functions of shop signs in the Chinatown context. The
analyses made in these chapters are intended to identify some features of
sign formations in Sydney's Chinatown within an architectonic system.
The thesis concludes with a summary of the study and a discussion of
the applicability of architectural semiotic theories. It is suggested that
further study can be pursued in the direction that contributes to an
understanding of architectonic systems and social communication.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese architectonic code</field><field name="subject">Syney</field><field name="subject">Chinatown</field><field name="subject">shop signs</field><field name="subject">architectural semiotics</field><field name="subject">architectonic systems</field><field name="subject">social communication.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060818.132847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening comprehension tests for intermediate students at Hanoi Foreign Languages College</field><field name="creator">Loan, Nguyen Kim</field><field name="description">In Vietnam today there is an urgent demand for well-designed tests
of listening comprehension. Little attention has been given to this
problem. This field study is intended to provide guidance on the
design of listening comprehension tests and in particular for
intermediate level students at the Hanoi Foreign Language College
(HFLC).
The Field Study Report consists of six chapters. Chapter One gives a
brief introduction which covers the problem, aims, subjects
(testees) and the background of the Field Study Report.
Chapter Two deals with the purposes of testing in some detail,
setting this in the framework of the teaching-testing link, teachers
and testing, and students and testing. Test characteristics are
considered and the problem of sampling for test content is addressed.
Chapter Three concerns test items for listening comprehension. The
chapter begins with a short description of listening comprehension
and is followed by a survey of theorists on listening comprehension
together with the test items for listening that they suggest. Some
commonly-used standardised tests and their listening items are
discussed.
The chapter ends with a checklist of selected listening items
suitable for students at HFLC in Vietnam.
Chapter Four discusses the designing and trialling of test items for
listening comprehension, such as multiple choice, completion of a
taped talk, matching pictures with statements etc. The chapter
presents the results of the trialling of sample items and also deals
with correlations between the sample tests used.
Chapter Five deals with test design and development in general. It
clarifies the bases for test design and provides a checklist of
steps in the development of tests. In addition, the chapter includes
a resources inventory for listening test items.
Chapter Six presents the conclusions of the Field Study Report.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hanoi Foreign Languages College</field><field name="subject">HFLC</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">listening comrehension tests</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060818.141820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the spoken English of Vietnamese EFL teacher-trainees</field><field name="creator">Loc, Ton That Tung</field><field name="description">This study examines the problems of constructing and
administering a test of spoken English for Vietnamese EFL teacher-trainees. In
an attempt to standardize the assessment, a planned oral interview was pilottested
with a group of ten Vietnamese EFL teachers currently enrolled in a
Graduate Diploma Course in TESOL at the Canberra College of Advanced
Education, Australia. Results of the study indicate that the validity and reliability
of such measurement can be achieved if certain carefully outlined procedures in
planning the test and training the testers are carefully followed.
Given the close relationship between testing and teaching, it is
suggested in this study that there could be an improvement in the teaching of
spoken English to Vietnamese EFL teacher-trainees if (i) the amount of time
allocated to testing oral proficiency in the curriculum was increased, (ii)
Vietnamese EFL teachers were provided with formal training in language test
construction, and (iii) research on EFL oral testing was encouraged. Further,
this study recommends co-operation between TEFL institutions in Vietnam to
develop standard instruments for the assessment of spoken English of EFL
teacher-trainees on a national level.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hanoi Foreign Languages College</field><field name="subject">HFLC</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">spoken English tests</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">English as a Foreign Language</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060818.142405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a syllabus for teaching academic writing to Vietnamese senior students of English</field><field name="creator">Loi, Nguyen Van</field><field name="description">Writing is one of the four macro language skills which a student of
language should master. However it remains the one receiving the
least attention so far in Vietnamese teaching of English. Senior
students of English at a college or university are required to
demonstrate in writing that they have mastered their studies;
therefore, writing plays an important role in their academic success.
It is noted that "learning to write fluently and expressively is the most
difficult of the macroskills for all language users regardless of
whether the language in question is a first, second or foreign
language" (Nunan: 1989:35). Therefore, writing English, especially
for academic purposes , remains difficult for Vietnamese students.
Obviously, such writing, as a study skill, affects the learning process,
hence, the effectiveness of the training. Writing ability in general,
and EAP writing in particular, need attention right from the teacher
training stage, and then at the teaching stage at schools.
This study reviews the theory of writing and the teaching of writing,
with strong emphasis on the writing process to identify the point
where a teacher of writing should intervene to yield the optimum
effect - to develop students' writing ability by developing their
awareness of the strategies which can be applied to writing for
academic purposes, including strategies in analysis of their own
writing as both process and product.
The study examines the teaching of English, writing and academic
writing in the Vietnamese perspective and identifies the problems in
reference to the theoretical bases in an eclectic manner. A syllabus is
suggested to cater for the needs of the target population.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">academic writing</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">EAP</field><field name="subject">English for Academic Purposes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060818.151036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In search of appropriate language testing techniques for EFL tertiary teachers in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Le, Duc Long</field><field name="description">This Field Study Report concentrates on the
appropriate language testing techniques for EFL tertiary
teachers in different foreign language institutions and
centres in Vietnam. It falls into five chapters.
The first chapter is a brief introduction and
an overview of the problems with EFL testing and assessment
in Vietnam. It describes the need for this study,
its general testing terminology. It also describes some
general problems, problems with specific testing techniques
and problems with testing assessment.
The second chapter discusses the role of classroom
language testing, the relationship between language
teaching and testing and the use of different kinds of
tests.
In the third chapter, four qualities of a good
test and instructions to the testee are considered.
After discussing the use of various kinds of
tests, the Study Report examines different EFL testing
and assessment techniques in chapter IV. This chapter
focuses on the pros and cons of major language testing
and assessment techniques such as translation, essay
writing, oral interviews, multiple-choice items, shortanswer
items, cloze tests, dictations, terminal assessment.
Critical comments on these techniques are also
given.
In the final chapter, some practical suggestions
and proposals for EFL testing and assessment in Vietnam
are made.
It is hoped that these suggestions and proposals
will help to improve the present language testing situation

between the ages of 18 and 21.
Adolescence is a developmental stage in which young people feel a need to define their
cultural identity. According to social identity theory, being a member of the group provides
individuals with a sense of belonging that contributes to a positive self-concept. In
particular, young people belonging to ethnic minority groups need a firm sense of group
identification in order to maintain a sense of wellbeing (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979).
The purpose and significance of this study is to update our understanding of how
adolescents from a specific ethnic minority group (Chinese Australian) adjust to the
mainstream Australian culture. The information gathered will be significant to the
wellbeing of these individuals in helping them to come to terms with their own identity. It
will also provide useful information for effective cross-cultural interaction for a range of
services such as education, law, health and social services.
The quantitative and qualitative approaches employed in this study include a questionnaire
and a semi-structured interview. The semi-structured interview complements the
questionnaire in confirming the adjustments of these adolescents within an analytical
framework that is a replica of Phinney's framework (1994). In her research on bicultural
identity orientations of African American and Mexican American adolescents, Phinney
categorised these adolescents under four distinct types of interaction with the mainstream
culture. These are namely: separation (focus only on the ethnic culture), assimilation
(identifying solely with the dominant culture), integration (relating well to both cultures)
and marginality (relating to neither culture). In this dissertation the researcher also aims to
determine the cultural identity of Chinese Australian adolescents in Canberra in the study
using these four categories.
The results of this study demonstrate that this framework is an appropriate analytical tool
for the study of the cultural identity of Chinese Australian adolescents, most of whom
classified themselves as integrated. Overall, Chinese Australian adolescents between the
ages of 18 and 21 in the Canberra region were well adjusted and showed little tension or
stress in relating to their ethnic culture or to the mainstream Australian culture.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural identity</field><field name="subject">Chinese Australian</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">group identification</field><field name="subject">ethnic minority group</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060818.161530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A communication analysis of China's family planning campaigns</field><field name="creator">Luo, Jianguo</field><field name="description">In China, April 13, 1989 was marked as the "1.1 Billion Population Day."
Though it has become the first "demographic billionaire" in the world, China
has obtained remarkable results in population control. According to the
statement issued by China's National Bureau of Statistics in 1987, the
natural population growth rate dropped from 25.83 per thousand in 1970 to
11.28 per thousand in 1985. This has been viewed as an achievement not
previously seen in any other population.
In the past four decades, the Chinese government has adopted a population
policy to organize the fertility transition in a planned way through
education, motivation and persuasion. Five communication campaigns have been
instituted to implement the policy. The successive family planning campaigns
have played a vital role in educating and persuading individuals to accept
the new fertility norms advocated by the government.
In the communication processes of these campaigns, the strategies used have
changed from the media-oriented strategy of the first campaign, to the
introduction of an interpersonal approach in the second followed by an
integration of media, interpersonal and organisational communication in the
three latest campaigns.
The integration of the media and interpersonal communication approaches was
achieved through group discussion sessions and home visits, in which media
messages were mediated and interpreted as a reinforcement to media impact.
The group dynamics in the interpersonal communication has played an important
role in changing individuals' attitudes towards and behaviour of family
planning.
As a campaign is an organized activity which requires organizational channels
to ensure the conduct of the activity and the flow of information, a
well-established organization hierarchy for family planning work has
facilitated the management of family planning campaigns and also been
regarded as a fundemental element to the success of the later campaigns.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">family planning</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">population control</field><field name="subject">population policy</field><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">demographics</field><field name="subject">communication campaigns</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060818.162031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian Capital Territory Primary Principals' Association 1965-1976 : its history, role and development</field><field name="creator">Lusty, David A. R.</field><field name="description">This study has resulted from the author's interest and
participation in the activities of the A.C.T. Primary
Principals' Association over the past six years. For
the last three years of the twelve-year period covered
by the study he was General Secretary of the Association,
and thus had access to the minutes, reports and correspondence
which had accumulated since the inception of the
Association. Additional information has been obtained
through discussions, reminiscences, letters and taperecordings
from members and others who were actively
involved in the activities of the Association.
The History of the Association has been divided into four
stages, corresponding to:
1. The inaugural period, under the direction of New
South Wales.
2. The period of maximum growth.
3. The beginning of the independent A.C.T. Schools
System.
4. The reorganisation of the Association.
The main topics which were discussed within each period
are analysed, together with the reactions of members to
the circumstances which caused those topics to be emphasised,
The analysis has shown that over the twelve-year period
there has been:
1. A series of organisational changes in the structure
of the Association as its membership has increased.
2. A significant trend away from the discussion of
topics which could be classified as Managerial
and towards subjects which could be regarded as
Educational.
3. An increasing use of Guest Speakers at meetings
and conferences.
4. A gradual change in the objectives of the Association
and in the nature of the organisations to which it
has related.
5. Only a very small percentage of members who have
held Executive Office in the Association.
The comments of individuals who have been involved with
the Association over a period of years are used to assess
its strengths and weaknesses, and suggestions are made
regarding ways in which the structure of the organisation
might possibly be improved.
An examination has been made of the Association as a
model-type, and throughout the study there is discussion
as to how its performance equates with the findings of
current literature on Organisational Theory.

the hardest listening skills (Lebauer, 1988). There are various
possible reasons for this: the jargon and specialised words of
the field that are used; also the language that is used is often
at a more formal level; the lecture situation which is unidirectional
with the listener having little role to play, and no
control of the oral message; the expectations that the listener
is assumed to have in listening to lectures which depends on
many factors such as attitude, motivation, linguistic
knowledge and world experience.
Trying to find an answer to where difficulties lie is the
purpose of this study, with the focus on the type of problems
that post-graduate non-native students of English might have
had during their study in a native English academic
environment.
Chapter one presents the purpose and significance of
study, and deals with a few problems in the history of the
teaching of listening in Vietnam.
Chapter two looks at the different developments in
understanding the listening processes in general and listening
to lectures in particular.
Chapter three studies difficulties that non-native
speakers of English may face in lecture listening.

broadband matching to photonic devices such as lasers and high speed detectors.
The thesis is divided into two areas of interest relating to the design of
broadband fiber optic links.
The first area is the application of numerical methods and commensurate
line methods to the design of compact equalisers which allow an improved
transducer power gain over a wide band. It is shown that physically small
equalisers can yield an improvement of 4 dB over a 2 GHz bandwidth.
The second area considered is the distortion inherent in a laser diode.
Detailed measurements of the second order and intermodulation products
are given. A small signal perturbation analysis is presented which helps to
explain the observed distortion products. The results of numerical
simulation of the distortion using a state variable implementation of the full
rate equations and related first, second and intermodulation equations is
presented and possible methods of reducing the distortion are explored. It is
shown that in principle the distortion could be reduced by pre-generating
the distortion and adding an inverted form of the distortion to the
transmitted signal. The distortion can then be corrected in the fiber and
simulation studies suggest that an improvement of 13 dB optical or 26 dB
electrical may be possible.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">broadband matching</field><field name="subject">photonic devices</field><field name="subject">broadband fiber optic links</field><field name="subject">distortion performance</field><field name="subject">laser diodes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060821.095055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tertiary fossil wood in South Eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Jane</field><field name="description">Palaeobotany illuminates past environments by relating the fossilised species to
the existing geological conditions. This has previously been done with fossilised
leaves and spores but not with fossilised wood.
The recovery of a significant quantity of wood from an area of Tertiary sediments
in New South Wales, enabled the used of fossilised wood as a
palaeoenvironmental tool. Tertiary sedimentary deposits of south eastern
Australia are diverse lithologically, occupy distinct areas and are limited in vertical
and horizontal extent. However, samples in museum collections together with
samples from field work and descriptions of fossil wood from previous researchers
enabled an analysis of the fossil wood.
The geological and palaeontological aspects of the fossil wood were considered
for each specimen. Only specimens with precise information concerning location
and description of the sedimentary deposits in which the specimens were found
were investigated. Lithology, sedimentary structures and the relationship with
surrounding geological units were also considered.
The samples were then classified and identified. It was possible to identify fossil
wood to Family level by comparison with existing taxa. In the majority of cases,
identification to species level was not possible due to the lack of detail in the
specimen and because features such as colour cannot be used with fossilised
specimens. With Australian fossilised wood, a systematic nomenclature based on
structure observed within the palaeotaxa, would be more relevant. Comparisons
of cell structures with previous work on palaeoenvironmental indicators was found
to be possible.
Fossil wood has two uses. Firstly, as a local environmental indicator, usually in
conjunction with sedimentological data, assessing the rate and direction of water
flow, types of depositional environments and localised floral assemblages.
Secondly, as an indicator of regional climate. Within any one particular time
period, comparisons between the cellular structures of wood found in different
parts of south eastern Australia show gross changes in cell size, mean growth ring
size and vessel size, which enabled generalisations about climate for each epoch
in the Tertiary.
Palaeoclimatic indicators from the wood concurred with previous climatic
interpretations based on palynology and sedimentology. Cool conditions during
the Palaeocene were clearly indicated by small cells and small growth rings which
gradually increased throughout the remainder of the Tertiary. Several areas e.g.,
Dargo High Plains, where cold conditions existed in isolation could be clearly
distinguished. This corresponds with the gradual northward movement of the
Australian plate with consequent increasing temperatures on the mainland.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tertiary fossil wood</field><field name="subject">South Eastern Australia</field><field name="subject">palaeobotany</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060821.132803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Archaeological and ethnographic painted wood artifacts from the North American Southwest : the case study of a matrix approach for the conservation of cultural materials</field><field name="creator">Odegaard, nancy Nell</field><field name="description">This study examines and demonstrates the value of a matrix approach in the
discipline of conservation and the concerns specific to the conservation of
archaeological and ethnographic objects. The chapters identify the relevance of
the matrix to current conservation practices through a history of artifact
conservation and a discussion of the factors that compromise the conservators'
role in the study and preservation of material culture. The discussion evaluates
the nature of systematic research collections, the impact of legal issues, and the
ethics of including cultural context as important aspects in the development of
the matrix approach.
The matrix approach provides the conservator with a number of variables or
categories of information that may assist in the determination of an appropriate
conservation process. In this study, the matrix approach was tested on a
number of artifact objects. To provide a common link, all of the objects were
characterized by paint on some form of cellulose (wood or a wood-like
substrate). The object cases were from both ethnographic and archaeological
contexts, and the work involved both laboratory procedures and consideration
of non-laboratory (i.e. legal, cultural, ethical) aspects. The specific objects
included (1) a probable tiponi of archaeological (Anasazi culture) context, (2) a
group of coiled baskets of archaeological (Mogollon culture) context, (3) a
kachina doll of ethnographic (Hopi culture) context, (4) a group of prayer
sticks of archaeological (Puebloan and Tohono O'Odham) context, and (5) a
fiddle of ethnographic (Apache culture) context.
By recognizing the unique and diverse aspects of anthropology collections, the
conservator who uses a matrix approach is better equipped to work with
archaeologists on sites, with curators and exhibit designers in museums, and
with claimants (or the descendants of an object's maker) in carrying out the
multiple activities frequently involved in the conservation of objects as they
exist in an ever broadening and more political context.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">matrix approach</field><field name="subject">archaeological objects</field><field name="subject">ethnographic objects</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">artifacts</field><field name="subject">North American Southwest</field><field name="subject">cultural materials</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060822.132115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family policy in the context of education : an integrated        perspective on family policy</field><field name="creator">O'Flaherty, Patrick</field><field name="description">The statement by the Director of the Australian
Institute of Family Studies - that Australia needs a
Family Policy in order to make Australians more aware of
the crucial role of the family in the development of human
competence - provides the benchmark for this study,
A content analysis of Australian and overseas family
policy documents reveals that present approaches are ad hoc
and fragmented - although there is a definite move towards
a developmental and integrated approach.
In this study it is argued that family policy has a
valid role in providing the context of education throughout
the life cycle of individuals, simply because, together with
education (in its widest sense of human development) it
provides the construction of social reality for members of
Australian society.
Three metaphorical models of reality promoted by
different education approaches are delineated:
(i) The Clockwork world of the megamachine and
the image of education as a means of production,
(ii) the Secular Humanistic world of dichotomies and
the image of education as a means of intellectual
growth, and
(iii) The World of Interrelationships and Wholeness
and the image of education as a life long
journey
A review of the literature on the relationship
between family and education reveals an historial development
from separation, through collaboration to integration of
these two important influences in human development.
The central issue identified for policy is that of
the twin horns of a dilemma. Either the terms of policy are
so strictly defined that it becomes a self-limiting selffulfiling
prophecy, or there is no basis at all for
constructive discussion because of the present mass of
unorganised detailed material.
A way out of this dilemma is proposed with the design
of an integrated perspective on the family for use by policy
makers, educators and families themselves. Six interrelated
models of the family (Cultural, Functional, Survival,
Developmental, Legal and Structural) are defined and their
links to the dynamics of an actual family are described.
The implications of this new conceptual tool are
briefly discussed and it is argued that any approach in
policy or practice that ignores the mutlifaceted dimensions
of this integrated perspective on the family is incomplete.

T.</field><field name="description">The writer set out to evaluate the extent to which the Boards of Governors of six provincial high schools in the Highlands of Papua
New Guinea were conforming with the provisions of the 1970 Education
Act and subsequent Departmental directives.
Interviews were conducted with senior officers of the Department
of Education, members of the Boards of the six schools and Mission
Agency personnel. Board meetings were observed by the writer and
records of past meetings and Departmental files were examined.
The writer has traced the development of community participation
and the sharing of decision making in Papua New Guinea education up to
1970 when school Boards were established by the Education Act, as well
as subsequent developments in the relationship between the Department
of Education and Boards of Governors. Histories of the six schools
used as case studies are given, including accounts of the establishment
and development of their Boards of Governors.
In only one function, student discipline, did the Boards appear
to have a largely executive role. This function was regarded by most
Board members as being the area in which their Boards did their most
important work. In some of the other functions listed in the Act and
in subsequent directives, the Boards' role was found to be only a
partially executive one or an advisory or critical one. With some of
the functions assigned to them, there was little or no involvement by
the Boards.
Although the Boards have continued to be viable and to contribute
to the effective running of their schools, they were not being used to
their full potential and there was a need for their relationship with
emerging Provincial Governments to be defined.
The writer collected suggestions for improvements in the
operations of the Boards from the people interviewed and made further
suggestions based on his own observations.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">provincial high schools</field><field name="subject">Boards of Governors</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">highlands region</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060822.142921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Freirean perspective on a Catholic girls' school</field><field name="creator">O'Loughlin, Anne</field><field name="description">This study examines values in the curriculum of one

Major elements of this alternative model include an

behaviours of delinquent and acting out children.
The programme was used at Duffield Place, a
small special school where such children were referred
when it was deemed that they could no longer be catered
for in their home schools.
An examination was made of the five main
theories of delinquency (Psychoanalytic, Biological,
Conditionability, Sociological and Social Learning) and
seven behavioural procedures commonly used with delinquent
and acting-out children (systematic adult attention and
feedback, token economies, contracting, stimulus change,
assertiveness training, time out and generalization
training). The first seven children to finish the
programme in 1981 were then examined, using a case study
approach, to answer two questions -
1. Can acting out and delinquent children be
removed from their home schools and be taught
various skills that will generalize when they
are returned to a home school?
2. Can the. programme be assessed by the staff
and consultants working at the centre?
Criteria used to evaluate effectiveness were
the number of offences involving police contact, whether
the child remained in school until he or she was fifteen
years old, whether the home school reported a decrease in
aggressive/disruptive behaviours and whether there was
an increase in measured self-esteem and attainments. Most
criteria were met with most children and maintained so the
evaluation met the needs of the public schools system.
However functional relationships between particular interventions
and behaviour changes were not established and
evaluation by personnel other than those at the centre
would be necessary to establish these relationships.
Results from programmes like that at Duffield Place
should provide a more complete theoretical basis for
working with delinquent and acting-out children.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Duffield Place</field><field name="subject">behaviour modification strategies</field><field name="subject">delinquency</field><field name="subject">acting out</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060822.144902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The home tutor scheme in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Oner, J. A.</field><field name="description">This study sets out to describe the current situation in the
Home Tutor Scheme in the Australian Capital Territory, and
to evaluate the Scheme's effectiveness in achieving its
goals as listed in the Australian Institute of Multicultural
Affairs Review (1980). These stated goals were: to improve
the students' English language proficiency, to encourage
integration of the students into the wider community, and to
prepare them to attend more formal English language classes.
The writer also considered a further question in evaluating
the Scheme, whether it satisfied the needs and expectations
of the tutors and the students.
There were two sections to the investigation: the main
study, in which the progress of eighteen tutors and their
students was followed for a period of up to six months, and
a subsidiary study that was designed to assess the
generalisability of the data elicited in the main study. A
range of instruments were employed. In the main study,
findings were derived principally from interviews, and from
lesson reports written by tutors. In the subsidiary study,
data were collected by means of questionnaires issued to a
greater number of tutors and to students from the Scheme's
four major language backgrounds.
The introductory chapter sets out the purpose of the study
and explains its relevance in the current Australian
context. This is followed, in Chapter 2, by a review of the
relevant literature and previous research. The design of
the study is set out in Chapter 3, where details are given
of the procedures and instruments employed to gather data.
In Chapters A, 5 and 6, the results of the study are
presented. Discussion of these results and a consideration
of their implications may be found in Chapter 7. In the
final chapter, Chapter 8, the findings are summarised and
recommendations are made for future developments in the
Scheme.
In summary, the study found that in the ACT the Scheme was
achieving some success in its language teaching and social
objectives, and in satisfying its student clientele. It was
also found, however, that the Scheme's operational
efficiency was hampered by the low level of staffing and
that a significant number of tutors withdrew from the Scheme
after a short period because they were not experiencing a
high level of satisfaction. The recommendations made would,
it is thought, lead to greater efficiency of organisation
and could raise the level of tutor satisfaction.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">home tutor scheme</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">English language proficiency</field><field name="subject">language teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060822.145549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of factors affecting the establishment and implementation of a gifted and talented programme in a rural primary and secondary school</field><field name="creator">O'Regan, David</field><field name="description">This research reports on the factors that a sample

evaluation in the Australian Capital Territory. One of its aims was to encourage teachers
and parents to work together in evaluating and developing policy across all areas of school
life: Administration and Management, Finances, Curriculum and Assessment, Staff and
Student Welfare and overall School Climate.
SPRAD is different from other forms of school review in that it is system-initiated but kept
under the control of the participants. The ACT Department of Education and Training
supplies the resourcing and consultative assistance.
One of the hopes for SPRAD was that, in bringing teachers and parents closer together, it
would create a greater understanding of where each group stood in relation to the other
and strengthen parent/teacher relationships.
The focus areas for this study were parent participation in classroom and related activities,
the various channels of information employed within the school such as school
newsletters, reports and interviews, specific notices and letters relaying matters peculiar to
class groups and school sectors, parent/teacher information-sharing sessions,
parent/teacher involvement in board and P &amp; C activities, and other forms of formal and
informal contact.
The study highlights the differences and similarities between teachers and parents in
relation to "professionalism" and "partnership", and areas of conflict highlighted by
Beacham &amp; Hoadley (1979) who discuss the Fortress Model of Schooling, and Darland
(lanni et al: 1975) who writes of the "anyone can teach attitude" displayed by many
members of the public, i.e. the attitude that because all people have had some experience
of schooling, then their opinions on education carry as much weight as those of the
professionals; the feeling that what was good for them is good for their children, because
they have "been there, done that" and teachers do not really know very much more than
they (the public) do.
SPRAD was seen to be a helpful factor in developing some aspects of parent/teacher
relationships. Satisfaction with parent participation in classroom activities had increased
overall despite some drops in actual parent presence at the activities because of the
movement of children into the Senior areas of the school. Another example was the
lessening of the degree of dissatisfaction with teachers' professional development
programmes, especially pupil-free school development days.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School Performance Review and Development</field><field name="subject">SPRAD</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">parent teacher relationships</field><field name="subject">parent participation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060823.160212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compliance with standard precautions and occupational exposure reporting among operating room nurses in Australia</field><field name="creator">Osborne, Sonya Ranee</field><field name="description">Occupational exposures of healthcare workers tend to occur because of
inconsistent compliance with standard precautions. Also, incidence of occupational
exposure is underreported among operating room personnel. The purpose of this
project was to develop national estimates for compliance with standard precautions
and occupational exposure reporting practices among operating room nurses in
Australia. Data was obtained utilizing a 96-item self-report survey. The Standard
Precautions and Occupational Exposure Reporting survey was distributed
anonymously to 500 members of the Australian College of Operating Room Nurses.
The Health Belief Model was the theoretical framework used to guide the analysis of
data. Data was analysed to examine relationships between specific constructs of the
Health Belief Model to identify factors that might influence the operating room nurse
to undertake particular health behaviours to comply with standard precautions and
occupational exposure reporting. Results of the study revealed compliance rates of
55.6% with double gloving, 59.1% with announcing sharps transfers, 71.9% with
using a hands-free sharps pass technique, 81.9% with no needle recapping and 92.0%
with adequate eye protection. Although 31.6% of respondents indicated receiving an
occupational exposure in the past 12 months, only 82.6% of them reported their
exposures. The results of this study provide national estimates of compliance with
standard precautions and occupational exposure reporting among operating room
nurses in Australia. These estimates can now be used as support for the development
and implementation of measures to improve practices in order to reduce occupational
exposures and, ultimately, disease transmission rates among this high-risk group.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">healthcare workers</field><field name="subject">occupational exposure</field><field name="subject">standard precautions</field><field name="subject">operating room nurses</field><field name="subject">Australian College of Operating Room Nurses</field><field name="subject">Health Belief Model</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060823.161225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change detection in the Upper Yarra Valley using Landsat MSS satellite imagery</field><field name="creator">Osburg, Thomas</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">change detection</field><field name="subject">Upper Yarra Valley</field><field name="subject">Landsat MSS satellite imagery</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060823.170057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outsourcing the human resource development function in the Australian Public Service</field><field name="creator">Ostrowski, Romuald</field><field name="description">The Howard Government has made public its agenda to significantly reform the
Australian Public Service (APS). It has presented its vision for a highly efficient
APS which is globally competitive by being customer focused, and by
benchmarking best practice in organisation management. Outsourcing of a
range of internal functions is but one of the strategies Commonwealth agency
Chief Executive Officers are applying or considering to apply in achieving the
Government's vision for a reformed APS.
When examining functions to be outsourced within Commonwealth agencies it
seems that many senior managers see benefits in outsourcing a range of
corporate support functions. Such support functions, which are considered as
potentially being undertaken by private sector vendors, generally include
property management, financial management, payroll services, records
management, human resource management (HRM) and human resource
development (HRD).
In view of the varying impacts different functions have on an organisation it
would be rational to consider the implications of outsourcing each function
separately. All functions are complex and have their own specific impacts on
the organisation. In its own right HRD has a significant impact on an
organisation in that it develops and trains employees, initiates and delivers a
range of interventions to improve performance and brings about a desired
corporate culture.
The idea of outsourcing the HRD function presents an interesting topic for
study. Recent APS reforms, which include outsourcing strategies, provide an
opportunity to examine the practice of outsourcing the HRD function within
selected Commonwealth agencies.
Outsourcing the HRD function, within the Commonwealth context, raises two
basic questions:
&#183; What factors need to be considered before deciding to outsource (or not
outsource) the HRD function?
&#183; What factors do managers within selected Commonwealth agencies
consider before arriving at a decision to outsource the HRD function?
In essence this study seeks to review how HRD and outsourcing generally
apply to the APS. It also critically examines the outsourcing of the HRD
function in certain Commonwealth agencies, and the implication this could have
for ongoing people and organisation development.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Public Service</field><field name="subject">Howard Government</field><field name="subject">human resource management</field><field name="subject">HRM</field><field name="subject">outsourcing</field><field name="subject">APS</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060823.170859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perception and practice in art, craft, and design : an in-service proposal</field><field name="creator">Naar, Noeline</field><field name="description">The intention of this study is to examine the role of art, craft, and
design education in primary and secondary curricula, to outline from a
personal viewpoint what is actually happening in the ACT system of
education, to suggest reasons for what is happening, and to make
recommendations for improving art, craft, and design education in ACT
schools.
The study begins by exploring definitional problems, and examines a
range of views on the nature of art and design before establishing the
definitions upon which the ideological framework of the study is based.
The relationship between art, craft, and design is discussed, including
what they have in common and where they are essentially and significantly
different.
It is argued that there are major misconceptions about the nature of art,
craft, and design and their role in education at primary and secondary
level, and there are perceptual barriers which inhibit the ability of
educators and the community to overcome these misconceptions. They include:
The failure of the majority of art, craft, and design educators,
at all levels, both to define their terms and to develop and
articulate a defensible philosophy which demonstrates the importance
of these areas of education to our community and to our culture and
The failure of the majority of educators outside these specialist
areas but in positions which require them to make or influence
decisions which shape the educational experiences, values, and
future lives of children in their care, to inform themselves about
the role of art, craft, and design in education, or to seek and act
on informed advice.
Supported by visual material, a justification for art, craft, and design
in the curricula of schools is based on ways in which we learn to
understand the world by interpreting information obtained through the
senses, forming concepts, and expressing and communicating ideas, thoughts,
and feelings in various forms of communication including visual
representations. The way we interpret information is influenced
by our environment, learning, and experiences.
The study outlines the structure of the ACT system of education, and
discusses possibilities and limitations for art, craft, and design
education in schools within this context. Uninformed perceptions are
identified as a major barrier to change.
A proposal for long term in-service in art, craft, and design education
for primary and secondary teachers is discussed. The proposal is based on
a holistic approach, with courses grouped as related but independent units,
each capable of further division into modules. When developed the
in-service proposal was a response to perceived needs at both primary and
secondary levels of education, current educational values, existing
economic restraints, and existing resources. The progress of the
proposal is traced from its inception in 1977 to its demise in 1983.
The study concludes by reflecting on major issues, proposing the need
for informed and powerful leadership, and offering a wide range of
recommendations for future action.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">craft</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">in-service proposal</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060823.172527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Video ergo sum : the legitimisation of the post-colonial condition</field><field name="creator">Nacci, Dominique</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">post-colonial condition</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="subject">electronic age</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060824.092736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TAFE and award restructuring processes, a case study : development of skill standards and assessment criteria for the

               industry</field><field name="creator">Naylor, Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the argument that TAFE as an organisation has not significantly changed its concept of its
purpose and place in Australian society over the last hundred years. It concludes that Industry Award Restructuring
may possibly achieve what two world wars, two depressions, one economic boom, international civil rights
movements and technological change could not: TAFE may change substantially over the next decade and move
from its self-concept as an education institution into an overt training role. Due to award restructuring in industry,
new demands will be made on TAFE which cannot be resisted if TAFE is to maintain its position as the primary
provider of vocational education/training.
In the course of the research it was found that it is possible to carry out direct observation of an organisation or
industry without significantly affecting the processes of the organisation. This may be achieved by finding a role
which complements, supports or supplements the organisation's objectives, but in which there are no line
responsibilities and thus little or no interference. Such a role appears to be that of writer of documents, which gives
unlimited access to all parties and sources without influencing either policy or practice. The outputs from the writing
tasks are of value to the target organisation, so that the researcher gives as well as takes, and could be described as
being in a symbiotic relationship with the organisation.
The skill standards and assessment criteria developed during the study are presented as outcomes of a symbiotic
case study, and the success of the method is evaluated by comparing the outcomes with those of other Streams of
the same industry, which have been working on similar document development tasks over the same time period
using traditional methods.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="subject">skill standards</field><field name="subject">assessment criteria</field><field name="subject">Industry Award Restructuring</field><field name="subject">building and construction industry</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060824.094611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The changing role of the A.C.T. government school principal : an investigation of administrators' perceptions</field><field name="creator">Nelipa, Tanya</field><field name="description">This study researched three major areas of the school Principalship within the
Australian Capital Territory government school system. The three major areas of
research concern related to school Principalship were:
1. Changes in the role and responsibilities of the Principal
2. Skills Principals require to perform effectively within the role and responsibility.
3. How the education department may best facilitate and support effective
performance of its Principals.
An outline of the history of administrative and organisational restructuring within the
A.C.T. government education system during the past two decades has been presented
to provide the context of the study. A review of the literature also contributed to the
contextual understanding of the study by examining specific issues and understandings
within the literature. The specific issues and understandings related to:
context and the role of the Principal
concept of the role of the Principal
instructional leadership and the role of the Principal
administrative and organisational devolution and the role of the Principal
The research methodology used to examine the issues central to this study is
qualitative or descriptive in nature, reflecting a phenomenological perspective. The
data was collected through personal interviews conducted with senior administrators of
the A.C.T. government school system and written questionnaires completed by
Principals of the A.C.T. government school system. The data comprises the
perceptions, ideas and beliefs of the two defined groups targeted in the study.
The analysis of responses presented the major findings regarding the perceptions, ideas
and beliefs of the Principals and senior administrators of the A.C.T. government school
system relating to the key research areas of this study. The major findings show that
the role of the school Principal has changed, with Principals requiring a broader array
of skills to effectively meet the challenges of the new role. The major findings discuss
how the education department may best facilitate and support effective performance in
the Principalship.
The conclusions of the study discuss how changes to the role of the Principal have
increased the Principal's workload, with Principals now required to utilise a broader
scope of often new skills to effectively perform their changed role and responsibilities.
The Principal respondents and senior administrator respondents suggest best ways that
the education department may facilitate and support effective performance of the
Principalship. It was also suggested that the amount of professional development and
training was inadequate to facilitate the performance of effective Principalship.
Respondents indicated that incentives such as sabbatical leave for Principals be
facilitated by the education department to ensure Principals' professional renewal.
Finally, the implications of the conclusions of the study address the ways in which the
education department may best assist Principals to acquire the necessary new skills to
effectively perform their changed role. The implications of the conclusions of the
study also address the ways in which the education department may best facilitate and
support Principals' professional renewal. The implications of the conclusions of the
study state that the responsibility for Principals' professional development and renewal
should be a shared responsibility between the school Principal and the education
department.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">principals</field><field name="subject">school administrators</field><field name="subject">government schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060824.095312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural ecology of the Woylie, Bettongia penicillata Gray, 1837, on Island A, Venus Bay, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Lyn</field><field name="description">A study of the behavioural ecology of the woylie (Bettongia
penicillata) was conducted between November 1986 and September 1987
on a population that had been introduced to Island A, Venus Bay in
South Australia. The primary aim of the research was to establish
the reasons for the success of this population of approximately 20
individuals which survives in an environment which is considerably
different from the pockets of forest and woodland habitats comprising
the present range of this species in Western Australia. This
knowledge will assist wildlife authorities to identify suitable
reintroduction sites within the former mainland range of B.
penicillata.
Scat analysis revealed that woylies on Island A consumed a
catholic diet of dicotyledon leaf material, seasonal fruits and
berries, and invertebrates. Endomycorrhizal fungal spores were
common in scats during spring and are possibly derived from the gut
of Scarab beetle larvae that were present in the scats at this time.
Fungi are an insignificant dietary component of woylies at Venus Bay.
The home ranges of woylies on Island A overlapped considerably
and were significantly smaller than the "feeding" areas recorded for
Western Australian conspecifics. Separate "feeding" and "nest" areas
could not be identified on Island A as refuges were dispersed
throughout the home range and were at a density of approximately
three times that reported for Western Australian woylies. The refuge
sites used by woylies on Island A were relatively simple
constructions and contrasted with the more complex double-layered
structures described for mainland woylies. Refuge sites on Island A
were generally located beneath dense bushes. They provided little
protection from prevailing temperature and relative humidity but did
provide cover and ameliorate the effects of insolation. Refuges were
exclusive to individuals. Males maintained a greater degree of
spatial separation from one another during refuge occupation than
they did from females, or females from each other.
No significant difference between male and female body masses
was detected, while the mean body mass recorded in December was
significantly higher than at other times. The woylies at Venus Bay
had significantly lower masses than those reported for a population
of woylies at Tuttanning in Western Australia. The limited genetic
base of the founding population and competition for food among this
high density population are the most likely reasons for the lower
masses of woylies on Island A.
This study demonstrates that woylies can be successfully
introduced into a wild, modified environment if their basic habitat
requirements of suitable cover and diet are met. A broad diet, the
abundance of suitable food species and adequate refuge sites within a
small area, together with the absence of predators and fire, have all
contributed to the success of the woylie population introduced to
Island A. Active management is required to monitor and manipulate
such small populations to ensure that genetic viability is maintained
and the long term survival of the species is secured.
Management: Recommendations
1. Monitor the population dynamics and genetic profiles of wild
woylie populations in Western Australia.
2. Monitor the genetic profiles of woylies on Island A and other
introduced populations.
3. Identify and acquire habitats similar to, and within, those
of B. penicillata's former range, remove stock and exotic
herbivores, implement and maintain predator control measures,
and foster the growth of food species suitable for woylies.
4. Conduct research at proposed introduction sites to
establish the fire regimes that would maintain adequate food
and cover for woylies.
5. Introduce fresh genetic stock from wild Western Australian
populations into the existing small populations in South
Australia and simultaneously cull adults from the receiving
population.
6. Maintain management practices to protect relic populations
in Western Australia and newly established populations at
introduction sites.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Woylie</field><field name="subject">Bettongia penicillata Gray</field><field name="subject">behavioural ecology</field><field name="subject">Venus Bay</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">SA</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060824.103148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The aesthetic order of design, as a unifying concept for an educational programme</field><field name="creator">Nevin, Thomas Joseph</field><field name="description">The aim of this field study is to examine

of oral communicative skills requires a good

and its process of learning. This field study attempts
to review the major theories of language and language

Year 7 to 10 A.C.T. high school. The study emerged at the theoretical level from a
concern that school effectiveness studies focussed too narrowly on student academic
attainment as an indicator of an effective school. A broader view of effectiveness
would hopefully show that in the case of comprehensive co-educational government
high schools, student alienation could have a powerful effect in undermining the
achievement of academic goals in such schools.
Because these schools have little control over their student clientele and require
compulsory student attendance until age 15, it seemed a degree of alienation was
inevitable. The task for high school administrators, it was hypothesized, lay in
minimizing these alienation levels in order to reduce the impact such student
alienation might have on other school effectiveness indicators like teacher
commitment, teacher morale and time on task in classes.
My experience as a practitioner, in the Student Welfare area of a large ACT
government high school, also indicated that the traditional "top down" strategy of
much research in the field of Educational Administration that concentrated on the
perspectives of principals and teachers only gave one view of the processes within a
school. The other, complementary "bottom up" view came from students. In
particular, it was hypothesized, the perspectives the most alienated students in a
government high school held towards the organizational health of the school might
represent an unusual test of school effectiveness.
This was because the commitment of such students towards the school and its stated
academic goals was most problematic. The promotion of a school "culture" or
"ethos" that could integrate low level and high level alienation students, and thereby
foster school effectiveness, appeared to be possible only to the extent that high level
alienation students could be kept on side or neutralized by high school
administrators.
These speculations were largely confirmed in this study. Apart from the interaction
of sex and year level with alienation, the other major finding was that teacher
consideration, or the extent to which teachers show concern for students as
individuals, was the only organizational health dimension that produced a significant
difference between students on the basis of alienation level.
In short, the study is not concerned with student alienation as such. Rather it is
concerned with understanding how alienated students perceive a relatively effective
school. This would hopefully enable that alienation to be minimized and managed.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alienated students</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">organizational health</field><field name="subject">educational administration</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060824.130208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative analysis of English as a second language programs and services in government school systems in Australian states and territories and the nexus with Commonwealth funding</field><field name="creator">Nielson, Pam</field><field name="description">The study investigates the nature and extent of provision
of English as a Second Language (ESL) programs and
services for students of non-English speaking background
(NESB) in government school systems in the six Australian
states and two territories and the interrelationship of
state/territorial education authority provision and levels
of commonwealth funding. The study further examines
perceptions of state/territorial service providers of
where the onus of responsibility for ESL provision lies.
The study is limited to examination of ESL provision at
the school level in government education systems only and
does not address services for adult NESB learners or
provision in the non-government sector.
The study is set in the context of the impact of
commonwealth immigration policies on the nature of
Australia's multicultural society and on the evolution of
provision of appropriate programs and services for NESB
students in Australian government schools.
The major findings to emerge from this study which bear on
the issues identified in the literature and which are of
significance for the future of ESL service delivery are:
&#183; the existence of overall commonality of definition of
NESB students and identification of such students for
ESL programs on the basis of need, but a degree of variation in procedures used by state and territorial
systems which falls short of standard practice and
renders comparative measurement of perceived shortfalls
in provision difficult;
&#183; variation in definition of intensive programs which
renders comparison of provision difficult;
&#183; strong commonality in overall provision of both
programs and services across all schooling sectors,
with limited local variation in service delivery;
an increasing commitment in all systems to the
mainstreaming of ESL provision through language across
the curriculum programs aimed at complementing
specialist ESL provision by enabling mainstream
teachers to accept responsibility for the language
needs of NESB learners;
&#183; variation in degrees of dependence on commonwealth
funding for provision of programs and services ranging
from almost total dependence on commonwealth funding in
two systems to significant local education authority
provision in four systems;
&#183; commonality of opinion among local service providers of
the commonwealth's responsibility for some degree of
funding of ESL provision, but variations in perceptions
of the extent of the commonwealth's responsibility in
this area;
&#183; commonality of experience of initial identification of
need at the local level, but dependence on commonwealth
intervention to approach adequate provision to meet
identified need;
&#183; a degree of tension between on the one hand,
recognition of individual differences among systems and
the concomitant need, or desire, for state/territorial
autonomy in service delivery; and on the other hand,
recognition of commonality of purpose and provision and
the concomitant need for some standardisation of
practice in the interests of efficiency and
accountability of service delivery.
The study concludes with an examination of the
implications of these findings for policy for future ESL
service delivery.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English as a Second Language</field><field name="subject">ESL</field><field name="subject">non-English speaking background</field><field name="subject">NESB</field><field name="subject">government schools</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Governement funding</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060824.132257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of systematic training in effective parenting : a pilot study</field><field name="creator">Norington, Margaret A.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to assess the immediate and
delayed effectiveness of Systematic Training for Effective Parenting (STEP), an Adlerian-based parent study group
programme. STEP is a nine-session, multi-media package
which combines communication skills with basic Adlerian
principles. The focus of the study was the parents. The
dependent variables were: parents' perceptions of their
Target Children's behaviour; parents' knowledge of an
Adlerian approach to child-rearing; and parental perceptions
of their own behaviour and feelings.
Measurement of the dependent variables was by the use of
the following instruments: the Adlerian Parent Assessment
of Child Behavior Scale (APACBS), a 32-item interval scale
developed to assess parents' perceptions of typical child
behaviours dealt with in the STEP programme; the STEP
Questionnaire, a cognitively-based questionnaire based on
the content component of the STEP programme; and individual
interviews held with the mothers in the Experimental (STEP)
Group. The Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design was used
in the study. Both the parents in the STEP and Control
Groups were either clients or potential clients of an
Educational Clinic, or had been referred by a School
Counsellor.
The STEP programme was run with strict adherence to materials
and format by the researcher. Measurements were taken
immediately following the completion of the programme and
again 14 weeks later.
Results indicated significant positive short- and longterm
changes in parental perceptions of their children's
behaviour as measured by APACBS after involvement in a
STEP programme. Short- and long-term changes also occurred
in the parents' knowledge of an Adlerian approach to childrearing
as measured by the STEP Questionnaire. The STEP
Group mothers reported changes in their behaviour and
feelings following participation in a STEP programme.
Some recommendations for further research are: replication
of the study with various populations; studies measuring
actual observed behaviour of the child, and the parent;
effects of STEP as a minor strand or part of an ongoing
parent education programme; the effects of varying levels
of skills of leaders; and the incorporation of video
cassette recordings of the audio tapes in the STEP kit.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systematic Training for Effective Parenting</field><field name="subject">STEP</field><field name="subject">Adlerian Parent Assessment</field><field name="subject">Child Behavior Scale</field><field name="subject">APACBS</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060824.142450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards more effective approaches in teaching oral English to
               Chinese students in EFL teaching</field><field name="creator">Wang, Ning</field><field name="description">This study examines the problems involved in oral
English teaching in the Chinese tertiary institution Erwai
(the Beijing Second Foreign Language Institute). In the
study the author analyses oral English teaching in China
based on his experience as a teacher of English in China,
his two-year study experience as a student in Australia,
interviews with colleagues, and class observation of oral
English teaching by Australian teachers in the C.C.A.E.
Special English Programme. Some materials from Erwai are
also drawn on in the study, such as Erwai-compiled
textbooks and the Erwai teaching curriculum. During the
study the author has referred to many books and journals on
TESOL in various libraries in Canberra. The theoretical
knowledge and teaching techniques learned in the TESOL
Programme at the Canberra College of Advanced Education have
also helped the author carry out this study.
Chapter One introduces the background to the
problems which exist in oral English teaching in China. It
emphasises the importance of Chinese teachers' having a clear
understanding and a good command of a wide range of techniques
in teaching oral English.
Chapter Two examines some approaches now used in
oral English classes at Erwai. This chapter also analyses
students' motivation to learn oral English, the teachers'
performance in oral English classes as well as when and how
to correct students' mistakes in their oral English. Some
practical oral activities which Erwai has arranged for
present students and is thinking of arranging for future
students are also discussed in this chapter.
Chapter Three identifies and analyses in more
detail theories of teaching oral English such as the audiolingual
method, counselling learning, the direct method and
the eclectic approach.
In Chapter Four some activities are suggested to
make oral classes more enjoyable. In second year oral
English classes, repetition and situational dialogue are far
from enough for teaching oral English. Short plays and skits
can be used to enrich the oral English classes. This chapter
also discusses the observation of oral English classes by
Australian teachers in the C.C.A.E. Special English Programme.
Chapter Five considers the choice of materials and
the application of materials in class. Oral English materials
used at Erwai at the moment mainly come from two sources:
home-produced materials compiled by Erwai or other foreign
language institutes in China, and some commerciallypublished
materials imported from foreign countries. There
is another source which can be used in teaching oral English -
materials compiled on the basis of authentic materials such
as excerpts from magazines and newspapers.
In the conclusion it is pointed out that many
suggestions have been made in the study about oral English
teaching techniques and materials.
It is hoped that such suggestions have practical
value in improving the level of oral English in China in
line with the country's present needs. At the same time new
techniques require ample opportunity for trying out in
practice before their full effectiveness will become
apparent.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English as a Foreign Language</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">Beijing Second Foreign Language Institute</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">oral English teaching</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">C.C.A.E.

science-based courses can block the inclusion of green education into tertiary
curricula. In the study, I used a participatory action research approach, embedded in a
critical research paradigm, in order to work with interested students and community
groups as well as academia at the University of Canberra. During the research period,
I aimed to further develop green education on the campus, while observing responses
of academia, students and environmentally related community groups. Data were
analysed using an analytical model linking education with social change.
The thesis addresses the following questions: how do students demonstrate their
interest in environmental sustainability; why are formal studies within an institution
unable to respond to student interest; what characterises the gap between formal
university studies and non-formal environmental education in relevant community
groups; what is green education, how is it put into practice, and does it bridge the gap
between formal studies and community-based environmental education.
The study found that the environmental science-based course at the university was
focussed on the transmission of knowledge rather than the teaching of contemporary
problem solving in the form of green education. The formal environmental education
of the university setting varied greatly in terms of purpose, culture, values and
philosophy from the environmental education of the community, which was
compatible with the theory of green education. Communication between academia
and community groups was minimal. The study also demonstrates that following
student activities, green education has now been implemented in many universities
around the globe, resulting in a breakdown of the barrier between formal and nonformal
education sectors. Students have set-up and maintained links with the green
education practiced by community groups, and have then brought ideas of green
education into universities. Recommendations are made for green education at the
University of Canberra.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">green education</field><field name="subject">tertiary education</field><field name="subject">University of Canberra</field><field name="subject">community groups</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060825.125532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The theory and technology of early colour photographic processes including antipdean heliochromes housed in the Australian War Memorial</field><field name="creator">Nizette, Mark</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">early colour photographic processes</field><field name="subject">antipdean heliochromes</field><field name="subject">Australian War Memorial</field><field name="subject">screens</field><field name="subject">filters</field><field name="subject">colour theories</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060825.130232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining acoustic analysis and phonotactic analysis to improve automatic speech recognition</field><field name="creator">Nulsen, Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of automatic speech recognition, specifically, how

the acoustic front end of a speech recognition system. Temporal reasoning as used
in WAL rules is examined. The use of WAL in recognizing one particular class of
speech sounds, the nasal consonants, is described in detail.
The remainder of the thesis looks at the statistical analysis of samples of spontaneous
speech. An orthographic transcription of a large sample of spontaneous
speech is automatically translated into phonemes. Tables of the frequencies of
word initial and word final phoneme clusters are constructed to illustrate some
of the phonotactic constraints of the language. Statistical data is used to assign
phonemes to phonotactic classes. These classes are unlike the acoustic classes,
although there is a general distinction between the vowels, the consonants and the
word boundary.
A way of measuring the phonetic balance of a sample of speech is described. This
can be used as a means of ranking potential test samples in terms of how well they
represent the language.
A phoneme n-gram model is used to measure the entropy of the language. The
broad acoustic encoding output from WAL is used with this language model to
reconstruct a small test sample.
"Branching" a simpler alternative to perplexity is introduced and found to give
similar results to perplexity. Finally, the drop in branching is calculated as knowledge
of various sets of acoustic classes is considered.
In the work described in this thesis the main contributions made to automatic
speech recognition and the study of speech are in the development of the Wave
Analysis Laboratory and in the analysis of speech from a phonotactic point of view.
The phoneme cluster frequencies provide new information on spoken language,
as do the phonotactic classes. The measures of phonetic balance and branching
provide additional tools for use in the development of speech recognition systems.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acoustic analysis</field><field name="subject">phonotactic analysis</field><field name="subject">automatic speech recognition</field><field name="subject">Wave Analysis Laboratory</field><field name="subject">WAL</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060825.131042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population dynamics and control of feral goats in a semi-arid environment</field><field name="creator">Maas, Sylvana</field><field name="description">The ability of feral herbivores to reduce the amount of food available to domestic livestock has
rarely been quantified. This thesis seeks to examine the degree to which feral goats (Capra
hircus) reduce the availability of pasture and shrub biomass for other herbivores. The
interaction between feral goat populations and their food supply will be explored using a
modelling approach. In addition to this it will also examine the cost of controlling goats and
attempt to identify the cost efficient target densities for control operations. The implications of
this information for management will be discussed.
There are two ways an animal population can interact with its food supply, through: (1)
intrinsic food shortages, and (2) extrinsic food shortages. Intrinsic food shortages occur when a
negative feed-back loop exists between the animal population and their food supply. This
means the animals affect the availability of their food and their food supply affects the
dynamics of the animal population. Since the animals are affecting their own food supply it
could be said that they will also affect the availability of that food to other herbivores if they
consume the same species. Extrinsic food shortages occur when there is no feed-back from the
animals to their food supply. Food availability is determined by extrinsic factors such as
rainfall and is unaffected by the animal population. To determine how feral goats interact with
their food supply several models will be examined, and these include: (1) single species models
which use data from the animal population only. These have historically been used to identify
density dependence which is commonly caused by the animal population being regulated
through their food supply in the case of large herbivores, and (2) trophic models which
incorporate data from at least two trophic levels in an ecosystem, in this case those being the
animal population and the vegetation they are thought to consume. These models allow a more
direct examination of the relationship between the feral goat population and their food supply.
The various models were fitted to data collected on the field sites and the following results
were obtained:
(1) the dynamics of the feral goat populations could not be represented by single-species
models. This was most probably due to the stochastic environment in which they lived
causing the level of density dependence experienced by the goats to vary greatly masking its
presence.
(2) the rate of increase of the goat population could be predicted by the numerical response of
rate of increase to pasture biomass. This demonstrated that food availability influenced the
dynamics of the goat population.
(3) goat density affected the availability of some species of shrub biomass. There was,
however, no response seen in the availability of pasture species to changes in goat density.
Since the study was conducted during a drought this is in agreement with other studies
which indicated that goats will primarily browse during dry spells but switch to pasture
species when conditions improve following rainfall.
These results indicate that a negative feed-back loop does exist between feral goat populations
and their food supply since the goats affected the availability of some shrub species and so they
suffer intrinsic food shortages. This means goats have the ability to reduce the availability of
food to other herbivores providing both are eating the same species.
Cost-efficiency analysis showed that the cost of removing individual feral goats increases
exponentially as density decreases because the search time per animal becomes greater. This
relationship was used to construct a model that predicted the cost of achieving a target density.
The model describing cost of control over density was also combined with a productivity
model based on the numerical response of feral goats to pasture biomass to predict the cost of
maintaining target densities under different environmental conditions. Using these models the
most cost-efficient density identified was 11 goats/km2.
From this study we can make the following conclusions:
(1) feral goats have the ability to reduce the amount of shrub biomass available to other
herbivores during dry conditions
(2) their ability to influence the availability of pasture species remains unknown
(3) given the cost of initial and ongoing control and the minimal benefits that result it would be
difficult to justify controlling goats during a drought on the field sites.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feral goats</field><field name="subject">semi-arid environments</field><field name="subject">Capra hircus</field><field name="subject">population dynamics</field><field name="subject">food supply</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060825.132138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wine tourism in Australia : emergence, development and critical issues</field><field name="creator">Macionis, Niki</field><field name="description">Wine tourism has emerged as a strong and growing area of special interest tourism in Australia, and
as such it has become an increasingly significant component of the Australian regional tourism
product. The Australian Wine Foundation (1996) estimates total Australian wine tourism figures to
be in the order of 5.3 million visits per annum, worth $428 million in 1995 and which is expected
to grow substantially to around $1100 million by 2025. As a consequence, Australia's Federal and
State Governments and regional communities (including regional associations) are recognising the
benefits of promoting their wine districts as tourism attractions in their own right.
While the destinational appeal of wine regions and the concept of wine tourism is generally
acknowledged, research concerning wine tourism development, marketing and impacts is lacking.
Therefore, this thesis examines the nature and potential of wine tourism in Australia, and
documents its historical development and current status. The activities and initiatives of a number
of agencies involved in wine tourism development and marketing are also critically examined, and
significant wine tourism developmental issues are investigated through a case study of the
Canberra District, an emerging Australian wine region.
A number of developmental similarities between rural tourism and wine tourism are noted,
including: a lack of tourism and marketing awareness and knowledge by practitioners, and a lack of
industry integration and cohesion. These issues are compounded by the infancy of wine tourism
and the dominant product focus of wine makers and the Australian wine industry, resulting in the
absence of effective inter sectoral linkages. While a number of tourism agencies and wine industry
associations are pursuing wine tourism development initiatives, the success and sustainability of
these activities is dependent upon addressing various developmental issues.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wine tourism</field><field name="subject">wine regions</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">tourism development</field><field name="subject">tourism marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060825.142128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health related decision making and the elderly : the acceptance of influenza vaccination</field><field name="creator">MacKinlay, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The study set out to determine the influenza vaccination

Prediction of vaccination acceptance was compared using
three measures: stated behavioural intention, report of past

model. In this study no one method of prediction was
obviously better than another.
The most important findings of this study included the
marked variations in vaccination rates based on type of

as the most important factors by both acceptors and nonacceptors

libraries in Australia in 1998-1999. The background to the study lies in some of
the current issues in the information sector, and government responses to those
issues.
The study begins by considering the nature of the Australian Commonwealth
Government, reviewing what government libraries are and whom they serve, and
examining the future trends expected to affect Commonwealth libraries. The
current state of virtual library research is then reviewed, and the need for research
in the Commonwealth library sector examined.
The author reviews the virtual library concept as expressed in the literature in the
field, determines what a virtual library is, and gives consideration to why virtual
libraries are being developed. The issues that affect and are affected by virtual
library development are then examined. Based on this, a model of virtual libraries
is formulated, along with a brief consideration of the possible application,
importance and problems associated with each element of the model.
The research design and methods that were used to gather information for this
study are then outlined, along with the inherent limitations of the research model.
Following this, the findings from a survey of virtual library development in
Commonwealth libraries are discussed. The author then conducts some analysis
of these responses, and makes comparisons between different Commonwealth
library responses, as well as comparisons with virtual library studies conducted in
American and Australian academic libraries.
The research concludes by attempting to reach some conclusions about
Commonwealth virtual library development and the validity of the proposed
model of virtual libraries. Flowing from this, recommendations are made for
further research in this field.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commonwealth libraries</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">virtual libraries</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060829.130944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary school teacher perceptions of the present and future teaching culture : applying the Delphi and Nominal group methodologies as an aid for defining primary school teacher work culture in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Maiden, William</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the views of A.C.T. primary school teachers about their work to
build a picture of the culture of primary school teacher work of primary schools in the
Australian Capital Territory. I define teaching culture to mean the behaviour, work
practices, beliefs and possible habits teachers display in their efforts to perform the task
of teaching. This description of teaching is possibly similar to what some authors
describe as the 'sociology' of teaching (e.g. Barton and Walker, 1981). It is also a
reflection of Deal's suggestion that culture describes 'the way things are done around
here1 (Deal, 1985:605). In this case the study builds a picture of primary school teacher
perceptions of the way things are, the culture of primary school teacher work, in the
A.C.T. primary teaching system.
The study has been designed to identify key workplace issues which preoccupy A.C.T.
primary school teachers now and what they perceive to be the significant issues of the
future, that is by the year 2005. The Delphi methodology was chosen to be the means to
gather and refine information and perceptions from teachers its ability to clarify and
refine issues and because the Delphi has amongst its advantages anonymity for
participants and the use of experts in the data gathering.
The study found that a high proportion of teachers feel stressed about attending
meetings, yet wanting at the same time a say in the running of their school. Other
results were that teachers considered they are poorly supported by the wider community
and that a significant reward of the job was the interaction with the children. Teachers
also believe that instructional methods will be radically different by 2005.
The study aims to provide current information about the culture of primary school
teacher work to teachers themselves and to present to interested authorities and
institutions, such as the Department of Education and Training and The University of
Canberra or the Australian Catholic University, recommendations for further research
and practice to assist in policy design regarding the work teachers do.
Some recommendations to the Department of Education and Training include:
&#183; the culture of primary school teacher work should be actively promoted to inform
the community of the complexity of teacher work and to attract quality applicants to
the profession;
&#183; that classroom teachers are resourced, at comparable levels to Public Servants or
Departmental officers, with equipment such as computers and furniture;
&#183; that consideration be given to providing more inservice opportunities for teachers
to pursue during stand-down (school holiday) time.
Recommendations made to teacher-training institutions include:
&#183; regular research and reviews of teacher-training programs, with particular emphasis
placed on beginning teacher needs and competencies and to highlighting areas newly
recruited and experienced teachers consider require more training;
&#183; the design of comprehensive upgrading programs catering for the needs of newly
appointed and experienced teachers.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary school teacher</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Delphi methodology</field><field name="subject">Nominal methodology</field><field name="subject">teaching culture</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060829.132637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of transition from years 6 to 7 in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Major, Glinda R.</field><field name="description">In 1980, the A.C.T. Schools' Authority through the curriculum
development section together with its curriculum consultants, helped
to initiate and develop a pilot programme In relation to Year 6 students
about to proceed to Year 7. This programme was made possible by the
co-operative participation of both primary and secondary schools, their
principals and staffs. The programme aimed at building bridges between
primary and secondary schools, between primary and secondary teachers
and between the curriculum of primary and secondary schools.
This study began, as has been said,.where a Pilot Programme
introduced by the A.C.T. Schools' Authority, by its Curriculum Development
Section, left off. It aimed to explore further the nature of the 'day to
day' reality experienced by some Year 6 students in the Australian Capital
Territory. In addition, it aimed to explore and gain insights into the
process of transition by following up those students who had been part of
the sample in Year 6. It includes individual perceptions of the process.
In designing research instruments and investigating the process of
transition, certain theoretical concepts drawn from both psychology and
sociology were used to crystallise the observations made. In addition,
earlier studies concerning transition were assessed as well as those in
related areas.
In the process of this field study, many observations were made,
some contradictory, and generally the field study seems to have raised as
many questions as it has answered. As might have been expected, any study
dealing with human reaction is complex-more so when there are different
types of institutions to be considered. Nonetheless it is only apparently

inconclusive enquiries like this which will add to the store of knowledge
and allow assumptions to be replaced by more precise data.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">year 6</field><field name="subject">year 7</field><field name="subject">ACT Schools Authority</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">transitions</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060829.142353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of an airborne thermal scanner (8-12 &#181;m) as an irrigation scheduling tool for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)</field><field name="creator">Malouf, Christopher P.</field><field name="description">Water is Australia's most precious natural resource. The quality, quantity and
availability of this resource is the single factor most limiting agricultural development and
sustainability in this country.
Since the development of Australia's cotton industry in the 1960's, and the expanding
areas of irrigated crop, there has been an increasing demand placed on the limited water
resources of the country. Consequently, the cotton industry has been the target of protest from
conservation groups, residents of rural townships and others farmers engaged in competing
rural sectors. Therefore, cotton farmers need to develop best practice in terms of water use
efficiency. Not only does this make good ecological sense but also good economic sense.
Traditional methods of irrigation scheduling have proven to be subjective and haphazard.
Recently developed methods, while providing more quantitative techniques, do not give a
synoptic view of a field's or region's crop moisture status.
The main objective of this project was to evaluate an airborne thermal scanner (8-12 &#181;m) as practical tool for monitoring the water requirements of an irrigated cotton crop. The
thermal scanner was mounted below a light aircraft and imagery was collected over Field 86 ,
Togo Station, north-west NSW during the summer of 1990/91. The field was divided into
nine treatments for the purpose of this project. Three irrigation regimes (early, normal and
late) with three repetitions were applied to the nine treatments.
A total of fourteen images were selected for analysis. These images were grouped into
sets of AM images, PM images as well as diurnal groupings which were interpreted for three
separate dates during the growing season. Ground based measurements of infrared crop
surface and soil temperature, soil moisture deficit, leaf area index (LAI) and the Crop Water
Stress Index (CWSI) were collected to calibrate the airborne imagery.
Imagery was in the first instance visually interpreted to determine what information
could be gained from this technique. Patterns on the imagery were related to diurnal
variations in soil and crop temperatures. This investigation revealed a number of soil related
phenomena inherent to the field which were influencing the airborne detected temperatures.
While this technique showed variability across the field, the interpretation was somewhat
subjective.
Temperature values were extracted from the imagery in order to conduct an analysis
of variance (ANOVA) between the airborne and ground measurements of infrared crop
surface temperature. In summary, this analysis did not show a strong relationship between the
airborne and ground based measurements. A number of contributing factors have been
proposed as the reason for this variation in the two datasets. Pearson's correlation analysis
was applied to the AM (r = 0.65) and PM (r = 0.32) groups of airborne and ground
temperatures.
Airborne derived calculations of the CWSI were compared to ground based
measurements for the AM group of flights. These derived values were only acceptable in
instances where the ANOVA results had shown them to approximate the ground based
measurements.
While airborne thermal imagery provides a useful tool for determining general
variations in temperatures across a field, there are many additional factors, the most dominant
being the thermal characteristics of the background soil, which influence the detected
temperatures. This technique does not provide the precise quantitative information required
to accurately determine across-field measurement of the CWSI.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cotton industry</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">water efficiency</field><field name="subject">irrigation scheduling</field><field name="subject">airborne thermal scanner</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060829.143622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origins and early years of the Australian Ministry of Post-War Reconstruction</field><field name="creator">Mamchak, Yaroslaw Andreas</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the process by which an Australian policy
of post-war economic reconstruction, the main focus of which was the
achievement and maintenance of full employment, was developed in
preparation for the return of peace at the conclusion of World War II,
and the consequences which that policy had within the Australian
community. Development of a policy of economic reconstruction took
place largely at the instigation of the Curtin Labor government, which
had come to power in October 1941, and which in December 1942 established
a Ministry of Post War Reconstruction with J.B. Chifley as Minister.
Those who were associated with the work of the Ministry in
formulating economic policy were Ministers of the Labor Government and
professional economists. In the contribution which they made, each was
conditioned by the experience of the Great Depression, which motivated
them to formulate a policy of full employment, by their adherence to the
attitudes and values of the groups to which they belonged: the Labor
Party which advocated a move to centralized powers and socialism on
the one hand, and the school of Keynesian economic thought which gave
the economic initiative to governments on the other, and by the
pervasive climate of stringent government direction and control which
the war had brought about.
This thesis argues that the attitudes and values which were
brought to the task of economic reconstruction policy defined the
character of that policy, set limits on its scope, and created
difficulties in reconciling political and economic views. As a consequence,
the policy proposals which were put forward for public debate
and endorsement were inadequately thought through, poorly co-ordinated,
and too radical to be accepted by the Australian electorate. Because
the response of the various interest groups within the community had
not been taken into account when the policy was framed, nor had been
considered when deciding on the measures to implement the policy, there
was considerable opposition to the proposed program of post-war economic
reconstruction. This program, when associated with other apparently
radical policies such as the nationalization of the banking system,
notably contributed to the defeat of the Labor Government in the 1949
elections. The rejection of the post-war reconstruction program might
have been avoided or at least ameliorated had a broader perspective
been taken in formulating the policy and assessing its consequences.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">post-war economic reconstruction</field><field name="subject">full employment</field><field name="subject">World War II</field><field name="subject">Curtin Labor government</field><field name="subject">Ministry of Post War Reconstruction</field><field name="subject">Chifley</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060829.145111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the internet on schools of library and information science in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Manmart, Lampang</field><field name="description">The main purpose of the research is to examine how the Internet has impacted on the schools
of library and information science in Thailand. The study focuses on how it is used and the
resultant changes in knowledge and skill of the academic staff, the teaching and learning
process and the schools' curricula. In the research framework general systems principles
were adapted to explain particular characteristics of the schools and the implementation of
innovation in organisation process was used to clarify the phenomenon of Internet
implementation in the schools' activities. The identification of the different pattern of
change was arrived at by correlation and comparison tests between Internet use, its
impact and the differential among the schools' characteristics and human factors.
Questionnaires were provided to 146 academic staff in 16 schools of library and
information science in Thailand. Sixteen heads of schools and 25 other information
professionals were interviewed and an analysis of each school's curricula was also
carried out.
The results of the study show that the library and information science schools in
Thailand are keeping up with the changes in information and communication
technology. Since 1997 some schools have changed the name of the programs to
Information Studies, Information Science or Information Management. The study
found a correlation between names of the programs, the number of courses and
credits for information technology and the inclusion of the Internet in the curricula.
As well, the visions and goals of the schools were found to be associated with
technology infrastructure and support from parent universities. The study also
found that the Internet has been integrated into the schools as an important part of
their curricula and the teaching and learning process, especially the courses in
information services, information resources and access, and information storage and
retrieval areas. Furthermore, Internet use has impacted on academic staff knowledge
and skills, their teaching methods and activities and their communication patterns
and research behaviour. However, the use and impact of the Internet shows a
correlation with the age of academic staff, their knowledge, skills and experience in
using the computer and the Internet and information technology infrastructure and
support in the schools. As a result of this research study, a new model of library and
information science education in Thailand is proposed which takes all of these
factors into account while considering its application to other countries in South East
Asia.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">schools of library and information science</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060829.162246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of grade 7 social science textbooks in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Mari, Zenzeng Bofirie Tore</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on a study which made an analysis of the new
Grade 7 social science syllabus textbooks that are currently being

data was basically obtained through postal questionnaires.
The basic aim of the study was to find out how the syllabus materials
are received and used in the implementation process. The study also
attempted to identify the problems and difficulties the teachers
encountered and the concerns they had about the new course.
The study revealed some interesting results. For example, there are
some teachers of social sciences in the high schools who do not have
secondary teaching qualifications, the level of English language used,
which was one of the major problems identified with the old
syllabus, has not been completely overcome, the problems,
difficulties and concerns identified by this study differ from school
to school and between rural and urban schools.
In addition, the study also identified many practical problems,
difficulties and concerns which affect the effective and successful
implementation of the syllabus. These include the need for additional
support such as reference materials both for teachers and students
and a need for more short in-service courses to resocialise teachers

W.</field><field name="description">This study examines the friendship patterns of
students in a year 7 to 10 A.C.T. high school using Vertical
Integration as a grouping policy.
The origins of this study can be found in the
school's policy developed in 1976 and favouring vertical
integration on the basis of perceived social benefits.
In the development of teaching strategies at
Melba High, Vertical Integration has been used with all
year groups in all subject areas.
Over the last three years teachers have questioned
the validity of this policy.
This study arose out of the demand by staff for
more detailed understanding of group formation processes
generally and of the link between group formation and
school grouping policies at Melba High in particular.
The approach used to generate data was an action
research design that could feed information to the school
decision-making processes.
The key findings of the study were that;
(a) whatever form of Vertical Integration was used,
students still worked in age and sex groups by choice.
(b) students tended to form friendships on a subschool
basis.
Recommendations resulting from these findings have been
implemented in the present planning of Melba High School. The
format for Vertical Integration (the method of combining years
7,8,9 and 10 in classes) has been modified to combine adjacent
year groups only. (viz. years 7 and 8 as one group and years
9 and 10 as another).</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">friendship patterns</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">open plan</field><field name="subject">Melba High</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">Vertical Integration</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060831.121619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artifacts conservation : bronzes, bones, bowls and boxes : a

under the supervision of Mrs. Patricia Johnson, the Conservator
of the Nicholson Museum of Antiquities, the University of Sydney.
My area of specialization was in the conservation of artifacts.
The majority of artifacts examined and treated during the
Internship were from archaeological excavations in the Middle
East, at the site of Pella, in Jordan. The site of Pella has
produced artifacts from a wide chronological range ; Neolithic,
Bronze Age, Iron Age, Hellenistic (Greek), Roman, and Arabic
historical periods. A selection of these artifacts has been granted
to the University of Sydney by the Jordanian government, and
constitute the present Pella Collection.
Most of the materials are inorganic, i.e. ceramics, metals,
glass, and stone, although bone and ivory artifacts, as well
as skeletal material, form a part of the collection. Upon an
initial examination of the collection, conservation problems
were identified and a program of conservation work for the
collection was formulated.
Priority treatment was given to the metals in the collection,
particularly to the small bronzes which were found to be
suffering from "bronze disease" (active corrosion), to ceramics
needed for study and display, and to glass with unstable surfaces.
Improvements in storage conditions for the Pella Collection,
particularly in the packing of small finds and the storage of
metals, were also given a high priority.
Taken altogether, the Pella Collection has proved to be a wellbalanced
collection, covering almost every period of Kiddle
Eastern Archaeology, and containing artifacts representative
of most types of materials and of ancient technology. Planned
as a research and teaching collection for the students of the
Department of Archaeology, the University of Sydney, it also
proved to be an excellent teaching collection for a student
of materials conservation.
The following, therefore, is a report on my Internship in
Archaeological Conservation, and includes a description of
the institution which sponsored the Internship, a description
of both the program of work and the program of instruction
for the Internship, detailed descriptions of all conservation
work and other activities which were undertaken as part of the:

                with application to a Tasmanian Centre for Continuing
               Education of Teachers course in aboriginal studies</field><field name="creator">Marshall, G. B.</field><field name="description">The following study, in examining theoretical
constructs and their practical implications, as
they relate to organization management, innovation,
and ethnicity, notes the inter-relationship of all
aspects of administration. It also recognizes that
organizations are social entities which have a nonrational
component. These non-rational elements
can lead to prejudice, discrimination, and hostility,
particularly across organizations and across
ethnic boundaries.
In the field of education it is contended
that innovation or change is only acceptable where
effective communication across all involved groups
occurs; and in ethnic settings educators must heed
the feelings of the ethnic community accepting that
the community has knowledge about its culture that
they do not possess. Educators are often unprepared,
or unwilling, to do this, hence the move
towards change stagnates, and hostility between the
groups festers. To overcome the stalemate appropriate
cultural forms of communication between the
participating groups must be established.
To demonstrate the application of the various
theories under review, an inter-organizational
conflict situation between the University of Tasmania
and the Tasmanian Aboriginal Education Consultative
Committee was examined. The reasons leading
to the conflict are cited, along with their relevance
to theory, and proposals to overcome the
obstructions facing each group are delineated. In
putting forward these notions there is a realization
that closer bonds must be forged between the
University and the TAECC if the conflict is to be
resolved. To do this it is advocated that the
change strategy, Organization Development, be utilized,
using outside change agents who are acceptable
to both organizations.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">University of Tasmania</field><field name="subject">Tasmanian Aboriginal Education Consultative Committee</field><field name="subject">innovation</field><field name="subject">orgaizational development</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060907.100512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An intensive language unit : its establishment and early years</field><field name="creator">Martin, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">A participant-observation study was carried out of
a centre providing intensive English instruction for
newly arrived, migrant adolescents. This study was
conducted during a period of fifteen months from late
in 1978 to the end of 1979, by which time the Intensive Language Unit had been operating for three and a half
years.
Part of the study traced the establishment of the
Unit as an independent body within the A.C.T. secondary
education system. This involved an examination of the
process by which the Unit was set up in 1976, and of the
context in preceding years of general developments in
migrant education throughout Australia and, in particular,
those occurring in the A.C.T.
Data collected during 1979 dealt with this background
and also with the Unit's operation and role in the A.C.T.
in 1979. Some of this data was documentary evidence but
a considerable part consisted of interview material obtained
from key individuals associated with the Unit. From this
material was gained an understanding of their perceptions
and actions in the establishment and operation of the new
institution.
Analysis of the data indicated a distinct pattern of
continuity in the first years of the Unit's existence.
It became apparent that this continuity had been maintained
by several factors. These were the existence, from the start,
of a clearly defined rationale and the presence
at the Unit of a selected group of dedicated teachers
who strongly supported it. The outcome was that in 1979
the rationale had become entrenched to such an extent that
Unit teachers were prepared to protect the Unit's
threatened integrity with considerable effort.
It was possible to relate these features of the Unit
to the general context in which it emerged. This study
revealed how, in the early 1970's, increasing awareness
of the inadequacy of migrant education as well as the
significant roles of the Schools Commission and the individual
who set up the Unit, produced a situation in which
the new centre developed its distinctive features which
still existed at the end of 1979.
A general overview was developed of how a new institution
with a high degree of autonomy was introduced into
an existing system, of the advantages and difficulties
which resulted, and how it was able to maintain its
independence and particular character during the early
years of its existence.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">migrant adolescents</field><field name="subject">English instructions</field><field name="subject">Intensive Language Unit</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060907.101040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Apologizing : a cross-cultural study in Chilean Spanish and Australian English</field><field name="creator">Masini, Marisa Isabel Cordella</field><field name="description">Apology is intended to 'set things right' through "remedial
work" (Goffman 1971). This involves, in some cultures, a face
threatening act on the part of the Speaker who undertakes
an apology to maintain or re-establish social equilibrium or
harmony (Edmondson 1981 and Leech 1983) between
speaker and hearer.
Several studies across languages (Cohen and Olshtain 1981,
Olshtain 1983, Trosborg 1987, Holmes 1989) investigated
the different social and contextual factors that influence
native speakers to select one or a group of "semantic
formula(s)" (Fraser 1981) in the act of apologizing.
Nevertheless the literature is still in its infancy (Fraser 1981
and Holmes 1989) in respect to the gender differences
between speaker (apologizer) and hearer (recipient), and in
the comparison of Spanish and English. Therefore this study
aims to investigate which strategies, semantic formulas and
excuses are most commonly used by female and male
speakers of Chilean Spanish and Australian English.
To determine similarities and dissimilarities between their
apologies, a role play was carried out in their mother tongue.
Twenty two Chileans (twelve females and ten males) who
had lived for not more than three years in Australia and
twenty Australians (ten males and ten females) who, like the
Chileans, varied in age from 17 to 30 and who were students
of secondary or tertiary institutions helped as informants in
this study.
The speech event was designed to elicit an apology and was
held constant for both groups.
Results show that Chileans in comparison with Australians
make less use of explicit expression of apology. Nevertheless
they appear to give more explanations than Australians in
the act of apologizing. Dissimilarities in both languages were
also found in the use of speaker and hearer oriented
apologies and in the the use of some strategies and
intensifiers, in which the addressee gender played an
important role in both languages.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apologizing</field><field name="subject">Spanish</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Chilean</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural communication</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060907.102205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arts education access in high school scheduling</field><field name="creator">Mauragis, Rasa Emilija</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the implementation of curriculum policy

analysed in terms of allocation of time to key learning areas, pastoral care, assemblies,

primary schools in Australia was noted by the Senate Standing
Committee on Education and the Arts (Report on a National Language
Policy, 1984, Recommendation 78, p230). The introduction of the
Japanese language program at Macquarie Primary School, ACT, in 1984,
was a response to this need, combined with the expressed wish of the
local community. Within this program it was decided that an
unpublished curriculum developed and used in the ACT by a native
speaker of Japanese, would be trialled.
The purpose of this study, within a Master of Education degree, was to
evaluate Book 1 of this curriculum, and the process by which it was
implemented at the school, during the first year of operation of the
program. The framework around which the evaluation was organised was
Sanders and Cunningham's (1973) Structure for Formative
Evaluation in Product Development.
The evaluation sought to answer five questions which focussed on the
validity, appropriateness and consistency of the broad goals of the
program, and the extent of achievement of those goals by the students;
the effect of the implementation of the program on school
organisation; unexpected outcomes of the program; and revisions and
modifications which were necessary to the program as the curriculum
was trialled. A number of data gathering techniques was used to
obtain the information required to answer these questions.
The results of this study suggest that the curriculum being trialled
was based on an eclectic approach to the teaching of a foreign
language (Prator, 1980; Bell, 1981), selecting from various theories
and methodologies, components deemed appropriate for primary age
students in their first year of Japanese.
The study also provided evidence that, after one year's participation
in the Japanese program all children were, to an extent, achieving
both broad goals of the program. There was some evidence however,
that achievement of the goals was mediated by several learner
characteristics, the most influential of these falling into the broad
category of 'attitude'. It was discovered also, that the
introduction of such a program into an already crowded school
curriculum affected aspects of organisation within the school, and
that all the outcomes of the program were not necessarily planned, or
expected. Finally, certain changes, both organisational and to the
curriculum, were made and implemented during the 'formative interim
evaluation' stage.
The conclusions of this thesis are offered at two levels: conclusions
concerning the evaluation process itself, and those arising from the
teaching of Japanese to primary age students.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Macquarie Primary School</field><field name="subject">Japanese language program</field><field name="subject">foreign language teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060907.131034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exercise programs as determinants of well-being : a holistic view</field><field name="creator">May, Murray</field><field name="description">This field study is about well-being.
It examines the proposition that exercise is a pathway
to well-being. Participants in two "keep fit" groups
at the Australian National University Sports Union and
members of Lifestyle health and fitness club in Woden,
Canberra, A.C.T. provided the population for the study.
A critical review of the literature on well-being suggests
that a number of differing perspectives exist and that
these should be clarified before commencing such a study.
The existence of multidimensional indices of well-being
points to the use of a holistic model of well-being but
did not provide an existing methodology. Therefore an
experimental method was attempted using established and
open-ended questionnaires. In addition, a short
participant observation study of exercise programming in
the A.N.U. groups was carried out. Implications for
future studies of well-being are drawn, particularly
suggesting that existing tools designed for special
unidimensional examinations are inherently unsuitable.
The development of new research tools to evaluate the
different dimensions of well-being which together form
the whole are foreshadowed.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">well-being</field><field name="subject">exercise programs</field><field name="subject">Australian National University Sports Union</field><field name="subject">Lifestyle health and fitness club</field><field name="subject">holistic model</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060907.132531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of a microteaching program by preservice primary teachers and their university tutors</field><field name="creator">Mayer, Diane E.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the perceptions held by second year preservice primary
teachers and their tutors/supervisors of a 1990 microteaching program at a regional
university in Queensland. Perceptions were ascertained on (a) the skills addressed,
(b) peer and tutor feedback, (c) the self evaluation techniques used, (d) the content
level taught, (e) the videotaping of the sessions, and (f) the effectiveness of the
program in the continuing development of teaching skills for preservice teachers.
Perceptions were collected using a questionnaire designed for the purpose. The
questionnaire incorporates fixed response options, for which percentages of those
agreeing with each response are presented in tabular form. It also invites open
ended responses which are coded according to the areas designated of interest for
the study. A Likert type rating scale is used to ascertain opinions on the
effectiveness of the program for developing particular classroom teaching skills.
Results of the study indicate that for the participants, microteaching is appropriate
and effective in helping to provide prospective teachers with experiences that
complement practice teaching in schools, but that the actual structure and
components of any such program requires some discussion. Analysis indicates a
need to vary microteaching programs from those of many traditional approaches
based on the early Stanford model. The writer suggests the concept of a teaching-learning
laboratory based on a macro teaching skill approach with peers as more
appropriate for current preservice teacher education.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">preservice primary</field><field name="subject">microteaching program</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Likert type rating scale</field><field name="subject">classroom teaching skills</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060907.133436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multicultural education and A.C.T. government high schools : an investigative study</field><field name="creator">Mazza, Rose</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multicultural education</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">government high schools</field><field name="subject">ACT Schools Authority</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060907.142249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The limitations and possibilities of school-level curriculum evaluation</field><field name="creator">McConachy, Diana</field><field name="description">This study emanates from a concern about social injustice. I
believe that a number of people in our society, by virtue of their
race, gender or class, are disadvantaged in the distribution of
wealth and privilege. Some people have suggested that schools
contribute to the maintenance and reproduction of this situation
because, in various ways, they replicate inequitable social,
political and economic arrangements. I accept this claim and argue
that any attempt to improve schooling must focus on the social,
economic and political outcomes of education, as well as on
curricular, pedagogical and administrative concerns.
In this study one recent attempt to improve Australian
education, the move to school-level curriculum evaluation, is
examined to ascertain if it represents a challenge to existing
school practices and the beliefs and assumptions which underpin
these. Dominant ideological orientations to improvement are
examined and their key features and assumptions delineated. Because
I believe that these exclude any consideration of the relationship
between school knowledge and the distribution of power and privilege
within society, an attempt is made to reconceptualize school-level
curriculum evaluation in a way that will permit teachers to unpack
what schools do socially, politically and economically. Theories of
cultural and economic reproduction and the work of Freire are drawn
on to help with this task.
Evaluation policy statements and guidelines and examples of
evaluation practice are then analysed in terms of dominant and
reconceptualized notions of evaluation. What emerges is that
although many of these are engulfed by dominant and limiting
ideologies, school-level curriculum may be reconceptualized in a way
that will permit the penetration and contestation of dominant
practices and beliefs and thereby will offer educators a possible
means of addressing problems of social injustice.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school-level curriculum evaluation</field><field name="subject">social injustice</field><field name="subject">Freire</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060911.132106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Right and left brain learning processes : in the context of Australian export education</field><field name="creator">McDonald, P. M.</field><field name="description">The nature of the human brain has preoccupied philosophers and scientists for centuries. As early as the
4th Century BCE, Greek philosophers speculated that the
anatomically distinct hemispheres of the brain implied
specialisation of function. It was not until the "splitbrain"
operations of the 1950s, however, that the precise
specialisation of each hemisphere could be demonstrated.
The right hemisphere apparently assumed responsibility
for spacial, holistic processes, while the left hemisphere
processed analytical, sequential tasks.
During that same decade, educational psychologists
observed two markedly different ways in which
individuals perceive and relate to the world. It was later
observed that these "cognitive styles" seemed directly
related to the bi-polar functions of the right and left
hemispheres of the brain. This implied a genetic basis
for cognitive style.
Subsequent research suggested that cognitive style is to a
considerable extent a result of the environment of
socialisation, and therefore, different cultures would
demonstrate different cognitive styles. Such cultural
differences in learning expectations might have serious
implications for both teachers and learners in the field of
export education.
The literature review in this study identified physical,
environmental, and experiential factors which appear to
influence cognitive style. This information formed the
basis of the biographical section of a questionnaire which
elicited the learning style preferences of pre-tertiary
students from Australia (native speakers), Indonesia and
Japan. The study posed the negative hypothesis: There
are no significant differences in patterns of cognitive
styles between cultures.
The results of the field study contradicted the negative
hypothesis, identifying significant differences in patterns
of cognitive styles between the three cultural groups.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">right brain</field><field name="subject">left brain</field><field name="subject">hemispheres</field><field name="subject">Australian export education</field><field name="subject">bi-polar functions</field><field name="subject">cognitive styles</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060918.132852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing change : the implementation of the participation and equity program in a central school</field><field name="creator">McDonnell, T.</field><field name="description">The major purposes of this study are twofold. The first purpose
is to describe the setting and the context for the program and the
methods by which a Government initiated change, a Participation and Equity Program,was introduced into a particular school. The second
purpose is to consider the change process which occurred and to
analyse the factors involved in the change and the procedures by which
the change was managed.
The study outlines ways in which change can become an issue on
the political agenda and hence become a Government priority which is
eventually handed down as policy to be followed by schools.
Introduction of change in this manner is regarded as a top-down,
or authoritarian, model of change. Such a model of change has the
advantage of ensuring same change occurs within a specified time but
at the same time there are disadvantages relating to a lack of skill,
or expertise, amongst school staff and a possible lack of commitment
to change.
The study draws attention to problems encountered in the
introductory procedures of the program which caused a sense of
frustration amongst those attempting to manage the change at the
school level. It is shown how the system failed to provide effective
support at this level. It is suggested that there is a bureaucratic
lack of understanding of the problems of implementing change in a
school which is itself considered to be a loosely coupled organization
with problems peculiar to itself.
In summary the study suggests that progress was made, in this
particular example, chiefly through efforts at the school level but
the results could have been improved with effective system support.
While there has been some success the change has not yet been
institutionalized within the school.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Government initiated change</field><field name="subject">Participation and Equity Program</field><field name="subject">schools</field><field name="subject">change process</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060918.141456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between strength and endurance in female triathletes</field><field name="creator">McElligott, Mark</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">female triathletes</field><field name="subject">strength tests</field><field name="subject">endurance tests</field><field name="subject">swimming</field><field name="subject">cycling</field><field name="subject">running</field><field name="subject">triathlons</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060918.160011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and herbicidal properties of some pyrazole and pyrimidine heteocycles</field><field name="creator">McFadden, Helen Georgina</field><field name="description">Four main series of novel heterocyclic compounds were successfully syniliesised.
Two of these series were found to be post-emergence herbicides with the activities of each
being based on a different mode of action. The (pyrazole-4-yl)alkanones are inhibitors of
protoporphyrinogen oxidase, an enzyme in chlorophyll biosynthesis, whereas alkyl 3-arylsulfonylamino-
3-methyllhio-2-(pyrimidin-2-ylcarbamoyl)acrylates and pyrimidin-2-yl 3-(2-
chlorophenyl)sulfonyl-amino-3-methylthio-2-cyanoacrylamides (collectively termed
"vinylogous sulfonylureas") are inhibitors of acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS). an enzyme
in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. Both these enzymes are established targets
for current commercial herbicides.
Studies of the utility of 2-(l-ethoxyalkylidene)-3-oxoaIkanenitriles (acrylonilriles)
in heterocycle synthesis were facilitated by the recent development of a convenient route
to these starting materials. Acrytonitriles were reacted with different hydrazines to give
(pyrazol-4-yl)alkanones and pyrazole-4-carbonitriles in varying proportions depending on
the reaction conditions and the substituents on the reactants. Although distinction between
alternative 3- and 5-substituted pyrazoles is a perennial problem in pyrazole synthesis, in
this case the products of these reactions were successfully characterised and identified using
a range of n.m.r. spectroscopy techniques. Once the herbicidal mode of action of the
(pyrazol-4-yl)alkanones had been confirmed, synthesis of a series of analogues allowed the
structural elements contributing to biological activity to be identified. The reaction of
acrylonitriles with bidetate nucleophiles such as thiourea gave novel pyrimidines. but these
compounds were not herbicidal.
The vinylogous sulfonylureas were synthesised using established procedures to
obtain novel compounds structurally related to the commercial herbicide chlorsulfuron. The
biological activity of the vinylogous sulfonylureas was found to be sensitive to apparently
minor changes in structure, but x-ray crystallographically-generated structures of an active
and an inactive member of the series revealed marked differences in conformation. Some
of the vinylogous sulfonylureas were used as synthons for pyrazole and pyrazolopyrimidine
derivatives. Although these compounds did not exhibit herbicidal activity, this synthesis
provided the basis for some interesting chemistry. Unexpected elimination of the arylsulfonylamino
group was observed when a vinylogous sulfonyurea was treated with methyl
hydrazine. In order to confirm the identity of the 3-methylthiopyrazole product, model compounds
were synthesised using alternative routes. The resulting pairs of 3- and 5-substituted
pyrazoles were characterised using n.m.r spectroscopy.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">novel heterocyclic compounds</field><field name="subject">herbicides</field><field name="subject">pyrazole</field><field name="subject">pyrimidine</field><field name="subject">heteocycles</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060918.160845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Successful change in schools : factors affecting change and evaluation of outcomes</field><field name="creator">McFarland, Bruce</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">schools</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">outcomes</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060928.121041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pupil teacher and counsellor perceptions of the school counsellor : implications for counselling services and secondary schools in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">McGlynn, Margaret Jean</field><field name="description">Research has suggested that the identity of the school counsellor
is inevitably determined by what they do or are perceived to do,
rather than by what they would like to do or ought to do.
Thus the perception held by students, counsellors and teachers are
of paramount importance in attempting to define the role and function
of the counsellors.
This study attempts, by a descriptive approach to determine what
their perceptions are, and in addition to determine what effect,
if any, the administration of a school can have on the perception
held by the counsellor of that school.
A questionnaire was distributed to a randomly selected sample
(N-223) of students from a secondary school within the ACT, whose
total population was 750. The results were shown in their-raw
score form, percentage form and in years and sex.
The same method was used to ascertain the perceptions held by
stuff and administration of this school, and results were shown
in raw score and percentage form. Similarly counsellors' perception
of their role and function were obtained, although counsellors
themselves were able to comment upon the design of the questionnaire
before the final format was given to them.
The results tend to show that counsellors within the ACT system
were similar to those in the USA, in that their identity was
determined by what they were perceived to do.
The second part of the study used a causal - comparative approach
to determine the effect of school administration on counsellors.
The results of this showed that this body can potentially exert an
extremely powerful influence upon the role and function of
counsellors.
The implications of the study for the ACT system are great. If
the counsellors are to be used to their maximum, greater support
must be given to them, and teachers at all levels should undergo
some training to aid them in understanding and thus utilizing the
counsellors to their fullest potential.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school counsellors</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">perceptions</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060928.121736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experiment with radical pedagogy</field><field name="creator">McInnis, Shelley</field><field name="description">This thesis is an analysis of some research undertaken with

penetrating oppressive ideology and practice and working towards
emancipation and social change.

transcriptions of video and audio-tapes of thirteen, two&#65533;hour
class sessions. The first chapter of the thesis outlines the
nature of a pedagogical style which could be described as
counter&#65533;hegemonic, non-reproductive, or liberatory, and it
specifies the elements of a 'radical' approach to classroom
process and content, which is distinguished from a 'traditional'
one. Subsequent chapters present a critical analysis of actual
classroom 'content' and 'process', which is based on a study of
reconstructed sessional data, and the final chapter discusses the
factors which limited the 'success' of the experiment, and
attempts to draw some conclusions about the liberatory
possibilities of radical pedagogy.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radical pedagogy</field><field name="subject">human sexuality</field><field name="subject">social reproduction theory</field><field name="subject">resistance theory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060928.122201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How would you discuss a leopard? : the quality of small group talk</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, John P.</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small group talk</field><field name="subject">teacher led discussion</field><field name="subject">small group discusssion</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060928.124958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The word amongst us : a descriptive study of the perceptions of communication problems in a traditionally hierarchical organisation moving to a more lateral form of collaborative ministry</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Monica M.</field><field name="description">This paper attempts to isolate some implications for secondary and
adult education emerging from an exploratory study of perceived
effective interactional communication in a religious organisation.
Leaders of the local parishes of the Catholic Church in Australia are in
the process of moving from the traditional basic communication
structure of an hierarchical model to the lateral and collaborative
interaction of a more participative model of management.
This descriptive study records the perceptions of a sample of parish
workers in the Church throughout Australia as they describe some of the
problems they experienced in communication processes and attempted to
identify the reason why these problems emerged. In doing so, they also
identified the more effective communication processes emerging in this
new form of pastoral ministry. They listed a number of attitudes which
they believed would lead to greater communication effectiveness and
without which genuine constructive communication usually does not
take place (Carl Rogers 1957 in Bolton, 1983 p. 259). The media and
written communication are not explored, except in their relation to
effective meeting procedures. Verbal and non-verbal communication
amongst people interacting with one another in the interpersonal
organisational setting is the focus of this work.
The findings of this study point in the short term, to the need for
empowering people engaged in pastoral work with the necessary skills
of effective communication processes. In the long term, the paper
proposes the need for continuing educational emphasis on communication
skills especially in secondary schools when students move towards a
more personalised form of self-assertion.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">religious organisations</field><field name="subject">interactional communication</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">lateral interaction</field><field name="subject">collaborative interaction</field><field name="subject">participative management</field><field name="subject">commpunication processes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061003.114719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supply of faculty teachers to individual high schools within the A.C.T. Schools' Authority, over the period 1983-1984 : an analysis of needs satisfaction</field><field name="creator">McKinnon, Gregory Colin</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates the supply of
and demand for High School teachers, working in
prescribed faculty areas in Government schools in the
A.C.T., over the period from January 1983 to July
1984, for all new temporary teachers appointed to the
Service.
Statistical details of vacancies for assistant
teachers, in the 12 defined faculties of this study, were
obtained from the Assistant Principals (Staffing) of the
17 A.C.T. High Schools, as well as from records
maintained by the Staffing Officers of the A.C.T. Schools
Office.
The levels of High School teacher demand, for
the period under investigation, are compared with similar
statistics obtained for previous years in the A.C.T., as
well with other Australian and international figures on
teacher supply and demand. Through these comparisons,
suggestions are made regarding emerging trends of teacher
shortage, in particular faculty areas. Historical
parallels are presented to supplement these arguments
and to give underlying reasons for the projections that
are made.
The potential supply of faculty teachers over
the period is investigated through an analysis of
teacher faculty waiting lists. Numbers from these
lists are compared with the actual demand statistics
previously collected and a potential supply to vacancy
ratio collected for each faculty area.
A major part of the study is the construction
of supply satisfaction indices, under the headings of:
"Overall Satisfaction, Teaching Skills, Academic
Qualifications, Other Requirements and Recruitment".
These indices were derived from Likert type rating scales
completed by the Assistant Principals, in respect of
each of the 397 temporary teachers employed.
After obtaining an average rating in each faculty,
for the five measures of satisfaction, as determined by
the Assistant Principals, observations are made as to how
closely these indices match the corresponding potential
supply indices.
Particular emphasis is placed on the comparisons
between the recruitment satisfaction index (i.e. - how
quickly recruitment was expedited) and the potential
supply ratio for each faculty. Reasons are advanced for
any significant differences detected, and the overall
findings interpreted in terms of possible future trends.
The study concludes with an analysis of
factors affecting the market for teachers. Recommendations
are made for future planning that may offset problems
which were detected in the A.C.T. market for High School
teachers.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australain Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT Schools' Authority</field><field name="subject">high school teachers</field><field name="subject">Staffing Officers</field><field name="subject">teacher shortages</field><field name="subject">recruitment</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061003.122421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional work in the new work order: a sociological study of the shift from professional autonomy based in expertise to professional accountability based in performativity</field><field name="creator">Axford, Beverley</field><field name="description">'Profession' and 'professional' are shifting signifiers that have taken on a range of new
meanings in the past two decades as professional occupations have been reshaped by
moves to 'flexible' (deregulated and decentred) work processes and work practices.
The role of modern professions was significant in terms of the democratic elements of
the professionalising project. But how do moves away from the modern
bureaucratically-structured professions, and a professional ideal based on the concept of
universal service, impact on graduates currently entering professional employment
domains in which new 'performativity-based' management regimes are replacing the
older control structures? This study draws on a range of sociological literature to explore
both the structural and discursive changes in the meaning of profession practice. The
study also draws on a number of research projects, including materials from focus group
interviews of final year undergraduate students, recruitment brochures, ABS (Australian
Bureau of Statistics) statistical analyses and DEST (Australia: Department of
Employment, Science and Training) graduate destination studies, and policy documents.
These materials are used to argue that the employment destinations of those with
professional qualifications and credentials are now more stratified and more diverse and
no longer necessarily coupled with a lifelong career. In addtion, the new management
regimes that accompany the move to more flexible work processes and work practices
are changing how those in professional work locations construct their sense of
themselves as professional practitioners.
Changes in the nature of professional work, and in the structural and discursive location
of professional workers, have implications for education and training institutions. These
institutions not only prepare workers for these occupational domains but are the main
conduits through which access to work in the restructured labour markets is mediated.
The study concludes by drawing attention to the need for educational research to be
anchored in a 'sociology of employment' that is able to provide a more critical account
of the relationship between education and training and entry into high status/low status
employment domains.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">new work order</field><field name="subject">professional autonomy</field><field name="subject">professional accountability</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">flexible workplaces</field><field name="subject">performativity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061010.111412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between phosphorus transport and stream flow</field><field name="creator">Chew, Hoong Cheong</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stream flow</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Lake Burley Griffin</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060627.155328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coping with colorectal cancer and the creation of a colostomy in the Thai context</field><field name="creator">Rattanajarana, Sahattaya</field><field name="description">The number of patients who suffer from colorectal cancer in Thailand has increased
during the last three decades as a result of the change to a Westem-style diet. Due to
many patients presenting at a late stage and the location of tumours in the rectum,
patients have a higher probability of needing a colostomy. This study explores the
experiences, coping strategies and the factors that influence coping strategies over a sixmonth
period in a group of Thai colorectal cancer patients who have a colostomy.
The conceptual framework used in this study was based on the Moos and Schaefer
conceptual model of the stress and coping process. A case study methodology was
employed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data from eleven participants at
three points in time: within one month after the operation to create a colostomy, three
months and six months after the operation. Data were collected from structured
interviews, which followed the Coping Responses Inventory (CRI), the Ostomy
Adjustment Scale (OAS), the Personal Resources Questionnaire 2000 (PRQ 2000), the
Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), and the Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-
Colon (FACT-C). These data provided information on the participants' levels of coping
strategies, adjustment to a colostomy, social support, optimism and quality of life. Indepth
interviews with open-ended questions provided a deeper understanding of the
participants' experiences in relation to their colostomy.
Findings from quantitative data showed statistically significant changes in the
participants' quality of life over time, particularly in their physical and functional wellbeing.
An examination of the coping focus used (approach and avoidance) indicated that
participants utilised both approach and avoidance coping at the same time, although
approach coping was more common. Changes in the most frequently and the least
frequently used coping subtypes at six months after the operation were observed.
Correlation tests showed various relationships between the levels of quality of life
domains and coping subtypes as time passed. Multidimensional scaling procedures
uncovered a consistent pattern of coping which involved 'problem solving' and 'seeking
guidance and support'. Six major qualitative themes emerged through content analysis of
the in-depth interview data. The themes described how participants' psychological and
emotional concerns changed over time; the steady improvements in physical health after
the operation; the difficulties of adjusting to life with a stoma; facing up to the reality of
the new circumstances; the spiritual aspects of their lives; and the level of social support
experienced. Religious beliefs such as the 'Law of Kanna', as well as a variety of
religious rituals and other practices such as Buddhist chanting and "making merit" played
important roles in coping. The findings from the quantitative and qualitative data were
used in a complementary and confirmatory manner to provide a richer understanding of
the participants' experiences as they coped with this life changing event.
The findings of the study are significant as they provide important indicators for
improvements in nursing service, particularly the development of nursing procedures to
enhance the psychological aspects of care. In addition, they offer important indicators for
improvement of the nursing curriculum and directions for further research in Thai culture
and the health care system.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">colostomy</field><field name="subject">Moos &amp; Schaefer conceptual model</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">coping process</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061010.154836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defence technological edge program management : a search for more reliable outcomes</field><field name="creator">McNally, Raymond Gordon</field><field name="description">During the early 1960s, the US Department of Defense, under Secretary Robert
McNamara implemented for the first time in national government a Planning-Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) in order to improve effectiveness
and efficiency in defence program management. McNamara sought improved
effectiveness through a formal five-year program designed to reduce costs. He
also sought efficient methods of managing joint service strategy coordination,
requirements' analysis and planning, and improved alignment between the
choice of requirements and the size and nature of the acquisition program. The
Australian Defence Organisation (ADO) and the UK Ministry of Defence later
sought to implement their own forms of PPBS. Recently, both have introduced
program management innovations that seek to achieve more reliably effective
and efficient outcomes.
The thesis has reviewed program management theory with a particular focus on
its implementation challenges relating to strategic management, program
review, personnel management and program coordination. It has sought to
answer the research problem: Which specific management designs could offer
better outcomes for Australian defence technological edge programs? The
thesis' central proposition is that the greatest opportunities for improving
defence program outcomes occur when classic PPBS concepts are
implemented within a Program Management System that incorporates Zero-
Base budgeting (ZBB), Management by Objectives (MBO), and Matrix
structural systems. All of these systems, either alone or in combination seek to
enhance program quality, scheduling, financial management and evaluation.
The research used in-depth case study research based on qualitative data found
within a selection of recent Australian National Audit Office reports, and other
public records. The central proposition is subjected to dynamic reliabilityrelated
contingency analysis and evaluation. The thesis concludes with the
proposition that if managers were to implement a contingency based integrated
mixture of the above-mentioned systems they could expect improved
technological edge program outcomes.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">defence</field><field name="subject">program management</field><field name="subject">Planning-Programming and Budgeting System</field><field name="subject">PPBS</field><field name="subject">Australian defence technological edge programs</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061013.122250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of attrition among accounting certificate course students at Woden College of Technical and Further Education, 1981 - 1984</field><field name="creator">McNeil, E. M.</field><field name="description">This study examines the reasons for student withdrawal from
the Accounting Certificate Course at Woden TAFE College
during the period 1981 to 1984 inclusive.
The investigation concerns students enrolled in a demanding,
four year course, which leads to a para-professional
qualification including (subject to practical experience)
registration with the Tax Agents Registration Board.
A 100% survey was made of all students, both withdrawn and
continuing for the relevant period.
Students are adults, mostly between the ages of 20 to 50.
Attrition rates in the early stages of the course were found
to be very high, and reasons established were related to a
variety of causes, including personal reasons.
Follow up interviews by telephone were carried out and these
showed no new trends from the results of the questionnaires.
The main reasons for attrition within the control of the
college, seemed to be related to inaccurate student
perceptions of, and expectations from the course.
The major recommendations and implications arising from the
study suggest that counselling be given greater prominence
at the time of enrolment. There is also a case for
timetabling to include day classes at times and venues most
beneficial for students. Another outcome of the
investigation suggests that closer liaison be developed
between the college, industry and commerce. An important
issue which became evident from this research focused on
staff development and the need for administrators and
teachers to further their educational leadership knowledge
and skills to provide the best possible service for
students.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Woden College of Technical and Further Education</field><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="subject">attrition rates</field><field name="subject">accounting students</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061013.125123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A.C.T.

meeting of teachers in the Canberra Workmens' Club on August 3rd 1972.
Its structure was strongly conditioned by the N.S.W. background of
many of those who played a role in its early affairs. Changes which
have taken place since then have been influenced by the environment
within which it operates.
It soon obtained, and held, a large proportion of its
potential membership. The internal organisation enabled the leadership
to keep in touch with rank and file opinion and ensured that democratic
practices were observed.
It was fortunate in that a legitimate role had been
established in Australia for pressure groups and that the governments
it dealt with in its early days were prepared to acknowledge its
authority to speak for teachers. It was able to take advantage of the
opportunities made available to it and to play a prominent part in the
early policy formation in a new system.
The evolving system was based on a participatory model
and the Federation gained access to all major decision centres. It
retained, its right, however, to operate outside formal consultative
forums and to engage in direct bargaining when necessary.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">A.C.T.

development of Human Resource Management competency standards for the Australian
Public Service. The thesis is a vehicle for examining and exploring a complex Human
Resource Development strategy, through dealing with the details of the project. This
project was undertaken from 16 January to 13 April 1995. The project occurred in a
turbulent environment with limited resources.
The decision whether or not to develop Human Resource Management competencies was
an important step in the implementation of the National Training Reform Agenda by the
Australian Public Service, being influenced by a number of changes in the national
environment as well as having to accommodate a number of factors internal to the
Australian Public Service. Factors included: the impact of changes to vocational
education and training at the national level such as the introduction of the Australian
Qualifications Framework; the impact of a devolved management structure; the differing
needs of stakeholders; the need to accommodate industrial relations issues; and the impact
of resource constraints (including time).
The thesis explains the context and conduct of the project. It critically examines the
development of action plans and progress made over the course of the project. It explains
the process and content of project activities and provides comments on them. This allows
insights into the development of Human Resource Development policy in the public
sector. In particular it shows how the nature of the project changed from its anticipated
focus on competency identification to its final focus on preparing advice to the Joint
Australian Public Service Training Council. That advice recommended that separate
Human Resource Management competency standards should not, after all, be identified.
It concluded that they should be integrated with the core competency standards for the
Australian Public Service.
The thesis reflects on key aspects of the project including its subject matter, processes,
and outcomes. Some of these concern the impact of the systemic, conceptual and
structural changes in the National Training Reform Agenda on strategic Human Resource
Development. In addition the thesis reflects on the many roles of the project officer in
strategic Human Resource Development activities, suggesting that the project officer
should act as a consultant rather than servant. To illustrate this point the thesis describes
how the project officer was able to facilitate processes during this project that resulted in
management accepting outcomes that differed from their expectations but better met their
needs. The work of Lippitt and Lippitt (1986) is found to be helpful in identifying the
project officer's roles.
Finally the thesis considers the outcomes of the project in the light of the publication of the
Karpin report (1995) and finds that the outcome is consistent with the thrust of that
report.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human Resource Management competency standards</field><field name="subject">Australian Public Service</field><field name="subject">APS</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061013.142754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhanced access for re-entry into education, training is is seen to enable women to achieve self-fulfilment and to enhance employment opportunities</field><field name="creator">McNickle, Cathy</field><field name="description">The study topic undertaken was "Enhanced access for
re-entry into education, training is seen to enable women
to achieve self-fulfilment and enhance employment
opportunities".
Thesis Proposition and Study Problem : 
The topic was undertaken to study groups of women
during different stages of education, training to see
whether they did achieve self-fulfilment and had better
employment opportunities if they did have enhanced access
for re-entry into education, training.
The study briefly looks at the progress by women
chronologically, from the late nineteenth century until
today, noting the major changes that have given greater
gender eguity within the workplace.
Methodology : 
The study focused on four different case studies;
each case study focusing on different women who were at
different stages of education, training. The study
ensured it also focused on women who had gone into nontraditional
roles to gain a greater insight as a result
of women being given greater access, whether it has
played a role in women having the opportunity to gain
greater career opportunities and self-fulfilment as a
result.
Results : 
Some of the key results were that if women were
given the opportunities of education, training that they
were able to achieve self-fulfilment and their employment
opportunities were enhanced. It was also evident that
women were increasing in numbers to study at university.
There were a number of inequalities noted still, although
there have been a number of changes in recent times.
These changes were also noted, as well as the barriers
that are still evident.
The study identifies different areas within
education/employment whereby there are barriers and
inequalities. The changes in training/legislation are
also noted.
Conclusions : 
The study is concluded by compiling the results of
the four case studies and presenting these as well as
other evidence from a variety of sources clarifying the
investigation that "Enhanced access for re-entry into
education, training is seen to enable women to achieve
self-fulfilment and enhance employment opportunities".</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">employment opportunities</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061013.143535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Job satisfaction of registered nurses</field><field name="creator">McQueen, Anne</field><field name="description">A questionnaire survey of a stratified random sample

issue for the ACT.
The following forms of euthanasia were covered by the
research:
(i) voluntary active euthanasia:
(ii) voluntary passive euthanasia:
(iii) involuntary active euthanasia:
(iv) involuntary passive euthanasia.
Passive forms of euthanasia were found to be the most
acceptable.
Voluntary forms of euthanasia were not found, in general, to
be more approved of than involuntary forms of euthanasia.
However, active forms of euthanasia were much less
acceptable than passive forms.
In order to adapt the research findings to a methodology for
policy use. Allison's models (1971) of public policy
development were modified into a single model. This provided
an application of the research results in such a way as to
allow for the development of a possible formalised policy on

in them were grouped into fifteen broad categories, six of
which - professional staffing, policy making/procedures,
central staff and services, boundary maintenance, school
buildings and curriculum Matters - were found to have been
given the greatest attention by the Council.
The study reveals that decision making was associated
with only slightly more than half of the issues discussed
and that three quarters of those decisions could be termed
effective, in that they might lead to a change in the
education system's operations or in relationships with
another body or in that they appeared to finalize the
discussion on an issue.
It also demonstrates changes over time in both the
types of issues discussed and the ways in which the Council
operated as a decision unit. Some attention is given to
variables which might account for the observed patterns.
The decision making strategies used are explored
as are the methods of policy determination. An attempt is
made to identify stages in the Council's history which might
correspond to those postulated in organizational growth

diminished and their self esteem is lowered. Not only is their behaviour often
disruptive, reflecting their inner feelings and frustrations, but their health and wellbeing,
physical, psychological, and spiritual is affected.
Art is a natural medium of expression for children and provides an emotionally
distressed child with a means of self expression, enabling an emotional release, an
opportunity for self-exploration, and a means of communication which may not be
possible through the normal channel of language.
An art intervention program was implemented with a small group of emotionally
distressed or withdrawn children at an A.C.T. primary school which holds a
humanistic/holistic attitude to health and education. The study was undertaken between
May and November 1992 in a first grade integrated classroom, where mainstream
children are together with special needs children. The object of the study was to
examine if art activities in small groups can provide a combination of personal and
group experiences that result in a therapeutic change to the emotional health and
wellbeing of the participating children.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emotionally distressed children</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">wellbeing</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">primary school children</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061018.100536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the reading efficiency of Chinese tertiary EFL students</field><field name="creator">Gao Ming-ming,</field><field name="description">This field study concentrates on how to improve the
reading efficiency of Chinese tertiary students of English as a foreign language (henceforth EFL) with particular
reference to Bejing Second Foreign Language Institute
(henceforth Erwai). The study covers the following aspects
in five chapters.
Chapter 1 reports and analyses the findings of the
research done to identify inefficient reading problems in the
Chinese EFL reading situation. Based on the analysis of the
existing problems, the chapter comes to a tentative conclusion
that teaching reading skills could be one possible solution
to the problems.
To prove the relevance of the conclusion, the second
chapter turns to a critical review of literature about the
nature of the reading process. The emphasis in this chapter
is on the psycholinguistic perspective of the reading process
and its relevance to EFL teaching in China.
Related to the psycholinguistic perspective of the
reading process, Chapter 3 moves to some more specific issues
concerning reading efficiency. The discussion deals with
various factors which can influence reading efficiency and
points out implications for teaching in the Chinese EFL reading
situation.
Having considered reading efficiency theoretically in
Chapter 2 and 3, the study turns to the practical teaching of
reading skills in Chapter 4 and 5. In these two chapters,
efficient reading skills are analysed and suggestions are made
about practical classroom teaching. It is hoped that these
analyses and suggestions will give some impetus to improving
the teaching of reading in the Chinese EFL field.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading skills</field><field name="subject">reading efficiency</field><field name="subject">Chinese tertiary students</field><field name="subject">English as a foreign language</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">Bejing Second Foreign Language Institute</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061018.124741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation assessment of remnant vegetation in the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Leslie Howard</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with programs to conserve remnant stands
of native vegetation in the agricultural regions of South Australia
and concentrates on the development of explicit evaluation procedures
which reflect stated conservation objectives. As botanical data are
available for stands of native vegetation in most of the agricultural
regions, stands in a particular region are able to be compared rather
than assessed in isolation. Based on a review of conservation
evaluation schemes in Australia and overseas, a hierarchical evaluation
procedure using multiple criteria to compare stands was applied
to stands of vegetation in the Mount Lofty Ranges.
The conservation objective, of preserving samples of all plant
communities in a region, led to the analysis of existing botanical data
from two surveys of the Mount Lofty Ranges, to provide the basis for
an inventory of regional plant communities. These surveys included 52
remnant stands of native vegetation and employed a point-centred quarter
plotless sampling technique to summarise the vegetation. Numerical
classificatory analysis of the raw sampling point data produced a more
comprehensive floristic summary than the results from the plotless
sampling. These floristic groups were correlated with physical
environmental variables to produce an inventory of 45 regional vegetation
types, as the first stage in the conservation evaluation of stands.
Evaluation criteria of size, species richness and species rarity
were quantified and used to select examples of each vegetation type on
the basis of overall satisfaction of the criteria. In addition, the
smallest suite of stands, in which all the vegetation types were represented,
was determined, and was shown to be 24 stands. All of these
were included in the 37 stands chosen using the three criteria. A third
evaluation stage used stand parameters such as plant community richness
to give a priority ranking of the 37 stands.
A polythetic divisive classification of the vegetation types was
developed to provide a means of evaluating communities in stands of
native vegetation yet to be sampled in the region, and of comparing
the vegetation types with communities in existing reservesr Examination
of species-sampling area relationships led to recommended plot
sizes for such future vegetation surveys in the Mount Lofty Ranges.
The ease of collecting floristic data and the extensive time involved
in quantitative measurements suggest that all perennial plant species
be recorded and only estimations be made of vegetation quantity and
structure for each sampling plot.
This study demonstrates the usefulness of numerical classification
techniques for conservation evaluation, and of continuous variables to
quantify criteria of conservation value; and the application of those
criteria in an explicit, hierarchical conservation evaluation procedure.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">remnant vegetation</field><field name="subject">native vegetation</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">Mount Lofty Ranges</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">evaluation procedures</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061018.130636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating the practice of teaching : a study of evaluative discourse between student teachers and their associates</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Jane</field><field name="description">The central question in this thesis is How do participants in the practicum interact in order
to evaluate teaching practice? This question has been posed for several reasons:
1. The practicum is a crucial part of teacher education and teacher socialisation;
2. Little is known about the nature of student teacher learning during the practicum;
3. Much of what happens during practicum interactions is taken for granted, and needs to
be made explicit in order to fully understand how student teachers learn and what it is
important for them to know.
In order to investigate this question this study examines the interactions between student
teachers and their supervising teachers in post lesson conferences. These conferences are
a site in which practicum participants evaluate teaching practice and in which values,
beliefs and knowledge about teaching in the context of the classroom and the practicum
are produced and reproduced. To obtain data on the ways in which participants interact
in post lesson conferences tape recordings of conferences and interviews with
participants have been collected and analysed. Three quite different cases are presented to
show a spectrum of evaluative styles and interactions.
In each case the language of the post lesson conferences is explored. A particular
concern in the thesis has been to consider the ways in which the linguistic choices of the
participants express their subjectivities as well as reflect the cultural and institutional
context in which the post lesson conferences were located. In order to achieve this the
study draws upon theoretical perspectives concerned with social practice, language and
meaning.
Fundamental to any evaluative interaction is its purpose, the relationship between the
participants and the construction of the evaluative criteria. This study has sought to
identify those routines that are a common part of and that underpin the purpose of
evaluative interactions in post lesson conferences. By considering the differences
between the interactions in each case, this research concludes that the degree of symmetry
in the participants' evaluative relationship and the extent to which the evaluative criteria
are made explicit are critical to the authority that student teachers have to negotiate their
understandings, reflect on their practice and take responsibility for their own learning.
The three cases provide a dynamic account of the evaluative process, and a more
comprehensive account than has hitherto been provided in much of the literature. They
also generate suggestions for future research in this important area of teacher education.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching practice</field><field name="subject">evaluative discourse</field><field name="subject">student teachers</field><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="subject">practicum</field><field name="subject">supervising teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061018.141211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spirituality and counselling</field><field name="creator">Moir-Bussy, Ann</field><field name="description">There has been little Australian research on the religious and spiritual values
of counsellors &#65533; one study only, published by Cross and Khan in 1983. However, this
issue is an important one, as counsellors' values may influence their clients and the
need of clients may require the attention of the counsellor to religious and spiritual
issues. This study consisted of two surveys in which the religious and spiritual beliefs
and values of Australian counsellors were examined.
The first study addressed some root questions concerning the relevance of
religion and spirituality to psychologists and therapists in the counselling situation. The
queries concerned (a) the recognition and acceptance by counselling practitioners of the
religious/spiritual dimension of a person, (b) whether religious issues, values and
beliefs were seen as an integral part of psychotherapy and (c) the degree to which these
practitioners saw themselves as religious or spiritual.
To answer some of these root questions, the initial objective of the field
study was to survey psychologists and therapists in Canberra using the Batson and
Ventis (1982) Religious Life Inventory, because this was a framework for identifying
the ways in which a person was religious. Added to this were some demographic
questions and questions regarding the relevance of religion to work. A poor response
rate led to the surveys being sent also to Sydney and Melbourne.
Results from this first survey were limited. The term "religion" was found
to be far more complex than at first realised, and hence objectives were modified for a
second survey.
The second survey focussed on perceptions of spirituality of Canberra
counsellors. The survey questions were based on the studies by Shafranske and Gorsuch
(1984) and Shafranske and Malony (1990). Added to these questions were demographic
questions and open questions dealing with personal insights, experiences with symbols,
rituals and myths. Ideas for questions were also taken from studies on religion in
Australia, including Bouma and Dixon (1986) and the Australian Values Study Survey
(1983).
The data was analysed first by tabling frequencies, then by cross-tabulating
selected variables and computing the chi-square statistic for each cross-tabulation to
determine whether the relationship was significant at the 0.05 level.
Results suggested that the majority of Canberra practitioners not only
perceived spirituality as important to their personal life and clinical work, but also
regarded themselves as spiritual people and believed in a transcendent Being and Life
Force. Most saw their spirituality as entirely personal and had little connection with
organised or traditional religions. Within the counselling relationship approximately
half of the counsellors were willing to discuss religious issues, and nearly 90% to
discuss their clients' spirituality. Female counsellors were much more likely than male
to discuss a client's religious beliefs with them; other differences between the sexes
were less marked.
The high response rate in this study together with the significant findings
indicate the value of further research in this area on a broader scale.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">counsellors</field><field name="subject">spiritual values</field><field name="subject">religious values</field><field name="subject">Batson and Ventis</field><field name="subject">Religious Life Inventory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061018.142411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological change and piospheres : can the classical range succession model and its modifications explain changes in vegetation and soil around boreholes in eastern Botswana?</field><field name="creator">Moleele, Nkobi Mpho</field><field name="description">There is concern that the communal rangelands of Botswana are overstocked with
cattle, and that this has led to unwanted ecological changes. These changes are
assumed to be most prominent around boreholes. This study describes vegetation and
soil piospheres around boreholes in Eastern Botswana and investigates factors
associated with their development.
The classical range succession model and its modifications, the bush encroachment
theories and the soil-nutrient transfer model, have been applied here to explain
changes in vegetation and soil variables with distance from artificial water points.
Data on soil texture, soil nutrients, vegetation species composition and cover, dung
weight and bare ground were collected from boreholes of different ages, with different
numbers of cattle using them.
Piosphere patterns were observed. However, some of the patterns were not in
accordance with the classical range succession model and the bush encroachment theories. The frequent occurrence of palatable grasses (Panicum maximum, Setaria
verticiliata and Digitaria milanjiand) nearer to water points where the grazing
pressure is highest, and of unpalatable ones (Aristida congesta and Eragrostis
rigidior) further away, where the grazing pressure is minimal, contradicts the classical
range succession model. Total tree cover along the gradient did not show any changes,
which contradicts bush encroachment theory (two-layer soil moisture model). The
concentration of soil nutrients and dung weight close to boreholes was well predicted
by the soil-nutrient transfer model. The frequency of Acacia tortilis and Dicrostachys
cinerea and bare patches, increased towards boreholes. Grass cover, occurrence of
Terminalia sericea, Boscia albitrunca and Combretum apiculatum increased with
distance from water points.
The results suggest that the range succession model and its modification, the twolayer
soil moisture model, cannot satisfactorily explain vegetation changes with
distance from water points. Species composition at a point may be affected by the
growth, survival, recovery and reproductive strategies of different species, fire,
selectivity of browsers and nutrients status, as well as grazing disturbance. Therefore,
the 'state and transition' model is recommended, as it considers factors that are ignored
by the classical range succession model, and is appropriate for analysing vegetation
change under highly variable rainfall.
The adverse impacts of grazing around boreholes could be reduced by controlling
cattle distribution on the range as a whole.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vegetation</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">communal rangelands</field><field name="subject">Botswana</field><field name="subject">boreholes</field><field name="subject">classical range succession model</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061018.144247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A descriptive analysis and evaluation of Australian Capital Territory Institute of Technical and Further Education's marketing strategy</field><field name="creator">Montgomery, Thomas</field><field name="description">The research in this thesis attempts to study the ACT
Institute of Technical and Further Education's marketing
strategy, and it addresses a particular situation at a
specific time.
The research was undertaken in two studies. The first,through
the use of a marketing audit, was focused on three key
marketing areas within the Institute to indicate its overall
marketing strategy. The second study involved a questionnaire
to ascertain the effectiveness awareness of the Institute's
advertising.
The researcher first presents an historical review and an
ordering of the historical aspects to illuminate the past and
the current marketing posture of the ACT Institute of
Technical and Further Education (ACTITAFE). The data are
presented through four distinct historical periods from the
establishment of the organisation in 1921 to 1991.
Although technical and further education in the ACT has a
history in excess of sixty years, data revealed that there is
no clear evidence of a formal marketing strategy.
The marketing audit interviews collected information from a
broad but representative sample of eighteen staff members of
the institution who are involved with marketing, media,
career advice, publicity and similar marketing activities.
The results revealed ACTITAFE has no formal marketing
strategy. The attitude toward marketing and the marketplace
has been ad hoc, uncoordinated, disjointed and reactive in
its approach. Its principal approach is a reliance on
awareness advertising.
Because of the emphasis placed on advertising as the
Institute's major concept for marketing, a questionnaire was
distributed on advertising effectiveness and data were
obtained from 252 completed responses.
The results obtained from this study indicated that over the
years the Institute has successfully built advertising
awareness. Currently, it has no formal structured marketing
strategy. The approach appears to be ad hoc, disjointed and
uncoordinated.
There are positive attempts to rectify this posture. However,
the evidence available suggests that the journey will not be
easy and the transition will not be rapid.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory Institute of Technical and Further Education</field><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="subject">ACTITAFE</field><field name="subject">marketing strategies</field><field name="subject">marketing audit</field><field name="subject">advertising</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061018.145205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two school-based evaluations at a Catholic high school in the ACT a review</field><field name="creator">Moore, Peter Joseph</field><field name="description">The completion of two school-based evaluation reports at a

factors which contributed to the decision of the Minister for
Education on the recommendation of the Australian Education Council,
to establish such a centre.
This study looks at the historical background which resulted in
States' responsibility for education, at the Australian Constitution
which avoids any mention of education but which allows Commonwealth
support for education through grants to the States. It briefly traces
the development of an increasing Commonwealth involvement in education,
notes the very significant inquiries at national level into areas of
need resulting in reports such as the Murray Martin, Karmel and Kangan
recommending Commonwealth funding for specific areas of education.
Other significant institutions and influences are identified. These
include bodies such as the Australian Council for Education Research,
the Conference of Directors' General and the Australian Education Council.
The Commonwealth Department of Education is seen to play a major part in
the decision to establish a national curriculum centre supported as it
has been in this policy, by all major political parties and by successive
governments in office.
Much of this concern for curriculum reflects an environment of change
typical of the 60's both educationally and politically. It was a period
when philosophies of education and attitudes to the whole process of
schooling were being questioned.
Some influence emerges from contact by Australian teachers and academics
with major overseas curriculum centres, notably the Schools Council and
from large scale curriculum projects both in the U.S. and the U.K., notably
in the area of science.
A variety of factors contributed to the Australian Science Education
Project as a major national curriculum program which gave support to the
view that all States and systems could and would co-operate, with some
Commonwealth support, in the provision of curriculum materials and the
development of curricula with relevance for all Australian students.
UNESCO conferences such as that at Burwood in 1967 on the "Teaching
of the Social Sciences at the Secondary Level" and the Sydney one
concerned with the Teaching of English, among others, brought together
a range of concerned teachers who were involved in the subsequent
establishment of the National Committee on Social Science Teaching and
the National Committee for Teaching English. A third Committee, the
Asian Studies Co-ordinating Committee arose from a Commonwealth inquiry
into the teaching of Asian language and culture. These three committees
undertook programs in curriculum development which responded to the need
for work in these areas, and for the need for such programs to involve all
States and systems and to rationalise expenditure and utilise available
expertise in the curriculum area.
This study supports the view that the Curriculum Development Centre,
established under a 1975 Act of Parliament by that name, is a unique step
in the development of a national view of education and an example of a
co-operative model of development of curriculum at a national level. It
is not solely a funding body nor does it direct funds to State Departments.
Its small budget maintains a secretariat and a curriculum staff with
involvement and concern for national issues and the avoidance of overlaps
and duplication, and for the rationalization of resources. Its decision
making process requires involvement by all State departments, by Contact
Officers from State, Catholic and Independent schools and an input from
specialists in the field, from parents, academics, and the community. In
this regard it represents a marked change from the strictly State based
curriculum pattern in Australia.
The role of the Australian Education Council, the Commonwealth Department
of Education, the Australian Council for Education Research and two major
UNESCO conferences are examined as significant influences.
This study identifies other influences, political, social, educational and
financial which were significant in the decision by the Government of the
day to establish a national curriculum centre, and the persons and institutions
which influenced that decision, and worked to achieve its establishment,

assumed responsibility for pre, primary and secondary
schools in the Australian Capital Territory. It took
steps to provide a basis for the restructuring of
secondary education. The traditional six-year comprehensive
high school was to be replaced in 1976 by a
four-year high school and a two-year secondary college.
The Interim Authority decided that each school should be
responsible for its own curriculum which should not be
constrained by an external examination.
A system of course development and teacher assessment,
to replace the New South Wales Higher School Certificate
syllabuses and examination, was developed during 1974.
The Interim Authority sought the advice of the Australian
Council for Educational Research, and a report prepared by
it was used to stimulate public debate. After considering
a wide cross section of points of view the Interim Authority
decided that accredited courses would replace syllabuses,
teacher assessments, the examination and profile reports
the Certificate.
The ACT Schools Accrediting Agency, a committee of the
Interim Authority, was formed in 1975 to administer
accrediting assessment and reporting. The Accrediting
Agency negotiated the basis for tertiary entrance for
ACT students. It determined that a single aggregate
score, the Tertiary Entrance Score, should be calculated,
using aggregated scaled teacher assessments. Scores from
three major and one minor accredited-TES courses scaled by
the Australian Scholastic Aptitude Test total score would
be aggregated. A system-wide order of merit would be
created. The maximum aggregate score would be 360.
The basis for the aggregate was very different from that
which it was replacing. In New South Wales, five subject
scores with a possible maximum of 900 was used. An
examination of a number of comparison and correlation studies
presented in Part B indicates that ASAT scaling of teacher
estimates improves the correlation of teacher estimates with
the Higher School Certificate examination aggregate scores.
Some correlations between ASAT-scaled criteria and HSC
aggregates are in the order of 0.9. As is expected some
movement away from what was acceptable in 1975 occurred.
When examined in the light of the philosophy of school responsibility for curriculum and assessment the procedures
adopted certainly facilitate this, while at the same time
produce students' results which can be used as confidently
as external examination results have been.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">senior secondary colleges</field><field name="subject">ACT Schools Accrediting Agency</field><field name="subject">ACT Schools Authority</field><field name="subject">Tertiary Entrance Score</field><field name="subject">Higher School Certificate</field><field name="subject">school responsibility</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061020.093707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a media centre : a study of the development of the Instructional Media Centre, Canberra College of Advanced Education</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Frank</field><field name="description">The Instructional Media Centre at the Canberra College of Advanced
Education has been developed in the belief that teaching and
learning are performing arts - particularly when they take
place together - and that they are greatly enhanced by an understanding,
and appropriate use, of the media.
This Centre was established to provide media services to the
whole College, and to teach media courses in its School of
Teacher Education. Its development entailed the procurement
of equipment, the employment of staff, the organization of
administrative procedures, the devising of courses, the production
of materials, and later the design of a building to house the
operation.
In the absence of any comprehensive, coherent and cogent theory
this development was essentially pragmatic. Factors such as
the availability of money and material resources determined
its lower limits; the skills and beliefs of the people involved
its upper limits.
Designing, producing and delivering media materials, teaching,
and evaluating the outcomes of those activities are however
susceptible to theoretical examination, if not completely to
prediction and control. Media producers, managers, teachers
and students require an artistry that goes beyond theoretical
insight and technical competence. Traditional theoretical
frameworks have not adequately encompassed this quality.
The study examines the development of this Centre and the complex
of factors which have influenced it, in the light of the available
theories. It pays particular attention to the ways in which
theory informs practice in each of the Centre's areas of
activity, and also to the personal preferences and attitudes
of the people involved. Educational media is seen as a field
governed more by convention than by formula. Its unpredictable
and uncontrollable aspects are seen as signs of its artistry.
And artists have ultimately to be left to their own devices
and their own genius.
Perhaps the most important outcome of the study is that it
translates some knowledge from someone's head to a more objective
and accessible form of record.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Instructional Media Centre</field><field name="subject">Canberra College of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">CCAE</field><field name="subject">school of teacher education</field><field name="subject">media courses</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061020.094446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change agency in the implementation of telematics</field><field name="creator">Morris, Laraine</field><field name="description">Educational change can be defined as a systematic, sustained effort at change in
learning conditions and other related internal conditions in one or more schools,
with the ultimate aim of accomplishing goals more effectively (Miles 1987).
One project designed to bring about educational change was the Country Areas Program National Element (NATCAP) distance education by telematics project,
funded by the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training.
It was designed to increase curriculum options to students in schools in the western
region of New South Wales. All curriculum was delivered through the telematic
delivery. This project formed the basis of the research for this thesis.
The aim of the study was to examine the roles of change agents and determine
who enacted the roles through the process of implementing the NATCAP distance
education by telematics project in western New South Wales.
Telematics refers to the transmission of signals usually generated in a computer
circuit board over distance. It involves using computers, facsimile machines,
modems and telephones.
Through audio visual links students in western New South Wales can engage in
lessons delivered by teachers located in the Australian Capital Territory. This was
achieved through a pilot distance education via telematics project conducted in
1991 which was expanded in 1992-1995 to include students in six rural schools.
The students were located in both Catholic and Government schools in four rural
town in New South Wales. The NATCAP distance education project was
administered by the Catholic Education Office, Archdiocese of Canberra and
Goulburn and a project manager was appointed to facilitate the implementation of
the new project.
The question of who enacted the roles of change agents through the process of
implementing the distance education project in 1992-1995 became the focus of the
study.
Change is a process that involves the phases of initiation, implementation and
adoption according to Fullan (1991b). There are a number of factors that affect
implementation including teachers, principals and outside agencies (Fullan
1991b). The initiative of change does not occur, however without an advocate or
change agents. Havelock (1973) has identified four roles of a change agent which
are described as the catalyst, the solution giver, the process helper and the
resource link. Though the examination of the literature the question of who
enacted the roles of the change agents through the process of implementing the
NATCAP distance education project was refined and clarified.
The qualitative research method, with the researcher as an active participant in the
process, was the approach which enabled the research question of this thesis to be
examined. The researcher was the project manager for the NATCAP distance
education project and was placed in a central position to explore the question of
who enacted the roles of the change agents through the process of implementing
distance education by telematics.
Three research instruments, two questionnaires and a semi-structured interview,
were used to gather data based on the perceptions of the six participating school
principals. This data ensured that the information gathered by the researcher as
an active participant was reliable and valid.
The results of the first questionnaire, which examined the role of the project
manager as a change agent, indicated that the manager was a catalyst, facilitating
the introduction of the new method of teaching and learning. The results also
indicated that the roles of the solution giver and the resource link were also
enacted by the project manager according to the majority of principals who
responded to the questionnaire. The role of the process helper, involved in
problem-solving, monitoring and reviewing, was also a part of the project
manager's role as a change agent according to all the respondents.
The results of the second questionnaire which examined the three phases of
implementing change indicated that all six schools involved in the NATCAP
distance education project were involved in the initiation stage of implementation.
This was achieved by trialing the telematic mode for teaching and learning in each
school. All six schools moved into the second stage. This developed into the
implementation of Indonesian language and culture lessons, Art/Design and
Remedial and Extension Mathematics classes. For two schools the
implementation stage included the introduction of the Year 11 and 12 curriculum.
The project progressed into the third stage, continuation, for five out of the six
schools. One school did not move from the implementation to the continuation
stage.
As a result of the data collected through the examination of the factors that affect
implementation it was stated that the principals enacted a role of resource
providers and in some cases on the spot support for teachers. In the schools
administered by the New South Wales Department of School Education the cluster
director was also a resource provider. In some schools the principal was also a
"teacher" actively involved in the implementation of the NATCAP distance
education project. The project manager, cluster director (where applicable),
principal, assistant principals and teachers were listed as being involved in the
identification of needs. Need was identified as the most important factor which
affected the change.
As a result of the data collected and the interpretations made relating to the
findings of this research a number of conclusions were drawn.
Educational change goes through a process involving three phases from the initial
introduction of the innovation to the initial use and then full implementation as part
of the school practice.
Change involves a change agency, not one agent of change but a team of change
agents or a change agency. The change agency includes the project manager,
the principal, assistant principal, teachers and cluster directors (where applicable).
The agency enacts the roles of catalyst, solution giver, resource link and process
helper.
Implementation requires an agent of change from within the school and an agent of
change from without of the school working together as part of the change agency.
This can be seen by examining the factors affecting implementation. Need,
practicality, clarity, complexity and quality all affect implementation of an innovation
and all required an agent of change from without and agent of change from within
the school to identify each factor and address it.
The key personnel affecting implementation are the project manager and cluster
directors (where applicable) from the external level and the principal and the
teachers from the local level. These key personnel are factors which affect
implementation and belong to the change agency.
The leadership role of the principal impacts on the degree of implementation of the
initiative.
Teacher involvement through observation, exchanging ideas, team-teaching and
collegiality is required to bring about full implementation of the change.
Clustering schools to form learning networks where schools share ideas,
knowledge and resources enhances the possibility of initiatives becoming
implemented. Schools in the cluster should not only include those in the same
education system, schools should go outside their system for new ideas.
In the NATCAP distance education by telematics project there were four schools
administrated by the NSW Department of School Education and two schools
administered by the Catholic Education Office, Archdiocese of Canberra and
Goulburn who formed a NATCAP cluster. Together these schools implemented
the new method of teaching and learning called telematics. They brought about
change in the learning conditions and extended the curriculum.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="subject">Country Areas Program National Element</field><field name="subject">NATCAP</field><field name="subject">telematics</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061020.115221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power and the decision making process : an exploratory case study</field><field name="creator">Morris, Mervyn J.</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061020.120903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The immunosuppressive properties of the oligosacchardie processing inhibitor, castanospermine</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Russell</field><field name="description">Castanospermine (CS) is an alkaloid isolated from the nut of the Australian chestnut
tree, Castanospermum australae. It has been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory
effects, as evidenced by its ability to inhibit the clinical manifestations of passively induced
autoimmune encephalomyelitis and passive adjuvant arthritis in rats and the efferent phase
of contact hypersensitivity in mice. The purpose of this study was to determine if CS has
immunosuppressive, as well as anti-inflammatory, properties.
Contact hypersensitivity in mice to picryl chloride was chosen as the in vitro model of
cell mediated immune reactivity. Mice were sensitised with picryl chloride and treated with
CS, at doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg/day, twice daily for seven days, beginning at the time of
sensitisation. Passive transfer of spleen cells from treated animals transferred significantly
less contact hypersensitivity (P&lt;0.05) to naive mice than did cells from control mice. This
suggests that CS inhibited the generation of picryl chloride reactive effector cells. This
inhibition was not due to a depletion of the T cell phenotype responsible for contact
hypersensitivity, CD4+, as FACS analysis showed no alteration in CD4+/CD8+ ratio in CS
treated mice.
In vitro studies, using antigen-specific cell lines, showed that CS inhibits antigen
specific T-cell proliferation in a dose dependent fashion. Studies on the kinetics of this
inhibition revealed that CS inhibits an early step, before 24 hours of culture have elapsed, in
the T-cell proliferative response. Experiments were designed to examine if this early event
was antigen processing by the accessory cells in the culture, or an early event in T-cell
replication itself. CS not only failed to inhibit the antigen processing step, but when
processing was carried out in the presence of CS the subsequent T-cell proliferation was
enhanced. The results also indicated that CS, when added with preprocessed antigen, was
inhibiting T-cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner.
Subsequent studies examining the role of several key molecules in T-cell
proliferation showed that CS did not effect the expression of the receptors for IL-2 or
transferrin, nor did it alter the expression of the adhesion molecules LFA-1 or ICAM-1. The
precise molecular mechanism by which CS inhibits contact hypersensitivity in vivo and T-cell
proliferation in vitro still remains to be determined.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian chesnut tree</field><field name="subject">Castanospermine</field><field name="subject">Castanospermum australae</field><field name="subject">immunosuppressive</field><field name="subject">anti-infalmatory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061020.121647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese history books and other stories</field><field name="creator">Chan, Kenneth</field><field name="description">My thesis is a creative writing doctorate which focuses on one Chinese family's
adaptation to living in Australia in the mid-twentieth century. The thesis is in two
parts. Part I is an examination of Chineseness and identity within the context of the
short stories that make up Part I1 of the thesis.
In Part I, I have looked at the place of the Chinese within the larger, dominant cultures
of America and Australia. In particular, I have discussed the way in which the
discourses of the dominant culture have framed Chineseness; and also what it might
mean to describe authentic and essential qualities in Chineseness. The question I ask
is whether the concept of Chineseness shifts according to time, location, history, and
intercultural encounters. This leads me to try to "place" my family and myself. I
provide some background on my family and on specific incidents that have served as
springboards for the fiction. Part I also discusses some aspects of narrative theory in
relation to the stories and considers the stories within the context of other Chinese-
Australian fiction and performance.
Ln Part 11, I have written a collection of nine short stories about the lives of a fictitious
family called the Tangs. The stories can be described as a cycle that is unified and
linked by characters who are protagonists in one story but appear in a minor or
supporting role in other stories. Composing a linked cycle of stories has given me the
opportunity to extend the short story form, especially by giving me scope to expand
the lives of the characters beyond a single story. The lives of the characters can take
on greater complexity since they confront challenges at different stages of their lives
from different perspectives.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese identity</field><field name="subject">Chineseness</field><field name="subject">Chinese family life</field><field name="subject">Chinese Australians</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">stories</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061020.144139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher involvement in system policy formulation</field><field name="creator">Mugridge, Karen</field><field name="description">Policy formulation is a complex process involving many stakeholders. Teacher
involvement in this process is vital if policies are to be successfully implemented at

This study investigated teacher perceptions of their involvement in system po1icy
formulation in relation to eight areas: the complex policy process, political /
economic influences, teacher empowerment and morale, willingness, relationship
with the governing body, opportunities, support / encouragement and
implementation.
Teachers from four primary schools and one high school were involved in the study.
A questionnaire was completed by 68 respondents and a sub-sample of 8 participated
in a semi-structured interview.
The main findings of the study show that teachers are willing to become involved in
the policy process, however, are inhibited by ineffective information flows

Learning strategy research and learning style research, as two main areas of individual difference research, seek to help learners to &#65533;learn how to learn&#65533;, and ultimately become autonomous and independent learners.  Learning strategy theory postulates that successful learning strategies can be used to good effect by less effective learners, and that teachers can promote good learning strategy usage through classroom instruction.  At the same time, for there to be effective instruction to second language learners as to the most efficient learning strategy usage, there must be a research effort that looks not just at the strategies per se, but also gives attention to the cultural background of the students themselves.  However, there has been little research into the ways in which low-achieving ESL learners can develop effective learning strategies in a non-western context.  The historical, political, social and economic aspects of Taiwan make this small island a fascinating place for researchers interested in exploring how English is taught and learned in a relatively monolingual society (in the sense that Chinese Mandarin is the only official language and is predominately used all over Taiwan).  Therefore, this study explores the ESL learning strategies and learning styles of 462 adult learners in Taiwan, making use of Oxford&#65533;s Strategy Inventory for Language Learning and Kolb&#65533;s Learning Style Inventory.  Similarities and differences between the learning strategy usage of the high-achieving and low achieving groups are also investigated.  The results show that there was no statistically significant relationship between the learner&#65533;s English proficiency level and their individual learning style.  In sharp contrast, it was discovered that there was a highly significant relationship between the learner&#65533;s English proficiency level and their choice and use of various learning strategies.  It was also found that the higher the English proficiency level, the greater the variety of learning strategies adopted, and the more frequently those strategies were used.  This study aims to shed some light on the principles that underlie successful language learning, particularly in regards to the utilisation and accommodation of learning strategies and styles.  The results of such a study could thus contribute to the field of second language learning in a number of ways: for the learner, the teacher, the school policy maker, and the researcher.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ESL</field><field name="subject">English as a Second Language</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">college students</field><field name="subject">learning outcomes</field><field name="subject">learning strategies</field><field name="subject">Oxford's Strategy Inventory for Language Learning</field><field name="subject">Kolb's Learning Style Inventory</field><field name="subject">learning styles</field><field name="subject">language learning</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061023.124302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The practicum in library and information studies : a qualitative comparison of expectations and learning outcomes</field><field name="creator">Mulder, Ursula E.</field><field name="description">The purpose of the study was to ascertain the degree of similarity between the expectations for student learning as expressed by faculty, host librarians and students on practica in library and information studies; and the learning outcomes experienced as expressed by students. An attempt was also made to assess the bearing that preparation for and organisation of the practicum might have on learning outcomes. The study thus had four aims: (a) To discover whether the three stakeholders (faculty, host librarians and students) were working towards the same or similar objectives, (b) To ask students what they experienced and learnt in their individual practica, and to compare this with their previously stated expectations, (c) To assess the relationship between preparation by faculty of host librarians and of students, and a successful practicum. (d) To gather information on the importance of aspects of organisation related to practica, such as timing and duration. To meet the purpose and aims of the study five groups of research questions were framed. The first three dealt with the expectations for student learning and learning outcomes in the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains, as defined by Krathwohl, Bloom and Masia (1964) in their taxonomy. To meet the third and fouth aims of the study two other groups of research questions were framed which dealt with preparation and organisational aspects of the practicum under study. From these five groups of research questions specific interview schedules were designed, appropriate to each stakeholder interviewed and the inter-related investigations which the study comprised. A qualitative approach was chosen as the basis for carrying out the study. The Department of Library and Information Studies at the Western Australian Institute of Technology (now Curtin University of Technology) was selected as the study site. A sample was drawn to represent each of the stakeholders: the DLIS faculty, the host librarians and two cohorts of students. Student samples represented those undertaking a practicum at the end of their course in 1985 (an end-on practicum) and those undertaking the component mid-course in 1986 (a sandwich practicum). A total of 69 respondents were interviewed which produced 88 separate interviews. Personal interviews which were tape-recorded were conducted with each of the respondents between 19 September 1985 and 8 August 1986. A method of collating and analysing the data collected was devised by the researcher and is presented in Appendix V of this thesis. The following conclusions were reached from the analysis of results. While there was congruence between the expectations held by stakeholders for the learning outcomes of students, there was a lack of congruence between the expectations held by students pre-practicum, and their learning outcomes postpracticum. However, there was no marked difference between the outcomes of the end-on practicum and sandwich practicum students. This implies that the timing of the practicum might not be as important to learning outcomes as the individuals' experiences in their host library.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">library and information studies</field><field name="subject">practicum</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">librarians</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061023.144529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career choice : drift, desire or decision. Factors influencing career choice of year 12 students in A.C.T. catholic schools</field><field name="creator">Muller, Karl</field><field name="description">Year 12 has been identified as a critical decision
point in the career decision making process for students.
Students have been found to make decisions in different
ways some having already defined goals for the future
others are doubtful and make tentative goals.
At the end of Year 12 students are faced with the task
of career decision. During the final two weeks of year 12
these students will have to make choices about their
imminent future that is whether to do tertiary
studies/seek apprenticeships look for immediate employment
or defer studies for a time and seek employment. A review of
major theories relating to career determination was
undertaken. Decision-making theories have identified twelfth
grade/age range 16 - 18 years, as being one of the critical
decision periods for an adolescent. 355 A.C.T. Year 12
students from Catholic Colleges were given a questionnaire
designed to probe students' self awareness in relation to
study habits coping abilities, as well as a description of
some of their personal qualities relating to school life,
subject interest, and career benefits derived from the
future career considered. The information gained from the
Questionnaire was reduced to a number of sets of
relationships by factor analysis. The personal factors of
subject interest, career benefits and further study
interests were examined by canonical correlation techniques
with Career Types.
Students with an interest in scientific careers
exhibited an interest in the physical science subjects.
Those with an expressed interest in a blend of science and
expressive arts career were a group of students with
creative ideas / leadership aspirations,an interest in
cultural and physical science subject, and a desire for
further- studies. Another group of year 12 students involving
more girls than boys showed an interest in a cluster of
careers with a social involvement component but a rejection
of routine activities. Students with an interest in
environmental subjects with a possession of management and
living skills looked towards careers that provided out of
doors activities involving social work and selling. There
was a positive correlation between these personal factors

detailed, comprehensive portrait of the views of stakeholders, a view which can serve
as a medium through which Zambia can familiarise itself with issues and concerns

schools in the district have few human and material resources to support inclusion; (c)
students with/without disabilities and most stakeholders, except teachers, tend to
favour inclusion; and (d) the agenda for donor countries complicate educational

'keen readers' of novels for pleasure, and considerations regarding
audiencels by writers and publishers. It is predicated on the understanding that
adult power operates at every level of young adults' lives, including the
publishing, promotion and availability of their literature. The complexity of
defining 'young adult' and 'Young Adult literature' and therefore publishing
and promoting for this nominal audience is recognised as being dependent on
the varying adult constructs of the terms and, therefore, is at the basis of
decisions made in this adult-oriented industry. Historical and commercial
aspects of Australian publishing (nominally) for this group of readers provide
a context for this grounded theory-based qualitative study. Analysis of
transcripts from focus group discussions with self-defined young adult 'keen
readers of novels for pleasure' demonstrates that these participants had a
sophisticated understanding of their leisure reading experiences regarding
what they liked reading, how they found out about books, what made them
choose one book over another, and where they obtained them. The insights
gained from these 34 participants informed the analysis of comments by
Australian adult 'creators' - writers and publishing staff - regarding audience,
commercial pressures, promotional aspects and other factors influencing what
is published and made available to young adult keen readers for pleasure. That
these 34 participants were active buyers and promoters as well as borrowers of
books indicates the need for the industry to recognise their expertise and value
as a distinct and influential audience niche - the 'neo-consumers' of the
future. The research provides a starting point into analysis of the influence of
the group of adults I have termed 'gatekeepers', whose (largely institutional)
roles enable them to either connect young adult readers with books and
creators, or to separate them.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="subject">young adult readers</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">young adult literature</field><field name="subject">book publishing</field><field name="subject">bookselling</field><field name="subject">keen readers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061024.143742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community and teacher attitudes toward special educational provisions for gifted students in A.C.T. primary schools</field><field name="creator">Mulraney, Rosemary Anne</field><field name="description">This decade has seen an increasing awareness by
the Commonwealth Schools Commission, the ACT Schools
Authority, educators and members of the community of
students who are gifted in a diversity of areas.
A number of programs designed to meet the special
needs of gifted students have been developed in some
primary schools in the A.C.T. and it is timely that
the attitudes of principals, teachers and parents were
assessed.
To assess the attitudes of the three populations
(principals, teachers and parents) toward general
attitudes about gifted students, key aspects of planning
and organisation of gifted programs, classroom teachers
and their knowledge and need of assistance in gifted
education; and to explore whether the three populations
held different attitudes toward gifted students and the
provision of specific programs to meet their special
needs, the Field Study candidate developed and
administered a questionnaire to members of the A.C.T.
Association for Gifted and Talented Children, together
with principals, teachers and parents in nineprimary
schools in the A.C.T.
The results of the questionnaire indicated that
all three groups agreed with the proposition that every
child was entitled to an educational program that would
assist the child to develop to his / her fullest
potential. Appropriate extension programs should be run
for gifted students in the local primary school, with the
involvement of the resource teacher and the assistance
of personnel and locations outside of the local school
when it was appropriate.
Some reservations were expressed toward the level
of parent participation in the identification procedure,
program planning and program evaluation, and classroom
teachers were seen to require assistance in the areas
of identification, program planning and the evaluation
of programs designed to meet the special needs of
gifted students.
The Field Study concludes that local A.C.T.
primary schools could meet the special needs of gifted
students. This could be achieved by principals, teachers
and members of the School Board developing and
implementing special educational programs by utilising
Special Project funding, additional staff and
professional development opportunities which are
currently available in limited amounts through the

using Social Impact Assessment methods. The impacts studied were
changes in employment, household income, land and rental values.
The evaluation suggests that the execution of the IUIDP generated
beneficial as well as adverse effects.
The beneficial effects include that the program created employment
for several residents in the study areas and generally improved the
household income of the residents concerned. Also some benefits have
accrued to a number of land owners as the value of their land
increased. Other benefits identified include improved access, water
supply, sewerage and garbage services.
The adverse effects of the IUIDP include that the government did not
provide either compensation (for those who had to sacrifice their
land) or reconstruction assistance (for those who had to cut back
their property for access routes). Another adverse effect was
experienced by tenants who found their rent increased.
There was a widely held perception among the residents surveyed that,

In
the opening chapter theoretical issues relating to local government in developing
countries are raised. These are followed by a historical account of the development of
local government institutions in Tanzania, from pre-colonial times to the present day.
After this, the thesis identifies current problems of local government performance
paying special attention to local government authorities' effectiveness in collecting
their own revenues, their responsiveness to public needs, and staff satisfaction with
council leadership. Various explanations of poor performance of local government
authorities in Tanzania are then reviewed and evaluated. While acknowledging the
lack of autonomy from central government and the ill-planned re-introduction of
councils in 1982 as causes of poor performance, this thesis attributes some of the

relationship existed between teacher Pupil Control
Ideology (PCI) and membership of a practical subject
faculty or of a humanities subject faculty in ACT
government high schools. It was hypothesized that
teachers in practical subject faculties and teachers
of practical subjects would be custodial in their
PCI. Teachers in humanities subject faculties and
teachers of humanities subjects would be humanistic
in their PCI. A subsidiary purpose was to replicate
earlier research findings of a relationship between
PCI and years of teaching, sex, position in the
school administration, and type of school.
The PCI Form was administered to a population sample
of 116 teachers from five high schools in the Belconnen
area of Canberra. The results were subjected to t-test
and one-way analysis of variance. Statistically
significant relationships were observed between PCI
and teacher variables of subject faculty, subject
taught, and sex of teacher. Earlier findings for other
variables were not replicated.
The direction of findings was surprising. Teachers
in practical subject faculties and of practical
subjects were more humanistic than humanities
faculty and subject teachers. Female teachers were
more custodial than male teachers. An analysis of
variance showed no interaction effect between
variables sex and faculty, and sex and subject taught.
More research on possible causes of the relationships,
such as student attitude to subject, and teacher
sense of achievement, is needed before the findings
can have practical application.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pupil Control Ideology</field><field name="subject">PCI</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">government high schools</field><field name="subject">subject faculties</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061027.123030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching English as a foreign language for communication in China</field><field name="creator">Rongji, Lu</field><field name="description">China urgently needs a large number of interpreters, guides
and teachers who are competent communicators in the English
Language. One of the foreign language institutes that is
attempting to satisfy this need is the Beijing Second Foreign Language Institute (or Erwai).
It is argued that Erwai fails to produce competent
communicators in English, a failure that is seen to be due
to three interdependent factors: 1) the lack of teacher
training, especially in the area of teaching methodology;
2) the resultant inability to select and effectively
exploit teaching materials; and 3) the inappropriateness
of currently-used teaching approaches to the perceived
goals of the Institute.
It is the third of these factors that receives particular
attention in this paper. A survey is made of the merits
and shortcomings of the three teaching approaches that
have been used at Erwai, namely the 'grammar-translation,'
'audio-lingual' and 'cognitive' approaches. This serves as
back-ground to the proposal that a 'communicative approach'
to teaching be introduced at Erwai.
It is claimed that the communicative approach is the most
appropriate to the goals of Erwai students, the majority
of whom will need to be communicatively competent in their
future professions. The communicative approach is applied
to the four basic skills of language and it is suggested
that these skill areas be integrated in the classroom,
rather than be taught in separate courses, as is presently
the case at Erwai.
Finally, the adoption of a communicative approach is seen
to involve changes not only in classroom activities and
materials, but also in the role of the student and the role
of the teacher.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching English as a foreign language</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Beijing Second Foreign Language Institute</field><field name="subject">Erwai</field><field name="subject">communicative approach</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061027.141713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A belly full of arms and legs</field><field name="creator">Page, Courtney Hodges</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative thesis</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061027.142947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The travellers</field><field name="creator">Page, Sue</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative thesis</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061027.143720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes of Australian sports administrators to unions, awards and enterprise bargaining</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Jocelyn Anne</field><field name="description">Sport, once an amateur pursuit has evolved in to a lucrative industry. The most
recent development in the evolution of Australian sport has been the emergence of
industrial regulation. Unlike other Australian labour markets, the sports administrators
labour market was entirely market regulated until 1994. Over the last five years the sports
administrators labour market has transformed into a centralised award based system. On
the surface it appears that there is no obvious explanation for the dramatic re-regulation of
this labour market. In order to determine the factors behind the re-regulation, this thesis
investigated Australian sports administrators attitudes to unionism, awards and enterprise
bargaining, including their preferences to awards and enterprise bargaining agreements.
The attitudes of 229 Australian sports administrators were surveyed. The response rate was
67.25%. Findings from the survey indicated a number of points: (1) union membership
predicted 8% of their attitude to unionism, (2) non union members were more likely to have
positive and accepting attitudes to unions, (3) sports administrators working under
Enterprise Bargaining agreements had more positive and accepting attitudes of unions, (4)
Enterprise Bargaining was considered to be more beneficial than not in sport, (5) Enterprise
Bargaining had more than double the support of Award regulation, and (6)Award
regulation had almost equal amounts of rejection and support.
Other results indicated that the sports administrators labour market remained market
regulated until 1994 because a majority of sports administrators belonged to demographic
groups which were less inclined to become union members. Factors behind the reregulation
were determined to be: strong support for targeted services within workplaces
rather than generic services across an industry, and strong support for increased union
interaction when negotiating terms and conditions of employment which effects sports
administrators' attitudes to unionism. It was evident that the re-regulation was not caused
by a large shift in the attitudes of sports administrators or a result of problems stemming
from the market being entirely by market regulation. It is more than likely that the sudden
re-regulation of the sports administrators labour market was the sports industry's first step
towards industrial maturity.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial regulation</field><field name="subject">sport</field><field name="subject">sports administrators</field><field name="subject">unionism</field><field name="subject">industrial awards</field><field name="subject">enterprise</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061027.144327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water in the urban landscape : the focus being on the design of a public open space on the Mutha River corridor at Pune, India</field><field name="creator">Pandey, Roopali B.</field><field name="description">The focus of this study is the design of a public open space on the Mutha River corridor
at Pune in India. Like any other river in India, the Mutha River has religious
significance to the region. The river has influenced the location and development of the
city and featured prominently in the history of the region. Most of the historic heritage
values of the city are along the river and are located in the study area.
Though the river has been abused by damming of the catchment, removal of vegetation
for urbanization, polluted by human and industrial waste and channelization, it still
provides opportunities to be developed as a recreational resource. Insights from a study
of water bodies in Canberra, Australia, where the design of the water bodies for urban
recreation encompass ideas of sustainable design, combined with an appreciation of the
heritage of Indian design, are used for the river corridor development at Pune.
The proposed development of the river corridor to include parkland is designed to
provide a recreational open space for the community as well as improve the overall
health and management of the Mutha River corridor. The proposal will also try and
achieve long-term sustainability of the river. The design considers hydrological,
morphological, ecological, water quality, aesthetic, vegetation, recreation and cultural
issues. A more naturalistic channel as an alternative to a hard engineering solution is
proposed. It provides protection from flood and erosion hazards, addresses social
concerns like environment and health, and provides a more attractive landscape in the
high-density section of the city</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban landscape design</field><field name="subject">public space</field><field name="subject">Pune</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">Mutha River</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061027.153613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intersource agreement on the prediction of recidivism</field><field name="creator">Parker, Richard John</field><field name="description">In a wide range of counselling situations, including those involving offenders,
researchers have bemoaned the lack of consensus about outcome. Some
researchers have argued that a lack of consensus is due to the fact that the
different sources retain unique points of view, which can never be amalgamated
into a common outcome. The current paper argues that, while sources will have
their own unique perspective, it is possible to develop a meaningful consensus,
if it is done very carefully. The factors which need to be taken into
consideration are: measuring different outcomes; the different interpretation of
the question by each source; and bias.
An important outcome in correctional settings is an offender's current level of
criminality, or likelihood of reoffending. It was hypothesised that the 12
Probation and Parole Officers' predictions about the likelihood of recidivism of
368 offenders would correlate with fresh charges recorded within 12 months by
the Magistrates Court. This hypothesis was supported. It was also
hypothesised that the Level of Service Inventory - Revised (LSI-R) would also
correlate with fresh charges and that the former correlation would be different
to the latter. While the LSI-R did correlate significantly with fresh charges, the
predictions of the Probation and Parole Officers were not significantly different.
The use of correlation coefficients to assess predictive validity has been
criticised as they are affected by base rates of offending and selection ratios of
offenders to high and low risk categories. However when a more appropriate
statistical tool, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
(ROC) was employed, the results were not substantially different. The
predictive abilities of offenders was also tested against the same criterion and
Intersource Agreement on the Prediction Recidivism
were found sorely wanting, failing to correlate with fresh charges or any of the
other predictive measures. It is argued that the offenders failed to predict
accurately because of bias and/or poor ability to predict their own behaviour.
The ability of the Probation and Parole Officers to predict reoffending to a much
greater level than usually recorded in the criminological literature was ascribed
to the higher level of information about their own predictive abilities, through a
natural feedback mechanism which does not usually apply to professionals
making clinical predictions about recidivism, and to training in predictors of
reoffending which they received when they were trained in the administration
of the LSI-R.
It was also found that the ability of the LSI-R to predict recidivism was
improved by incorporating offender age through linear regression.
Suggestions were made for improving consensus among sources in counselling
outcome studies. In particular, it was noted that sources do not necessarily
interpret the question in the manner the researcher desires and it may be
necessary to test the subjects' ability to distinguish between similar questions
when this distinction is important.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">probation</field><field name="subject">Parole Officers</field><field name="subject">recidivism</field><field name="subject">correctional settings</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061031.111330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of school-based staff development</field><field name="creator">Peljo, Kalle</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with school-based staff development. It
looks briefly at the reasons for this development, emanating from changes
in society and schools.
First it traces the growth of school-based staff development
overseas and in Australia. A variety of approaches to school-based
staff development activities is demonstrated by a selection of case
studies in the United Kingdom, United States and Australia.
The study then examines staff development provisions in the ACT
education system, a system based on the philosophy of participatory
decision making. It then looks closely, by means of description and
questionnaire, at staff development in a particular school in this
system, Duffy Primary School.
The study concludes with recommendations and a model for staff
development in schools.
The writer implemented a school-based model of staff development
at Duffy Primary School independent of other current theories and
practices on school-based staff development. His most recent reading
and research outlined in this study have confirmed the basic soundness
of the school-based model of staff development.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school-based staff development</field><field name="subject">Duffy Primary School</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061031.123052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Khmer Sampot : an evolving tradition</field><field name="creator">Perry, Liz</field><field name="description">The Khmer Sampot: An Evolving Tradition examines the history of the Khmer
hip-wrapper, specifically the sampot. and its place within Khmer society. The
thesis suggests that the continuation of the tradition of making and wearing
the sampot is an indicator of what is important within Khmer society.
Evidence of the sampot's early form comes from many sources, including
Angkorian sculpture and inscriptions; from notes made by the Chinese emissary
Chou Ta-Kuan who lived at Angkor in 1296AD; traders in the region around the
fifteenth century; later European explorers such as Henri Mouhot; early
twentieth century travellers, scholars and French administrators; later
twentieth century anthropologists notes, Cambodian journals, interviews with
Cambodian people and visits to Cambodia.
Using the above evidence, the sampot's forms and functions within Khmer
society from ancient times to the present day are examined and discussed. The
varieties of sampot. the motifs, colours, types of cloth and methods of
weaving are considered. Also considered are the sampot's functions, ie as
everyday dress, ceremonial dress and the economic function of the sampot
within Khmer society.
The thesis notes that during the twentieth century alone there have been two
events which could have caused the demise of traditional sampot weaving, one
of which was the flood of imported goods to Indochina during the early years
of the twentieth cntury, resulting in a lack of interest in local goods and
the subsequent lack of production of local goods such as cloth. The other
event was Pol Pot's reign of Cambodia during 1975-79, when the population wore
a black uniform. In the case of the first event, it was the French who
realised that encouraging the traditional skills to resurface was essential if
these skills were not to be lost. However in the case of the second event, it
appears to have been the Cambodian people themselves who, after the
devastating events of the late 1970's, recommenced their tradition of making
and wearing sampot as a way of expressing their cultural identity.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Khmer Sampot</field><field name="subject">hip-wrapper</field><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061031.132245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Senior school writing : a study of the content and form of writing in senior secondary English</field><field name="creator">Patis, Anthony Powis</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the writing of senior students in the subject
English at an ACT secondary college. Several features of the ACT
education system are relevant. There is a high retention rate, so the
sample is a broad one. The curriculum is school based, as is assessment.
There are separate courses for those seeking tertiary entrance (TE) and
those seeking to complete their education at Year 12 (Accredited).
The theoretical basis of the study is provided by the work of a number
of linguists with an interest in school language, in particular Graham
Little. 255 samples of writing have been analysed, taking account of the
function and forms of language. The function, or meaning, has been
analysed in terms of content, abstraction, purpose and audience.
The writing in the Accredited course is evenly distributed between the
human and material worlds, three quarters is informational and one
quarter Imaginative. The level of abstraction shows a predominance of
reporting and generalising. Writing in the TE course is 60% concerned
with the human world and reaches higher levels of abstraction such as
speculation and hypothesising. The audience is academic. Compared with
earlier findings, this study shows more human content and higher levels
of abstraction.
Language functions through selective use of forms. The aspects of form
analysed are vocabulary, abstraction of noun phrase, sentence length and
sentence sequencing. Figures produced were largely consistent with
earlier studies; however the TE group shows higher syllable counts,
greater abstraction of noun phrase and longer sentences than the
Accredited group. Creative writing brings the groups closest together.
Handwriting, spelling and punctuation are examined. Handwriting is
always legible, spelling close to 98% correct and 84% of full stops are
correctly used. A small number of scripts produce most of the errors in
both spelling and punctuation.
The achievement of students as revealed by this study of writing is
consistent with earlier studies although the students represented here
demonstrate higher levels of abstraction. The curriculum contains more
human content and is commendably comprehensive, although there is
less poetic and expressive writing than might be expected.
This form of language analysis is recommended for its concentration on
the language actually produced in class, the insights it provides for
teachers and the information it provides for meaningful public
discussion of education.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">senior secondary English</field><field name="subject">senior schools</field><field name="subject">senior students</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061031.142022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining teacher morale in amalgamating schools : factors which have a positive effect on teacher morale &amp; factors which have a negative effect on teacher morale</field><field name="creator">Paul, Anne</field><field name="description">This study arose out of an experience with an amalgamation of two high
schools in the ACT in the early 1990s. The amalgamation process took two and
a half years from the time the decision was made to close one of the schools
until the new school was consolidated on one site. The change processes
impacted on many areas of teachers' work and this, combined with the
emotional aspects of being in a school which was closing, flagged teacher
morale as an issue requiring attention.
The study involved seeking responses to a questionnaire and interviewing
teachers involved in the amalgamation. The interview data was then grouped
by issue and the responses from teachers analysed and compared with related
research literature.
Research indicated that leadership style and effectiveness impacts most
heavily on the morale of teachers undergoing major change such as school
closure/amalgamation. This was substantiated by this study. The decision, by
the principal, to close both schools and create a new school, retaining aspects
of the culture of the original schools was clearly favoured over the alternative
suggestion, by the ACT Government, of the swift closure method and the
absorption of students into an existing school. The outward signs of a new
school; name; logo; uniform; the involvement of the community, the degree of
shared decision-making, the refurbishment of the buildings, the new curriculum
and associated policies and the management of resources were found to
contribute positively to teacher morale.
A lack of consultation prior to announcing the closure decision, a failure to
acknowledge the need of some teachers to grieve for the loss of their school
and a lack of activities to mark the final days of the schools involved have been
identified as having the greatest negative effect on teacher morale in this study.
Maintenance and effective use of the buildings vacated by a closing school has
also been raised as an issue affecting the morale of the teachers from that
school.
This study has implications for future school closures or amalgamations from
the points of view of maintaining of the morale of teachers, and also that of
students</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australain Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">school amalgamation</field><field name="subject">school closures</field><field name="subject">teacher morale</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061031.143504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consensus, decision-making and the Anglican Church : a case study of decision-making in the Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn</field><field name="creator">Paul, Ross G.</field><field name="description">decisionmaking
in a free-associative, or non-imperative, organisation,
focusing on the Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn as a
case study. Because people choose to participate in the Anglican
Church as a religious community, it is postulated that they may
perceive its decision-making as being characterised by consensus.
Through an analysis of the organisational elements and the
participants involved in the decision-making process, their
inter-relationships are examined. By survey the biographical
nature of synod participants is specified and elites identified.
Finally, by case-decision analysis the process of decision-making
is explored, and the presence and use of consensus examined.
The study draws upon those members attending the 1988 session of
the Diocesan Synod of the Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn as the
population to be surveyed. Members of synod are also members of
the various decision-making groups in the diocese. Two recently
implemented decisions are used as case studies in order to
examine the process of decision-making in the diocese.
Results of the Synod survey are detailed at Chapter 4, and the
analysis of the case decisions is at Chapter 5. The study found
that there was an indication of an elite in the decision-making
structure and that a strong administrative agenda was promoted by
that group.
The study concludes by suggesting that there are similarities in
function between public, commercial and free-associative bodies
of comparative size in regard to elites, professionalism and the
lack of consensus in the decision-making process. The study also
concludes that the nature of elites may be similar to that
portrayed by the community studies school where the organisation
is sufficiently like a community in the nature of its interpersonal
relationships. The researcher suggests that the study
provided illumination about church management procedures and a
framework applicable to the study of other organisations.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">Anglican Church</field><field name="subject">Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn</field><field name="subject">Diocesan Synod</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061031.150036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A profile of the away from home Year 12 college student in the A.C.T.</field><field name="creator">Paynter, Christine</field><field name="description">Questionnaires were administered to 118 Secondary College students in the A.C.T. to

programme was to provide young children ("Kids")
from deprived cultural backgrounds with opportunities
to learn appropriate social behaviours by pairing
them with older students ("Companions") for activities
involving social interactions. Unlike the typical
work of the School Counsellor, which tends to be
problem centered and crisis oriented, the Companionship
programme is seen as a preventive activity which uses
"peer helpers" as a means of extending the outreach
services of the School Counsellor. The effects of
this programme on the Companions, rather than on the
Kids, was the focus of this study.
The purposes of the present investigation were:
a) to identify characteristics of A.C.T. secondary
college students who volunteered to be Companions;
b) to identify appropriate Companion selection
procedures;
c) to assess the effects of communications skills
training on an initial group of Companions in
comparison to late-entering Companions who did
not receive such training;
d) to assess the drives and sentiments which motivated
college students to volunteer for the programme
and to ascertain any changes in those drives and
sentiments which might occur during the programme;
e) to determine whether the Companionship experience
influenced a change in vocational preference
toward a career in social service;
and, although not the major thrust of the study,
f) to assess the effects of the Companionship
experience on the Kids' social adjustment.
After pilot programmes in 1978 and 1979, the
present study was undertaken during Terms One and
Two, 1980. Thirteen A.C.T. secondary college students
volunteered to become Companions. Eleven A.C.T.
primary school students and one junior secondary
school student were selected to participate as Kids
in the programme.
Prior to active participation, volunteers completed
the Kuder Preference Record - Vocational (Kuder) and
the Motivation Analysis Test (MAT). The teachers of
the Kids assessed them using the Bristol Social Adjustment
Guide (BSAG) and completed a brief questionnaire
to aid the Researcher in his pairing of Kids with
Companions.
The Companions attended six (1 1/2 hour) sessions
of a communications skills training programme adapted
from the Peer Counselling Student Training Course
(Varenhorst &amp; Hamburg, 1972). Based on perceptions
formed during the training period, the Companions
then rated each other using the Group Assessment of
Interpersonal Traits (GAIT) developed by Goodman (1972).
The Researcher also made a subjective ranking of each
participant in relation to his perception of the
individual's potential to be an effective Companion.
Contrary to expectation, only two new Companions
joined the programme at the beginning of Second Term.
The Companionship activities terminated after two
school terms, at which time all Kids were reassessed
by their teachers on the BSAG and post-measures on
the Kuder and MAT were completed for those Companions
remaining in the programme. Four Companions who had
left the programme before the termination of activities
had completed these measures at the time of their withdrawal
.
The results of the present investigation included:
a) Significantly more females than males volunteered
to become Companions, and their family birth-order
position as last-born was highly significant.
b) The results of the ratings for potential
effectiveness as a Companion on the GAIT and on
subjective ranking by the Researcher produced a
highly significant correlation (.01 level),
indicating that either method of selection is
appropriate.
c) Because only two new Companions joined the
programme at the start of Term Two, it was not
possible to adequately compare the effects of
training versus no training.
d) As a group, there were two significant changes
in the motivations of the older students. There
were increases in MAT scores measuring the drive
"Narcism-Comfort" and the sentiment "Sweetheart-
Spouse," significant at the .05 level.
e) The results of the initial administration of
the Kuder revealed that volunteers already
had a high preference for careers in social
service areas. There was no significant change
in this orientation following participation in
the Companionship programme.
f) The second administration of the B3AG revealed
no significant changes in the teachers'
perceptions of the Kids' social adjustment.
The Companionship programme is considered to
have been beneficial to both Kids and Companions.
Although there were no statistically significant
changes in the Kids in the short term of this study,
it appears likely that there is potential for long
term benefits. Several of the relationships are
continuing on an informal basis. Companions spontaneously
expressd the enjoyment and personal growth
they had derived and their willingness to participate
in the next programme. Some parents of Kids were
enthusiastic in their evaluations and have sought
to keep in touch with the Companion. The Companionship
programme is seen to have been a valuable preventive
programme in community mental health.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrabundah College</field><field name="subject">companionship programme</field><field name="subject">peer helpers</field><field name="subject">companions</field><field name="subject">school counsellors</field><field name="subject">social service</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061031.155256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Melrose High School : a portrayal of the institution</field><field name="creator">Pettigrove, Graham</field><field name="description">This Field Study is an attempt to present an wholistic

HOWZAT, designed to sample the oral language, reading, and cognitive
style competencies of seven year old children. The evaluation of
the pilot study indicated that the procedure was limited in the
extent to which the original aims could be attained.
A follow up study with amended aims, items, and procedure was
conducted and evaluated. The second study was a descriptive,
empirical study of the responses of a sample of seven year old
children to eighteen items - most of which contained distortions of
written language forms. The procedure required the children to make
decisions about the acceptability of the items and to discuss and
justify their decisions. The sample consisted of thirty children,
ten from each of three reading ability groups. The allocation of
children to groups and ranking within each of the groups according
to reading ability was done by their respective teachers.
The children's responses to the items and some of their response
behaviours were analysed in two major ways.
In the item analysis it was found that the children had similar
response patterns to the items that were distorted semantically,
syntactically and in conventions of print but responded differently
to the graphophonically distorted items.
The patterns of response to the different kinds of distortions were
interpreted in terms of the intrusive effect of the distortions on
the children's expectations about written language.
Different response patterns were also found between and within the
three ability groups. Children perceived by their teachers as being
better readers demonstrated competence in finding and using
strategies for dealing with the task and items. Individual profiles
were presented to illustrate these differences.
The conclusion reached in the evaluation was that the use of
distorted materials had produced interesting results but was not
justified on ideological grounds. However, the procedure was judged
to have some potential as an action research methodology to explore
children's reasoning with print and strategy learning abilities, and
to probe their linguistic development and performance.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HOWZAT</field><field name="subject">oral language</field><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="subject">learning behviours</field><field name="subject">cognitive style</field><field name="subject">linguistic development</field><field name="subject">action research methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061102.151731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The roles of intermediary agents in housing for the poor in Inonesia: three models of intervention</field><field name="creator">Lang, Heracles C.</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the issues faced by the urban poor in their efforts to gain housing in
developing countries. It argues that participation in housing is a matter of governance, in
which the Public, Private and Popular sectors interact, and Intermediary Agents (IA) are
necessary to act as catalysts in this interaction.
In Indonesia there are two major problems related to housing the urban poor. The first
problem concerns the quantity of housing. The second problem concerns the quality of
housing, infrastructure and the environment. The government usually addresses these
problems through a project-based, sectoral approach that lacks community engagement and
accountability. Intermediary Agents have assisted many of these housing projects. However,
little research has been undertaken on their role in these housing projects, as well as in the
informal housing process.
This thesis examines the role of IAs in the housing process of four different
communities: one community in a government-sponsored project and three communities in
informal settlements. The findings showed that the IAs, in engaging with the four different
communities, played different roles and have different values.
The involvement of IAs in the housing process elucidates a fundamental issue. On one
hand, the IAs offer a mechanism to assist communities in providing and improving access to
housing, infrastructure and services. However, there are limitations to their role: they have not
the capacity to improve security of land tenure for the residents, which is essential for
sustainable housing development. Where there has been some recognition of residents' rights
to occupy the land, there have been substantial gains in community engagement in investing
and improving their living environment.
The thesis demonstrates the importance of community participation and acknowledges
stakeholder engagement and community empowerment are crucial, roles that are often
dependent on the involvement of IAs. It also extended the research on movement and
development IAs demonstrating that both functions are complementary and important in
housing delivery and that there are five roles that these IAs could play depending on the
housing situation.
The thesis offers new approaches to housing delivery and policy in Indonesia by
involving urban poor communities, as the beneficiaries of housing for the poor programs. The
qualitative method of the research has not been able to provide a generalised conclusion, but
the lessons learned are important not only for providing housing for the urban poor in
Indonesia but also possibly to addressing housing problems in other Asian countries. This
thesis addresses four areas of intervention in transposing skills for a more democratic
approach in housing the poor. Within these areas the research proposes new models of
engagement for relevant stakeholders in public, popular and private sectors involving
Intermediary Agents. These models are underpinned by a set of basic principles to guide IA
engagement. Lastly the thesis proposes three models for IAs involvements in the housing
process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">urban poor</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">intermediary agents</field><field name="subject">charity</field><field name="subject">legal advocacy</field><field name="subject">networking</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061102.152324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A consideration of how the communicative approach may be used in language teaching in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Phuc, Vu Van</field><field name="description">Increasing development of the relationship between Vietnam and other
countries has resulted in a great demand for English language teaching (ELT)
throughout the country. The need is ever greater for a considerable number
of people who can use English effectively in their work. However, at present
ELT in Vietnam is still far from satisfactory. There exists a common problem
of communicative incompetence in Vietnamese learners. ELT in the Hanoi Foreign Languages Teachers' College (HFLTC) is taken to illustrate the fact
that even after five years of training, students frequently remain deficient in
the ability to actually use the language, to understand its use in normal
communication, and to carry out their teaching adequately afterwards.
That existing situation demands a critical look at ELT in all institutions to
work out suitable materials and methods to be used in the Vietnamese setting.
This work has been undertaken as an exploratory study of this problem. To
provide a context for the study, the background to ELT in Vietnam is
reviewed. Following it is a detailed description of different approaches used
in ELT with reference to the teaching and learning situations in Vietnam.
Special emphasis is placed on the differences between conventional
approaches and the currently influential one - the Communicative Approach.
A detailed comparison is made between two lessons taken from structuralbased
and functional/notional-based textbooks representing two distinct
approaches. This comparison will be examined from the methodological point
of view, investigating, for example, how language is treated in the two
approaches, how different types of activities are used, and the role of teacher
and learner in the two approaches in order to highlight a possible fresh
approach for Vietnamese coursebook designers, teachers and learners in ELT.
A sample lesson based on the Communicative Approach is finally provided to
assist any attempts to teach and learn English communicatively.
It is hoped that this survey will contribute to reducing the existing problem
of inadequate communicative competence in Vietnamese learners.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">English Language Teaching</field><field name="subject">ELT</field><field name="subject">communicative approach</field><field name="subject">Hanoi Foreign Languages Teachers' College</field><field name="subject">HFLTC</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061102.160458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Commonwealth Senior Executive Service : an approach to improving the Public Service</field><field name="creator">Pinyoying, Disaya</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commonwealth Senior Executive Service</field><field name="subject">public service</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061102.161233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">North-Eastern Regional Non-Formal Education Centre Life Experience classes</field><field name="creator">Piaseu, Bunmee</field><field name="description">The objectives of the study were to examine the Life Experience curriculum, level 3-4, in terms of the teachers,
students and problems encountered in the course presentation
at the adult school of the North Eastern Regional Non-formal Education Centre:
Tools used in the study are :- (1) questionnaires
seeking the expectations of the twenty-seven centre staff
(2) questionnaires seeking attitudes and desires of eighty-two
students in the classes studied (3) observation of four
Life-Experience classes (4) interviews with five teachers of
Life-Experience classes and thirty-one students.
Important findings include the following :-
Both student attendance and staff enthusiasm were high,
The syllabus was seen as suitable in length and level of
difficulty by both staff and students, even though the level
of performance (as measured by examination) varied widely
across courses and between students. Students asked for a
flexible component to meet localised needs as well as the
core curriculum.
The objectives of the classes were for students who
had had no chance to continue their formal studies to gain
knowledge, attitudes, skills and culture needed for their daily
occupation. Students requested more information on foreign
geography, biographies on important Thai figures, and the
economic and political situation in Thailand. Skills which
were learnt and applied included food preservation, house
maintenance, hygiene, use of legal procedures such as traffic
controls and loans, family planning and Buddhist moral codes.
Attitudes which it was considered appropriate to develop were
symbolised by the 'Knit-pen man' who is a good citizen,
rational problem solver, diligent, patient and a supporter of
national goals.
Changes requested by students for the courses included
more time for class discussion, a wide range of textbooks to be
available, and field trips to broaden their experience. Changes
indicated by staff and student responses were a greater
emphasis on changes in behaviour with regard to food
preparation and hygiene, more thorough and reflexive evaluation
to develop adequate levels of knowledge, allowance for the
considerable personal difficulties of the adult students
attending classes, and supply of a greater range of teaching
resources.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Life Experience curriculum</field><field name="subject">North Eastern Regional Non-formal Education Centre</field><field name="subject">adult students</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061102.162041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The in-service needs of teacher-librarians</field><field name="creator">Pitkeathly, Pamela Jean</field><field name="description">To determine the in-service needs of teacher-librarians, personal
interviews were conducted in thirty six schools selected by random
sampling technique from schools in the Liverpool education region.
In this survey research, teacher-librarians in these schools were
asked to indicate courses they felt they needed to attend, preferred
learning method and to discuss aspects of their work in schools.
Results showed that teacher-librarians with more extensive library
training felt the need for extra skills in curriculum/teaching areas,
those with basic training only wanted more librarianship skills,
whilst a number employed in non-government primary schools wanted to
learn more about management. The most experienced group of teacher-librarians
wanted courses that provided more skills in librarianship;
those with the highest qualifications had demands for in-service that
were comparable to those of the lesser trained. A significant
feature of the findings was the extent of isolation felt by teacherlibrarians,
especially those working in small primary schools.
Primary and secondary teacher-librarians felt that their needs were
quite different, but this was not borne out by results of the survey.

more democratic educational structures and practices. By
examining the restructuring of public secondary schooling
provisions in New South Wales in the period after 1950 it
argues that public schools in Australia are not democratic
institutions.
Rather than being democratic institutions public
schools, it is maintained, reflect the private interests of
members of so-called "professional and professionalizing
groups", or, more precisely, of those with assets in
credentials or assets in organization employed within
monopoly capitalist enterprises and state enterprises. The
employment domain of these groups is characterized by
bureaucratic forms of control.
The private interests of these groups are class
interests in that they pertain to the maintenance of the
material interests of those with assets in credentials and
assets in organization through the monopoly of special
knowledge and skills and reflect the class structure of a
society in which monopoly capitalism has become the
dominant economic, and, therefore, political and
ideological, force.
As the above outline suggests, in attempting to address
the question of inequality in secondary schooling, marxist
theories and categories, most notably those pertaining to
class formation and class struggle, are drawn upon.
In addition, the thesis maintains that the private
interests of those with assets in credentials or assets in
organization are "naturalized" in and through the ideology
of individualism and of meritocracy. By examining the
actual way in which the labour force was being restructured
in the post-war period the thesis provides one avenue of
critique of these constructions and attempts to demonstrate
the limits of equality of opportunity in a class-based
society.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public schools</field><field name="subject">class interests</field><field name="subject">educational inequality</field><field name="subject">professional groups</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061106.094056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of desktop personal computer technology on the factors that contribute to job satisfaction and motivation</field><field name="creator">Porch, Celina</field><field name="description">This research study had three aims. The first aim was to identify if any
changes in job characteristics and the motivating potential of jobs occurred
when workers were provided with their own personal desktop computers for
accessing automated integrated information management systems,
wordprocessing and spreadsheeting facilities. The second aim of the study
was to determine if any changes in job satisfaction occurred as a result of
such changes in job characteristics and the motivating potential of jobs. The
third aim of the study was to determine whether changes in job satisfaction
that resulted from changes in job characteristics and changes in the
motivating potential of jobs were moderated by the following factors:
workers' perceptions of the impact of the new technology on their work
practices, workers' prior knowledge of computing, and workers' age, gender
and job category.
A survey questionnaire was used to collect information for this research
study. The complete version of the Job Diagnostic Survey formed the major
portion of this questionnaire. The additional portions of the questionnaire
were designed to collect information relating to workers' perceptions of the
impact of the new technology, their prior computing knowledge and their
age, gender and job category.
A quasi-experimental multiple time-series research design was used to
fulfill the aims of this study. The experimental group comprised 19 workers
who had been using the new technology for no longer than five months. In
order to maximise discrimination between effects that resulted from the
introduction of the new technology and effects that resulted from other
organisational factors, two control groups were used in this research study.
The "established users" group comprised 10 workers who had been using the
new technology in their jobs for at least six months, and the "non-users"
group comprised 22 workers who had not used the new techno&#65533;logy in their
jobs and would not do so for the duration of the study. A period of 18
months elapsed between the pretest and the posttest. In total, 51
respondents completed both the pretest and posttest questionnaires. These
respondents' results were analysed using Statview 512+ and JMP
(version 2).
The participants of this research study were all employees of the National
Library of Australia (NLA). Although computer technology has been in use
at the NLA since the 1980s, the new technology that has been the focus of
this research study differs from previous technology because it provides
staff of the NLA with instant access to an information system that is both
fully automated and fully integrated. This has been achieved in two ways.
Firstly, the development of a local area network, the installation of a Dynix
Integrated Library Management System, and the provision of Epsom
personal computers equipped with Word for Windows and Excel for
Windows have collectively made it possible for staff of the NLA now to
access all the NLA's existing and new automated systems from a single
personal computer instead of having to use different equipment for different
automated tasks as has previously been the case. Secondly, rather than
having to share equipment with other staff, each staff member has been
supplied with their own PC.
The study found that the introduction of the new technology did not have
any significant effects on job characteristics and the motivating potential of
jobs. However, there was a significant decrease in job satisfaction after the
introduction of the new technology. It was found that workers had very
positive perceptions of the effects of the technology on their jobs, and very
high levels of prior computing knowledge, and therefore it was concluded
that these factors did not have any moderating effects on the relationship
between the introduction of the new technology and job satisfaction. No
relationships were found between the decrease in job satisfaction and
workers' age, gender and job category. Results of further analysis, however,
reveal that there was a relationship between the decrease in job satisfaction
after the introduction of the new technology and two other factors. These
were a reduction in workers' perceptions of the value of the skills required
to complete their work tasks and a decrease in their social satisfaction.
Further research is suggested in order to determine the general
applicability of these results to other organisations and other occupational
groups.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">personal computers</field><field name="subject">Job Diagnostic Survey</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061106.094834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drama, as a technique that can be used in environmental interpretation and education</field><field name="creator">Powell, Ruth M.</field><field name="description">This work endorses the need for environmental interpretation and education because
of the threat to the natural environment as a result of the lack of understanding and
knowledge of environmental issues. The writer's personal perspective on the
environment is described. There is a strong advocacy for the use of the fine arts in
interpretative programmes as a way of reaching audiences, and particularly those
individuals who learn through an abstract/symbolic modality. The use of drama is
explored as one of the fine arts media through which all visitors to natural sites can
gain information , experience personal growth, and develop an understanding of
their relationship to the natural world. A study was conducted in which a
questionnaire, which posed 36 questions related to common practices and
experiences, and the use of drama as a medium in environmental interpretation and
education, was used in interviewing representatives of 18 organisations, 9 in Canada
and 9 in Australia, involved in environmental education. The responses to the
questionnaire are summarised and discussed. Of those interviewed, most of the
Australian and Canadian respondents were aware of the need to use a variety of
techniques when developing programmes, had used drama in their programmes, had
all attended programmes where drama was used as the interpretative medium, and
were positive about their experiences. More than two thirds of the respondents
from Australia and Canada indicated that drama should be given a high priority in
environmental interpretation and education in the future. Information on two
children's eco-drama programmes and two workshops for adults on the use of
drama in environmental interpretation and education is also included.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">drama</field><field name="subject">eco-drama</field><field name="subject">environmental interpretation</field><field name="subject">interpretative programmes</field><field name="subject">fine arts</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061106.132559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Has Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) overcome the problems with the operation of section 260?</field><field name="creator">Prasarasatya, Sanya</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</field><field name="subject">taxation</field><field name="subject">section 260</field><field name="subject">anti-avoidance proisions</field><field name="subject">taxpayers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061106.142510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A role study of teacher librarians in government schools in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Pratt, Christopher</field><field name="description">This field study examines the acceptance of role

during the decade 1962-1972.
The situation became exceptionally complex and grew out of the
reorganisation of the secondary school curriculum recommended by the
so-called Wyndham Committee in 1957. A completely new concept of science
was offered to students of the State when biology was given increased
status beside the physical sciences - physics and chemistry. This
combination of material was examined in a very special way and Science
(in this broad sense) was also tied administratively to mathematics.
In 1966 a complicated syllabus was presented to students and
teachers with negligible advance preparation of teachers, no period of
familiarisation and no in-service support. Almost no explanation of
the rationale behind such a novel and untried scheme was offered.
The response of teachers and students was initially one of
stunned silence. Very quickly this developed into hostility to the
content, to its serious overloading and to the restriction of practical
work. Teachers, parents and some members of the Universities expressed
grave misgivings not only about the suitability of the course as a
preparation for tertiary studies, but also about the completely
unsatisfactory nature of the texts offered, about the examination method
adopted, and about the restrictions on the personal aspirations of
students for some degree of specialisation in their senior studies.
The Universities became very interested in the discussions then
appearing in the newspapers. Academics took sides either attacking or
defending the concepts underlying the course; their points of view
being based largely on the performance of the students at university
level.
The campaign for change began with a band of very vocal teachers
working through the Teachers' Federation. These were supported by
academics in promoting a series of public meetings. Parallel to this a
campaign spearheaded by Professor Alexander of Sydney University was
initiated in the Press. The defence of the new courses was taken up by
Professors Messel and Butler of the same University. To maintain the
impetus for the change in curriculum, the Secondary Schools Science
Association was formed by persons interested and very involved in the
curriculum.
Intricately woven into the pattern of discontent with and
strenuous defence of the Wyndham courses, among teachers there was a
groundswell of positive aspirations towards the understanding of and
clarification of the aims of science teaching in New South Wales.
This resulted in the preparation of a document which contained
guidelines for both teaching and curriculum development: it was
subsequently adopted by the Board of Senior School Studies.
This same Board was, by then, very much aware of the discontent
with the new courses and various modifications of them were considered.
Attempts to accommodate teacher, student and university aspirations
resulted in firstly the appointment of Curriculum Development Officers
to assist the Science Syllabus Committee and, parallel to this, a
willingness to permit trial of science courses which had been developed
for use in the United States of America and in other states of
Australia.
Once the decision was made in December, 1969 to permit the
trialling of other courses, a Committee was set up to evaluate these
courses as well as the existing Wyndham courses. This Committee reported
favourably on the new courses and after some false starts the Board of
Senior School Studies not only extended the trials of the new courses,
but in 1975 the old Wyndham courses were abolished and superseded.
Complications arising from the personalities involved, from people
with vested interests in certain educational theories, from the authors
of the specially published texts, from the Publishing Houses which were
to provide the new texts became very tangled indeed. Similar difficulties
were encountered by the Curriculum Development Officers who later
directed the adoption of the new courses to a conclusion satisfactory to
the Science Syllabus Committee and the Board of Senior School Studies.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science education</field><field name="subject">curriculum development</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061106.151839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The establishment and development of the Canberra Teaching Resources Centre, 1968-1976</field><field name="creator">Price, Barry</field><field name="description">The concept of the Canberra Teaching Resources Centre was
derived partly from the teachers' centre movement which originated
in England and to a lesser extent from the American educational
materials centre concept. This field study uses historical method
to trace the establishment and development of the Centre with an
emphasis on the role of its first Director.
The planning initiative lay with the Commonwealth Department
of Education and Science from 1968 to 1972 although considerable
teacher input was invited and received in 1970. Originally seen
as a regional centre in the N.S.W. education systemf the Centre,
when its Director took up duty in 1972, was influenced by educational
reports of A.C.T. and national significance and in 1974 became part
of the Interim A.C.T. Schools Authority. It operated in a limited
way in 1973 but was ready by 1974 to act not only as a teachers'
centre for the A.C.T. but as an agency of the new education system.
The Centre's activities, involving integration of five main
functions, expanded rapidly in 1974 and 1975. Demand as a meeting
place for teachers soon overtaxed accommodation in the City Education
Centre and additional space was acquired in Griffith Infants' School
late in 1975. Displays of educational material evoked the least
response from teachers. Demands on the multi-media Library's
loan service grew so quickly that related services could not be
developed. The entrepreneurial in-service education activities
expanded quickly in volume and range and played an important part in
establishing a new system. Audio-visual services developed more
slowly and production of curriculum materials was just beginning in
1976.
While teacher demand continued to grow, the Centre's development
was held back from late 1975 by government economic policy and in

reforms took place in the Commonwealth primary
industries portfolio statutory research and marketing
authorities. These reforms implemented dual
accountability arrangements which legislated the
requirement for the authorities to be held accountable
directly to government and Parliament, as well as to
industry and community bodies which held either a
financial stake in the authorities or a stake in the
outcomes of their activities.
This dissertation discusses the nature of the dual
accountability arrangements in the broader context of
administrative and accountability theory, with particular
emphasis on its place in the evolution of public
enterprise and of more open, participatory and socially
responsive public administration. It also considers the
1980s reforms in the historical context of Australian
primary industry institutionalisation and agrarian
socialism.
The dissertation concludes that dual accountability can
strengthen an organisation's accountability while at the
same time reduce the need for close administrative
control. Dual accountability acknowledges that the
fundamental processes of an organisation's
accountability should apply in more than one direction,
and that the decentralisation of these processes actually
fills the voids left by removing control mechanisms. The
dissertation also identifies variations in the application
of dual accountability principles across primary industry
authorities and suggests that there is potential for the
principles to be applied to other areas of government administration.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commonwealth primary industries statutory authorities</field><field name="subject">government administration</field><field name="subject">public administration reforms</field><field name="subject">dual accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061106.152937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Having their say : some young men's beliefs and attitudes about being a man</field><field name="creator">Prosser, Anna Kristina</field><field name="description">Western societies are increasingly becoming aware of the many problems facing boys and men. In
Australia these problems include one of the highest youth suicide rates in the world, a high divorce
rate, with most divorces being instigated by women, the breakdown of the family, and conflicting
messages about what it is to be 'a man'. This study examines and describes how a group of 15-17
year old young men, who attend a private single sex school in Canberra, describe their beliefs and
attitudes about becoming adult men. Participants were asked to respond to questions posed in a
survey designed specifically for this research. These questions looked at relationships, gender roles,
family, fatherhood, work and leisure and whether impending manhood appeared confusing. The
context in which participants are situated is one of cultural and social flux; it was the current
discourse and debate in Australia about how to be a man, men's issues, and the perception of men
in crisis, which gave this study its broad contextual frame.
Contrary to the conventional wisdom about boys/young men who attend elite private schools, the
participants in this study emerged as egalitarian and flexible in their attitudes with regard to
relationships, gender roles, parenting and work. This study therefore in part refutes the stereotypes,
which surround students at private boys' schools, including those that purport that these students
will hold predominantly hegemonic, traditional views about masculinity and their role as men.
This thesis presents the voices of some three hundred young men, adding to an area of research,
which is contested and vigorous in its development. By exploring the beliefs and attitudes of a
group of Australians who are on the brink of manhood tentative insights have been offered, and,
believe, some illumination gained. The dilemmas posed for meaningful adulthood for young men in
Australia are very real. We need to listen to what young men have to say.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth suicide rates</field><field name="subject">boys</field><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">men's issues</field><field name="subject">private boys' schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061106.161423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indonesia : development and the 'open skies policy'</field><field name="creator">Pulun, Putri Prima</field><field name="description">Indonesia is home to 183 million people scattered through about 13 thousand
islands. There are at least 583 dialects and also various religions and ethic
groups exist in the country. Thus, the issue of unification is significant in
Indonesia. To date, the state's ideology, Pancasila, has been considered as an
effective device to bring the nation together. Pancasila is also used as a platform
for Indonesia's developmental policy making. Media in Indonesia have long been
seen as a means to support the development process.
Indonesia has just completed its first Long Term Development Plan (1969 to
1994). The first Long Term Development Plan emphasized Indonesia's
economy. Under the New Order administration, Indonesia has achieved both
political stability and a continuing economic growth. Lately, there are some
significant changes in the field of broadcasting infrastructure.
On July 24th, 1990, the government issued the Decree of the Minister of
Information (no. 111/Kep/Menpen/1990) which is unofficially known as the 'Open
Skies Policy'. This policy allows the private sector to run private television
stations and also gives permission to the public to own satellite dishes.
The 'Open Skies Policy' can be seen as a breakthrough in Indonesian media
infrastructure because from 1962 to 1989, Indonesia had only one, state owned,
television station-TVRI. Now, there are five private stations and numerous
foreign television stations beamed through at least 400 thousand satellite dishes
in the country. The number of telephones, however, has not yet exceeded 1.7
million.
This thesis recognizes that the 'Open Skies Policy' deserves thorough analysis
because it reflects a series of significant changes in the Indonesian governments
development strategies. This thesis sets itself the following objectives: to
overview major development communication paradigms and to consider which
development paradigm works most effectively in the Indonesian context; to
explain how 'development' has been conceptualized in Indonesia and how this
has manifested in media policy; to analyse the implications of the 'Open Skies
Policy' and to consider whether it represents a new direction in Indonesia's
developmental policy making.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">unification</field><field name="subject">Pancasila</field><field name="subject">open skies policy</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">developmental policy making</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061106.162752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public relations practice in Indonesia : a case study of a commercial television station and a state university</field><field name="creator">Putra, I. Gusti Ngurah</field><field name="description">This study examines public relations practice in a developing country by
looking at two Indonesian organisations - a commercial television
station (RCTI) and a state university (UGM) - using a case study approach
complemented with a qualitative analysis of the history of public
relations practice at a societal level.
Two theories about advanced public relations practice have been
borrowed for the framework of the study. They are Grunig's model of
public relations and Broom's public relations role theory. However,
given the less developed practice of public relations in Indonesia, the
present study did not intend to test these theories in a rigorous manner.
Rather, the theories have been mainly used as guidance in analysing
public relations practice in Indonesia.
Modern public relations has been practiced in Indonesia as early as the
1940s. Public relations was used as part of Indonesia's struggle for
independence, while the arrival of multinational corporations, and
recent changes in national economic policy, has since extended public
relations practice into the wider corporate world.
While it is clear that both RCTI and UGM considered public relations
important, they treated public relations in different ways. RCTI, as a
private sector company, located its public relations department in the
higher level of its organisational structure with the purpose of
promoting the interests of the organisation and defending itself in the
marketplace of ideas. UGM, as a public sector agency, located its public
relations department in the lowest level of the organisational structure.
Overall, public relations as an organisational activity was more
important in RCTI. However, both organisations practiced the first two
models of public relations, namely, the press agentry and the public
information model, and public relations practitioners in both RCTI and
UGM predominantly played the role of technicians.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">public relations</field><field name="subject">commercial television</field><field name="subject">state universities</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061106.163409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some Australian English-Vietnamese cross-cultural differences in conveying good and bad news</field><field name="creator">Quang, Nguyen Van</field><field name="description">This Study examines some cross-cultural differences in conveying good

aspects are taken into consideration: address forms, modality, and
directness-indirectness. Theoretical issues are raised and discussed, and
questionnaire data collected and analysed.
Chapter I shows why it is important and necessary to study crosscultural
differences and sets up the aims of the study.
Chapter II deals with address forms in general and the use of address
forms in conveying good and bad news in the Australian and
Vietnamese cultural contexts in particular..The similarities and
differences between the two systems are also discussed.
Chapter III dwells on modality and its devices: modals, modality
markers, subjunctive mood (in English) and lexico-modal operators for
subjunctive mood (in Vietnamese). The use of these devices in
communicating good and bad news in the two cultures is discussed in
detail.
Chapter IV is concerned theoretically with directness-indirectness, and
the relationship between indirectness and politeness. How directness and
in-directness are actually used to convey good and bad news in
Australian and Vietnamese cultures is also analysed.

methods of teaching second language learners to communicate
effectively in the foreign language, concentrating on methods of
developing skills in oral communication.
Although there are many factors in Australia which
would favour the introduction of Communicative Language
Teaching for Indonesian - such as well-equipped classrooms and
small class sizes - the Communicative Approach to teaching does
not appear to have been fully developed. This is partly because
of the lack of communicatively-based textbooks and teaching
materials.
The aim of this study is to suggest some ways in which
Australian teachers could adapt the currently available materials
and textbooks for use in communicative teaching of Indonesian,
and also to propose methods of assessing students'
communicative abilities.
Chapter One describes the background to the study, and
defines its aims, its scope and the research method used.
Chapter Two looks at the teaching of Indonesian in the
A.C.T., concentrating on the equipment and textbooks which are
available. Some of the problems of teaching and assessment are
also outlined.
The discussion of Communicative Language Teaching in
Chapter Three covers the development of language teaching
methodology in general terms.
A description and analysis of my research conducted on

The last two chapters contain a presentation of possible
teaching materials and methods of introducing communicative
activities (Chapter Five), and possible ways of assessing
communicative activities (Chapter Six). Some of the problems of
the Communicative Approach are also discussed.
This Study Report is intended only to suggest some ways
of introducing communicative activities into A.C.T. classrooms in

group that received no instruction at all. The results indicated that the
hands-on instruction program evaluated did not prove to be superior to a
demonstration in providing students with necessary skills to search CDROM
databases. A sample of 98 novice users enrolled in Research Skills
were randomly allocated to three groups. The first group received hands
on instruction on CD-ROM searching. The second group watched a
demonstration using a liquid crystal display. The third group acted as a
control group and received no instruction. Each group conducted a search
on three pre-determined questions.
The experiment was conducted in three stages. The first stage was a pretest
in which students searched the three search questions. The second
stage was instruction. Two groups of students were instructed, either
hands on or demonstration. The final stage was a post-test which involved
searching the three questions used in the pre-test.
The following databases were used in the study: ERIC, MEDLINE and
Sports Discus. The results were measured in terms of a number of search
terms used, number of retrieved records, number of Boolean operators
used, and a appropriate choice of a database. The statistical significance
level among the groups was tested by the means of the technique of oneway
analysis of variance to test The F test was used to compare differences
between the different groups.
The results of this experiment indicated that groups of students instructed
on either method of instruction, hands-on and demonstration, performed
significantly better than the control group. However, there was no
significant difference between the two methods of instruction. This
research confirms the need for CD-ROM instruction for novice users if
CD-ROM databases are to be used effectively by students. Furthermore,
this result shows that demonstrations can be used as alternative methods
of instruction.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">University of Canberra library</field><field name="subject">CDROM hands on instruction program</field><field name="subject">database searching</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.092039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of Board-registered school subjects : a survey of selected schools in south east Queensland</field><field name="creator">Randall, Dell</field><field name="description">An exploratory study of Board-Registered School Subjects was
undertaken in 1989 to investigate the impact of this category
of subjects on the curriculum for Year 11 and 12 students in
Queensland secondary schools. The study was undertaken at two
levels -the Systems and the Schools levels. At the Systems
level, analysis of Reports and other documents was supplemented
by interviews with key personnel in the education authorities.
The segment at the Schools level consisted of interviews with
administrators or teachers in ten schools in South East
Queensland and a small student survey.
Board-Registered School Subjects, first developed in that State
in 1982, broadened the Senior curriculum from its traditionally
academic base. The development of this category of subjects
also heralded the beginnings of school based curriculum
development in many secondary schools in that State. However,
in the latter years of the 1980's, policies and syllabuses
developed by the Queensland Department of Education indicate
that a shift to systems based curriculum development is
probable in the 1990's.
Four sub-categories of Board-Registered School Subjects were
identified in the sample schools. These were alternatives to
core subjects, such as English and Mathematics, vocationally
oriented subjects, those related to life/leisure skills and
subjects which reflected the nature of the geographical area.
The response by many schools to the development of these
subjects was enthusiastic; most schools in the sample offered
six to eight Board-Registered School Subjects to students in
Years 11 and 12. Although many of these subjects were
developed initially for students of "lower ability", a reported
recent trend was for "academic" students to select one
Board-Registered School Subject.
The enthusiastic response by schools was curbed to some extent
by the reaction of some teachers, students and parents to these
subjects. Several Board-Registered School Subjects offered in
1989 were not implemented because insufficient numbers of
students selected them. The major factor which mitigated
against successful implementation of Board-Registered School
Subjects was that students' results in these subjects could not
be used in the calculation of the Tertiary Entrance Score, the
basis for selection to tertiary institutions. For many
students and parents, the Tertiary Entrance Score appeared to
be the major goal of Senior secondary education.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Board-Registered School Subjects</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.092656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Religious and social attitude scales : the description of a field study experience in which an attempt was made to develop and use four instruments to measure the religious and social attiutes of secondary school students in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Randell, S.

J.</field><field name="description">In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in Australia in
structures which allow community participation in the governance of
schools. The introduction of a new Education Authority in the Australian
Capital Territory, beginning in 1974, brought with it a substantial
commitment to such structures as school boards, a relatively new phenomenon
in Australian school systems.
However, there has been substantial experience of lay or community
participation in governing bodies of post-secondary institutions in
Australia. This study examines both the general experience of lay
participation in such governing bodies and the specific experience of
lay members of the governing bodies of three institutions in the Australian
Capital Territory, the Australian National University, the Canberra College
of Advanced Education and the Canberra College of Technical and Further
Education.
The principal collection of data was from structured interviews
with lay or community members of the councils of these three institutions,
designed to produce a picture of their attitudes towards participation
in governance. It was found that lay members are most commonly "middleaged,
middle-class, males", although women are more frequently found in
college councils. Lay members believe that they are chosen because of
their successful backgrounds, their administrative skills, and their
ability to reflect general community values. They do not believe they
are constrained in their participation by specific community interests.
They act as independent critical, individuals.
Some areas of difficulty were identified, particularly the
problem of finding sufficient time to learn thoroughly the nature of
complex institutions, and to participate on an equal footing with staff
members of councils.
It is asserted that the assumptions underlying lay participation
remain broadly unquestioned, even at a time of significant change in
the wide process of planning and control of post-secondary education.
The relevance of this to the innovations in the A.C.T. school system is
suggested.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">post-secondary schools</field><field name="subject">school governance</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.093856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is the social integration of people with intellectual disability living in group homes comparable to the community participation of non-disabled people living in the same community?</field><field name="creator">Rawlings, Meredith</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the results of a comparison of the experiences of community
participation between two groups of people - people with intellectual disability
and non-disabled people.
An interview schedule was developed, based on the social integration
literature, government policy and a small empirical study. The common factors
from these three bases were represented in the interview schedule which
covered the areas of degree of social contact with family, friends and
neighbours; involvement in the local community; and degree of satisfaction
with the local community.
Thirty people with intellectual disability and sixty non-disabled people were
interviewed using the schedule. The non-disabled people lived in the same
street (if possible) or within very close vicinity of the people with intellectual
disability.
The findings of community participation for people with intellectual disability
reflected other research, indicating that this group had limited social contact,
and reported few friendships in the community, but participated to a large
extent in community activities and made use of community facilities. This
group were also inclined to report satisfaction with living in, and feeling like
part of the community.
For non disabled people, the findings reflect a group that does not particularly
feel like part of the community and makes limited use of community facilities.
However, this group reported regular contact with family, friends and
neighbours.
The above findings are discussed with relevance to policy, theory, research and
practice.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group homes</field><field name="subject">intellectual disability</field><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">social integration</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.094540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of an educational program to teach a group of A.C.T. nurses comprehensive physical assessment skills</field><field name="creator">Reaby, Linda Lewis</field><field name="description">A sample of 22 registered nurses participated in an
educational program to learn comprehensive physical
assessment skills. This study investigated the effects
of that program on their nursing practice. Administration
of tests and questionnaires provided a measure
of the: (a) use of physical assessment skills; (b)
knowledge of physical assessment; (c) changes in
nursing practice since learning the skills; (d)
barriers to the use of the skills.
The model used for the program's curriculum development
was adult learning theory. The curriculum focused on
this theory's key aspects. Namely, adult students
build new skills on their past knowledge and already
developed skills. Additionally, they must see the
relevance of learning the skills and be able to apply
them in their current life situation. The findings
suggest this model was appropriate.
The nurses in the study used the majority of learned
skills after they completed the program. Their
knowledge concerning these skills also showed
dramatic improvement.
The major findings regarding the increase in knowledge
and use of physical assessment skills, positive changes
in nursing practice and lack of barriers to the use of
skills indicate that an educational program in physical
assessment can be very beneficial to nurses. The
results support those of previous studies in that
nurses will use the physical assessment skills they
have learned in continuing education programs.
The implications for nursing practice and education
were discussed. Suggestions were then made for future
research in this area.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">registered nurses</field><field name="subject">physical assessment skills</field><field name="subject">nursing education</field><field name="subject">nursing practice</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.095130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A survey of regular teachers' concerns towards the integration of disabled children in state primary schools, Bendigo region, Victoria</field><field name="creator">Reed, Brian</field><field name="description">The integration of disabled children into regular schools is
a current educational and social issue causing widespread
interest, concern and debate throughout Australia. The most
controversial and innovative adoption of integration policy
has occurred in Victoria since the release of the Collins
Report in 1984.
The present study was conducted in 26 State primary schools
in the Bendigo area of the Loddon Campaspe Mallee region of
Victoria where disabled children had been integrated in
regular classrooms with the assistance of a paid teacher
aide during 1988.
The purpose of the study was to survey the concerns of those
teachers into whose classes children with disabilities had
been integrated.
The Stages of Concern (SoC) dimension of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (C-BAM) was chosen as the research
methodology. C-BAM was developed at the Research and
Development Center for Teacher Education, University of
Texas at Austin, and for the purpose of this study, the
methodology consisted of a questionnaire of 35 standardized
items (the Stages of Concern Questionnaire), and a School
Survey.
The study set out to identify the concerns of teachers
(ii)
toward integration, and to establish reasons why teachers
are at particular stages of concern. Factors included
teachers' age, gender, number of years of teaching
experience, qualifications and in-service training. Other
issues related to the disabled children themselves, the
school, and factors such as availability of resources,
funding levels, and access to support systems.
This study developed from the policy document Integration in
Victorian Education (the Collins Report, 1984). Since then,
the Ministry of Education has published two additional
booklets (in January and February, 1987), which partly
address some of the issues included in this thesis. These
include resourcing, in-servicing and the legal implications
of the innovation.
The analysis of the data points to major shortcomings which
will jeopardize the implementation process and the likely
success of the innovation. A number of recommendations have
been suggested, with particular reference to the pre-service
and in-service training of teachers, and issues relating to
funding and resources.
The findings have implications for all classroom teachers,
as potentially all are required to accept disabled children
into their classes. The results and recommendations also
have relevance for the Ministry of Education, whose
responsibility it is to ensure that the integration of
disabled children into regular classes is fully supported at
a government level, and for training institutions, whose
task it is to provide appropriate pre-service and in-service
programs for present and future classroom teachers.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disabled children</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">Bendigo</field><field name="subject">Loddon Campaspe Mallee region</field><field name="subject">Collins Report</field><field name="subject">Concerns-Based Adoption Model</field><field name="subject">C-BAM</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.100059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian culture in children's literature : reflections and transmissions</field><field name="creator">Reeder, Stephanie Owen</field><field name="description">In this study of the relationship between children's
literature and Australian culture I make a close textual
analysis of the works of Ivan Southall, Eleanor Spence,
Colin Thiele and Patricia Wrightson. This analysis is
based on a framework of areas of culture as defined in
anthropological terms, and includes such categories as the
Environment, Social Organization, the Life Cycle, the
Family and World View. Each author's work is analysed
according to this framework. In a final section on each
author I draw together the themes and developments in each
author's writing and discuss the cultural insights they
provide. In these textual analyses the emphasis is on
identifying the culture which these authors reflect in the
twenty to twenty-five year period in which they have been
writing. I am also interested in identifying those
cultural values which the authors promote or attempt to
transmit to their readers. In the final chapter I
undertake a comparative analysis. First I identify the
areas of overlap or of greatest concern on which the four
authors focus. These I identify as the Environment, the
Family, Adolescence, Consumerism, the 'Other' Australians
and Religion. I then compare these areas of focus and the
attitudes and cultural values which the four authors
reflect and transmit in these areas, with generalizations
revealed in other interpretative analyses of Australian
culture, including those of Craig McGregor and
Ronald Conway. The result of this comparative analysis is
striking in terms of the significant aspects of Australian
culture which all the authors reflect. At the same time
they bring their own personal perspectives to bear on the

children who had experienced separation within the last six months. The
sample was homogenous in so far as each family had been separated for
under six months and the children were of a similar age range and each
family was mother headed. The aims of the study were to explore the
experience of separation for the adults and children by means of interviews
both before and after attending the "After Separation Program" and to find
out whether the experience of attending the Program had an effect upon
intra- familial relationships. While the study could not be said to be large
enough to be representative of all populations of single, newly separated
families in general, some common themes emerged which correspond with
other studies referred to in the literature. These include the sense of loss
children feel with the absence of a parent, the breakdown in generational
boundaries which often accompanies separation and a sense of loneliness
and isolation. From the study identifiable themes emerged and it became
clear that the group experience had made an impact. It would appear that
following attendance of the program appropriate parenting is restored with
mothers' more able to respond to the needs of the children. It was noticeable

determination in Australia was generally expected to widen the gender wage gap (see
Chapter 3). However, as discussed in Chapter 4, the research that underlies this
expectation is typically based upon aggregated data and suffers from a number of
deficiencies. In contrast, this dissertation utilises unit record data from the extensive
1995 Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (AWIRS95) commissioned by
the former Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business to test the
hypothesis that enterprise bargaining has affected the gender wage gap in Australia.
Whilst the passing of four years between 1991 and the time of data collection may not
have allowed for the landmark industrial relations change to have worked itself through
the labour market, a noteworthy and major feature of AWIRS95 is that it identifies
workers and workplaces operating under enterprise bargaining agreements, as well as
containing a female/male split of the enterprise bargaining status (see Chapter 5).
Along with hourly earnings data derived from AWIRS95, a clear assessment can be
made of gender wage gaps for employees under enterprise bargaining and those not
employed under enterprise bargaining. The thesis uses OLS earnings regressions to
identify the part of any gender wag gap that can be justified by the difference in
measured characteristics between males and females, as well as identifying the part that
remains unexplained (see Chapter 7). Given the potential that workplace characteristics
can affect the integrity of OLS results, a random effects model is also used (see Chapter
8). Interestingly, the OLS and random effects results are virtually identical (see
Chapter 9).
It needs to be noted that the component of the gender wage gap that is unable to be
justified by direct statistical reference to the regression model has been attributed to
discrimination in the labour market. However, this is something of a misnomer as the
unjustified component also captures the impact of:
&#65533; model misspecification, including excluded variables;
&#65533; mismeasurement; and
&#65533; errors of calculation.
111
Every effort has been made to reduce these effects. Nevertheless, there may be an
element of discrimination in the regression model utilised in this thesis that is not
discernible through the observable and measurable variables (see Chapter 3).
Results of analysis undertaken in this thesis indicate that the gender gap, as well as the
unexplained component thereof, are larger for employee data associated with enterprise
bargaining than is the case for workers not so employed. Even so, the result is not
deemed to be statistically significant, as is further supported by extensive sensitivity
testing (see Chapters 7 and 8).
Further research is needed to support the posed hypothesis. Nevertheless, the thesis still
provides a wide range of interesting outcomes in providing a greater understanding of
an observable gender wage gap in Australia, as well as the associated and contributing
characteristics of employees and employers. It is in this capacity that the research work
recorded in this thesis provides a new level of knowledge and understanding,
particularly given the thorough use made of recent microdata and the observed earnings
effects of selected variables. As a consequence, the results of this thesis will form a
solid foundation upon which further gender wage gap debate, policy formulation and
labour economics research can stand.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">enterprise bargaining</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">wage gap</field><field name="subject">labour market</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.102527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of overlap in the Australian Federal system of            review of administrative decisions : and some suggestions

for a one semester elective course of study Australian Minorities:
Concepts and Perspectives to be offered at a tertiary institution.
It is intended primarily to provide a context in which minority group
persons can be introduced to and analyse the theories and concepts
which have been used to describe them as minority group persons, and
to give minority group persons the opportunity to formulate and
develop their own theories and concepts derived from their own
experience.
Since the program in which the course is offered is already
operating and this course is a required part of it, the case for the
provision of specific courses for minority group students is not
argued here. The purpose in providing a detailed course description
through this field study is (a) to contribute to the, as yet, small
number of tertiary level courses from which both minority group and
mainstream students select their programs, and (b) to provide
suggestions for teachers of such courses to enable them to present
courses which have specific interest for minority group students.
The principles on which the course is constructed constitute a
blending of humanistic and social reconstructionist perspectives with
the purpose of (a) making the course acceptable to the espoused
values of institutions offering teacher education programs, and (b)
providing students with some knowledge and skills whereby they are
empowered to make changes in the societies in which they will work.
The course was compiled from
(a) Suggestions solicited on an informal basis from students
involved in an initial teaching of a similar course.
(b) The writer's perceptions of needs arising from experience
of teaching in a tertiary program catering specifically for
Aboriginal and Islander persons.
(c) Library research of, especially, material written by minority
group persons, but also material written about minority group
persons.
Suggestions for evaluating the effectiveness of the course are
provided because it is intended that this course be used as a base
or beginning structure to generate new courses, or for modifications
of this one according to specific needs of teachers and student
groups. It is presented in a form intended to be useful as a
starting point for other minority group teachers involved in
offering courses to cater for similar needs. Source material is
drawn mainly from sociological and philosophical perspectives,
combining western concepts from these disciplines with contemporary
minority group definitions of experience.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian minorities</field><field name="subject">courses</field><field name="subject">course development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.120800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbonyl sulphide as a fumigant for grain and timber : efficacy towards organisms and formation of residues</field><field name="creator">Ren, YongLin</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigation of carbonyl sulphide as a new fumigant
and related methodology studies. The first part involved the investigation of a new
fumigant - carbonyl sulphide, which has the potential to replace methyl bromide.
Its biological response or activity was investigated, e.g. toxicity to target organisms
and phytotoxicity, environmental and worker safety considerations. In the second
investigation, analytical methods were developed for the determination of fumigant
movement through timber and fumigant residues in grains as well as a method of
chemical fractionation to determine the fate of carbonyl sulphide. A comprehensive
literature review of 161 references in these two areas is reported.
Carbonyl sulphide was highly toxic to adults of three coleopteran species
tested, namely Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), Tribolium confusum du Val, and
Sitophilus oryzae (L.), the most sensitive species was R. dominica. For 6 hr
exposure at 25&#65533;C, the L(CxT)95 value for R. dominica, S. oryzae and T. confusum
were, respectively, 36.48, 99.82 and 113.0mg h L-1. Carbonyl sulphide inhibited
100% of mould in wet wheat and more than 90% of mould on dry wheat at lOOmg
L-1. Both carbonyl sulphide and hydrogen cyanide were low in phytotoxicity
without affecting germination of wheat, at levels needed to control insects. Unlike
hydrogen cyanide, carbonyl sulphide can be used at minimum levels without
decreasing plumule length of wheat.
Chemical data on the sorption of carbonyl sulphide are compared with data
from methyl bromide. The levels of carbonyl sulphide in the headspace of five
commodities (wheat, barley, paddy, sorghum and peanut) and timbers (hardwood
and softwood) decay more slowly than do levels of methyl bromide. Carbonyl
sulphide was blown through a column of wheat as easily as was phosphine and
more easily than was methyl bromide, and its front was blown out faster than
phosphine and methyl bromide. Movement of two fumigants (methyl bromide and
carbonyl sulphide) through, and sorption on, softwood and hardwood were studied.
Each fumigant was sorbed less on softwood than on hardwood and penetrated
softwood better than hardwood. Carbonyl sulphide penetrated timber better than
did methyl bromide, and was less sorbed on timber. A rapid method of solvent
extraction was developed to enable rapid estimation of the amount on intact
fumigant sorbed in wood. This procedure enabled near quantitative recovery of
methyl bromide as either intact fumigant or as bromide ion.
Carbonyl sulphide residue in unfumigated wheat was found to be around 25-
SOppb. Carbonyl sulphide left little residue on fumigated grains. Desorption of
carbonyl sulphide from the wheat was extremely fast, 85% of it was released after
one day aeration which was very much greater than that of methyl bromide and
carbon disulphide. After 6 days aeration the incorporation of 14COS on mungbean,
wheat, paddy, rice and safflower was lower than 7Oppb (calculated as COS
equivalent). Food value or nutritional quality of foodstuffs is not harmed by
carbonyl sulphide fumigation. This result was assessed by identifying any nonreversible
change or combined residues in biochemical fractions of commodities
including lipids, protein, amino acids, carbohydrate, etc., and no irreversible
reaction between carbonyl sulphide and any constituent such as B vitamin, atocopherol,
lysine, maltose and starch. Fumigants did not affect lipids, although
each fumigant was applied to wheat at exaggerated concentrations, nor wheat germ
oil and canola oil treated with extremely high concentration of fumigants.
Factors which affect analysis of fumigants including stability of chemicals
in extraction solvent and partitioning of fumigant between solvent and air, were
examined. The partition ratio, defined as the fumigant concentration in extraction
solvent to that in the headspace, varied with fumigant. Methods for multi-fumigant
analysis were developed or modified and gave high recoveries and efficiency. The
procedure of Daft of solvent extraction followed by partitioning was modified by
being performed in sealed flasks. This raised the recovery of carbonyl sulphide,
methyl bromide, phosphine and carbon disulphide. Recoveries were near
quantitative at levels down to 6-16ppb (w/w) for tested fumigants. Thus the
modified Daft method can be adapted to enable determination of the main fumigants
used on staple foodstuffs. Microwave irradiation method give higher efficiency of
removal of fumigants from grains. Limits of quantification were &lt; 0.2ng g-1 (ppb
w/w) for each tested fumigant. The detection limit of COS was calculated, as
natural levels of the fumigant were detected in commodities. These are feasible,
simple and rapid (&lt; 2 min.) to be use to analyse fumigant residue in grains.
Carbonyl sulphide has potential as a fumigant for grain and timber and may
replace methyl bromide in some uses, subject to further investigation in commercial
situations.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbonyl sulphide</field><field name="subject">new fumigant</field><field name="subject">methyl bromide</field><field name="subject">grain</field><field name="subject">timber</field><field name="subject">fumigants</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.120137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing retention rates in secondary schools within the Wollongong region</field><field name="creator">Repetylo, Anna H.</field><field name="description">Throughout the 1980s, there was a trend in Australia towards increased
participation rates in post-compulsory education. This study examines factors that
influence Year 12 retention rates in four Government secondary schools within the
Wollongong Sub-Region. Factors that were thought to influence students to continue
to Year 12 and sit for the New South Wales Higher School Certificate Examination
included those related to Gender, Socio-economic (relating to occupation of parents,
government financial assistance, and language background), Educational and Career.
The study involved surveying over 400 Year 10 students in four schools by
questionnaires. These schools were chosen for their geographical location and to
include two schools with a history of high retention rates and two schools with low
retention rates.
The questions in the survey were incorporated with a larger survey conducted
in 1989 by the Faculty of Education at the University of Wollongong under the coordination
of Dr. Noeline Kyle ("Everyone expects you to know; A report on careers
advice and industry attitudes towards female students in non-traditional study and
work in the Illawarra", 1990). The questionnaire was piloted in 1988 and after
seeking recommendations from students, teachers and the NSW Department of School
Education Research Group, the survey was administered in 1989.
The study used descriptive research methodology, and Chi-square analysis
was used to establish significance levels in the data.
With regard to gender, the data clearly demonstrated that female students were
more inclined than male students to stay on to Year 12, and have positive reasons for
their decision.
Concerning Socio-Economic factors, the results of this study showed that
students whose parents have a professional background are more likely to stay on to
Year 12. In addition, the achievement of the Higher School Certificate as a preIV
requisite for further study was a strong motivating factor for students staying on to
Year 12. However, students in receipt of Austudy did not appear to relate in a
statistically significant manner with any of the factors that influence the student to stay
on to Year 12. As well, no statistical inference could be drawn from intention to sit for
the HSC and the language most used at home by parents.
With regard to educational factors, the responses from each of the four schools
surveyed showed a high percentage (82 to 85%) of students intending to stay on to
Year 12 and sit for the HSC examination. None of these schools had an appreciably
higher proportion of students intending to sit the HSC exam. However, it was found
that students from one particular school were more likely to undertake further study
and students from this school had a high percentage of both parents with a
professional occupation than any other school.
The findings relating to career factors showed that students who have a
professional career in mind are more likely to proceed to Year 12. It was also found
that students who had school work experience in a professional occupation were more
likely to proceed to Year 12.
The study relates the survey findings to the research literature in Australia, and
also includes a discussion of the limitations of the survey.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retention rates</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Wollongong</field><field name="subject">HSC</field><field name="subject">New South Wales Higher School Certificate</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.122538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The loss of grain freshness : indicators or storage induced quality loss in dry barley and canola grain</field><field name="creator">Reuss, Rainer</field><field name="description">The work presented here explores the effect of storage on chemical and other
characteristics of dry, free of added chemicals and pest-free barley and canola grain. This
was achieved by measuring the changes in a number of variables of grain stored at
different temperatures under laboratory conditions and in commercial storage. The
following measurements were carried out: Viability, moisture contents (mc), oil contents
(oc), whole grain colour, spectrophotometry of grain extracts, hydroxy methyl furaldehyde
(HMF), changes in storage atmospheres, organic sulphide levels, tocol concentrations
(vitamin E), Iodine Value (IV), Thiocyanogen Value (TV), Peroxide Value (PV),
p-Anisidine Value (p-AV) and Acid Value (AV).
The mc of canola and barley were within the range considered safe for storage. Oil content
of canola did not change significantly with storage. Viability of canola stored at 4 and
25 &#176;C did not change noticeably, but higher storage temperatures resulted in seed death.
Barley maintained high viabilities at low temperatures, but was more susceptible to high
temperatures than canola. Colour changes of whole barley grain in storage were
pronounced and temperature dependent. Colorimetry of whole barley grain showed
potential as a tool for monitoring quality changes in storage. Absorption spectra of grain
extracts reflected chemical and physiological changes in storage. HMF, an indicator of
Maillard browning, accumulated in short to medium term storage at 45&#176;C and in long term
storage at 25 and 35&#176;C. Measurement of HMF was considered useful for monitoring
quality changes of stored cereal grain.
In a study of storage atmospheres, changes in the concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon
monoxide, oxygen, carbon disulphide and carbonyl sulphide were shown to be useful
indicators of quality loss of grain in storage. Gas concentrations usually depended on
storage temperature and time and reflected the storage history of the commodity. They
indicated loss of carbohydrates and lipids by respiration, oxidative damage and
deterioration of sulphur containing amino acids and other compounds.
Oil quality indicators were consistent with oxidative damage to canola lipids in storage.
IV, TV, and p-AV of canola oil did not correlate with quality of commercial samples.
However, a relationship between increases in PV and high storage temperatures in canola
was shown and AV increased in storage dependent on storage temperature and time. In
barley and canola, the concentration of anti-oxidant tocol species (vitamin E) decreased at
35 and 45&#176;C storage dependent on storage time. The overall tocol content as well as
vitamin E activity decreased with storage decreasing the nutritional value of the
commodities and indicating oxidative damage to lipids.
It was concluded that the storage of dry, pest-free whole barley and canola grain at
moderate temperatures (25-45&#176;C) resulted in chemical and other changes. The
consequence of these changes was a measurable reduction in the freshness of grain
relevant to the nutritional, food technological and commercial quality of grain.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grain storage</field><field name="subject">grain freshness</field><field name="subject">grain quality</field><field name="subject">dry barley</field><field name="subject">canola</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.123442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV/AIDS and public policy : an Australian perspective</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, Catherine Janet</field><field name="description">This study analyses the influence the HIV/AIDS epidemic has had on the
development of public policy in Australia, and evaluates the effect this policy is
having on preventing the spread of this disease. According to Waites (1993 p.7)
Australia's integrated reaction to the issue of HIV/AIDS has been amongst the
finest in the world. This has been due to the cooperation of government health
authorities and the first affected groups, especially the gay male population in
urban areas. The purpose of this study is to investigate how, and if, this
integrated response to policy development occurred, and then discover whether or
not the outcome has resulted in the implementation of effective public policy.
The method chosen to conduct this study was to apply a variety of models to the
research. The epidemic, Posner, political, and the implementation and evaluation
models have been developed and applied in order to gain more understanding of
a particular public policy process. These models are used as A framework to
analyse some of the complexities involved; the intention is to separate out some of
the complex interactions. The paradigms chosen to direct this study in policy
analysis do not encompass all the aspects, nor provide all the answers, because
there are multiple complex political, sociological and economic issues within the
HIV/AIDS policy process.
The influence of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the development of public policy in
Australia has been remarkable. This has been due to the active responses from
government health authorities, the gay lobby, the media, community groups,
committees, and specific individuals. These include Neal Blewett a former Federal
Minister for Health, a previous Queensland Minister for Health. and Professor
Penington. At times there have been divergent opinions, but the integrated
Australian approach involved in developing the HIV/AIDS National strategy has
ensured that this public policy has received extensive community support Australia
wide (National Evaluation Steering Committee 1993 p.83).
The effect of the National Strategy and associated public policy is difficult to
evaluate. The cost of the human and financial resources involved is also hard to
justify, due to the unknown factors still involved. Evidence suggests that the
HIV/AIDS epidemic has stabilised. Yet no one really knows how many individuals
are currently infected with HIV. The future progress of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is
somewhat of an enigma, and there is no known cure.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">epidemic</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.124018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The career aspirations of women and men primary school teachers in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Richards, Rosemary</field><field name="description">This study set out to document and compare differences in career
paths and career aspirations between women and men primary school
teachers in the ACT. The study wished to confirm in the ACT, the kinds
of differences between career patterns well documented elsewhere and to
go beyond this to an exploration of why these differences persist and
the implications of them.
A questionnaire with factual items on teachers' career backgrounds
and open-ended questions on teachers' attitudes was sent to a random
sample of teachers in ACT government primary schools within the four
cells made by the two dichotomous criteria of women and men, promoted
and non-promoted. Data was tallied, categorized, and despite the small
sample, statistically significant differences were found:
Women take more and different kinds of leave; women teach the
younger children but have greater teaching experience across the grades;
in terms of intending to stay in their career, women have a greater
commitment to teaching than men.
Women are more negative towards promotion and express career
ambition in professionally oriented terms, i.e. in terms of children and
teaching. Men, particularly those promoted, express career ambitions in
extrinsic, promotional terms. Women have high career satisfaction;
promoted men are the most dissatisfied. In contrast with promoted men,
non-promoted men come from metropolitan areas and have less extrinsic
and more child-centred career aspirations.
Teachers' attitudes to grades were studied: grades 5/6 were the
most sought after for promotional purposes, had the highest status yet
were considered to be relatively easy to teach. The early years had
least value in promotional terms, lower status and were the most
difficult to teach.
The system needs to re-appraise definitions and assumptions about
teachers' careers in general and women's role as a commited group of
professional teachers. Teachers disinterested in conventional career
ambitions, most of whom are women, are undervalued while decision-making
is in the hands of non-practicioners in male-dominated heirarchical
structures.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary school teachers</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">career aspirations</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.124512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of videotape support in enhancing print based learning material</field><field name="creator">Richardson, Lesley</field><field name="description">In higher education greater emphasis is being placed on independent study

classroom practice to occur, multiple actions are required at different
levels of participation, from federal and state education jurisdictions
through to school communities and individual classroom teachers. The
thesis supposition is that practical action factors in schools and the
community can be found which meet the needs of the change.
The history of attempts to achieve educational change through changed
classroom practice is littered with a range of different approaches, usually
one-off events. They have sometimes succeeded. Stakeholders, including
parents, social pressure groups and particularly governments have
increasing expectations of what it is that teachers can achieve in terms of
their students' learning outcomes. The degree to which actual teaching
practices are changed at the classroom level will depend on the degree to
which teachers are able to manage and implement change. However,
studies in the area of curriculum change reveal that the gap between
policy and practice remains an ongoing concern.
This thesis draws upon theory and applied research findings from the
traditions of educational change, health education, models of change,
evaluation and social science research methods. The purpose of this
thesis is to identify and make comparisons in the practical action factors
which enhance the capacity of teachers to change their classroom practice.
These are investigated through a multiple case study consideration of the
school context, the professional development inputs, and the classroom
programs. The patterns of effective practical action in the research study
would support the thesis supposition.
A multiple case study-theory building approach was used to analyse the
data from twelve school sites selected from the School Development in
Health Education (SDHE) Project. Data analysis employed the technique
of matrix displays, with several rounds of analysis in order to generate
some significant factors related to teacher change. The results were
considered for endorsement by an expert panel from the field in order to
enhance confidence in the validity and the reliability of the research
study.
Results from first round of analysis in the multiple case study showed
school team commitment, teachers' attitude to professional development
and community cooperation to be important factors in educational
change. The second round of analysis highlighted the importance of
placing the teacher at the centre of change when planning professional
development. Finally, the third round presents a summary of the factors
emerging from the analyses in five major focus areas: professional
development; principal leadership; school organisation and culture;
school team; and system support. The importance of the relationships
among these factors was recognised in their impact on teachers' abilities to
make educational changes in their classrooms.
The thesis has found that the professional decision-making and practice
of teachers is value added by the actions of other players - professional
development providers, school principals and education systems.
Teachers' capacity to change is enhanced by appropriate school-based
professional development, flexible school organisation, and the
opportunity to work collaboratively in school teams.
From the patterns emerging from the strong and weak clusters of cases
the thesis is able to make conclusions about teachers' professional practice,
professional development approaches, principal leadership, school
organisation, education systems and the nature of change. This thesis
shows that educational change requires multiple actions at different
levels of participation. Finally, the thesis offers recommendations to the
different players in the field: education systems, principals and
professional development providers.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">classroom practice</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">teaching practices</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.130304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The setting, structural control, geochemistry and mantle source
               of the Monaro Volcanic Province, southeastern New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Roach, Ian C.</field><field name="description">The Monaro Volcanic Province (MVP) is an Oligocene-Eocene intraplate basaltic lava
field situated in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales between the towns of
Cooma and Bombala. The lava pile of the MVP consists of basal sub-alkali rocks
(olivine tholeiite, transitional basalt) capped by a number of thick ankaramite lavas,
above which lie less numerous alkali rocks including alkali olivine basalt, nepheline
basanite and olivine nephelinite. Intercalated with the lava flows are massive and
matrix-supported alkali and ankaramitic hyaloclastites, alkali pillow basalts, rare tuffs,
bauxitic weathering profiles, lacustrine sediments and reworked late Cretaceous to early
Tertiary river gravels. The lava pile is intruded through by numerous volcanic plugs
and dykes and rare maars. Volcanic centres are principally concentrated in two NW-SE
trending zones parallel to major crustal-scale fractures in the Palaeozoic basement.
Centres almost always lie over the intersections of two or more conjugate strike-slip or
transverse fractures. The stratigraphy, whole-rock geochemistry and Sr and Nd isotopic
signatures of rocks from the MVP indicate magma-genesis initially from an
asthenospheric source with EM1 characteristics, gradually becoming more lithospheric
with DM source characteristics. The long-lived nature of the MVP rules out a mantle
plume-type source for magmas. Instead, a diapiric source is envisaged. The MVP
mantle xenolith suite appears to have equilibrated at slightly higher temperatures for
given pressures than the Newer Volcanics Province suite suggesting the palaeogeotherm
for the MVP was slightly hotter than the "South East Australian" geotherm. Large
amounts of amphibole (pargasitic hornblende, pargasite, ferroan pargasite and
kaersutite) occuring within the more silica-undersaturated rocks of the MVP, and rarely
within Iherzolitic xenoliths, are interpreted to have formed as selvages on mantle veins
in contact with peridotite beneath the MVP. Amphiboles were later sampled by
magmas rising through the same conduits and were brought to the surface. MVP
ankaramite lavas feature &lt; 2cm clinopyroxene porphyrocrysts, the cores of which are
shown to have crystallised at ca. 18 kb pressure or ca. 54 km depth. This defines the

provision of early childhood services. The change has been from delivery of a
discrete education model of sessional preschool to a diverse range of services to
families. This policy focus is reflected in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).
There has been a move from a discrete preschool provision by the Department of
Education and Training to a more cohesive early childhood approach by
Children's Services Branch within the expanded Department of Education and
Training and Children's, Youth and Family Services Bureau.
The purpose of the study is to investigate reasons for, and nature of, the shift in
policy focus and the impact on preschool staff in the ACT. The review of
literature reveals that implementation of a more cohesive provision of early
childhood services in Australia has not been without difficulties. These difficulties
are investigated.
The research is undertaken at an ACT Government preschool site. At this site
the sessional government preschool and a community long day care centre are
located in a purpose built shared facility. The research traces the values and
practices of preschool staff in the sessional government preschool as they work
in the shared facility in the first year of operation.
Action research is employed in the form of a single case study, and guided by
principles of Problem Based Methodology to clarify the issues involved and
develop strategies to address a positive way forward in the ACT.
The reflective, qualitative research provides the government preschool staff and
the researcher with opportunities to develop and implement strategies to address
difficulties. These difficulties are discussed in the context of the review of
literature.
Drawing on conclusions and recommendations from the case study, the
investigation provides management insight into a way forward for more cohesive
provision of early childhood services in the ACT.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">early childhood services</field><field name="subject">preschools</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">preschool staff</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">policy changes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.141351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the drop-out from external study programmes at Goulburn College of Advanced Education</field><field name="creator">Roberts, David W.</field><field name="description">External Studies has been in operation at Goulburn
College of Advanced Education for ten years (1970 - 1980).
During this time nearly 1,800 students have been involved
in the external programmes. Over half of these students
have not completed their studies.
This field-study is an attempt to document the actual
drop-out rates for the various programmes and to compare
the results obtained with statistics available from other
tertiary institutions in Australia and overseas. Factors
such as student age and sex as related to achievement and
time of withdrawal are investigated.
The statistics are largely drawn from student files
and a questionnaire distributed to a sample of external
students.
The main thrust of the study is to ascertain the
reasons for student withdrawal in an attempt to reduce
the attrition rates in the future. Drop-out was found to
be the result of a number of contributing factors rather
than deriving from any particular reason.
The field-study shows that drop-out rates at
Goulburn are somewhat similar to those experienced by
other tertiary institutions, but that the attrition rate
during the first semester of study is excessive.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Goulburn College of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">external studies</field><field name="subject">drop out rates</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.143134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The collection of visitor use information and its implications for park management planning : Centennial Park case study</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Geoffrey C.</field><field name="description">This study critically examines the role of visitor use
information in park management planning. Few park planning
documents utilise visitor use information. This is thought
to result from two problems. Firstly, visitor use studies
have been plagued with methodological problems such as
unclear objectives, lack of rigour in the survey design and
lack of synthesis of information needs. These have resulted
in data which are unreliable and at times have no direct
implication for management planning. The second problem
arises from the lack of understanding of the role visitor
use information may play in the planning process.
A case study, the Centennial Park User Survey, was
undertaken to demonstrate how the inadequacies of existing
visitor use studies could be overcome and to provide a base
for future planning of Centennial Park. The survey data
have assisted Management both in day-to-day decision making
and future management planning relating to control of
forthcoming events, responding to public comment, traffic
management, facility provision, staff changeover, park staff
work programmes and rosters, allocation of financial and
staff resources, promotion of the Park, provision of
interpretative material and re-allocation of users.
By comparing the shortcomings of previous studies with the
experience of the case study, specific implications for the
collection and use of visitor use information in park
management planning have been identified.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">park management</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="subject">Centennial Park</field><field name="subject">visitor information</field><field name="subject">user survey</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.143926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Competency based training : a certain game of truth</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Pauline</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a multi-faceted picture of competency based training
and the impact it is having on vocational education. The thesis is a personal
attempt to act agentically by deconstructing the discourse of vocational
education within which I am positioned in my working life. It is an attempt
to push back the boundaries of the discourse and to explore and create
spaces for contestation.
In order to do this I undertake three different readings of a set of texts. The
texts come from two sources. The first is a set of documents identified in the
Framework for the Implementation of Competency Based Training and which
represent the official government position on competency based training.
The second is a set of interviews I undertook with teachers at the Canberra Institute of Technology regarding their views about competency based
training. Details of the texts are provided in Section 2 of the thesis.
The body of the thesis is a set of three readings of these texts. The particular
view of 'reading' used in the thesis is a post structuralist one. Each of the
readings brings into play the understanding of the texts created within a
particular discourse. I draw on the work of Michel Foucault for the
understanding of discourse used in the thesis.
The first reading is from within the discourse. It is a reading which seeks to
understand competency based training in its own terms, and in relation to
the critical debates within the literature of vocational education. I argue in
this reading that competency based training emerges as a grand but flawed
vision for the future of vocational education.
The second reading takes the viewpoint of the work of Michel Foucault, and
in particular his book Discipline and Punish. It uses the metaphor of the
panopticon to explore the nature of power/knowledge within competency
based training and the regime of truth which it brings into being.
The final reading is from a feminist post structuralist position. I argue in this
reading that the discourse of competency based training is phallocentric. I
explore the liberatory claims of the discourse and conclude that the claims
are limited because they do not challenge the fundamental and powerful
dualisms through which competency based training is constituted.
Finally in the conclusion I briefly explore whether I have achieved the aim
of the thesis. I question what it means to act agentically and whether the
type of thesis I have undertaken constructs the possibility of doing so.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">competency based training</field><field name="subject">vocational education</field><field name="subject">Canberra Institute of Technology</field><field name="subject">CIT</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.144735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ant communities in the grasslands of the Australian Capital Territory and the role of ants in the ecology of the pink-tailed legless lizard, Aprasia parapulchella</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Wayne</field><field name="description">This study examined the ant communities of several grasslands of the Australian
Capital Territory (ACT) and their relevance to the pink-tailed legless lizard, Aprasia
parapulchella (Pygopodidae). A. parapulchella is a fossorial species that shares
burrows with, and eats the brood of, several grassland ant species.
Foraging ants were collected from sites by pitfall trapping throughout one calendar
year and comparisons of ant communities made between seasons and sites of differing
vegetation structure. Competition between ant species for artificial nest sites and the
effects of temperature on selection of nest site selection were also studied. The role that
ants play in the distribution of A. parapulchella was investigated by (i) comparing ant
faunas from several sites throughout the geographic range of the lizard, including sites
in New South Wales and Victoria, (ii) performing feeding preference experiments with
A. parapulchella, and (iii) investigating the seasonal nature of brood production and
nest establishment by ants in ACT grasslands. Major findings were used to make
recommendations to assist in the management, including rehabilitation, of
A. parapulchella grassland sites.
Low insolation appears to significantly affect the ant species composition of
grassland sites in the ACT relative to other Australian vegetation types. In the ACT
grassland sites, large species of the Dominant Dolichoderinae functional group were
absent, or present only in very low numbers. The communities were species-poor
relative to other Australian studies with only 60 species being recorded across all sites
studied, with no more than 21 species recorded at any site on any sampling occasion.
Whilst ant species community structure was highly variable between seasons and sites,
more than 95% of ants were from the three functional groups, Dominant
Dolichoderinae, Generalized Myrmicinae and Opportunists. The communities were
numerically dominated throughout the year by the ubiquitous species groups
Iridomyrmex 'rufoniger' and Rhytidoponera 'metallica'. Almost all taxa increased in
foraging abundance during summer months and Pheidole spp., Monomorium spp.,
Crematogaster sp. Paratrechina sp. and Notoncus ectalomoides were occasionally
locally abundant. There were no significant relationships between ant and vegetation
community structures, but Solenopsis sp. showed an alliance with sites that had a high
abundance of Themeda australis (kangaroo grass), whilst Crematogaster sp. and
Paratrechina sp. are potential bioindicators of disturbance from grazing or pasture
improvement.
Iridomyrmex 'rufoniger' were the numerically dominant foraging ants, making up
50% of all captures, but they held only 80% of their nest sites when faced with
competition from other species. R. 'metallica' and Pheidole spp. on the other hand,
gained 80% more nests than they lost to other taxa. I. 'rufoniger' and R. 'metallica'
both preferred nest sites with warmer temperature regimes when given the choice, and
this assisted them to tend brood throughout the year. All ant species in ACT grasslands
had summer peaks in brood production. Most nests were inactive throughout the cooler
months and nest founding was predominantly between September and November. The
common species, Iridomyrmex spp., Paratrechina sp. and R. 'metallica' held winged
reproductives in their nests from April and all ant taxa had released all alates by mid-
November.
Although there were differences in ant community structure throughout the range of
A. parapulchella, the ubiquitous R. 'metallica' and I. 'rufoniger' were always abundant,
whilst again, Dominant Dolichoderinae and associated subordinate taxa were absent or
present only in relatively low numbers. The lizards consumed brood from all the
common ant species in ACT grasslands and showed preference for consuming brood of,
and living with, small Iridomyrmex spp. The range of the small Iridomyrmex spp.
preferred by A. parapulchella extends far beyond that of the lizard. Its distribution is
apparently not restricted by the range of its ant prey species.
For rehabilitation of A. parapulchella sites in the ACT, it is recommended that a
significant ground cover of native grasses is established to ensure the low abundance of
large and territorial ants from the Dominant Dolichoderinae functional group. Along
with a high abundance of shallow surface rocks, this will ensure the establishment of ant
communities that are numerically dominated by small Iridomyrmex spp., which are
preferred by A. parapulchella for homesite sharing and as a food source.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ant communities</field><field name="subject">grasslands</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">pink-tailed legless lizard</field><field name="subject">Aprasia parapulchella</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.153532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Siblings of disabled children : and investigative study</field><field name="creator">Roe, Diana</field><field name="description">Research on the families of the disabled
suggest that the advent of a child with a
disability will cause a far-reaching effect on
the mother, father, siblings and the family's
relationship with the outside world. Researchers
have differed on the extent and causes of
difficulties faced by the siblings, with many
inconsistencies and contradictions shown. Some
studies have found behavioural problems and
lowered self-esteem, and others suggest an
increase in altruism and compassion. An
investigative study was implemented, with
siblings from 29 families with a disabled child,
matched with siblings from 29 families with no
identified disabled sibling. Patterns of family
outings, the use of support services and
perceptions of difficulties faced by the family
were examined. The matched siblings were
compared on the Coopersmith Self-Esteem
Inventory, measures of altruism, and behaviour
as seen by both teachers and parents. The
children also were questioned on their
perception of family cohesion and their
involvement with other family members. Major
findings of the study were a pattern of social
isolation for the families, and perception of
isolation within and outside the family for both
the parents and the siblings. The siblings
scored significantly lower on the Coopersmith
Inventory, and parents perceived them as having
more behavioural difficulties than the controls'
parents. No significant difference in altruism
was found between the two groups of siblings.
The finding that some siblings are coping well,

ilustrated by four case studies. A number of
limitation s of the study are discussed.
particularly the wide range of variables
investigated, and difficulties with some
instruments. Further areas of research are
suggested, including exploring the relationships

concluded that for both the siblings and the

expectations may help to overcome the feelings
of intra-family and extra-family isolation.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disabled children</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">siblings</field><field name="subject">Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory</field><field name="subject">family cohesion</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.154253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Observed interaction between students using computers</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Elise</field><field name="description">This study was conducted to see what cognitive and social skills and strategies were

conditions under which the activity is conducted.
The implications from the study are: that under most circumstances it is desireable
for students to work in pairs with a computer to enable interaction to occur, students
may require some training in the cognitive skills necessary for the software being

important; and integrating the computer into the classroom environment may

of Employment, Education and Training, 1989, p 81) concludes that science in primary
schools is in a state of crisis. This finding is not new as there have been concerns about
primary school science for many years. It is likely that one of the reasons why the
problem remains could relate to the attitudes and beliefs that teachers hold about the
subject and its importance in the primary school curriculum.
Another reason put forward relates to the limited background experiences in science of
many primary school teachers. In particular, their knowledge of content matter and
strategies for teaching the subject is limited. As a consequence, many primary teachers
do not feel confident to teach science so they avoid it or teach only units with which they
are familiar. This leads to inconsistent science teaching and an ineffective science
curriculum in many primary schools.
The research question, What factors influence the teaching of science in a primary
school?' is investigated through a case study of a primary school. Teachers' attitudes to,
and beliefs about, the subject are explored in relation to their background experiences,
teacher education and knowledge of science. How these factors influence their
classroom teaching is explored through the context of the physical environment and
culture of the school, the culture of teaching and the instructional leadership of the
principal.
The case study is based on information obtained from teacher surveys and interviews,
journal entries and school documents. A typology which helps clarify factors influencing
the teaching of science is developed. It provides insight into the problems of teaching
the subject and how they may be addressed. A case study of the principal adds to the
typology by providing the principal's perspective of science in the school.
It is likely that the school featured in the case study is representative of many primary
schools. The findings and recommendations may therefore have wider implications and
may contribute to more effective teaching of science in many primary schools.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">science teaching</field><field name="subject">science curriculum</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.155337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internship in paper conservation at the Australian Archives A.C.T., 1981-1982</field><field name="creator">Rome, Daraka</field><field name="description">The Australian Archives A.C.T.

teachers to utilize group teaching methods in musical instrument instruction,
have been set up in A.C.T. educational institutions. Reactions to
this innovation have been varied, and its usefulness queried. However,
there has been a lack of information and little evidence of systematic
research in Australia on this topic, perhaps because there are very few
areas outside the A.C.T. where keyboard laboratories are used in schools.
The investigation reported here attempted to determine why the
innovation spread so rapidly in the A.C.T., the uses to which it was
being put, and the kinds of support mechanisms that were necessary to
ensure its optimum use. An interview known as the Levels of Use Interview
was selected as the main method of collecting data from teachers using
keyboard laboratories, and by analysing these interviews in the context of
the A.C.T. educational milieu it was possible to predict a future pattern
of usage, and recommend appropriate action to be taken by administrators
responsible for the organization of A.C.T. education.
The findings of the study supported theories that innovations are
adopted by members of social networks and that the size of the system and
degree of administrative and financial support may positively affect the
spread of an innovation. All teachers using keyboard laboratories were
convinced of their value, although this perception varied according to
factors such as promotional status and recency of teacher training. In
addition, the LoU Interview was found to be a highly appropriate tool for
a practising classroom teacher to use in an investigation of this kind.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">keyboard laboratories</field><field name="subject">musical instrument instruction</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.161158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aquatic plants as indicators of heavy metal contamination</field><field name="creator">Sabet, Mitra Deliri</field><field name="description">Concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Cr, Zn, Mn, Fe and Pb) in the water columns,
aquatic plants and sediments of fourteen lakes of varied levels of pollution were
measured.
Correlation analysis was carried out between heavy metal concentrations in aquatic
plants and heavy metal concentrations in water and sediment. The aquatic plants
which accumulated heavy metals in their tissues in proportion to that in water and
sediments were identified.
The aquatic plants studied were: 8/yxa auberti Rich, Cabomba caroliniana Gray,
Ceratophyllum demersum L, Ceratopteris thalictroides (L.) Bron, Chara globularis,
Eichhornia crassipes Solmn, Hydrilla verticillata Royle, Ipomoea aquatica Forsk,
Limnophila aromatica (Lam.) Merr., Ludwigia adscendens (L) Hara, Nelumbo nucifera
Gaertn, Nymphaea stallata Linn, Nymphoides indica (L.) Kuntze, Typha angustata
Bony &amp; Chaub and Utricularia aurea Lour.
Metal uptake by aquatic plants varied between different species and within the same
species depending on lake water contamination levels. The level of metal uptake to a
great extent was a function of the environment water metal concentration.
Results showed that Utricularia accumulated Mn, Zn, Cr, Cd and Pb in direct proportion
to the overlying waters (r2 = 0.69, 0.63, 0.69, 0.65 and 0.39 respectively). Hydrilla
accumulated Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Cr, Cd and Pb in direct proportion to the overlying waters
(r2 = 0.65, 0.66, 0.44, 0.72, 0.38, 0.63, and 0.73 respectively). Blyxa leaves
accumulated Zn, Fe, Cr, Cd and Pb in direct proportion to the overlying waters (r2 =
0.74, 0.74, 0.72, 0.60 and 0.82 respectively). Echhornia leaf accumulated only Cr in
direct proportion to the overlying waters r2 = 0.81. Nymphaea leaf and Chara did not
accumulate any metal in direct proportion to the overlying waters.
Roots of Blyxa auberti, Ceratopteris thalictroides, and Eichhornia crassipes contained
higher concentrations of heavy metals than their leaves. Roots of Blyxa accumulated
Cr, Cd and Pb in direct proportion to the overlying waters (r2 = 0.91, 0.65 and 0.69
respectively). Echhornia root accumulated Cd in direct proportion to the overlying
waters with r2 = 0.90. Nymphaea stem showed no significant correlations between the
metal concentrations in the waters and in the plant.
Utricularia accumulated Zn, Fe, Cr, Cd and Pb in direct proportion to the metals in the
underlying sediment extracted by cold hydrochloric acid (r2 = 0.84, 0.51, 0.47, 0.68 and
0.80 respectively). Hydrilla accumulated Cu, Zn, Cr, Cd and Pb in direct proportion to
the underlying sediment (r2 = 0.34, 0.37, 0.91, 0.49 and 0.96 respectively). Blyxa
accumulated Zn, Fe, Cr, Cd and Pb in direct proportion to the underlying sediments (r2
= 0.99, 0.61, 0.82, 0.75 and 0.64 respectively) . Echhornia leaf showed significant
correlation between the Cu (r2 = 0.83) and Cr (i2 = 0.88) concentration in underlying
sediment and the plant. Nymphaea leaf showed a significant correlation between the
Zn (r2 = 0.83) concentration in the plant and the underlying sediments.
Roots of Blyxa showed significant correlation between concentrations of Cu, Cr and Pb
in sediment extracted by hydrochloric acid and plant (r2 = 0.9, 0.7 and 0.9
respectively). Roots of Echhornia had no significant correlation with the sediment
metal concentrations (hydrochloric acid extractable).
Two techniques (cold hydrochloric acid extractable and nitric acid extractable) to
extract metals from sediment were compared. Based on correlations of metal
concentrations in plant tissue and metal extracted from the sediment, it was concluded
that the cold hydrochloric acid extractable metal technique is more suitable for
determining bioavailable sediment metal concentration in environmental studies.
Laboratory studies investigations on the bioaccumulation of Zn and Cu in Hydrilla
confirmed that Hydrilla is a good bioindicator of Cu as it accumulated 20360 ug/g dry
weight of Cu in 72 hours. Hydrilla showed higher bioaccumulation factor with low
concentration of Cu in the solution, in the laboratory studies.
Hydrilla was determined to be the best indicator species as it reflected the heavy metal
concentration in the environment which was supported by the laboratory studies.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aquatic plants</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">contamination</field><field name="subject">sediments</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.161814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the success of women in educational administration in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Durie Saines, Deborah</field><field name="description">The role of women has become a central issue in educational debate because

can cause significant morbidity (Brook, 1994) and sometimes can cause irreversible
sequelae such as a hearing defect and subsequent learning difficulties (Klein, 1994). The
aims of the research presented here were to study some aspects of the middle ear
defence mechanisms in both immune and non-immune rats following experimental
otitis media (OM) with two pathogens nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and
Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis). This study also aimed at developing a suitable
technique for preparing immunohistochemical staining of middle ear sections (chapter
2).
A previous study has shown that a regime where rats received an IPP immunisation
combined with an IT boost was effective in enhancing clearance of a middle ear
infection with the same strain of NTHi and also in the presence of a concomitant viral
infection (Moore et al, 2001). Results of this study have shown that for NTHi infection
a distinct cellular influx to the middle ear in the immune rats was accompanied by an
enhanced bacterial clearance compared to the non-immunised rats (chapter 3). This
cellular influx was responsible for the remarkable reduction in the bacterial number.
The sharp decline in PMNs numbers in the NTHi immunised rats that followed
complete bacterial clearance at 72h post infection (Table 3.1) indicate a more
effectively controlled down regulation of this cell infiltrate than the non-immunised rats.
For M. catarrhalis infection, there was no difference in cell infiltrate between immune
and non-immune rats, but enhanced clearance of the bacteria were observed for the
immune animals.
The histopathological changes in the middle ear mucosa of rats with experimentally
induced infection were studied to provide a better understanding about the distribution
of the inflammatory cells and changes in the mucosa during the first 24h post challenge
with NTHi and M. catarrhalis (Chapter 4). These changes have not been previously
studied for the two pathogens at 24h post challenge in rats. Induced infections with the
two pathogens were found to produce similar histopathological changes but more
inflammatory infiltration was observed within the infected mucosa with NTHi than that
seen with M. catarrhalis. The infections were characterized by increased thickness of
the middle ear mucosa, Eustachian tube mucosa, periosteum and tympanic membrane.
There was also an increase in the number and size of small blood vessels at all sites, and
these small blood vessels seem to be the source of the inflammatory infiltration into the
middle ear mucosa and middle ear cavity during the infection. These findings provided
an essential background to the immunohistochemical study.
The effect of mucosal immunisation on the distribution of CD4+T cells and CD8+T
cells has not been investigated previously. Results of the present study (Chapter 5) show
the pattern of distribution of these cells during the first 48h post infection with NTHi in
the rat. The number of CD4+and CD8+T cells peaked at 24h post infection in the nonimmunised
animal and were highest at 48h post-infection in the immunised rats. The
difference in response in the immunised rats may represent regulation of the
inflammatory response by the immune system. The inflammatory response regulation is
indicated by the difference in cellular influx into the immune rats and the response in
the immune rats that corresponds to enhanced bacterial clearance prior to a decrease in
numbers of inflammatory cells once the bacteria was no longer detected (Chapter 3).
This resolution of the inflammatory mass would reduce the opportunity for continued
damage to local tissue. These changes are also supported by the reduction in the
thickness of the middle ear mucosa of the immunised rats especially at 24h and 48h
post-infection (Chapter 5).
This study has shown that there are distinct differences in the rate of bacterial clearance
and cellular changes in the middle ear mucosa and tympanic bulla in immunised rats
during a middle ear infection. Future studies are still required to gain a better
understanding of differences in the inflammatory response for both pathogens, NTHi
and M. catarrhalis.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acute otitis media</field><field name="subject">middle ear</field><field name="subject">defence mechanisms</field><field name="subject">immune response</field><field name="subject">immunisation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.163007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eco-efficient timber use through bio-sensitive design</field><field name="creator">Santana, Maria Elena</field><field name="description">A significant number of building materials are based on wood. Wood
competes with other materials and products for many building applications
from structural framing to cladding. Wood appears to be preferable because
of its aesthetic and structural properties, its versatility, economic cost and
environmental benefits. However, timber wastage within the construction
industry is incalculable. Waste occurs at all stages of the timber resource
stream: procurement, conversion, installation, use, maintenance, dismantling
and eventual disposal. Much of this loss can be avoided through eco-design
strategies based on a better understanding of the total resource flows.
This thesis addresses the ecological implications associated with the use and
over-exploitation of timber in building construction. Applying bio-sensitive
design principles and using a life cycle approach, the thesis examines ways
of maximising timber resource yield through appropriate materials selection,
design strategies and construction techniques to reduce their ecological
footprint.
Finally, an easy-to-use guide that incorporates economic and aesthetic-value
criteria to the analysis is developed. The guide is aimed to offer a flexible
decision-support tool that enables designers and other people involved in the
construction industry to comprehend in a systematic way, the multiple
dimensions interacting when selecting timber-building products. It is thus,
intended to explore in practice the implications and trade-offs of state of the
art timber products with the ultimate aim of integrating the ecological
dimension to the decision-making process.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">timber use</field><field name="subject">wood</field><field name="subject">eco-effiency</field><field name="subject">bio-sensitive design</field><field name="subject">building materials</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.164347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The law of private policing in Australia</field><field name="creator">Sarre, Warick T.</field><field name="description">Diversified, essentially privatised, policing options are expanding daily in modern
societies. They have become available to, and are being accessed by, individuals,
community groups and governments on a regular basis. While this dissertation
examines the phenomenon of private policing in Australia generally, its task, more
specifically, is to document and review the laws that govern, shape and make
accountable private policing operations and activities.
Chapter 1 reviews the origins and manifestations of contemporary shifts to privatised
models of policing. Chapter 2 examines models of relationships between public and
private personnel, and the various methods of accountability that may serve to govern
the activities of the latter. Chapters 3 to 8 explore and explain the applicable laws
that inform, shape and govern private policing generally. What this examination
reveals is that "private police" are empowered by a multitude of common law and
legislative principles, along with a mosaic of diverse and semi-structured rules not
necessarily designed for this specific purpose. One quickly finds that the laws that
permit, facilitate, regulate and manage private manifestations of policing do not fall
within easily discernible legal parameters.
Finally, Chapter 9 provides a summary of the dissertation, together with some
general thoughts concerning the effectiveness and appropriateness of the law as a
vehicle for bringing about the desired goals, namely effective policing that provides
appropriate outcomes for victims, suspects, private personnel, public police and the
general public alike.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">private policing</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">accountability</field><field name="subject">laws</field><field name="subject">private police</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.164945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anger is both a learned and learnable emotion</field><field name="creator">Sawyer, Susan M.</field><field name="description">Anger is an emotion sorely in need of an improved public profile. Its association with
overt violent aggression has masked its original purpose, namely, to be a useful and
motivating force to engineer our survival. An emotion designed to serve us well in the
face of injustice and threat has become the means by which injustice is perpetuated by
the strong and powerful, against the weak and vulnerable.
The expression of anger is often misguided, dysfunctional and misplaced with terrible
consequences for society, including road rage. Yet there is increasing evidence that the
suppression of anger is associated with negative health-related conditions including heart
disease, cancer, mental illness, substance abuse and eating disorders.
Evidence suggests that anger has a three-stage structure of socialised reactivity,
biological anger generation and environmentally acquired action and expression.
As a result of this six-year research study, ten key principles of anger expression have
emerged, suggesting that anger can be learned in both informal and formal institutional
education by both children and adults.
These principles were incorporated into a pilot program aimed to educate rather than
eliminate anger expression, in a health promotion program involving 25 self-selected
Canberra women. This program formed part of a wider study of acquired anger management experiences through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.
Results from the study are presented as a core of learned and learnable knowledge
about anger, as modules of information. These modules can be adapted and modified
for any learning forum, including schools, adult education, career-related education and
inservice training. Suggestions for the packaging of these component parts are provided,
together with guidelines for reaching target groups.
This thesis contends that each individual has the right to know and utilise this
information and can use anger to achieve beneficial outcomes for themselves. If anger
expression is inappropriate and dysfunctional, so will be its effects. If anger expression
is appropriate and functional, then it can have a positive and beneficial outcome.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emotion</field><field name="subject">anger</field><field name="subject">aggression</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">anger management</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.165537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An internship in the conservation of paper</field><field name="creator">Seager, Christopher Philipp</field><field name="description">This dissertation is an account of an internship in paper

submissions from politicians, bureaucrats and industrialists for a decade.
That the issue is not yet resolved is the result of many factors, all of which
serve to highlight the structural complexities of the Australian electronic
media system. At the political level, social policy is in a state of transition
and broadcasting policy has reflected this. The Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC) and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) have been
forced to reappraise their roles as public broadcasters. The commercial
networks have seen their reserves and their profitability deteriorate
drastically in an environment of poor management, fluctuating government
policy and a depressed national economy. The Australian Broadcasting
Tribunal (ABT), the federal regulator of commercial broadcasting, is
struggling to adapt to these new circumstances, and is confronted by new
challenges to its powers and responsibilities.
Ideally, a discussion on the introduction of pay television would be conducted
within the context of a comprehensive and established federal broadcasting
policy. Basic to this thesis is the perception that no such policy exists. It is
left to the analyst to speculate as to the intentions evident in Government
initiatives, suggest the potential impact of pay television in that light, and
offer constructive criticism accordingly.
This thesis recognises that pay television seems inevitable as both major
political parties are committed, in principle at least, to its introduction. This
thesis sets itself the following objectives: to identify the salient components
that serve to define pay television; to develop and employ a methodology to
extract lessons from the experiences of others with pay television, whilst
remaining sensitive to historical and structural context; to apply those
lessons to the Australia condition; and to make recommendations on the
introduction of pay television, based on both the definitional and comparative
work of this thesis, within the context of contemporary Government
deliberations, as evident in the Report from the House of Representatives
Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure of
November 1989.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pay television</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">broadcasting policy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.171016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling health care expenditure : a new microsimulation approach to simulating the distributional impact of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</field><field name="creator">Schofield, Deborah</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a microsimulation model was developed using methods which
were intended to overcome the main criticism of earlier models developed in
Australia - that their estimation of the distribution of health benefits1 across
income groups was not accurate. To determine whether the new model &#65533;
called the Person Level Model of Pharmaceutical Benefits (PLM-PB) &#65533; was
more accurate, two typical means-based models were also built to replicate the
most commonly used methods in Australia.
A comparison of the results of the three models revealed that while they
produced comparable results at the aggregate when compared with
administrative data, the PLM-PB was much more accurate in capturing
distributional differences by beneficiary and medication type. The PLM-PB
also indicated that, as anticipated, PBS benefits were more pro-poor than earlier
means-based models had suggested. The PLM-PB had another important
advantage in that the method also captured the variation in the use of
medication and thus the subsidy received within sub-populations.
As the PLM-PB was found to be more accurate than the means-based model, a
multivariate analysis of the distribution of PBS subsidy across a number of
socio-economic groups was undertaken as an example application of the model.
It was found that health status (defined by number of recent illnesses) and
concession card type were most important in explaining the amount of PBS
subsidy received. This indicates that the distribution of PBS expenditure meets
the policy objectives of assisting those most in need, whether need is defined as
poor health or low income.
1 Benefits refer to expenditure as transfers from government to individuals rather than the general health
benefits of using medication.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microsimulation model</field><field name="subject">Person Level Model of Pharmaceutical Benefits</field><field name="subject">PLM-PB</field><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</field><field name="subject">PBS</field><field name="subject">computer science</field><field name="subject">computer modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.171802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Context and choice : a new approach to making ecologically sustainable decisions</field><field name="creator">Schooneveldt, Jan C.</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a framework for making ecologically sustainable decisions. It is an
integrative thesis that draws its data from the fundamental concepts underlying the disciplines
of psyschology, linguistics and biology. Its orientation is essentially theoretical, but its
application is practical. It is presented in three parts. Part 1 sets out the theoretical context
and proposes a basis for understanding decision-making processes in an interactive,
evolutionary context. This part focuses particularly on subjective factors that play a role when
an organism is in the process of making a decision. Part 1 provides an underpinning for the
core of the thesis.
Part 2 forms this core. It considers the context in which decisions are made and
overviews current decision-making frameworks that aim at ecologically sustainable
outcomes. It proposes a process of metabolic mapping of materials and energy flows
across integrated socio-political bioregions as a basis for decision-making.
Part 3 considers the implications of the approach in terms of its utility, reliability and
validity. This part also looks at the role of ethics in decision-making and outlines the
strengths and weaknesses of the new approach.
The principle rinding is that research and decision-making are fundamentally distinct, often
confused concepts. An integrative approach to decision-making is required to counter the
increasing fragmentation in research and professional and administrative specialisation. A
research tool that bridges the plethora of theoretical orientations is proposed. This involves
the use of a semantic metalanguage to capture meaning in a rigorous and verifiable way. Such
a metalanguage gives us a means of understanding the subjective experience of organisms,
and in particular, their subjective perception of reality which guides their decision-making. A
second finding is that, unlike research, which necessarily involves a process of context
reduction, sound decision-making necessarily involves a process of context augmentation. And
finally it proposes a method of metabolic mapping on a bioregional basis operating under the
principle of subsidiarity as the most appropriate route towards sustainable decision-making.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecologically sustainable decisions</field><field name="subject">decision making processes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.172651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An internship in textile conservation : July-September 1983 Australian War Memorial, Jun-August 1984 the Abegg Stiftung</field><field name="creator">Schulz, Karin Hildegard</field><field name="description">The dissertation is divided into four sections. The
first deals with the work experience gained at the Australian War Memorial, followed by that gained at the Abegg Stiftung.
Observations on visits to other conservation laboratories and
a report on the two international conferences attended, complete
sections three and four.
Work experience at the Australian War Memorial Textile
conservation laboratory involved spending time in assisting
with ongoing programs, conservation treatments carried out
with supervision, as well as research. The time was divided
so that all areas received equal emphasis. Ongoing programs
involved the uniform inspections program and the display
maintenance program. The involvement with routine tasks
of surface cleaning, and with preparation for storage or
display, with both programs, is not detailed in the dissertation.
Nor can the dissertation include all the treatments of objects.
Reference may be made for details on these treatments, to
Australian War Memorial Conservation records for objects with
the following accession numbers: AWM 1102,/5947,/10487,
AWM 7919. However, two treatment reports are included. These
are for a pair of flying boots worn by the Baron von Richthofen,
and for an embroidered silk souvenir. The boots, now on
permanent display were conserved with attention given to the need
to preserve historical evidence, the choice of materials used for
repair and requirements of display. The silk textile treatment
took into consideration the benefits and risks involved in removing
a deteriorated backing and relining a silk which was extremely
embrittled. In the process it was realised that a facing might
give stability to such a deteriorated silk; however, an
initial study of facing materials and methods was required and
was therefore undertaken and reported on in the dissertation.
Whilst inspecting items in the relics collection of the Australian
War Memorial a number of rubberised fabrics and other rubber materials
were observed to show problems such as hardening, embrittlement,
deformation, tackiness or discolouration. It was found that no
information had been published on the treatment and
preservation of such materials in the conservation
literature. A survey on rubber deterioration and
preservation literature since 1900 is included in the
dissertation.
The function, facilities and equipment of the
textile conservation department of the Australian War
Memorial are described as well as the storage of relics
and uniforms.
Work experience at the Abegg Stiftung involved
assisting with group projects in most instances as well as
working independently with supervision. It was therefore
decided to report in general on the types of treatment given
and give a brief account of the experience and skills gained.
An example of a treatment report as was required for the Abegg
Stiftung records is included as well as an example of detailed
personal notes on the progress and treatment of a 15th century
silk chasuble.
The Abegg Stiftung is recognised as one of the foremost
training centres in textile conservation in Europe. This led
me to consider here the benefits and possible limitations of the
program from the impressions gained during the three months
work experience at the Institute.
Round table discussions were held by Mechthilde Flury-
Lehmburg which served to raise questions for discussion by
textile conservation students and staff. This also permitted
a concensus to be reached when items of a complex nature were
to be conserved. A record of such a discussion is annexed.
The Library of the Institute was frequently consulted by
historians, as it specialises in textile conservation literature
and many languages are represented, German being predominant.
This library was consulted on German literature on textile
conservation, and a brief guide to sources is included.
Visits were made to a number of textile conservation
laboratories in Europe. It was possible as a result of these
visits to evaluate various types of equipment which are used
for textile conservation. It was seen that although much
skilful work was being done, especially in laboratories where
more conservative treatments were preferred, there were a
number of questions which were raised and remained unanswered.
Subjects discussed and research undertaken are reported.
The 1IC and ICOM conferences attended, introduced me to
international cooperation and activity in conservation research
and setting of standards. Information found to be relevant to
progress in textile conservation research and related materials
is summarised here.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">textile conservation</field><field name="subject">Australian War Memorial</field><field name="subject">Abegg Stiftung</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.174002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the use of a simulation game to teach a specific topographic map reading skill</field><field name="creator">Scrivener, J.

Battle Squares on the learning of the map reading skill of
grid-reference determination by year 7 students. The effect of
ability level and sex differences on the acquisition of gridreferencing
skills were also examined. The simulation game
developed is a modification of the traditional children's
game Battleships. The modifications produced the major
features of the grid system used on Australian Survey Map
sheets without substantially altering the characteristics of
the game Battleships.
Two treatment groups played the simulation game, one group
having experienced both a pre test and a post test and the
other group only the post test. A third treatment did the
pre test and post test without experiencing the simulation
game.
Students in both treatment groups which experienced the simulation game showed significant gains in the learning of
grid-referencing skills. Students in upper ability level
groups gained significantly better scores on the post test
than students in lower ability level groups. Both upper and
lower ability level groups showed significant gains. Girls
performed significantly better than boys on the post test.
Both boys and girls showed significant gains as a result of the
simulation game experience. Ability level was a more important
moderating variable than sex difference in producing variations
in performance on the post test of grid-referencing skills.
The explicit educational aims of the simulation game were
effectively achieved in a short period of time, while maintaining
student motivation and interest. The success of the simulation
game in producing significant changes in grid referencing skills
would appear to have resulted from the frequent practise of
these skills the simulation game playing experience offers.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">simulation game</field><field name="subject">Battle Squares</field><field name="subject">topographic map reading skills</field><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061107.174519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the parent training evening seminar group program in the Language/Reading Centre at the Canberra College of Advanced Education</field><field name="creator">Seaton, Barbara Calre</field><field name="description">This field study is concerned with the development and

Commonwealth of Australia's Freedom of Information Legislation and proposals to
introduce a Freedom of Information Law in Sri Lanka. The major purpose of the study
was:
(i) to evaluate whether the Commonwealth FOI Act has
achieved the objects of Parliament - whether members of
the public could have a free access to government
information subject to important exemptions.
(ii) whether a FOI regime should be introduced to Sri Lanka
In conducting my research, I devoted three chapters to FOI in Australia including the
development of the legislation. I analysed key components of the legislation and
researched to what extent the FOI Act has achieved its objects. I devoted two chapters
towards the concept of transparency of government in Sri Lanka, the attitude of the
Courts towards the concept of the right to information and whether Sri Lanka needs a
Freedom of Information Act. In the last two chapters, I have devoted a chapter each to
the concept of translocation of laws and about an ideal FOI Act for Sri Lanka, which is an
adaptation of the Australian Act.
The individual components of the methodology incorporated:
(i) a literature survey of the Commonwealth FOI Act, Freedom of Information
in the United Nations and in the USA; and Sweden, Canada and New Zealand;
(ii) a literature survey concerning the transparency of government in Sri Lanka
(ii) interviews with a cross section Commonwealth FOI administrators and key
politicians, lawyers and a cross section of members of the press and public in
Sri Lanka; and
(iv) research of the Australian FOI legislation
The empirical data present an analysis of key features of the Commonwealth FOI Act
with particular attention to exemption clauses.
I have recommended some amendments to the FOI Act in view of the Commonwealth
Government's policy of outsourcing some of its activities and the creation of a position of
FOI Commissioner.
Finally my research indicates that Sri Lanka needs Freedom of Information legislation to
meet the challenges facing a developing country that is endeavoring to reach 'newly
developed status' early in the new millennium. Furthermore, international lenders and
donors are now requiring that developing countries like Sri Lanka seeking aid, should
show more transparency in its activities. I have drafted a Freedom of Jiformation Bill for
Sri Lanka. I have based the draft on the Australian law adapted to suit the local
conditions in Sri Lanka, which is in Appendix "G".</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commonwealth of Australia's Freedom of Information Legislation</field><field name="subject">FOI</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">right to information</field><field name="subject">empirical study</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.115444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of some significant issues and problems as           identified by the practical skills teachers in the provincial

A. Questionnaires, B. Interviews and
C. Review of literature.
A proposed set of questions for the questionnaires was sent to
the Division of Research and Evaluation Unit, Department of Education in Port Moresby, who made some encouraging comments
and suggestions which were then used in the formulation of the
final questionnaires consisting of 32 questions.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">provincial schools</field><field name="subject">Practical Skills teachers</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Department of Education in Port Moresby</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.145222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary-secondary transition : coping in a new school environment</field><field name="creator">Sen, Veronica</field><field name="description">The aim of the Field Study described in this Report
was to examine the nature of primary-secondary transition
as perceived by students themselves. Twelve students from
four A.C.T. primary schools were interviewed prior to their
entry to one or other of two high schools, and subsequent
interviews were conducted at intervals during the students'
first six months in high school. Further information was
obtained from interviews with their parents and from formal
and informal assessments made by their primary and
secondary teachers. To place the trends revealed in the
interviews in a wider context, surveys were administered
at the beginning and end of the six months' period to all
Year 7 students in both high schools.
A major emphasis of the Study was an investigation of
how students cope with new tasks, social and academic, at
a time when there is a potentially stressful conjunction
of early adolescence and major educational transition.
Such coping is conceptualised as the individual matching
his resources against the demands made by a new situation.
The initial appraisal by students of the new situation
was a general perception of high school as either benign or
threatening. The more differentiated, or secondary,
appraisal was influenced by further information and
experiences; and re-appraisal was characterised, after a
further lapse of time, by either a reinforcement or reversal
of original perceptions.
It was found that upon moving to the more complex
institutional setting of high school some students had
difficulty in adjusting to a more formal organisation and
a more demanding curriculum. The students' response to
high school included such coping strategies as hostility,
withdrawal or active striving to meet the challenge of a
new school. Some students who showed a marked inability
to cope with one or more of the tasks, social or
academic, of high school were deemed to have experienced
adaptive failure.
A key factor in adjustment to high school, and one
that was at least as important as academic achievement,
was that of interpersonal relationships. Success in
relating to both teachers and peers was found to be a
crucial factor for students, whether bright or less
bright, and it was found that students of limited academic
achievement could find compensation if they perceived
their "person environment" as benign.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary-secondary transition</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.145643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Streaming in the primary school</field><field name="creator">Seng, Lai Kwok</field><field name="description">This field study is a critical analysis of early streaming in
Singapore. Primary school pupils are streamed at the end of Primary 3 on
the basis of their performance in achievement tests in English, Mathematics
and Second Language.
The streaming policy is based on eugenic and economic premises.
The policy-makers believe that intelligence is largely determined by genes,
and that the quality of human resources is a vital factor for nation building.
The study identifies the ideological position of the policy-makers
by unpacking some of their major assumptions about humans, society,
knowledge, school and curriculum, and reveals the ideological underpinnings
of inherited differences in IQ and meritocracy which support this policy.
The study also examines the inequality of advantage of this form
of streaming. The findings of the pre-primary study and the study on
dropouts show that unnatural inequalities do affect the performance of
pupils in achievement tests and their desire to stay on in school.
The analysis of the planning and management of the change shows
that different reactions of principals, teachers and parents can have
different effects on pupil motivation and learning, with grave social implications.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">streaming</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.150311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The review of an innovation process in the Royal Australian Army Educational Corps</field><field name="creator">Sercombe, Wayne</field><field name="description">In 1983 there was a dramatic change in the activities of
the Royal Australian Army Educational Corps (RAAEC). From 1965
to 1983, the RAAEC satisfied the educational needs of soldiers in
the Regular Army by conducting the Australian Army Certificate of
Education Class 1 (AACE 1) and the Australian Army Certificate
of Education Class 2 (AACE 2). These courses were originally
designed to parallel civilian secondary school studies, and as a
result, the AACE program's structure, subject range and content
were similar to those of the civilian educational system. This
duplication was so complete that credit towards the AACE
qualifications was granted for secondary school studies at, or
above, Year 9.
In August 1983 the AACE program was replaced by a new
program of Army education. This program consisted of two courses
- Subject 3 Level 1 and Subject 3 Level 2. Whereas the AACE
courses were lengthy and included an extensive range of
subjects, the Subject 3 courses were of relatively short duration
and addressed only literacy and numeracy skills. As this change
was carefully planned and deliberately executed to better satisfy
the educational needs of soldiers, for the purposes of this field
study, it was described as an innovation - the Subject 3
innovation.
The study reported here reviewed the Subject 3 innovation
process. To ensure that the review was comprehensive, the
innovation process was examined from a number of different
perspectives. These included an historical description, an
analysis of the innovation strategy, a review of the curriculum
development tool and decision making, and a determination of the
process necessary to confirm and remediate any deficiencies in
the innovation process.
The outcomes of this review of the Subject 3 innovation
process gave cause to question the validity of many fundamental
characteristics of the Subject 3 courses, e.g. the scope of the
course content, the content validity of the terminal assessment
instruments, and the exit standards of the courses. The field
study concluded that there was an urgent need to conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the Subject 3 courses to verify and
correct these shortcomings.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Australian Army Educational Corps</field><field name="subject">RAAEC</field><field name="subject">innovation</field><field name="subject">courses</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.150734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity, patterns and processes of vegetation and invertebrate orders in natural temperate grassland in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Sarah</field><field name="description">The study aimed to gain understanding about diversity, patterns and processes in natural
temperate grassland sites in the ACT. Thirty natural grassland sites were surveyed for
plant composition, soil invertebrate abundance and site attributes. Floristic associations
were identified using multivariate analysis. These were compared to the other site
attributes to determine related characteristics.
Total plant species richness was 191 species, of which 41% were exotics. Forbs
comprised 56% of the total species, with 69 native forb species. There were 10 native
grass species and 12 sub-shrubs recorded. The number of species found within ten 1 m2
quadrats measured in each site ranged from 23 to 56 species.
Three floristic associations were identified through classification analysis using
frequency data. The Danthonia association occurred in well drained sites on soils with
high clay content and low nutrient levels and a greater percentage of bare ground. The
sites were assessed as having been subject to moderate to high disturbance in the past
and 46% were grazed and 46% mown. Species richness of both natives and exotics was
high (quadrat richness averaged 37 species, with 32.8% exotic cover in spring). The Wet
Themeda association occurred in poorly drained sites and had also been subject to
moderate to high disturbance; 67% of sites were grazed and 25% mown. Phosphorus
levels were higher in these sites and the acidity of the soil was also greater. Quadrat
richness averaged 39 species, with 35.5% exotic cover in spring. The Dry Themeda
association was well drained. These sites had a lower native and exotic diversity, with a
mean quadrat richness of 30 species, and 11.1% exotic species cover in spring, but a high
species richness in the sites (mean 65.4 species) and a high litter cover of 39.9%. All
have been subject to low disturbance and none were grazed. Phosphorus levels were low
(7.9 ppm). Wet Themeda grassland sites were more similar to Danthonia grassland sites
in terms of species occurrence and frequency than Dry Themeda grasslands, despite both
associations being dominated by Themeda australis. While trends emerged regarding
management and disturbance levels in the three associations, these were not major
differentiating attributes.
Invertebrates were collected from soil samples from the sites and identified to order
level. Twenty two orders were found, but only three orders, Acarina, Collembola and
Coleoptera, were sufficiently abundant to enable statistical tests to be undertaken.
Invertebrate order richness and abundance showed strong relationships with vegetation
attributes that measured or reflected vegetation structure, with higher abundance in sites
dominated by T. australis and where wet soil colour was darker. Both order richness and
total abundance of invertebrates were highest in mown sites and lowest in grazed sites.
The invertebrate order richness and abundance did not have significant relationships with
the floristic associations.
A field experiment was conducted in which above- and below-ground gaps were
created using the herbicide, Glyphosate, to remove interspecific competition and
comparing responses between the Dry Themeda and Danthonia associations. Litter load
and soil disturbance were also manipulated. The subsequent establishment of species
was studied over two growing seasons, a period of 18 months. Both native and exotic
forb richness and cover increased as a result of gap formation. Exotic grass cover and
richness showed a strong increase in the first season, but after 18 months had decreased
to levels similar to those prior to the application of treatments. Native grasses had not
recovered to pre-treatment levels after 18 months. Native forb richness and cover were
not inhibited by litter retention, but exotic forb richness and cover were higher in
treatments with litter removal. Soil disturbance to a depth of 20 mm had no significant
effect on the recruitment of the species.
Recommendations for protection and management of the sites were developed from the
study. Conservation recommendations are based on the aim of maintaining or enhancing
native species diversity and habitat, while protecting threatened species and their habitat.
Management plans should recognise requirements based on the floristic associations,
diversity of native species, drainage conditions and retention of invertebrate habitat,
including structural requirements. Grazing should be retained as a viable management
regime, particularly in sites where small species occur. Future research should aim
towards a greater understanding of the effects of management on species diversity,
including invertebrates, and include a monitoring component with which to determine if
management actions should be modified.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">grassland</field><field name="subject">species diversity</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">invertebrates</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.151320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spacetime initial data and quasispherical coordinates</field><field name="creator">Sharples, Jason</field><field name="description">In General Relativity, the Einstein field equations allow us to study the evolution of a
spacelike 3-manifold, provided that its metric and extrinsic curvature satisfy a system of
geometric constraint equations. The so-called Einstein constraint equations, arise as a
consequence of the fact that the 3-manifold in question is necessarily a submanifold of
the spacetime its evolution defines.
This thesis is devoted to a study of the structure of the Einstein constraint system in
the special case when the spacelike 3-manifold also satisfies the quasispherical ansatz of
Bartnik [B93]. We make no mention of the generality of this gauge; the extent to which
the quasispherical ansatz applies remains an open problem.
After imposing the quasispherical gauge, we give an argument to show that the resulting
Einstein constraint system may be viewed as a coupled system of partial differential
equations for the parameters describing the metric and second fundamental form. The
hencenamed quasisperical Einstein constraint system, consists of a parabolic equation, a
first order elliptic system and (essentially) a system of ordinary differential equations.
The question of existence of solutions to this system naturally arises and we provide a
partial answer to this question. We give conditions on the initial data and prescribable
fields under which we may conclude that the quasispherical Einstein constraint system is
uniquley solvable, at least in a region surrounding the unit sphere.
The proof of this fact is centred on a linear iterative system of partial differential equations,
which also consist of a parabolic equation, a first order elliptic system and a system of
ordinary differential equations. We prove that this linear system consistently defines a
sequence, and show via a contraction mapping argument, that this sequence must converge
to a fixed point of the iteration. The iteration, however, has been specifically designed
so that any fixed point of the iteration coincides with a solution of the quasispherical
Einstein constraints.
The contraction mapping argument mentioned above, relies heavily on a priori estimates
for the solutions of linear parabolic equations. We generalise and extend known results
111
concerning parabolic equations to establish special a priori estimates which relate a useful
property: the L2-Sobolev regularity of the solution of a parabolic equation is greater
than that of the coefficients of the elliptic operator, provided that the initial data is
sufficiently regular. This 'smoothing' property of linear parabolic equations along with
several estimates from elliptic and ordinary differential equation theory form the crucial
ingredients needed in the proof of the existence of a fixed point of the iteration.
We begin in chapter one by giving a brief review of the extensive literature concerning
the initial value problem in General Relativity. We go on, after mentioning two of the
traditional methods for constructing spacetime initial data, to introduce the notion of a
quasispherical foliation of a 3-manifold and present the Einstein constraint system written
in terms of this gauge.
In chapter two we introduce the various inequalities and tracts of analysis we will make use
of in subsequent chapters. In particular we define the, perhaps not so familiar, complex
differential operator 9 (edth) of Newman and Penrose.
In chapter three we develop the appropriate Sobolev-regularity theory for linear parabolic
equations required to deal with the quasispherical initial data constraint equations. We
include a result due to Polden [P] here, with a corrected proof. This result was essential
for deriving the results contained in the later chapters of [P], and it is for this reason we
include the result. We don't make use of it explicitly when considering the quasispherical
Einstein constraints, but the ideas employed are similar to those we use to tackle the
problem of existence for the quasispherical constraints.
Chapter four is concerned with the local existence of quasispherical initial data. We
firstly consider the question of existence and uniqueness when the mean curvature of
the 3-manifold is prescribed, then after introducing the notion of polar curvature, we also
present another quasispherical constraint system in which we consider the polar curvature
as prescribed. We prove local existence and uniqueness results for both of these alternate
formulations of the quasispherical constraints.

curriculum in listening comprehension, especially for
training Chinese EFL (English as a Foreign Language)
students. The paper is concerned with relating three
themes: why the emphasis should be laid on listening
practice, what strategies should be used to develop a
feasible curriculum and what factors should be considered
during the designing process. This study project
is intended to be useful to both Chinese EFL teachers
in search of a listening curriculum and the students
who need ear training in EFL study. The basic aims,
objectives and scope of the study are explained in the
Introduction.
The first chapter presents an overview of existing
difficulties and problems in developing the aural abilities
of the Chinese EFL students. In Chapter 2, the
importance of establishing clear and definite teaching
aims is discussed and two basic aims of teaching listening
comprehension are suggested according to the students'
needs in their communication with native speakers and in
their further study of EFL. Chapters 3 and 4 are concerned
with choosing and sequencing the course content.
Criteria of selecting materials and of classifying unit
aims and objectives are studied in an attempt to find a
way of teaching listening skills in a systematic manner.
Chapter 5 outlines the main teaching activities and
strategies of achieving the established objectives.
The final chapter is devoted to the discussion of establishing
an evaluation procedure throughout the whole
designing process, with stress put on testing students'
progress and the results of their learning. The whole
content of the study is summarized through a suggested
curriculum model in the Conclusion.
In the process of study, theoretical concepts and
linguistic principles basic to understanding spoken
English are discussed and used as a reasonable basis for
the curriculum. It is intended that this field study
will contribute in some way to curriculum design in
Listening comprehension, a facet of TEFL which has seldom
been systematically treated in China.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">listening comprehension</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">English as a Foreign Language</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.152657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of equivalence and non-equivalence in selected areas of English and Chinese lexis</field><field name="creator">Shimin, Zhang</field><field name="description">This study aims to discuss equivalence and non-equivalence in
some selected areas of English and Chinese lexis and their impact upon
teaching, learning and translating. Attempts have been made to state
the causes of lexical equivalence and non-equivalence and raise and
solve some difficulties and problems arising particularly from nonequivalent
lexemes between English and Chinese.
As a subdiscipline of linguistics, contrastive linguistics is
concerned with the comparison of two or more languages or subsystems
of languages in order to determine the differences and similarities
between them. Based on a practical aim this study tries to provide a
model for the comparison and determine how and which lexemes are
comparable so as to explore the notion of equivalence and non-equivalence.
It is hoped to provide as much information as is possible in a
limited study of this kind on lexical comparison between the two
languages. It compares differences with examples, analyses some of the
problems arising from the errors made by the Chinese students, and
analyses their causes in the areas of noun, verb, preposition, compound
lexemes, reduplicative words and phrases, negation, polysemy, idiomatic
expressions and lexemes derived directly from the cultural background.
Finally some suggestions and considerations are made for those who
might have responsibility for designing courses to train interpreters,
translators or teachers.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interpreters</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">lexis</field><field name="subject">equivalence</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.153208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological appropriateness of EFL methodologies to Chinese students</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Shou-Juan</field><field name="description">With the increase in international communication
and the growing demand for foreign language professionals
in the last decade, the teaching of foreign languages,
especially English, has gained considerable prominence in
Chinese education. Despite the long history of English
teaching in China, there are still significant deficiencies
in this area. If these deficiencies are to be addressed,
then methodology is a crucial variable worthy of
examination.
Many of the TEFL (Teaching English as Foreign
Language) methods developed in the last twenty years are
unknown to the Chinese teachers, although they may be
introduced to China in the future. Since these methods are
products of Western experience, a scrutiny of their
relevance to the Chinese teaching situation is necessary.
In particular, it is important to focus on the
psychological appropriateness of these methods to the
Chinese setting.
A number of the most crucial psychological
issues, such as learner's motivation, aptitude, personality
and learning style, are discussed in CHAPTER 2, together
with those social and cultural influences which may affect
the learner's psychological attributes.
CHAPTER 3 provides a detailed, yet not exhaustive,
description of a range of TEFL methodologies, which may
provide potential solutions to the deficiencies that have
been identified. Here the emphasis is on psychological
theories that underlie these methods and on their
psychological impact on the learner.
CHAPTER 4 moves to a specific investigation of
the psychological attributes of Chinese students. To this
end, data have been obtained from a study specifically
designed for this paper, and used as a basis for evaluating
the motivation, personality, affect and learning style of
English majors at ERWAI (Peking Second Foreign Language Institute). This evaluation is further supplemented by the
views of foreign visitors to China and by the results of
some published studies of Chinese nationals in America.
Based on the discussion in the previous chapters,
the fifth and final chapter concludes with an overview of
the appropriateness of TEFL methodologies to the Chinese
situation.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">ERWAI</field><field name="subject">Peking Second Foreign Language Institute</field><field name="subject">teaching methods</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.153734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' perceptions of the communicative language teaching approach in a teacher training program in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Siahaan, Rosemary</field><field name="description">This study investigated the perceptions of teachers of the Junior High and the Senior

questionnaire, interview and field study were employed to collect the data. Interviews
and field study were carried out by the researcher in Indonesia. Spearman's rho was used
to correlate answers about teaching principles of CLT and chi-square tests were used to
examine responses on the relevance of subjects and the influence of the course on
professional knowledge and teaching skills. The participants' opinion on the most and the
least useful units was discussed based on the calculated frequency. The problems faced
by the participants in implementing CLT were analyzed. The benefits of CLT were
analysed and categorized into positive and negative points. Results indicated that both
teaching levels have positive perceptions on CLT. Both groups showed an overall
similarity in problems faced in their teaching, on the usefulness and the relevance of
units presented in the Teacher Training despite some minor differences. It is argued that
it is necessary for the teachers to give consideration to the teaching of vocabulary. It is
also desirable to train the teachers to design tests which are valid and reliable.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communicative Language Teaching</field><field name="subject">CLT</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Irian Jaya</field><field name="subject">communicative language teaching approach</field><field name="subject">teacher training program</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.154518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Civil remote sensing policy in Australia : a case study concerning the commercialisation of a government-developed technology</field><field name="creator">Siemon, Noel</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">civil remote sensing policy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">technology commercialisation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.154949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peer counselling in schools : an experimental study of human relations training in an A.C.T. high school</field><field name="creator">Simic, Ann</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of
a human relations programme for high school students in Years 7, 8
and 9. The programme, based on the course devised by Varenhorst (1976;
Appendix B), was run as a non-assessable option for one semester in an
A.C.T. high school by the author, who was the counsellor at the school,
and a volunteer teacher. Humanistic, behavioural and cognitive methods
of implementation were used.
As well as trying to achieve more effective interpersonal relations
between students, so that they could more successfully relate and resolve
differences, a secondary aim was to try to make the counsellor's role
a more preventative rather than a largely remedial and crisis-laden one.
Twenty-eight students enrolled for the course. Fourteen were
assigned to the experimental group and experienced the human relations
programme; the fourteen in the control group undertook a variety of
other options they had chosen. Both groups completed pre- and postquestionnaires
from which quantitative data was gathered. As a check
on these quantitative results, post-study qualitative data were also
gathered from the experimental group.
The course taught verbal and non-verbal communication skills,
decision-making and problem-solving skills, particularly in relation to
such areas as the peer group, the family and the school. The ethics
of helping others experiencing problems in any of these areas was an
integral part of the course.
iv
The study showed that human relations skills can be taught,
although the findings were interpreted cautiously because of design
and methodological difficulties. The lack of randomisation and
reported, rather than behavioural, change per se are two areas which
restrict the generalisability of the results.
It is suggested that, to achieve more widespread gains, such a
course could be incorporated into the existing pastoral care programme
of the school in which all teachers and students took part. It is
further suggested that, for optimal effectiveness, parents and teachers,
as well as students, would need to be aware of, and know how to put into
practice, the skills taught in this programme and relate them to interaction
generally.
A first step was made by the experimenter towards widening the role
of the school counsellor away from crisis cases towards prevention of
problems. Ideally, the programme could be expanded to include teachers
and parents who could, in turn, become human relations educators, thus
serving the whole student population.
The teaching, learning and practising of skill became the main focus
of the programme. Although some peer counselling was involved in assignments,
time precluded an experimental study of effectiveness in this
applied area. All students but one wanted to proceed with this practical
work.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">peer counselling</field><field name="subject">human relations training</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.155340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic human resource management : matching the reality to the rhetoric in the Australian Public Service</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Beverley</field><field name="description">This paper focuses on three main themes. Firstly, what is Strategic Human Resource
Management (SHRM) and the rhetoric surrounding it? Secondly, does the reality match
the rhetoric? Thirdly, is the model that has been adopted by the private sector an
appropriate model for the Australian public sector to be using?
HR has been criticised for being an administrative function that is regulatory and
compliance based, adding little value to an organisation. SHRM provides a strategic
focus, involving the partnering of HR and line areas to provide value added people
services. SHRM has been described by some theorists (Ulrich, Rothwell et al) as the
only way of the future for the HR function.
The model/s of SHRM that have been adopted by the private sector are now being
promoted by the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission as the way forward for
HR in the Australian Public Service.
This paper discusses the appropriateness of the SHRM model/s for the public sector by
examining what is happening in the HR area in three Commonwealth Government
departments: Health and Aged Care, Transport and Regional Services and Family and
Community Services. It examines the dilemmas for the HR functions as they try to move
to an SHRM approach in these organisations, and suggests models that are appropriate to
the public sector context.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Public Service</field><field name="subject">APS</field><field name="subject">strategic human resource management</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.155751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of graduates and non-graduates in diploma courses at Fiji Institute of Technology</field><field name="creator">Singh, Bijan</field><field name="description">This is the first study done to ascertain which factors
significantly determine graduation and non-graduation in the Diploma
courses at Fiji Institute of Technology.
It is a quantitative study and analyses of the effects
of the variables sponsored/private, entry level, race, grade point
average, course sex, age and rural/urban on graduation and
non-graduation.
The significance of this study lies in determining
which improvements are necessary in order to increase the number of
graduates and thus make more effective use of the physical and human
resources. Resource utilisation gains added importance because of
its national implications. The Diploma graduates are the main
source of middle level technical manpower for Fiji; a developing
country which since its independence in 1970, has made satisfactory
social, political and economic progress.
For the period under study, data analysis shows that
the percentage of students graduating was 40.8. Furthermore, the
major finding was that Government sponsored ethnic Indian male
students with New Zealand University Entrance as entry level,
belonging to the 24+ age group produced statistically significant
results.
It has been recommended that both the Fiji Institute of
Technology and the Government of Fiji should increase and strengthen
Government sponsorship of Diploma students. Fiji Institute of
Technology in consultation with industry should work out effective
strategies such as better supervision and the monitoring of
sponsored students' progress throughout the course and provision of
an increased variety of work experiences, in order to improve the
weaker areas of practical experience during the course.

It then
examines the reception, mainly favourable, of Shah's representation of
Sufism particulary in the West, and, finally, attempts to analyse and explain
his methodology.
It is not the aim of this thesis to examine the complete works of Idries Shah.
Rather, by studying a number of his texts I have endeavoured to emphasise
Shah's role as a pontifex between Islam and the West. As well as placing Shah
within the complicated realm of Sufi thought, I have examined in some
detail the methods by which he has played this role. The aspect of Shah that I
have focused upon is that of the populariser and explicator of Sufism. For
Shah the subject of Sufism is not one confined to academic study. It is a way
of knowing related to everyday life and particularly relevant to the needs of
the West at a time when the Western world is experiencing emotional and
spiritual bankruptcy. Shah resembles the deconstructionist theorists in that
he sees the limits of the language on which the West has relied for so long.
But, even though his method is similar to theirs, he differs from them in that
for him there is another realm of knowledge beyond language.
I have quoted extensively from the stories Shah uses in order to demonstrate
the ideas and images he thinks are relevant to an understanding of Sufism
for the West, and I have used reviews and comments from audiences in both
East and West in order to demonstrate what those audiences think of what
Shah is attempting to do. This thesis examines the pedagogical techniques
employed in this process. The applicablity of deconstruction theory to Sufi
teaching is considered.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sufism</field><field name="subject">Idries Shah</field><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">Islam</field><field name="subject">West</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.160942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feral buffalo in Kakadu National Park : survey methods, population dynamics and control</field><field name="creator">Skeat, Andrew</field><field name="description">(1) Aerial survey methods for estimating
population size of feral water buffalo in northern
Australia were examined.
(2) Line transect models underestimated population
size. Of six models tested the most accurate
underestimated by nearly half. The models give
biased estimates most probably because not all
animals on the survey line were sighted .
(3) Aerial strip transect surveys were also
negatively biased. The extent of this bias was
estimated in index-removal experiments.
Experiments were carried out on two populations in
areas of differing obstructive canopy cover.
(4) In woodland habitat with a canopy cover of 30-
60%, a correction factor of 3.2 was required to
take account of animals not seen. In forest
habitat with a canopy cover of 60-100%, a
correction factor of 4.9 was required.
(5) Using these results, the population size of
feral buffalo, cattle and horses in Kakadu National
Park was estimated by aerial survey at the end of
each year over 6 years. Annual rates of increase
for three regions of the Park were estimated,
taking into account known removals from the
population. The effects of dry season rainfall and
population density in the preceding year on rate of
increase were examined for each species.
(6) The mean annual exponential rate of increase
for each species was 0.10 yr-1 for buffalo, 0.23
yr-1 for cattle and -0.14 yr-1 for horses.
(7) The annual rates of increase varied greatly
between years within all species and were highly
correlated with dry season rainfall in the year of
survey for buffalo and cattle but not for horses.
(8) No significant effect of preceding density on
rate of increase was found for any species. A
large reduction in buffalo populations did not
correspond with an increase in unharvested
populations of horses, suggesting the two species
do not compete for food or other resources.
(9) A campaign to control populations of feral
water buffalo in Kakadu National Park was assessed.
Between 1979 and 1988, approximately 79,000 animals
were removed, 54% by commercial live-capture, 35%
by shooting from helicopters and 10% by shooting
from the ground.
(10) In the period 1983-1988 when population
estimates from aerial survey are available, mean
buffalo population density was reduced from
5.60 km-2 to 1.17 km-2 over the surveyed area of
the Park.
(11) The costs of removal by shooting from
helicopters, capturing animals alive and shooting
from the ground were compared. The mean costs per
animal in 1988 were $24.13, $74.53, and $86.02
respectively.
(12) The effects of initial density and time spent
shooting on number of animals removed by shooting
from helicopters were examined. One linear and two
curvilinear models were fitted to data from four
different removal exercises. The relationship
between time spent shooting and number removed was
best described by a curvilinear (Ivlev) function.
This model was used to estimate costs of control to
a specified density.
(13) Model regression coefficients differed
between removal exercises, suggesting that the
number removed may be affected by variables other
than time spent shooting and initial density. Data
from the range of conditions encountered during
removal is thus likely to be required for robust
estimation of removal costs.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feral buffalo</field><field name="subject">Kakadu National Park</field><field name="subject">NT</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">survey methods</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.161608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive style and social needs of academically gifted children</field><field name="creator">Skinner, Geraldine</field><field name="description">Most departmental policy statements on the education of gifted

school. In particular the objectives were to ascertain the
factors which influences teachers' knowledge of discipline
procedures and the factors which influence teachers'
implementation of discipline procedures.
The study first examined discipline policies and
practices in Australian schools generally and in Australian
Capital Territory government schools in particular. A review
of the literature indicated that the area of discipline in
the classroom is one which seems to be increasingly
important in the range of presage variables under
investigation by researchers.
Information was obtained from sixty completed
questionnaires from primary teachers in eight primary
schools. Respondents indicated that they taught over the
full range of primary school years/grades. Results suggested
that senior management in the schools appeared to have a
relatively unimportant role in influencing classroom
teachers' discipline programmes.
The results indicated that the in-school influences
which were perceived as the most influential on both
teachers' knowledge of discipline procedures and on
teachers' current discipline procedures were a) those
connected with pupils and b) factors about the personal
preference of teachers.
The out-of-school influences which were perceived as
the most influential on both teachers' knowledge of
discipline and on teachers' current discipline procedures
were a) those connected with professional development and b)
factors about the intuitions and reactions of teachers.
Results in general suggested that some primary
teachers may be depending or) outdated information regarding
school and classroom discipline programmes. These findings
could have important ramifications for teacher training
agencies regarding the allocation of resources to the area
of school discipline programmes.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">classroom discipline</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">discipline policies</field><field name="subject">government schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.162433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change, conflict and control :  a case-study on the
               incorporation of the Neighbourhood Community Centre into the ACT government school system and its first year of operation as the Co-operative Peoples School</field><field name="creator">Smith, Libby</field><field name="description">This field study is an examination, by a partisan participant
observer, of the Neighbourhood Community Centre and its first year
of operation as the Co-operative Peoples School, in the ACT government
school system.
The Neighbourhood Community Centre was a small, alternative,
independent school for children from three to eight years of age. The
school's philosophy was progressive and its management policies and
structures co-operative and non-hierarchical. For two years, parents
campaigned to become part of the ACT government school system. In
February 1978, the school opened as a government school, with funding
and staffing arrangements similar to other schools in the ACT.
Soon after incorporation, the distinctive attributes of the
Neighbourhood Community Centre began to disappear. Conflict became
the dominant characteristic of the new school: the degree, extent
and duration were extreme for a group that had asserted a commitment
to consensus and co-operation. Two identifiable and, ultimately,
irreconciliable parent factions emerged.
Three factors were linked in the events of 1978: conflict,
ideology and power struggles in a situation of change. These factors
do not easily fit into the dominant sociological paradigm, functionalism,
as an explanation of the events of 1978, for the concept of power has
been, at best, slow to be incorporated into that sociological tradition.
Yet the events, to this observer, were linked to a political struggle
between competing groups for the domination of the school: power was
a major dimension. Only at a superficial level was the conflict
ideological.
Parent factions concealed a third group, the teachers, who
were striving to dominate the school, a domination that was not
accepted unequivocally in the new school. Their ultimate success
depended not on their coalition with a parent faction, the support
of the Schools Office, strategies for isolating criticism and critics
and their professional ideology; their success depended on their
structural power within the school system which provided resources,
support and justification for their position.
This analysis endorses sociological theorists who maintain that
power, and structural power in particular, is a central concern in
organisational life. The failure of the Co-operative Peoples School
was linked to the unequal distribution of power within the co-operative.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neighbourhood Community Centre</field><field name="subject">government school system</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">Co-operative Peoples School</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.162917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and secondary teacher training at Goroka Teachers' College, Papua New Guinea, 1979-1984</field><field name="creator">Warner Smith, Penny</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">secondary teacher training</field><field name="subject">GTC</field><field name="subject">Goroka Teachers' College</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.163320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internship in paper conservation at the National Library of Australia, Canberra, 1983-1984</field><field name="creator">Smith, Wendy</field><field name="description">This dissertation describes the work carried out by me in the

Conservation activities at the Library are organised in three
broad categories, with the following goals:
. preparation for exhibitions
. ongoing full conservation of the Library collections, in a
staged process
. methods development and materials investigation.
The internship program was devised to allow time to be spent
in each of these three areas. The amount of time spent in each
area roughly reflected the allocation of conservation staff
resources to each section at that time.
In the exhibitions program, objects were prepared for
display at the National Gallery of Australia. These included
watercolours and hand-coloured prints.
Under the ongoing conservation program, a wide range of
paper objects were treated. Objects from the Library's Special
Collections are treated in order of priority determined by
Librarian staff. Works treated included newspapers, both bound
and unbound, movie posters, and magazines.
Work in the third area involved both routine testing method's
of conservation materials, involvement in a phase preservation
project, and investigations into new methods of preventive
conservation.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paper conservation</field><field name="subject">National Library of Australia</field><field name="subject">internship</field><field name="subject">Preservation Services Branch</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.163837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of the literature used by researchers in  Indonesian economics, Indonesian agricultural development   economics, and Indonesian demography at the Australian National

the characteristics of the literature of Indonesian
Economics, Indonesian Agricultural Development Economics,
and Indonesian Demography.
The data used are the references made by Ph.D.
and master's candidates in these three subject fields
in their theses, which were submitted to the Australian
National University during the period from 1971 to 1981.
At first the references were examined according
to four researcher groups : Ph.D.'s in Indonesia Economics
(Ph.D Indec); Masters of Agricultural Development
Economics (MADE), with Indonesia as the subject area;
Ph. D.'s in Demography (PhD Demog), with Indonesia as
the subject area; Masters of Arts in Demography ( MAD ),
with Indonesia as the subject area. The results indicate
that the literature referred to by the four researcher
groups has many of the same characteristics, as well as/
a high degree of relationship amongst them. Therefore,
the references made by the four researcher groups were
combined.
In total, there were 5235 references from 42
theses. It was found that 54.48% of the references were
to monographs and 44.85% were to serials. Academic
research centres, which contributed 21.32% to the literature
of the four researcher groups, constituted the
major source' institution, slightly above the contribution
of commercial publishers. The United States
was the most important source country, contributing
35.28%; and Indonesia was the second most important,
contributing 25.86%. The main language used was English,
accounting for 82.35% with Indonesian the second,
accounting for 15.01%. Materials of up to 10 years
old accounted for 68.41% of the total.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian National University</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">researchers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.165156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing social competence in complimenting behaviour among Indonesian learners of English</field><field name="creator">Soenarso, Lany Idawati</field><field name="description">The study consists of five chapters. The first chapter
gives a brief description of how English as a foreign language is taught in Indonesia and the need to improve the
social competence of Indonesian speakers of English so that
they will be regarded as competent speakers in social
interaction. Language competence, including the notion of
linguistic competence, together with the notions of
communicative competence and social competence, is discussed
in the second chapter, since it underlies the language
learner's knowledge and ability to create and maintain a
harmonious atmosphere in social interaction. Furthermore,
the theory of communicative competence will include
competency in sociocultural rules of use which will specify
the ways in which utterances are produced and understood
appropriately with respect to the components of
communicative events outlined by Hymes. Speech act theory,
particularly as it relates to complimenting behaviour is
discussed.
Chapter three reviews research on complimenting behaviour
and considers some possible reasons why Indonesians do not
pay as many compliments as Australians do. Ways of
perceiving face - threatening acts and politeness are
related to different cultures with different social values
because of their different traditions, experience, ways of
development and ways of thinking. Developing from these
considerations of theory and research, the fourth chapter
describes the study project which deals with what counts as
a compliment in Indonesian and Australian English, what to
compliment about and how people compliment as well as how
people accept and respond to compliments. Analysis of some
problems caused by lack of awareness of the differences
between cultures and the effects of applying ones own
strategy in complimenting behaviour, leading to
misunderstanding, are also discussed. In the final chapter,
the results of the project suggest what Indonesian learners
of English need to be taught to help students develop social
competence in complimenting behaviour. Suggestions for
improving the social competence of Indonesian speakers of
English are made.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Indonesian</field><field name="subject">social competence</field><field name="subject">complimenting behviour</field><field name="subject">cultural awareness</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.165724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pers Pancasila in Indonesia : an analysis of three Indonesian dailies Kompas, Pelita and the Jakarta Post between               1987-1991</field><field name="creator">Solikhati, Siti</field><field name="description">There has been an on-going debate in Indonesia about
the implementation of the policy of Pers Pancasila between
the press and the government. Therefore, this study will
examine the extent to which both socio-cultural and sociopolitical
factors influence the policy of Pers Pancasila as
it actually operates. It aims to help understand why such a
debate exists and why it is likely to continue.
Using mainly a qualitative content analysis, this
thesis examines reporting in the three Indonesian daily
papers Kompas, Pelita, and The Jakarta Post between 1987-
1991. Four major news categories -news the press, religion,
development, and Pancasila issues- are defined as being
relevant to understanding the implementation of Pers
Pancasila policies. Quantitative analysis is used by
counting the frequency of the news as well as measuring the
space of each news. In addition, qualitative analysis is
applied by adopting the news-as-narrative approach used by
scholars such as Entman, Ettema, and Glasser.
Taking 180 editions of the three papers as a sample,
this study finds that there were significant differences in
the way the three papers reported the four selected news
categories. Certain papers are found to be more critical in
reporting certain news than the others. The affiliation of
of each paper, to some extent, influences the attitudes of
each paper. Pelita is affiliated to other Islamic papers,
The Jakarta Post is affiliated to Christian papers which are
in favour of the government, Kompas (the Christian based
paper) sees itself as a neutral paper which represents the
voice of the people.
Although there have been disagreements on certain
issues, such as in reporting news about development and
Pancasila, the three papers were found to consistently apply
the policy of Pars Panpasila. The papers are aware that
although the government does not have direct means of
controlling press reporting, it still has a range of
control mechanisms which substantially determines the scope
of Indonesian press freedom. Due to Indonesian cultural
diversity, the government pursues a 'free responsible' press
theory in that the press should have self-censorship.
However, there has been different interpretations made by
the press and the government about this policy which often
cause misunderstandings.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pers Pancasila</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Indonesian dailies Kompas</field><field name="subject">Pelita</field><field name="subject">Jakarta Post</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.170537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation) to

two pastoral land uses - commercial properties and "hobby farms" in
Murrumbateman. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the USLE
components. Sediment measurement in farm dams was taken to estimate
sediment yield from several sites, as an alternative approach to study soil
loss. The annual soil loss from entire study area was 0.25 t/ha/year whilst
these figures from commercial properties and hobby farms were 0.29
t/ha/year and 0.21 t/ha/year, respectively. The annual average sediment
yield from three catchments in hobby farms was 0.3 t/ha/year. The USLE
was found to be highly sensitive to slope steepness, ground cover and
stocking rates. The critical values were 16% for slopes, 35% for the ground
cover and 19 Dry Sheep Equivalent/ha for stocking rate. I tentatively
conclude that the USLE is sufficiently sensitive to detect differences in soil
loss between the two land uses. There is, however, a need to improve the
operation of the model in some respects. The use of farm dams for
estimating sediment yield also shows promise.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">USLE</field><field name="subject">Universal Soil Loss Equation</field><field name="subject">hobby farms</field><field name="subject">commercial pastoral properties</field><field name="subject">Murrumbateman</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.171337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linguistic and cultural problems in interpreting between Chinese and English</field><field name="creator">Song-qin, Li</field><field name="description">Recent years have witnessed many developments in using
a communicative approach in language teaching, but Little
has yet been mentioned about how to teach interpretation,
which is an important skill for many Chinese students of
English.
Interpreting involves a variety of complex tasks, such
as the acquiring of language proficiency, general knowledge,
cultural knowledge, and specific interpreting skills, among
which linguistic knowledge is a prerequisite for the study
of interpreting, and cultural knowledge is of equal importance.
The analysis of grammatical errors and cultural mistakes
made by Chinese interpreters indicates that errors and mistakes
are often recorded in areas where there is a significant
difference between the languages and cultures of English
and Chinese-speakers. Such analysis also demonstrates that
many errors and mistakes are attributed to interlingual or
intralingual transfer in addition to idiosyncrasy, and to
using the culture of the source language community as the
norm in linguistic and paralinguistic behaviour. The
errors and mistakes made can be traced to a lack of both
linguistic competence and communicative competence.
As the interpreter is an intermediary in communication
between an addresser and an addressee, the quality of his
output has considerable impact on the rendering of the
message. Therefore, in order to avoid possible errors
and mistakes which might impede communication, it seems
necessary to add to the existing curriculum of interpreting
in China such courses as will enable future interpreters
to acquire both linguistic competence and communicative
competence. The study of culture, which used to be
neglected in the interpreting curriculum in China, must
be seen as an indispensable component in the curriculum.
The understanding of some aspects of the culture of
English speakers can be facilitated by a communicative
approach to language teaching, by the use of a large
amount of culture-based authentic materials, and by the
introduction of specific techniques usually needed in
interpreting.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">language teaching</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">communicative approach</field><field name="subject">interpreting</field><field name="subject">linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061108.172103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">College course selections years 11 and 12 : students' aspirations and ultimate career choice</field><field name="creator">Soustal, F. G.</field><field name="description">This field study aims to identify and examine the consequences and
influences of course selections and career choices made by students,
their parents and college staff. Because of a lack of information
regarding the implications of their selected programmes of study,
many students choose unwisely and as a result, have become confused
about the relevance of their choices in relation to the achievement
of their ultimate career aspirations. To achieve the aims of this
study, an analysis of the course selections and career choices of the
Year 12 graduates of 1983 from Copland College was completed.
This field study is divided into three main sections. The first
section comprises Chapters I and II which outline the historical
development of secondary colleges within the Australian Capital
Territory. The author briefly discusses the influence of both the
Hughes and the Campbell Reports and illustrates how these Reports
were used as the basis for the establishment of the educational
structure we now have for our senior secondary college students in
Canberra. In addition, this section details the historical background
of careers education within the Australian Capital Territory
and the influences this has had on the status of career education
at Copland College.
The second section covers Chapters III, IV and V. In this section
the function of the Student Services Faculty within Copland College
is discussed and also a brief explanation given of the type of
information gathered by college and administrative staff for career
and course advice. The author provides a description of the procedures
II
used to obtain and collate the information collected for this field
study. A questionnaire method of data collection was the basis used
to examine the post-collegiate activities of over 240 graduate
students of 1983, and part of the questionnaire relates specifically
to the destinations of these ex-students.
Finally, the third section incorporates Chapters VI and VII. It
details the results of my research covered in earlier chapters and
at the same time, synthesizes that of other educationalists as
it relates to this field study. The concluding portion of this
section sets out recommendations proposed to meet the problems
identified in such areas as student course selections and careers

eliminating post-rest warm-up decrement (WUD) in the volleyball serve, and to assess
whether individual differences in imagery ability mediated any possible reductions in WUD.
Thirty-nine State level volleyball players were placed into one of 3 groups, High Imagery,
Control, and Low Imagery, based on their scores on the Vividness of Movement Imagery
Questionnaire (VMIQ). Players served 15 balls at a designated target area, rested for 10
minutes, and then attempted 5 more serves. During the last 2 minutes of the rest period, the
players in the High and Low Imagery groups engaged in imagery of successful serving every
10 seconds, for a total of 12 repetitions. The Control group continued to read a magazine
article. To ensure adherence to the imagery instructions, players were evaluated at
completion of testing. Results revealed the High Imagery group was significantly better on
serving performance post-rest, however there was no significant differences when
comparing the mean of the last 3 pre-rest trials with the first post-rest trial. The interaction
approached significance (p_= .091) and suggested that the High Imagery group may have
benefited from the use of imagery. These findings have implications for the Nacson and

the effectiveness of a series of perceptual training
and drawing lessons on the drawing behaviour
of children of eight years of age, in year three
classes in some South Australian middle income
schools. A literature search revealed that the
drawing behaviour of children is responsive to
perceptual training and drawing classes, and
furthermore that an improvement in drawing ability
has resulted from such programmes. Children
of eight years of age were selected for two reasons.
Their drawing development has generally become
schematic, which means that a certain degree
of stereotyping is used in their drawing. And
in addition the perceptual development of eight
year olds is considered by many perceptual theorists
to be sufficiently advanced for a series of training
lessons. Also as a result of perceptual development
children of eight years of age are able to participate
in a drawing test which involves the drawing
of objects or models based on the observation
of such objects or models.
A pretest-posttest with control group design
was used in this study. The experimental and
control groups were selected from a sufficiently
large sample of schools. The groups selected
were randomly assigned to be experimental or
control groups in the study. A Salome modified
drawing test was administered to each experimental
and control group in the study. This drawing
test which consisted in the subjects being required
to draw three objects, was administered as a
pretest and a posttest to all groups by the researcher.
The experimental groups received a treatment
which consisted of six weekly sessions involving
perceptual training and drawing exercises. The
control group continued with their normal art
lessons with their class teacher. The test drawings
were scored by three judges on a Salome modified
rating scale. A scoring procedure was devised
so that the judges were unaware whether the drawings
to be scored were pretest, or posttest, control
group or experimental group.
The following statistical tests were conducted
on the drawing scores using an SPSS computer
programme:
a t-test for age
a t-test to determine whether there was
a significant difference between the mean
scores of the experimental and the control
groups.
an analysis of variance to determine
whether there was a significant difference
between the gain scores of the experimental
and control groups.
- and Pearson Product Moment Correlation
Coefficients for rater inter-reliability.
All statistical tests demonstrated that the experimental
groups gained significantly higher posttest
drawing scores. All statistical tests produced
results as the 0.05 level of significance.
The implications for curriculum design, and the
practice of teaching drawing in primary schools,
are that interventionist drawing programmes of
the kind used in this study do aid drawing development.
Drawing is a basic skill in art, thus a perceptual
training and drawing programme which aids drawing
development will also improve other modes of
artistic expression.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perceptual training</field><field name="subject">drawing lessons</field><field name="subject">SA</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">drawing development</field><field name="subject">artistic expression</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.081759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public sector reforms and gendered organisation</field><field name="creator">Smeaton, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This study approaches the study of organisational communication in
the Australian public sector by focussing on the gendered nature of the
organisation, and presenting results from the grass roots or 'native'
level (Gregory, 1983).
The theoretical framework of this study draws on a diverse range of
philosophical viewpoints, ranging from organisational communication
and culture approaches, sociological perspectives, public sector
research, and uniquely Australian conceptualisations of gender within
the public sphere. This study introduces a new way of conceiving
feminist bureaucrats (femocrats), in terms of their relationships with
'natives' within public sector organisations.
Difficulties in identifying a distinctly Australian organisational
communication arena result from both the paucity of organisational
communication, grass roots, and public sector research, and because of
the problematic task of assimilating 'bits' of divergent theories, with
often incompatible views to inform one comprehensive theoretical
framework.
The results of focus group and individual interviews suggest that a
'managerial' culture exists both within and externally to public sector
organisations. This managerialism originates from within patriarchal
and masculine organisational structures, and from a shift of workplace
practices where a public service model has been replaced by a more
private sector, bottom line, results orientation.
While the 'natives' in this study are not representative of all public
sector employees, their discourse provides a glimpse into the concerns
of grass roots members of organisations, a view that is significant in its
absence from organisational communication research, particularly in
the Australian context.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational communication</field><field name="subject">public sector</field><field name="subject">reform</field><field name="subject">gendered organisation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.082301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pulse diagnosis in traditional acupuncture</field><field name="creator">Smith, Andrew</field><field name="description">The process of pulse diagnosis was examined in a
sample of 100 patients randomly selected from the

pulses (as utilised in traditional Chinese
medicine), diagnostic criteria (as described in
traditional Chinese medicine), acupuncture points
selected and patient comments after each treatment
were coded into a numerical format suitable for
stepwise multiple regression and crosstabulation

The analysis indicated that the interpretation of
pulse qualities predicted the diagnostic criteria

acupuncture. The selection of acupuncture points
could not be predicted from the diagnostic
criteria when using pulse diagnosis. Additionally
the analysis indicated that the patient comments
after acupuncture were independent of the initial
patient symptoms.
More research is needed to more fully understand

behaviour of health researchers at the National Institute of Health Research and
Development, Ministry of Health, Indonesia. Its objective was to identify the
relationship between information needs/information seeking behaviour and the
characteristics of those health professionals. Those characteristics include institution
to which health professionals belonged, institution geographic location, level of
appointment, level of education, and work experience.
Research was carried out through survey by using a questionnaire. This survey
obtained a response rate of 92 percent from a sample of 131 health professionals.
Their information needs/information seeking behaviour were correlated with their
characteristics to determine relationships, and the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse the data. Frequency distribution, chi-square
analysis, and descriptive analysis were used to obtain the results.
The study found that the health information available did not match the health
professionals' needs and that there was strong demand by these personnel for automated
information services. It also found that total hours reading per week was significantly
related to level of appointment, level of education, and work experience at other
institutions. The perceived usefulness of journals as information sources was
significantly related to institution, geographic location, level of appointment, level of
education and work experience at other institutions. Government publications and
statistical data as a source of information were found to be related significantly to
institution and geographic location. There was also a relationship between the
perceived value of reference books and work experience at the current institution. The
usefulness of library catalogues as a guide to information was found to be related
significantly to institution and geographic location, as was the usefulness of abstracting
and indexing services to level of education. Frequency of visiting libraries was
significantly related to institution, geographic location and level of appointment. The
membership of professional organizations and obtaining useful information from
friends, colleagues or personal contact were found to be significantly related to level of
education.
The study concludes with recommendations and suggestions for further research.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information needs</field><field name="subject">information seeking behaviour</field><field name="subject">health researchers</field><field name="subject">National Institute of Health Research and Development</field><field name="subject">Ministry of Health</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.083237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching English as a second language to children in primary schools in the Canberra/Queanbeyan area</field><field name="creator">Steel, John</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">second language</field><field name="subject">English</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">Canaberra</field><field name="subject">Queanbeyan</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.083818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactive video</field><field name="creator">Steele, James</field><field name="description">Interactive video is a new method of instruction which
has great potential. Already, the techniques developed
are being used effectively by companies with training
and information dissemination needs covering large and
diverse organisations.
This Field Study is an attempt to explore the
possibilities interactive video has for education.
Since the techniques are new and still developing
quickly, it was necessary to spend a significant amount
of time learning about the possibilities for the medium
and developing new techniques for the particular
application described in this Report.
There are a number of facets to the development of a
learning package which uses new technology and new
techniques. All these facets must be explored to make
sure the techniques incorporated in the package being
developed fit together properly, to make the learner's
experience an effective one.
Video production, computer programming, computer
assisted instruction and subject matter expertise are
the major facets of interactive video, and all have had
to be explored to some degree in this Study. For the
writer, a media producer with mainly film and video
production experience, video production on its own was
not a great problem, but computer programming and
computer assisted instruction techniques, and the
integration of all the various elements of the package,
was new ground. Subject matter expertise beyond the
writer's skills was available from other sources.
This Report covers the development of the Study from
the investigation of interactive video as a new
technology, through an exploration of the techniques
required to produce materials for it, finally to the
development of an experimental package designed to give
the writer some practical skills in the use of
interactive video, and insight into its usefulness as a
medium of instruction in a practical setting.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interactive video</field><field name="subject">video instruction</field><field name="subject">educational technology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.084302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental sensitisation : a proposal for a shift in emphasis in environmental education</field><field name="creator">Stenhouse, John E.</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with the design, justification

library displays: a display with books only, called Display, and a display with books,
posters, models, copy, and realia, called Display +. The effectiveness of these displays
was to be measured in two ways: a) through the observation of the attaction power,
holding power and viewer participation in a display and b) through measuring the
circulation of displayed books.
Before commencing the study a literature search was conducted. The result of the
literature search yielded four authors, Goldhor (1972; 1981), Aguilar (1983), Watson
(1985), and Baker (1986), who had researched the relationship between circulation and
displays. Each of these studies used the measurable effect of circulation increasing,
decreasing or remaining constant to determine the effect of the display. This present study
used a similar methodology and monitored the circulation of books on both types of
displays. However, this study sought to go beyond the effect of circulation in determining
the effectiveness of displays because the previous studies had not taken into account the
library user who is affected by the display but is unable to borrow a book from the
display. The literature search turned towards the area of museum exhibits and displays
and the methodology employed to evaluate these exhibits and displays. Shettel (1968),
Warren (1972), Screven (1976), Linn (1976), Clowes and Wolfe (1980), and Miles
(1982) used attraction and holding power as measures of museum exhibit and display
effectiveness. Similarly, library users can be attracted and their attention held by library
displays. To the variables of attraction and holding power this study added the variable of
participation, picking up books or other items in the display not necessarily with the intent
of borrowing the books. In order to construct a Display + and control as far as possible
the elements in the display a literature search of books and articles relating to the design
elements of displays was conducted, and findings applied in the construction of the
display.
Shettel's (1968) methodology of unobtrusive observation was employed in this
study with the added benefit of videotaping the observations. The hypotheses were set out
in three groups, those relating to a single display, those comparing the effectiveness of
Display and Display +, and those relating to circulation.
The results of this study found in general that the attraction power of Display +
exceeded the attraction power of Display but the holding power and participation in
Display was greater than that of Display + indicating that the designer of library displays
should pay particular attention to the purpose of displays in their libraries. The results of
the circulation hypothesis confirmed the results of Goldhor (1972;1981), Aguilar (1983),
Watson (1985), and Baker (1986) that more books circulated when they were displayed
than when they were on the library shelves.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school library displays</field><field name="subject">library design</field><field name="subject">Display +</field><field name="subject">Display Plus</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.085234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some younbg men's discourses on coping</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Matthew F.</field><field name="description">My interest in coping and survival of young men is my main motivation for
undertaking the field study which this thesis describes. It developed from my concern at the
continuing high level of young male suicide. I begin with some background discussion which
shows some examples of how the community has been informed, particularly on youth
suicide, by reviewing some of the media and government attention to these issues.
Because suicidal behaviour is a gendered social phenomenon, this is followed by a
discussion of some of the problems inherent in the hegemonic masculinity of young men. I
then set out the underlying assumptions, the purpose, aims and theoretical framework of the
study. The main theoretical underpinnings of the study are the theory of poststructuralism, as
explained by the noted writer on gender and education, Bronwyn Davies. The other major
components are Aaron Antonovsky's concepts of Salutogenesis and the Sense of
Coherence. Minor but nevertheless important reference is also made to Edward Sampson's
idea of the dialogic nature of the self.
Following this are two critical reviews of relevant literature. The first addresses
studies of resiliency and coping, while the second examines papers given at recent
Australian conferences on suicide prevention.
Following that I describe the methodology of the study before undertaking an
analysis and interpretation of selected transcripts of interviews.
This is an exploratory attempt at applying postructuralist discourse analysis to the
social problem of male coping skills and male youth suicide. The results describe various
discourses young men used in unstructuied interviews to explain how they cope when they
feel down or depressed.
The main conclusion from the results is that formation of small, confidential,
supportive discussion groups for marginalised young men can be useful for sharing and
developing coping skills and improving their management of stressors, which are everpresent
in the environment. It is argued that the proliferation of such support groups for
young men could have long term benefits in reducing the statistics of young male suicide by
encouraging young men to share their techniques or behaviours of coping with their peers.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">survival</field><field name="subject">youth suicide</field><field name="subject">young men</field><field name="subject">male coping skills</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.085803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of three-dimensional art works made by adults on children's construction of three-dimensional form</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Robyn</field><field name="description">Many studies of children's learning in Art education have focused

would affect the way the child perceived and constructed threedimensional

frames of reference related to the problem confronting the child.
The development of perceptual differentiation skills and perceptual,
manipulative and conceptual modes of learning underpin this
investigation.
Four intact classrooms of 12 year olds were studied and the
results were examined by a panel of judges. A rating scale
devised by the author was applied to each model. The scale was
designed to measure five aspects of three-dimensional form.
Results indicated that three-dimensional art works made by adults

describe some high school classrooms in terms of such
physical features as lighting, acoustics, thermal
comfort, furniture design and spatial arrangements. It
also sought to explore the possible associations between
student seating preference and such "ecological features".
The study first tried to confirm some previous
research findings with regard to the existence of "zones
of participation", associated with student personality
traits including academic ability. The researcher then
explored whether the "physical conditions" prevalent in
classrooms were as much the determinants of student
seating choice, as much as the student's personality
traits and relationships with his peers and teachers. It
further sought to confirm whether seat selection was
consistent and to explore whether it was characterised by
a range of factors which could be identified and
classified. The study lastly aimed to obtain anecdotal
data about the students' perceptions of their classroom
environments.
Information was obtained from one thousand and
eighty-six completed questionnaires from students in
years seven to ten, in two different types of classroom,
in two separate high schools in the Australian Capital
Territory.
The results in general supported previous
findings regarding associations between central and
peripheral seating locations and a student's personality
traits and academic achievement level. The results,
furthermore, suggested some possible dependence upon the
classroom's dimensions and opportunity for teacherstudent
eye contact as a crucial factor in the
relationship between seating location and student
achievement level.
The data further confirmed that a number of
physical as well as social factors were determinants of a
student's choice of seat. These factors were found to be
consistently identifiable over various age groups, in
different kinds of classroom, in different subject areas
and between separate schools. The anecdotal data further
established the degree of concern and importance
attributed to the physical environment by the students.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school classrooms</field><field name="subject">physical environment</field><field name="subject">seating</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.093002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the readjustment experience for secondary exchange students : a family perspective</field><field name="creator">Stoeckel, Helen</field><field name="description">This study of the process of readjustment for secondary students returning home after
twelve months abroad was investigated from a family perspective. Although
researchers suggest that interactions between the student and others in the home
environment facilitate smooth readjustment, little is known about how the family relates
during this transition period.
In this study, the interactional dynamics within the family during the student's
readjustment were explored. Theoretical concepts from systems theory and family
developmental theory were used to further understanding of the interactional processes
within the family system.
A multiple single-case study research design was employed, where eight families were
interviewed at three points in time: one month before the student's return; one month
after the student's return: and at four to five months after return. All family members
were interviewed at each stage, using a semi-structured interview guide designed to
gather data about family relationships during this period.
Changes in family dynamics between siblings, the returnee student, and parents, were a
significant finding of this study, although these changes varied across families. A
family perspective of the readjustment process was collated from descriptive accounts
from family members, where four phases of the family experience could generally be
described: excitement, uncertainty, rediscovery and reorganisation of the family
system.
It was concluded that the study showed evidence that the readjustment process was
influenced by the interactions and interrelationships within the family, where not only
the student had changed but also the family.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">student readjustment</field><field name="subject">family dynamics</field><field name="subject">secondary exchange students</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.093814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A qualitative assessment of small business establishment</field><field name="creator">Stone, Kim</field><field name="description">A study of the nature of entrepreneurial activity

from high schools to a particular college in the A.C.T.
The stimulus for the study arose from the writer's perception
of problems being experienced by beginning college students and a
concern that these were in part due to the recent restructuring of
secondary education in the A.C.T.
The study investigated a number of areas affecting the
transition experiences of students moving from high schools to
Hawker College. A comparative study was undertaken of the various
curricula of the feeder high schools and of the College. Instruments
were devised to measure student's perceptions of their transition
experiences and of their orientation to the College. Interviews
were conducted with College and high school teachers, a random
selection of parents and some ex-students. The modified American
CUES questionnaire used by Whitta in Queensland formed the basis of
a study of environmental press in the high schools and College. An
analysis was also undertaken of the nature and extent of communication
between the high schools and College.
Results indicated that for most students the transition to the
College was short and relatively smooth, although not without
problems. However 10 to 15 per cent of students, particularly
those of lower ability and low motivation, were observed to have
experienced a difficult and often prolonged transition. Problems
for students arose from a sudden increase in the amount of freedom
given them, a significant rise in teachers' expectations of their
written language skills and their lack of self-organisational skills.
On the basis of the findings certain recommendations are made
aimed at increasing the communication between teachers in high
schools and the College and at improving the orientation of students
to the College. Other recommendations are concerned with easing the
transition of students, particularly those most likely to experience
transition problems.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">high school</field><field name="subject">college</field><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="subject">Hawker College</field><field name="subject">transition</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.104100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A summation of projects and experience as an intern at the Art Gallery of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Stryker, Mark D.</field><field name="description">During the period of internship at the Art Gallery of New South
Wales (March, 1982 - January 1983), I had the opportunity to work on
paintings from the 20th, 19th, 10th, and 17th centuries. Some of the
paintings were privately owned, and usually arrived at the Gallery in
much worse condition than any of the Gallery's paintings, therefore
I had the chance to carry out major treatments as well as the routine
minor treatments associated with the maintenance of a collection.
The atmosphere at the Gallery conservation facility is a healthy
one. The laboratory supports five fulltime conservators (Alan Lloyd,
Peter Gill, Gill McMillan, Susie Bioletti, and Ranson Davies). All
the members of staff were willing participants in helping and advising
me during my period of internship. The contact with so many points of
view and attitudes was instrumental in maintaining a positive and constructive
attitude toward the profession. Cathy Lillico (conservator
for the Regional Galleries) and Anne Gaulton were also working in the
laboratory during my period of internship. Both took an active interest
in my work at the Gallery.
The work emphasis at the Gallery was placed on practical experience
with paintings conservation, and a wide range of techniques and attitudes
were considered and implemented. The period was also an opportunity to
become involved in other aspects of conservation work apart from treatments.
The transport, display, lighting, packaging and handling of painttings
are important responsibilities for conservation staff, and I participated
in them whenever possible. The routine examination of the Gallery
collection and monitoring the light and temperature fluctuations within
the Gallery environment were also part of my duties. The exposure also
gave me the opportunity to answer public telephone enquiries and participate
in advising the public on conservation during the Thursday morning
open house, when the public is allowed to bring their works into the
Gallery for advice from curatorial and conservation staff. I consider
it a valuable and worthwhile exposure to the workings of a major institution.
The Gallery conservation facilities include a studio and darkroom
that are well equipped for conservation photography. I chose to take
advantage of those facilities to improve my standard of photography and
increase my understanding of the application of photography to the examination
of paintings. The Gallery was very generous to allow me the use
of film materials during my period of internship. All the plates and
slides in this presentation were photographed, developed, and printed by
myself, with the exception of color processing, using the conservation
department facilities.
Internships are not a tradition within the Art Gallery Conservation
Department. Because of this, there is not an established program or itinerary
for interns to follow. I am grateful to the entire staff of the
conservation department, especially Alan Lloyd, for their support and
encouragement in shaping an interesting and rewarding internship. I hope
the opportunity will be made available to others who wish to pursue the
profession of conservation.
Some of the material presented in this dissertation is included for

the couple system, the family system and wider social systems. Negative conflict is
associated with breakdown in intimacy, marital dissatisfaction, and is seen to be a
prominent cause of marital failure. As conflict is a process, it has the possibility of
change and development over time, including moving towards a process whereby
disagreements can be worked out with mutually acceptable solutions.
Theoretical frameworks for conflict and marital counselling were reviewed and the
systems-interactionist theory and a systemic-based counselling approach chosen for the
purposes of this study. It was hypothesised that a systemic-based counselling approach
would lower the levels of conflict occurring within a marital relationship. The principal
objective of this study was to provide a more rigorous investigation than previous
studies of client perceptions of the effectiveness of a systems-based counselling
approach for marital counselling.
Three case studies were conducted, with embedded units of analysis, within the context
of a therapeutic process which drew on current theories of systemic counselling.
Conflict was measured and operationalised as overt behavioural conflict,
communication of negative affect, frequency of disagreements, intensity of
disagreements, desire to change the other partner, the desire for change, and evidence of,
and frequency of, positive conflict.
As the study was based on the client's perceptions of change, multi-methods of selfreports
were employed. As none of the known measurements met the needs of this
study, a questionnaire known as the QCR was devised specifically for the pre- and posttests.
The QCR was designed to measure: any increase or decrease in positive conflict;
changes to both the intensity and frequency in negative conflict; and perceptions of the
desire for change.
The effectiveness of the counselling approach was measured by comparing the results of
the pre-and post-tests with the continual self-reports and the self-reports at the long term
follow-up interviews. An analysis of the self-reports focus on: the desire for change; the
effectiveness of a systems based counselling approach in lowering negative conflict; and
the usefulness of the QCR and other tools as measures.
The systems-based-counselling approach, proved from the clients' perspective, to be:
highly effective in case one; mostly effective in case two; and ineffective in case three as
one partner aborted the counselling process. The systems-based-counselling approach
had variable success in decreasing the intensity of negative conflict but was mostly
successful in decreasing the frequency of negative conflict. This approach was not
largely successful in reporting an increase in the frequency of positive conflict.
The study revealed evidence of a relationship between commitment to the marital
relationship and negative conflict. It also adds to the debate about the appropriateness
of a systems-based counselling approach in violent relationships.
In judging the clients' perceptions of the effectiveness of the systems-based counselling
approach multi-measurements employed including the lengthy recording of the
therapeutic sessions. It is claimed that this thesis offers a more rigorous methodology
than anecdotal evidence previously used in the reporting of systemic counselling cases.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">marital relationships</field><field name="subject">family breakdown</field><field name="subject">marital counselling</field><field name="subject">systemic counselling</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.105126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation internship at the National Library of Australia and the Australian National Gallery</field><field name="creator">Sturma, Lee</field><field name="description">The contents of this dissertation are a compendium of the conservation
work carried out during a six-month internship period, divided between
the Textile Conservation Section of the Australian National Gallery and
the Conservation Division of the National Library of Australia.
During a six-week period at the ANG, served under the Textile Conservator,
Miss Josephine Carter, opportunity was provided to work with
items from several of the Gallery's major textile collections,
including:
1) Precataloguing surveys of articles of costume involving
a) removal from temporary storage, sorting, documentation of
holdings and repacking of over 500 items of costume from the
Dialghev Ballets in the Theatre Arts Collection
b) descriptive documentation and repacking of costume and
accessories dated between 1900 and 1950 from the Julian
Robinson Collection.
2) Assistance with the photography of 10 items of Dialghev Ballet
costume and 90 lengths of Indonesian fabric for the Gallery's
acquisition records.
3) Preparation for mounting, and hanging of a large Arthur Boyd
tapestry in the foyer of Government House.
4) Full conservation of four small articles of costume from the
Julian Robinson Collection, and preparation of treatment
proposals for future conservation of three additional items.
During a 41/2-month period at the National Library of Australia, served
under the direction of the Principal Conservator, Mr. Ian Cook
opportunity was provided to work with a wide variety of items on paper
while participating in virtually all the varied aspects of the Division's
work, including:
1) Conservation responsibility for a one-day exhibition held in the
Library in conjunction with the ANU conference, "Australian and
European Imagination", involving
a) conservation and/or condition documentation of 23 bound and

change, this Field Study involved a consideration of the first two
Royal Society of Arts Courses In The Teaching of English in Singapore
Schools (RSA TESL). These were part-time courses offered to graduate
teachers to enable them to further improve their skills in English
Language teaching.
The study was based on a questionnaire that incorporated the
following components:
the general background of the teacher
the school climate
the level of attainment in relation to the competencies
identified
the level of sharing
the methods of dissemination
Of the teachers from courses one and two who were invited to attend a
feedback session, forty-eight responded. The questionnaire was
designed to elicit responses from the participants in relation to the
main factors mentioned above. The results of the study were subjected
to three main types of analyses viz,
comparisons based on raw data
co-relations of the different factors using the Pearson's
Product Moment Co-efficient
Chi-square and T-score analyses of means of the different
factors to ascertain degrees of relationship.
Since the course had a task-based emphasis, it was not surprising
that the study revealed a high level of attainment of the teachers in
relation to the main competencies developed in the course. This in
turn was shown to have a significant effect on the confidence of the
teachers to share their knowledge and skills with other teachers.
Another factor that was significant in terms of the levels of
sharing achieved by the teachers was the position held by them. It was
found that a greater degree of sharing of skills and knowledge was
achieved by the senior subject teachers than those who were not. This
was also confirmed when a comparison of courses one and two was made.
The degree of sharing achieved by the course one participants was
higher because there were more senior subject teachers among them.
Furthermore, this difference in sharing in relation to position was
marked in both schools that had a good climate or those that had a poor
climate.
The school climate also significantly affected the relative level
of sharing of skills and knowledge achieved by the teachers. Even
among the senior subject teachers, the level of sharing was greater in
schools with a good climate than in those with a poor climate.
Finally, in terms of the method of dissemination, it was found
that the senior subject teachers used both the formal (demonstrations,
workshops) and informal methods of dissemination while the ordinary
teachers used mainly the informal (discussions etc) methods of
dissemination.
The four main findings arising from the study have had a
significant impact on the future developments in relation to the RSA
TESL course as well as other in-service courses where a transfer of
knowledge/skills is expected on completion of the course.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Royal Society of Arts Courses In The Teaching of English in Singapore Schools</field><field name="subject">RSA TESL</field><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">in-service teacher education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.110442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emergence and use of development communication studies in Thailand : an analysis of its origins, texts, teaching and research programs</field><field name="creator">Sukcharoen, Suwipa</field><field name="description">Development communication studies originated in the U.S. It is
understandable, therefore, that countries seeking to establish development
communication studies of their own engaged in considerable borrowing of
theories and methodologies from the U.S. However, it has ultimately
become necessary to adapt these borrowed materials to make them more
responsive to the specific needs of those countries.
Thailand, which was until recently an underdeveloped country and
only now is beginning to emerge as a Newly Industrialising Country, has
gone through this borrowing process since the start of its development
communication studies programs in the late 1970s. The direct borrowing
stage lasted from that time until approximately the mid-1980s. Until then,
teaching, research, and academic staff training in development
communication in Thailand relied heavily on U.S. sources.
After the mid-1980s, however, an indigenous development
communication research agenda began to be established. Where the earlier
programs, texts, and research basically reproduced mainstream U.S.
approaches based on the development modernization paradigm, Thai
programs have since begun to focus more clearly on the specific Thai
experience. Although rural development research in the areas of
agriculture, public health, and education remain in the forefront of Thai
research, newer concerns reflecting contemporary social problems, such as
women's issues, AIDS, the environment, and the uses of new information
technologies, are becoming important research topics.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">development communication studies</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.111054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous and successive synthesis and their interaction with instructional treatments in year eigth mathematics in the A.C.T.</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Carolyn Wendy</field><field name="description">This study addresses the criticism leveled at A.C.T.
Mathematics teachers with regard to their failure to use
any other method of teaching than chalk-and-talk. By
considering the changed needs of society for mathematics
and the changed perceptions by society of education, the
criticism is placed in context.
The importance of spatial ability for mathematics is
examined in the context of theories of cognitive abilities
and its current under utilization within the classroom. On
the basis of the increased need to utilize more talent the
study was designed to operationalise in the classroom the
constructs of simultaneous and successive synthesis,
derived from Luria's model of brain functioning.
The question of gender differences in mathematics
achievment and spatial ability is addressed.
The possible role of the maturation of language in
determining differences in the acquistion of ability to
form simultaneous synthesis is briefly discussed.
The study was designed to utilize and enhance
simultaneous synthesis. By demonstrating an
Aptitude-Treatment Interaction it was intended to confirm
that students, who function at a high level in
simultaneous synthesis but at a low level in successive
synthesis, would achieve more with experience with spatial
activates than in a more traditional chalk-and-talk
classroom.
Gender differences in achievement were not found.
Gender differences in successive/simultaneous profiles
were found in accordance with theory predictions. The need
for the duration of longer treatment periods is briefly
discussed in the context of funding and the appearance of
greater efficiency of traditional teaching methods when
the students are functioning at the highest level of
symbolic thought.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">mathematics teachers</field><field name="subject">simultaneous synthesis</field><field name="subject">successive synthesis</field><field name="subject">Luria</field><field name="subject">spatial ability</field><field name="subject">chalk-and-talk</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.111850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Explanation in human geography : some implications for teaching</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Ian W.</field><field name="description">As a teacher of the New South Wales Higher School Certificate
Geography Syllabus in the 1970s, I became aware of problems of
interpretation and implementation of syllabus documents dealing
with models and theories of human aggregate behaviour. A positivistic
underpinning allowed explanation in human geography to employ
deductive - nomological methodology. This field study investigates
a defined literature of academic geography including journals,
and both secondary and tertiary documents to identify the extent
and quality of nomothetic and idiographic traditions from the
late 19th century to the mid 1970s.
The literature prior to the late 1950s revealed a dominant
regional tradition and idiographic methodology with an emphasis
on description of uniqueness of areal phenomena. But underlying
currents of a nomothetic nature, running parallel to this regionalidiographic
tradition,exerted a noticeable challenge to gain acceptance
in geographic circles. This kind of nomothetism was in the
form of environmental determinism which held that physical laws
operating in nature were also at work to shape and direct human
societies. Environmental determinism contained generalised assertions,
enjoyed some appeal, but lacked rigorous justification. Even
within regional frameworks, authors used environmentally induced
determinants to explain the unique character of regions. Not until
the 1930s did environmental determinism lose its appeal, after which
time the regional - idiographic tradition strengthened as an
explanatory mode of human behaviour.
Nomothetism emerged in the late 1950s in Australia in the
application of models and theories explaining human behaviour.
Normative theory was supported by an increased use of quantification
and by the growing preference for systematic studies in
geography. Neither mode of explanation exists at the total exclusion
of the other; so that while nomothetism enjoyed widespread
appeal in academic geography from the late 1950s, significant
challenges were mounted against it because of its inadequacies
as a mode of explaining human aggregate behaviour.
Nomothetic explanation in human geography can be seen at the
research level and in education circles. Many normative models
and theories found their way into senior geography courses to the
extent they promoted a systems approach. Teachers would have been
aware of normative theory in geography from their university
studies and teacher training courses during the late 1950s and
throughout the 1960s.
The tension between associated explanatory modes in systematic
and regional geography becomes apparent in the analysis of the
N.S.W. H.S.C. Geography Syllabus in which confusing statements
raise problems for teachers interpreting and implementing this
prescriptive document.
Given these tensions and problems of explanation in human
geography, the adoption of a critical rationalist viewpoint as
propounded by Karl Popper is suggested as a possible solution
for geography teachers when interpreting a syllabus such as that
of the N.S.W. H.S.C. Falsification rather than verification
should be the node of inquiry towards explanation of human aggregate
behaviour.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geography teaching</field><field name="subject">human geography</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">HSC</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Higher School Certificate</field><field name="subject">N.S.W.

way beginning teachers in the A.C.T. incorporate music into their primary
classrooms.
Twenty-eight teachers from 23 different schools were interviewed in this
study. These teachers were chosen on the basis that they were beginning
teachers (teachers who were in their first, second or third year of teaching)
and had graduated from the University of Canberra from 1988 to 1990. The
teachers were interviewed over a 7 week period in Term 4 of 1990. The
interview schedule incorporated aspects of a questionnaire and an interview
employing both closed and open-ended questions.
The study found that although 71% of the teachers taught some music in
their classrooms, no teacher actually taught the whole music curriculum (as
defined by the A.C.T. Curriculum Guidelines, 1990). Singing, listening and
moving were taught by most teachers but areas of the music curriculum
such as playing, reading and writing, improvisation and composition were
rarely included. These results were influenced by factors such as the musical
background of the teachers, preservice courses, the school music curriculum,
whether or not teacher's colleagues taught music and the school's
utilisation of the music specialist. For example, teachers who taught music
were more likely to come from a school that had a music curriculum rather
than from a school that did not.
This study has implications for the development and implementation of
primary school music curricula, the reassessment of future preservice and
inservice programs, the utilisation of human resources within primary
schools and the development of more positive attitudes towards music in
schools and society in general.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="subject">music curriculum</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.113339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communication-satisfaction of educators and administrators of Adult Migrant Education Program within and between institutions in the ACT</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Susan Saubhag W.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the level of

master its system of form but also the ability to use its linguistic
units appropriately. This is because languages differ from one
another not only in their systems of phonology, syntax and lexicon
but also in their speakers' manners of patterning their discourse
and realizing speech acts.
Greeting and addressing people are, to varying extents, formulaic,
culture-specific and routinized in different languages, including
Vietnamese and English. The factors that govern the way one
person greets and addresses another varies across languages and
speech communities. The selection of one linguistic form over
another in greeting and addressing someone largely depends on
Speaker-Hearer relative power paradigm, the context of
interaction and other social factors.
Greetings and address terms by themselves do not carry much
referential meaning but accomplish pragmatic functions. Failure to
use them appropriately may result in communication breakdown
or unwanted hostility, particularly in cross-cultural interactions.
Since communication is meaning-based, conventional, appropriate,
interactional and structured (Richards,1983: 242 ff), speakers of a
foreign language must take into account these elements if they
wish to communicate successfully in the target language.
This study investigates the patterning of greeting and address
terms in Vietnamese and in English, identifying similarities and
differences between them. The factors that govern the way
speakers choose to greet and address are examined.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">greeting</field><field name="subject">address</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.114406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The implementation and initial performance of a wetland system

               introduction of quality assurance in small training
               organisations</field><field name="creator">Syme, David</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the impact that small training organisations expect as a result
of the introduction of quality assurance. It also explores how the culture of small
training organisations affects, and is affected by, quality assurance. The current
requirement for small training organisations to undertake quality assurance
processes represents challenges and opportunities. However, there is little
information available on the relationship between organisation culture and quality
assurance in small training organisations, and therefore little guidance on
implementing quality assurance in such organisations.
The relationship between organisational culture and quality assurance in
small organisations was examined from an interpretive approach that used both
quantitative and qualitative techniques. 78 respondents from 34 separate training
organisations responded to a survey comprising a questionnaire developed by the
author concerning the expected impact of quality assurance, and an organisational
culture instrument. The organisation culture instrument, which was adapted by
the author from the Organisational Culture Diagnostic Instrument (Cameron and
Ettington 1988), aimed to assess both current organisational culture, and
expected organisational culture after the introduction of quality assurance.
Further in-depth data were gained in focus groups held with two of training
organisations surveyed. Results were analysed using descriptive and inferential
statistics, and content analyses.
For most small training organisations, the opportunities provided by
quality assurance, especially in providing consistency through devolved
responsibility for management tasks, were perceived to outweigh the short-term
problems, especially resource issues and frustration with inconsistent external
requirements. Change for the most part was perceived to be at the level of
procedure and formal policy, rather than at the level of underlying values or
philosophy. The organisations tended to have flexible cultures ('Clans' and
'Adhocracies' - Cameron and Ellington 1988), and expected to become more
predictable ('Hierarchies' and 'Markets' - ibid) after the introduction of quality
assurance. However, there were variable paradoxical effects in relation to the
impact of quality assurance on organisational culture.
The study identifies some key issues for those implementing and/or
designing quality assurance systems in small training organisations and suggests
that, in comparison with large organisations, more attention needs to be given to
technical and resource issues than to changes in orientation or values. The study
identifies a number of complexities in the relationships between different aspects
of organisational culture, between organisational profile and expected impact, and
between expected and actual impact. Further research on these complexities is
suggested.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality assurance</field><field name="subject">small training organisations</field><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.115434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role expectations for college supervisors in a field experience
               programme : a study of the perceptions of the participants at a catholic college of education</field><field name="creator">Tabart, Michael J.</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this study was to examine the roles that college
supervisors perform in the Field Experience programme with particular
reference to the Field Experience programme in a Catholic College of
Education. Through clarification of the roles it was expected that
the effectiveness of college supervisors would be improved resulting
in a more efficient and productive Field Experience programme at the
institution concerned.
The overall aims of the study were:
(1) to clarify the roles of college supervisors
(2) to improve the quality of the Field Experience programme
(3) to give the programme more meaning in the teacher education
course at the College concerned and
(4) to make it clear to participants in such a programme that
there is an important role for college supervisors to play.
The study involved the co-operation of 62 student teachers, 45
classroom teachers (country and city) and 10 college lecturers
(totalling 117). A questionnaire was designed on the basis of
discussions with Field Experience participants, on a survey conducted
the previous year, and on an open-ended survey conducted immediately
after the mid-year Block Practicum. The final questionnaire was then
distributed to 82 student teachers (75.5% return), 76 classroom
teachers (58.5% return) and 11 college lecturers (90% return).
The study made use of earlier work by Waters (1973) and also by Duck
and Cunningham (1985). In the study, student teachers, classroom
teachers and college lecturers were surveyed by means of a
questionnaire to rate the frequency with which specific supervisory
tasks (already identified in a pilot study) were performed.
This involved rating each of the supervisory tasks twice; firstly
rating , the 'actual' occurrence of the task and secondly by rating
the 'ideal' occurrence of the task.
Results of the study showed that there are differences of
perception surrounding role expectations for college supervisors and
that these roles require clarification. What were perceived to be
the roles for and the behaviour of college supervisors contrasted
with what was actually exhibited. Students and teachers (country and
city) perceived college supervisors to be actually performing an
Evaluator role; while lecturers perceived a Manager role. The 'ideal'
role for college supervisors was perceived by all respondent groups
to involve the functions and tasks of Manager. The degree of role
conflict present indicates that follow-up measures deserve
consideration and clarification and that orientation and learning
programmes need to be conducted for all Field Experience participants
in order to give the Field Experience programme more significance and
to improve its overall effectiveness.
A result of the study and one which could be emphasised in
order to improve the quality of the programme was the indication
of 'desirable' and 'undesirable' characteristics of college
supervisors who were involved in the Field Experience programme at
the College concerned. These results were similar to the earlier
work of Beer et al. (1983) and were indicated by' the use of openended
comments being included at the conclusion of the
questionnaire. These comments concerned the personal and
professional characteristics of college supervisors and together
with this author's work could form the basis of further study as a

with the concepts of authenticity and relevance to students' needs
and interests. Using newspapers in foreign language classes is one
way of working towards the development of an authentic
environment and promoting the language learning process.
For EFL students in the Institute of International Relations (IIR)
newspapers are not simply an important source of learning
material, but an important source of information.
Vietnamese EFL students who learn to read English newspapers,
however, constantly encounter difficulties in comprehension.
This study report attempts to identify the common areas of
comprehension difficulty for Vietnamese learners, when confronted
with newspapers.
To achieve this aim, the study first reviews schema theory in order
to establish the factors which affect the reading process. It also
examines studies on news reporting style in English.
Attempts have also been made in the contrastive study of the
differences in reporting styles of international news in English and
Vietnamese to investigate what might cause difficulties for
Vietnamese readers.
Accordingly, the study considers implications for teaching
newspaper reading to Vietnamese EFL students at intermediate
level, who have not practised this before.
Finally, the study also suggests further areas of research in using
newspapers in a foreign language class.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">english as a foreign language</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">newspapers</field><field name="subject">reading problems</field><field name="subject">international news</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.120527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of politeness : two request situations in English and Japanese</field><field name="creator">Tanaka, Noriko</field><field name="description">Until recently, English teaching in Japan focused on giving much
grammatical knowledge to students, and paid little attention to
communicative competence, 'competence as to when to speak, when not,
and as to what to talk about with whom, when, where, in what manner'
(Hymes 1971: 277). However, nowadays, the importance of
communicating with foreign people for mutual understanding is often
pointed out, and communicative competence is gradually receiving more
attention in English teaching in Japan. Grammatical knowledge is not
sufficient for making students communicate well, and in addition to
grammatical knowledge, the knowledge of appropriate use of the
language is necessary for effective communication. Furthermore, as a
part of communicative competence, 'social competence', the knowledge
and ability to create and maintain a harmonious atmosphere in social
interaction, should be given more attention in order to allow
students to communicate with English speaking people harmoniously and
effectively.
Although a number of teachers have noticed the importance of
communicative and social competence, such competence is not taught
sufficiently in Japan. One reason for this is that, with few
opportunities to communicate with native speakers of English in
Japan, teachers themselves do not know well the communication
patterns of English in actual situations. To develop students'
communicative competence, Japanese teachers of English need to know
the cultural patterns in English, and to see what kind of problems
could occur for Japanese students. It is intended that this field
study will contribute a small part to the growing understanding of
the cultural patterns in English and Japanese.
Before considering the possible problems especially for Japanese
learners of English, three possible causal factors of communication
problems for non-native speakers are discussed:
(1) lack of linguistic competence
(2) transfer of native cultural patterns
(3) false stereotyping.
As a basis for considering the problems in terms of politeness
strategies, in particular, Brown and Levinson (1978)'s 'face theory'
is introduced, and some characteristics of Japanese cultural patterns
which may cause some politeness problems are discussed. Based on the
discussion, some hypotheses are built up about Australian and
Japanese communication patterns, and an investigation has been
conducted, focusing on two request situations:
(1) asking a lecturer to lend a book
(2) asking a friend to lend a book.
Four Australian native speakers of English and four native speakers
of Japanese were asked to role-play in each situation, and their
results were compared with each other. These results were also
analyzed in comparison with the results of four Japanese speakers of
English and four Australian speakers of Japanese.
Although this is a preliminary study and has some limitations in
the investigation, the results show that, although politeness is a
universal phenomenon, it is expressed differently in English and
Japanese, and they indicate some possible problems in politeness
strategies for Japanese speakers of English and for Australian
speakers of Japanese.
As to the implications of the results for English teaching in
Japan, three points can be considered:
(1) the need to make students aware of the cultural patterns of
English
(2) the need to teach students sufficient variety of
expressions
(3) the need to give students enough practice.
In terms of these points, some weaknesses in English teaching in
Japan are discussed. For example, teachers do not have enough
knowledge of communication patterns in English, materials used in
class do not give enough information about the target culture and
actual use of English by native speakers, and the amount of time
spent on English in the school curriculum and the number of students
in one class cannot be considered desirable for the purpose of giving
enough practice to each student.
These problems are not easy to solve, but it is possible to find
ways to improve the situation. In the final chapter, some practical,
though tentative, suggestions are made in the hope that English
teaching in Japan will be improved to help students to communicate
well with people in different cultures.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">politeness</field><field name="subject">communicative competence</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.121055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality service : what is it?, can it improve the delivery

every scientist in Vietnam must know one or two foreign languages
(one of them being English), and be able to use it for his work.
But even now, the number of people who have acquired the language
as required is still small. This paper examines the causes of this
problem and possible remedies.
What has caused the situation to change so slowly? The
reasons may be several, but the most striking one is that teachers
do not understand the nature of EST, so they try to teach scientists
the same language forms in the same way as they do with young
students at Foreign Language Colleges. Consequently, the learners
know a lot about the language, but can use only a little.
The paper considers several aspects of the situation.
Scientists and technologists need to learn only the language forms
often used in scientific literature and the skills needed for their
work. For this reason, teachers must first identify the learners'
needs, then draw up a list of objectives of the course, look for
relevant materials and use appropriate methods of teaching. To help
teachers to do these things, a training programme is needed. The
training will familiarize the teachers with key scientific concepts,
characteristics of EST, and the way to place learners in appropriate
groups.
Several approaches to ESP/EST are examined, but EST
learners in Vietnam are rather different from those in other
countries, so a special model for an EST course is designed ;
an example of a reading course to illustrate the model is given
for teachers to refer to. Finally, some suggestions are offered
to solve problems arising from present EST courses.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">scientists</field><field name="subject">technologists</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.123424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation, detoxification and storage in the gastropod molluscs Austrocochlea constricta and
               Bembicium auratum and an assessment of their potential as
               biomonitors of trace metal pollution in estuarine environments</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Anne</field><field name="description">Zinc, copper and cadmium accumulation was measured in two herbivorous gastropod
molluscs Austrocochlea constricta and Bembicium auratum from Lake Macquarie NSW an
area with a history of trace metal pollution.
The investigation consisted of three main parts. The first part examined the influence of
organism mass and location within the Lake on whole body tissue metal concentrations.
This part of the study also compared the distributions of tissue metal concentrations of
populations from Lake Macquarie, a known polluted environment, with those of
populations from Jervis Bay NSW, an unpolluted environment, to establish whether either
species is a net accumulator of zinc copper or cadmium. The second part of the
investigation examined a range of factors which may influence whole body metal
concentrations. One location in Lake Macquarie was sampled monthly from August 1995
to July 1996. The factors examined were temporal variation, gender, breeding cycle, and
tissue distribution. The final part of the investigation examined the detoxification and
storage of excess metals in the gastropods from Lake Macquarie. The mechanisms studied
were metallothioneins and granules.
The tissue metal concentrations of both species were found to be independent of mass.
Location within Lake Macquarie did not significantly influence tissue metal concentrations.
Variation between individuals was the most significant contribution to overall variation,
resulting in a positive skewing of sample trace metal distributions. B. auratum populations
from Lake Macquarie had significantly higher copper and cadmium tissue concentrations
and A. constricta populations had significantly higher zinc, copper and cadmium tissue
concentrations than the populations from Jervis Bay. This suggests that regulation of these
metals is not occurring. A. constricta may therefore be considered a net accumulator of
zinc, copper and cadmium and B. auratum of copper and cadmium.
Tissue metal concentrations did not vary significantly over time. It is suggested that the
organisms are in equilibrium with their environment. B. auratum has higher natural
equilibrium concentrations than A. constricta particularly for copper and cadmium,
suggesting different routes of exposure, uptake or accumulation for the two species.
Gender and breeding cycle did not significantly influence tissue metal concentrations.
Most of the variability in total copper and cadmium concentrations of both species was
explained by variability in gonad tissue metal concentration, while variability in the gonad
and somatic tissues zinc concentration explained about an equal amount of the variability
in total zinc concentration.
A. constricta and B. auratum were both found to induce a cadmium binding protein which
has some features in common with metallothionein. A protein of around 10 000 Da which
binds approximately 60% of the soluble cadmium was isolated using gel filtration. This
protein was further separated into two isoforms using anion exchange. The first isoform
eluted at the same time as MT I and the second at the same time as MT II rabbit liver
standard. Large cells containing granular material which stained positive for calcium were
observed interspersed among the connective tissue immediately behind the columnar
epithelial cells lining the gut wall in both species under a light microscope. Calcium
positive granular particles were also observed within the columnar epithelial cells of B.
auratum.
These species have been shown to be net accumulators of the trace metals investigated,
with the exception of zinc in B. auratum. It has also been established that organism mass,
gender and reproductive state, the partitioning of metals between tissues, and temporal
effects are not confounding factors for the purposes of comparing trace metal
concentrations between populations. They should therefore be effective biomonitors of the
trace metals investigated, with the exception of zinc in B. auratum.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zinc</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">detoxification</field><field name="subject">gastropod molluscs</field><field name="subject">Austrocochlea constricta</field><field name="subject">Bembicium auratum</field><field name="subject">biomonitors</field><field name="subject">trace metal pollution</field><field name="subject">estuarine environments</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.124205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social psychology in a secondary college and its part-evaluation</field><field name="creator">Teasdale, T. C.</field><field name="description">For the first time in the ACT, Social Psychology was introduced as a discrete
course of study at Hawker College in 1976. Its implementation represented some
eight months of research. This field study reports part of the course and its
evaluation, and it comes in two distinct segments: the detailed content of the
first third of the course (i.e. the first two units of a six-unit course) and
its part-evaluation. The term, 'part-evaluation' was chosen with care. It
serves two meanings: firstly, it refers to an evaluation of part of the social
psychology course, and secondly, it indicates that the evaluation was completed
by a novice, who is not qualified to investigate and operationalise either
a comprehensive, or a thorough and controlled, evaluation of the units.
The field study is produced in six chapters. The first provides a backcloth,
as it were, to the emergence of social psychology as a discipline of study at
Hawker College. The second chapter continues the theme, and it presents
social psychology in a historical perspective, and it outlines the mechanism
which eventually effected the implementation of the course at Hawker College.
The third chapter analyses social psychology as a body of knowledge in the
light of recent curriculum philosophy. The detailed content of Units 1 and 2
form the fourth chapter. Chapter 5 is lengthy, and it addresses itself to the
part-evaluation process, and in so doing, makes use of Robert Stake's 'countenance
model', and in particular, to his three major components: antecedents, transactions,
and actual outcomes. The first part of the chapter, however, introduces
the concept of evaluation and the particular stance taken towards it by the
author. The last two chapters, in turn, report the major findings of the partevaluation,
and relate them to the literature.
This field study serves the major purpose of providing the initial research for
a full and comprehensive evaluation of the social psychology course which will
be conducted in the third term of 1978.

in Vietnam in terms of textbooks and teachers' presentation.
The data sources for this study were from (1) an analysis of the two types of
English textbooks being used in Vietnam: those written by native speakers of
English and those written by Vietnamese authors, (2) an analysis of class-visit
reports of 176 periods of English classes in Hue, and (3) an analysis of 57
questionnaires answered by two groups of Vietnamese teachers of English:
39 high school teachers and 18 tertiary teachers.
Results from the study indicated that:
-In general, the textbooks of both types fail to introduce the
sociolinguistic aspects of the target language to the learners: the textbooks
written by native speakers of English are very culture-specific. The contexts of
situation in these textbooks in most cases are too implicit for both the teachers
and the learners. The explanation of most cultural aspects in the textbooks is
either not sufficient or not provided. On the other hand, the English cultural
aspects introduced in the textbooks written by Vietnamese authors are biased.
- Although most teachers have indicated their awareness of the
importance of both cultural and linguistic aspects of new language, actual
records of their presentation methods revealed more emphasis on the latter,
that is the linguistic features.
For the teaching of English to the Vietnamese learners, the results of this study
lead to rejection of the idea of presenting new language without reference to
the target culture as well as the idea of presenting new language removed
from the context of situation. The results suggest the need for adaptation and
supplementation of textbooks, and the inclusion of context of situation into the
teacher's presentation of new language.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">teachers' presentation</field><field name="subject">textbooks</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.125255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">News broadcasts and problems for EFL learners</field><field name="creator">Thao, Nguyen Dinh</field><field name="description">English is the language studied by the majority of students at the

causes septicaemia and chronic respiratory infection. It exhibits a higher
mortality rate than other gram-negative bacteria and the need for effective
immunotherapy is emphasised by the frequency of antibiotic resistance
associated with this organism. Mucosal immunisation with a whole killed cell P.
aeruginosa vaccine has previously demonstrated a significant immune response
in both rodent studies and human trials. This study is a continuation of that
research, with the major goal being the identification of a purified protein antigen
that could form the basis of a mucosal vaccine against P. aeruginosa.
Specifically, the aims of this study were the development of purification
protocols for the isolation of previously untested protein antigens, assessment of
the efficacy of these antigens to enhance bacterial clearance in an animal model
of acute respiratory infection, determination of the immune parameters that are
associated with the resolution of P. aeruginosa respiratory infection and finally,
cloning of an identified antigen which demonstrated vaccine efficacy.
Protocols were established to isolate proteins for use as antigens in immune
response studies. The proteins purified in this study were Pa 13, Azurin, acyl
carrier protein (ACP), Amidase, Aminopeptidase, KatA and Pa70. These proteins
were used to immunise rats by intestinal intra-Peyer's patch (IPP) inoculation and
intratracheal (IT) boost. The immunisation protocol employed was designed to
target mucosal antigen-specific immune responses where the route of
immunisation, Peyer's patch (PP) intestinal inoculation, is akin to the oral
delivery of antigens to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (96).
Investigations of a previously uncharacterised antigen, Pa60, later identified this
protein as the P. aeruginosa catalase, KatA. This study demonstrated enhanced
bacterial clearance of both homologous and heterologous challenge following
immunisation with KatA. The level of clearance demonstrated by KatA was
promising when compared to that of killed whole cell immunisation. KatA was
cloned and studies with the recombinant protein showed enhanced bacterial
clearance commensurate with that of the native protein.
Immunisations with other proteins identified four additional antigens which
enhanced bacterial clearance; Pa13, Pa40, Pa45 and Pa70. Amino acid sequence
analysis indicated that Pa13 may be a novel protein, whereas Pa40 was
determined to be amidase and Pa45, aminopeptidase. Pa70 was not successfully
sequenced. These proteins were effective in significantly enhancing bacterial
clearance of homologous P. aeruginosa challenge. For KatA, Pa13 and Pa70,
clearance was associated with a marked phagocytic cell recruitment. In contrast,
amidase and aminopeptidase demonstrated clearance with a minimal cellular
response. Proteins; azurin and ACP were non-protective, failing to clear a live P
aeruginosa challenge. Analysis of the antigen-specific responses of these nonprotective
proteins and comparison with those antigens which enhanced bacterial
clearance were used to determine factors that may contribute to the resolution of
an acute pulmonary infection.
The study has demonstrated that mucosal immunisation using purified protein
antigens can enhance the clearance of pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa. It
has also contributed to the understanding of immune responses to newfound
antigens of P. aeruginosa and identified antigen-specific responses which
confirm their potential as vaccine candidates.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">mucosal vaccine</field><field name="subject">chronic respiratory infection</field><field name="subject">immunotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.130804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leadership styles on principals at one A.C.T. secondary school, 1961-1981</field><field name="creator">Thomas, S.

from the community for principals to provide leadership in
their schools, little work has been conducted in Australia
into the question of educational leadership.
This study attempts to describe the leadership
styles of principals at one A.C. T. secondary school over
the period 1961 to 1981.
Immegart (1973), when considering possible
alternative approaches to the study of leadership
suggested that the genealogical approach, that is the study
of the succession of leaders in one situation, may be a
viable alternative.
Taking up this suggestion the present study
attempts to trial the genealogical approach in order to
contribute to a body of knowledge on the leadership styles
of principals in schools in the A.C.T.
A shortened form of Likert's Management Systems
Questionnaire was used to describe the leadership style of
the principals. A brief survey of the staff was conducted
in order to build up a profile of the staff with whom each
principal worked.
A number of hypotheses were tested. It was
found that there had been a change in the leadership styles
of the principals over the twenty year period, but this
change was not uniform. Subscales of leadership,
communication, decision making, goals and control were
found to follow the same pattern as the overall result,
with the exception of the subscale communication which had
a more restricted range.
The number of years a teacher taught at the

1. Error analysis in language teaching and learning and
its procedures
2. The relevance of error analysis to the teaching of
English as a foreign language in the Vietnamese situation
3. Analysis of errors made by Vietnamese speakers
4. The use of error analysis in teaching English to
Vietnamese speakers.
Error analysis can be a useful adjunct to second language
teaching, since it serves two related but distinct functions : the
one, practical and applied in everyday teaching, and the other,
theoretical, leading to a better understanding of the second
language learning acquisition process.
This study emphasizes the practical uses of error analysis in
teaching and correction techniques, materials development and
syllabus design. It is hoped that error analysis will make some
contribution to the teaching of English as a foreign language to
Vietnamese speakers, whose language is quite different from English
and whose culture is far from being similar to that of English
native speakers.
This study is aimed at helping Vietnamese teachers of English
to change their attitude to students' errors and see them in a more
positive way, rather than as signs of failure on the students' part.
It is suggested that a teacher of English must be able to
recognize errors when they occur, to form some idea of the kind of
error made and also why they occur. Finally, he must then be able
to draw, from the analysis thus made, some conclusions as to what
and how he should teach.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">error analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.131913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In search of possible solutions to the increase of ELT  effectiveness and efficiency for junior secondary schools in
               rural Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Thom, Nguyen Xuan</field><field name="description">Vietnam is a country with more than 80 percent of the population
living in the countryside. Rural education is, therefore, of vital
importance to Vietnamese education; and ELT effectiveness and
efficiency in junior secondary schools in rural Vietnam is a
problem of worthwhile attention.
This study, being a pilot one, limits itself to seeking solutions to the
increase of ELT effectiveness and efficiency in terms of syllabus
design, textbook revision and teacher development. The study
contains 5 chapters and a conclusion.
Chapter 1 deals with the general background of the study, schooling
and educational philosophies in Vietnam. In this chapter, special
attention is given to the role of foreign language teaching and
learning in Vietnamese schools. In addition, educational
philosophies in Vietnam are discussed as the philosophical and
legal basis for any implementation of FLT and ELT innovations in
junior secondary schools in rural Vietnam.
Chapter 2 deals with input studies and some models of language
teaching and learning that appeared in the last two decades. In this
chapter, special emphasis is laid on studies which explain how
input is transformed into intake and on the models of teaching and
learning that may be applied to the teaching and learning of
English in the context of rural Vietnam.
Chapter 3 deals with language teaching methods as the neverending
search for teaching effectiveness and efficiency. In this
chapter, based on the understanding of such concepts as
effectiveness and efficiency, language teaching methods are
presented as a means to an end, not as an end in itself. Thus, the
selection and use of a method depends completely on the goal set
for the process of language teaching and learning. When the goal
changes, the method will change accordingly.
Chapter 4 deals with the actual FLT and ELT situation in rural
junior secondary schools in Vietnam. This chapter includes the
results of surveys on teacher quality and a critical look at the
implementation of the communicative approach in language
teaching in the current textbooks in use in junior secondary
schools The background of rural students is discussed to clarify the
context of the learners in question.
In chapter 5, based on the theoretical findings in chapters 2 and 3
and on the actual ELT situation mentioned in chapter 4, possible
solutions to the increase of ELT effectiveness and efficiency are
proposed. These solutions are concerned with syllabus design,
textbook revision and teacher development.
The study closes with a conclusion which relates solutions to ELT
effectiveness and efficiency to the general solutions to teaching
effectiveness and efficiency mentioned at a number of workshops
held in Vietnam recently.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ELT</field><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">rural Vietnam</field><field name="subject">junior secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.132457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of an evaluation model for work experience programs at CIT</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Paula</field><field name="description">The provision of work experience opportunities for students at the Canberra
Institute of Technology (CIT) is an important feature in promoting the
practical application of theory learned in the classroom. At the outset of this
study, the variety and scope of work experience programs at CIT was not
known and there were no apparent efforts to co-ordinate this activity. The
effectiveness of these programs was not known, and there were no strategies
in place to measure their worth.
The purpose of this study was to identify and describe work experience
programs, to analyse existing evaluation methods and to propose a Model of
Evaluation appropriate to the maximum number of programs.
The review of related literature resulted in the selection of Stake's
comprehensive Countenance Model (1967), chosen for its consideration of
the complexities of purpose and the wide variety of experiences which
students may encounter. A significant part of the application of Stake's
Model was the development of an Evaluation Kit for Work Experience Co-
Ordinators at CIT and the subsequent trial on the Work Placement subject of
the Certificate in Travel course in the School of Tourism and Hospitality.
Stake's Countenance Model of Evaluation appears to embody an appropriate

               rural communities : an exploratory investigation of
               homosexuality in rural areas</field><field name="creator">Thorpe, Alan</field><field name="description">This is a qualitative study forming half of a coursework/thesis MA in Community
Education (HRD). It investigates some of the influences affecting gay men growing up in
rural communities. It provides material that may be useful in developing education
programs for gay men themselves, for the general community and particularly for health
educators.
The study illustrates and highlights these issues by presenting extracts and case studies
from twenty indepth interviews with rural homosexually active men. It looks at factors
affecting homosexual identity formation in rural communities and finds there are common
influences of family, religion, school and role models. It also identifies and examines other
influences of a rural nature, including concepts of masculinity, heterosexism and
homophobia, which may have a very restrictive effect on an emerging homosexual
identity.
The effects of such influences are explored, revealing common issues of isolation,
loneliness and lack of self esteem. The study reveals some of the particular difficulties
faced by young men becoming aware of and dealing with their emerging homosexuality
particularly in a rural community. Resultant behaviour is investigated and found to include
for some a fairly successful integration of homosexuality into their lives, but for others
there are common behaviours of denial, moving away from the community, or
contemplation of suicide.
The study highlights the importance of contacts with gay-identified men for support and
the need to be exposed to role models with whom gay men can identify. In this respect,
the influence on smaller communities of the mass media is found to be having an
increasing significance Unfortunately, the study also postulates that broader and positive
changes in the wider community may have served to heighten difficulties faced by rural
men if such changes are not mirrored at the local level. An awareness of increasing
acceptance and support for gay men in the wider community may be frustrating at least, if
local support has not also developed. In fact the study finds support for the assertions by
other researchers that there are links between sexuality and recent increases in rural male
youth suicide. The findings support the view that sexuality may play a significant part in
the contemplation of suicide by young gay men.
The particular value of the study is in exploring the issues through the words of the men
themselves. The extracts and case studies offer rich and varied illustrations of growing up
gay in the country.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">gay men</field><field name="subject">rural communities</field><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.133331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching functional spoken English at the Hanoi Foreign Languages Teachers' Training College</field><field name="creator">Thuoc, Bui Duc</field><field name="description">The English language occupied a specially
important status in the increasing development of science,
technology, culture and international relations in Vietnam,
which has resulted in a growing demand for English Language
Teaching (ELT) all over the country. The Hanoi Foreign
Languages Teachers' Training College in general and its
Department of English in particular plays a very important
role in this by producing as many teachers of English as
possible for high schools as well as for other Colleges and
Universities in Vietnam as a whole. Unfortunately, ELT in
Vietnam is still far from satisfactory. There exists a common
problem of communicative competence in Vietnamese students,
even in Vietnamese teachers of English. ELT at HFLTTC is
taken to illustrate the fact that even after five years'
training, graduates remain deficient in the ability of
language use as well as understanding its use in normal
communication. This being the case, how can they carry out
effectively the teaching of English to high school pupils or
students at other institutions?
In this situation, we need to take a serious look
at ELT in the Department of English at the HFLTTC so as to
suggest suitable materials and methods which will enable the
Institution to function more effectively.
This project makes an exploratory study of the
problem. To provide a context for the study, the background
to ELT in the Department of English is reviewed. This is
followed by a detailed description of different approaches
used in ELT with the reference to the actual activities of
teaching and learning in the Department of English. A special
emphasis is placed on the difference between conventional
approaches and the currently influential one - The Functional-
Notional-Approach to language teaching and learning. The
basic notions of this approach will be covered and also
different categories of functions and categories of
situations which the students of English often encounter in
using English. Different techniques of teaching functional
spoken English will be suggested with an aim to improving the
teaching of spoken English in the above-mentioned setting.
It is hoped that this project may become a
contribution to solving some of the existing problems of
inadequate communicative competence of Vietnamese students of
English and to teaching and learning English with effective
communication skills in the Department of English at the
HFLTTC.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">HFLTTC</field><field name="subject">Hanoi Foreign Languages Teachers' Training College</field><field name="subject">ELT</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">functional spoken English</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.133858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabulous Latin: a curriculum innovation for the teaching of Latin</field><field name="creator">Brazil, Wendy Marelle Harley</field><field name="description">This study is a Latin textbook designed for schools and

               and the effects of nutrient removal</field><field name="creator">Thurtell, Lisa</field><field name="description">Nutrients, periphyton and macroinvertebrates were sampled every two months
for one year to assess the effects of treated sewage effluent on the Thredbo River
and to compare changes in chemical concentrations and the invertebrate
community since the introduction of nutrient removal on the Thredbo sewage
treatment plant. Chemically, the impact of the effluent was minor and was
reduced from levels measured before the addition of nutrient removal to the
Thredbo sewage treatment plant. However, the reduction may be the result of
higher flows during the study period. Biologically there was no indication of
nutrient enrichment during June, August and October, with differences occurring
between physically dissimilar sites irrespective of position relative to the sewage
effluent inflow. Large increases in periphyton and macroinvertebrates occurred in
December, February and April at both open sites and those downstream of the
sewage outflow. Previous studies found increases in invertebrate abundance and
richness immediately downstream of the sewage inflow, but the impact was
greater and extended further downstream than found in this study.
Strong correlations between total phosphorus and periphyton biomass and
chlorophyll-a indicate phosphorus was a limiting nutrient. Higher periphyton
biomass and chlorophyll-a at all sites during the warmer months (especially at
open sites with an even cobble substratum), throughout the year, indicates light,
temperature and substratum type were as important as phosphorus in controlling
algal growth. Low algal biomass during the high flow month of October also
indicates the importance of water velocity in controlling periphyton biomass.
The structure of the macroinvertebrate community was noticeably different at
sites downstream of the effluent discharge, with the exception of the most
downstream site, when compared to the upstream sites. The occurrence of high
macroinvertebrate numbers and species richness at sites with high periphyton
growth and the strong positive correlation between invertebrate grazers and
periphyton measurements shows a dependent relationship between invertebrates
and periphyton growth. Therefore, the physical factors of light, temperature and
substratum characteristics of particular sites in the Thredbo River, may be as
important in controlling the benthic community as the levels of nutrient inputs
from sewage.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sewage effluent</field><field name="subject">periphyton</field><field name="subject">benthic macroinvertebrates</field><field name="subject">butrient removal</field><field name="subject">Thredbo River</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.143731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching reading to E.F.L.

The Report continues by asking a number of pertinent

which the writer examines at some length taking into account numerous
issues about language processing, cognition, expectation and

              community of the upper Thredbo River</field><field name="creator">Tiller, David</field><field name="description">Thredbo Village is a year round alpine resort located in Kosciusko
National Park, south eastern New South Wales. Treated sewage effluent
from Thredbo Village is discharged to the upper Thredbo River. The
river is a rocky bottomed, high mountain stream (&gt; 1,200 m altitude in
the study area) flowing predominantly through subalpine woodland, the
only major impact on the river within the study area was that of the
Thredbo Village alpine ski resort.
Nutrient concentrations were measured in the upper Thredbo River
monthly from January to September 1983 at 9 sites along the river, both
upstream and downstream of the effluent discharge. In addition,
invertebrates were collected at the same sites in January, April and July
1983.
The near pristine section of the upper Thredbo River upstream of
Thredbo Village was low in phosphorus and nitrogen (&lt;20 mg m-3 and
&lt;100 mg m-3 respectively). The sewage effluent discharge was high in
phosphorus and nitrogen (up to 5,000 mg m-3 and 28,000 mg m-3
respectively). Phosphorus generally returned to concentrations similar to
those measured in the pristine sections by 3.5 kilometres downstream of
the discharge. Nitrogen (mostly in the form of nitrate and nitrite)
often remained elevated down to the most downstream site, 8 kilometres
downstream of the effluent discharge.
The elevated nutrient concentrations immediately downstream of the
effluent discharge stimulated the growth of attached filamentous algae in
January when conditions for growth were most favourable. It is
concluded that this growth provided an additional food source for several
invertebrate taxa, Cricolopus sp. 12E and 160E (Diptera, Chironomidae),
Conoesucidae sp. TR6, Oxyethira columba (Trichoptera), Nais sp.,
Aeolosomatus niveum (Oligochaeta), and Austrocercella tillyardi
(Plecoptera), which occurred in higher numbers downstream of the effluent
discharge. Downstream of the effluent discharge the taxonomic
composition of the invertebrate community was not altered substantially
from that upstream, although there was a significant increase in the
abundance of the taxa which could take advantage of the increased food
resource. The changes in the invertebrate community were not evident
3.5 kilometres downstream of the effluent discharge, which corresponded
to the return of phosphorus concentrations to background levels. There
were increased abundances of several invertebrate taxa downstream of
both Thredbo Village and the rubbish tip in January which were
consistent with, but not as great as, those downstream of the sewage
effluent discharge. This was likely to be a result of increased nutrient
loads from urban runoff and tip leachate at these sites which possibly
lead to increased algal productivity. However, nutrient concentrations at
these sites were not notably higher than at the control site. The
sewage effluent discharge resulted in only small changes to the
invertebrate community in April or July 1983.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sewage effluent</field><field name="subject">benthic macroinvertebrates</field><field name="subject">Thredbo River</field><field name="subject">NSW New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.145223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case studies analysis of the functional model of school refusal behaviour</field><field name="creator">Todd, Barbara</field><field name="description">School refusal occurs across a broad range of students from the first to the final
years of school, and is of concern to students, parents and teachers alike. This
study uses the perspective of practitioners working at the school level to identify
linkages between the presenting problems, interventions and outcomes of school
refusal. This pattern is then compared to the Functional Model of School Refusal
to establish the relevance of the Model.
A multiple single-case study approach was used with ten case histories with
positive outcomes being matched against the Functional Model. As these
provided some support for the model an additional six case histories with
negative outcomes were then matched against the Model. Two interviews of
practitioners who had worked with school refusal were also analysed.
The Functional Model of School Refusal received some support through this
analysis, but areas were identified which were not adequately addressed by the
Model. The Model was subsequently revised into a broader functional approach
which takes greater account of the role of the family and environmental factors
affecting school refusal. It is recommended that a broader multi-modal approach
to intervention be implemented by practitioners dealing with school refusal.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">functional model</field><field name="subject">school refusal behviour</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.145654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narrative therapy : with a single case study</field><field name="creator">Todd, Sue</field><field name="description">A single case study using a narrative approach to therapy

   curriculum at De La Salle University, Manila</field><field name="creator">Tomlin, Steve</field><field name="description">This thesis undertakes a reformulation of ELT curricula by means of a
critique of established theoretical models and a case study of the ELT
curriculum at De La Salle University (DLSU), Manila.
The thesis proceeds in accordance with the precise that a sound
theoretical and philosophical perspective is crucial to any task of
curriculum development and criticism and thus derives a theoretical/
philosophical perspective from a consideration of ELT in the context of
the philosophy of education and linguistic, applied linguistic,
sociolinguistic, learning and curriculum theories.
The argument is presented that any model of language as communication
derived from linguistics and applied linguistics is not amenable to
translation into descriptive rules of 'use' and hence a pedagogic grammar.
Such theoretical perspectives, in only deriving partial models of 'use',
are largely inadequate in the context of a concern with language teaching.
Input from cognitive learning theory however suggests that teaching
language as communication requires a curriculum approach focusing on
'open' communicative procedures rather than systematic techniques premised
on language description and exemplified by a syllabus-based structure. It
is thus argued that communicative language teaching requires 'open',
methodology-based procedures that provide a markedly subordinated role for
syllabus. The advocated form of communicative language curriculum is thus
described as employing an 'open' rather than a 'closed-system') approach.
It is also maintained that the ELT debate on communicative curricula has
largely ignored crucial issues in curriculum theory and the philosophy of
education - especially the distinction between 'education' and 'training'.
This theoretical debate enables the derivation of a revised taxonomy of
language curricula to replace the orthodox dichotomy into General English
and ESP. The argument is presented that there are essentially two
approaches to the curriculum - closed-system and open approaches - and
that within each approach there are two curriculum types. Through revised
definitions, the intents of 6E and ESP curricula are distinguished and a
new taxonomy of four possible curriculum types, including that of a
Focused English Learning (FED curriculum, presented.
The principles derived from the theoretical discussion and reformulated
taxonomy enable an 'illuminative' case study investigation of an example
curriculum: the ostensibly English for Specific Purposes (ESP) curriculum
for Engineers employed at DLSU. This case study, by examining curriculum
justification and intent and illuminating the nature of the problem at the
university, illustrates, by example, aspects of the reformulated taxonomy.
The case study findings detail crucial aspects of the interface between
theory and local practice and expose the curriculum at DLSU as inherently
contradictory, based on an inaccurate notion of ESP, and principally
concerned with the pursuit of broadly educational aims through a mainly
training-based, closed-system and non-communicative curriculum.
The thesis concludes by proposing that the orthodox dichotomy between GE
and ESP curricula is inappropriate and fails to reflect the various and
possible forms of curricular intent. This has been a consequence of a
theoretical emphasis on linguistics and sociolinguistics and an inadequate
consideration of the philosophy of education and learning and curriculum
theories. The inadequacy of the established dichotomy has led to
confusion in application (as demonstrated through the case study) that
could be avoided through the adoption of the reformulated taxonomy.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ELT</field><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">De La Salle University</field><field name="subject">DLSU</field><field name="subject">Manila</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.151258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fuzzy approaches to speech and peaker recognition</field><field name="creator">Tran, Dat Tat</field><field name="description">Stastical pattern recognition is the most successful approach to automatic speech and
speaker recognition (ASASR). Of all the statistical pattern recognition techniques, the hidden
Markov model (HMM) is the most important. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
and vector quantisation (VQ) are also effective techniques, especially for speaker recognition
and in conjunction with HMMs. for speech recognition.
However, the performance of these techniques degrades rapidly in the context of insufficient
training data and in the presence of noise or distortion. Fuzzy approaches with their
adjustable parameters can reduce such degradation.
Fuzzy set theory is one of the most, successful approaches in pattern recognition, where,
based on the idea of a fuzzy membership function, fuzzy C'-means (FCM) clustering and
noise clustering (NC) are the most, important techniques.
To establish fuzzy approaches to ASASR, the following basic problems are solved. First,
a time-dependent fuzzy membership function is defined for the HMM. Second, a general
distance is proposed to obtain a relationship between modelling and clustering techniques.
Third, fuzzy entropy (FE) clustering is proposed to relate fuzzy models to statistical models.
Finally, fuzzy membership functions are proposed as discriminant functions in decison
making.
The following models are proposed: 1) the FE-HMM. NC-FE-HMM. FE-GMM. NC-FEGMM.
FE-VQ and NC-FE-VQ in the FE approach. 2) the FCM-HMM. NC-FCM-HMM.
FCM-GMM and NC-FCM-GMM in the FCM approach, and 3) the hard HMM and GMM
as the special models of both FE and FCM approaches. Finally, a fuzzy approach to speaker
verification and a further extension using possibility theory are also proposed.
The evaluation experiments performed on the TI46, ANDOSL and YOHO corpora showbetter
results for all of the proposed techniques in comparison with the non-fuzzy baseline
techniques.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fuzzy set theory</field><field name="subject">speech recognition</field><field name="subject">stastical pattern recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.151916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature and development of electoral education in Australia</field><field name="creator">Treadgold, Claire</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the nature and development of electoral education, a public

               1994</field><field name="creator">Trigger, David Scott</field><field name="description">There has been considerable controversy and debate over recent years about the most
appropriate method of measuring poverty. This debate has included, among other issues,
the questions of absolute versus relative poverty, the merits of money income as a
measure of the standard of living and the associated selection of poverty lines and
equivalence scales, and the selection of alternative indices of poverty. A review of the
literature indicates that the choice of differing approaches to poverty measurement can
lead to differing estimates of poverty. In the face of such results an evaluation of the
impact upon poverty estimates of alternative measurement methodology is appropriate.
This thesis assesses the impact upon the estimated level of poverty of variations in some
of the key poverty measurement parameters. The expenditure data derived from the
1975-76, 1984 and 1993-94 Household Expenditure Surveys have been analysed to
assess the sensitivity of poverty estimates, derived from a range of poverty indices, to
variations in the generosity of the equivalence scales, the level of the poverty line, and
the choice of the indicator of the level of resources used. The sensitivity of each poverty
index to variations in these parameters is assessed at both the aggregated level and for
the specified household types, while those population subgroups particularly susceptible
to poverty are also identified. The poverty distributions derived for each of the survey
years are compared to evaluate the impact upon changes in the level of poverty over
time of variations in the underlying parameters.
The thesis concludes that both poverty estimates at a point in time, and poverty trends
over time are sensitive to variations in the equivalence scales, in the level of the poverty
line, in the selection of the indicator of the level of resources, and in the choice of
poverty index itself. In light of these results, a review of recent Australian poverty
research concludes that insufficient attention has been paid to the sensitivity issues
associated with the measurement of poverty.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">poverty measures</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">absolute poverty</field><field name="subject">relative poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.153010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of cross-age tutoring on self-esteem amd computer

self-esteem. The study also examined the effects of the programme on the tutors'
attitudes to computers. A case study approach was used to answer the following
questions:
1. Does the self-esteem of tutors increase when they tutor in a nonacademic
subject area e.g. teaching others to use computer games?
2. Do the changes in self-esteem generalise to other areas or are the
changes specific to the subject area of the tutoring?
3. Do the tutors' attitudes to computers change when they teach younger
children how to use computer games?
Twelve tutors, from three A.C.T. primary schools, were trained as tutors. Girls from
Years 5 and 6, with low self-esteem (measured using the Coopersmith Self-esteem
Inventory), were selected to teach girls from Years 1 and 2 how to use computer
programmes.
Self-esteem was assessed pre- and post- tutoring using the Coopersmith Self-esteem
Inventory, concept maps and teacher's ratings. Computer attitudes were assessed
pre- and post- tutoring using the Bath County Computer Attitudes Survey and
concept maps. A post-tutoring questionnaire provided information, from the tutors,
about the tutoring programme. The case study approach allowed analysis of each
student's experience in the programme. The criteria used to evaluate the
effectiveness of the programme were the differences in the pre- and post- tutoring
measures of self-esteem and computer attitudes and the tutors' responses in
interviews.
Self-esteem increased for eleven of the tutors. Making a contribution, feelings of
increased competence, a sense of belonging and positive feedback were the factors
that appeared to enhance the tutors' self-esteem. All tutors were more confident with
the computer at the end of the programme, and in six cases there were increases in
the computer attitude survey scores.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross-age tutoring</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">primary school students</field><field name="subject">girls</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.153347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of remote sensing to monitor land use change and assess
              its effect on the hydrology of Tuggeranong Creek catchment</field><field name="creator">Dao, Minh Truong</field><field name="description">Since the launch of the first earth resources monitoring satellite, remote
sensing imagery has been used to provide information on the progress of
urbanization, and land cover and land use change. The launch of the first
SPOT satellite marked a significant improvement in spatial and spectral
resolution for discriminating individual targets and increased the potential to
acquire more information regarding land cover and land use.
This study aims to investigate the capability of using SPOT digital imagery for
monitoring land use change in the urbanised catchment of Tuggeranong Creek
in the Australia Capital Territory, and assess its effects on catchment
hydrology.
SPOT multispectral and panchromatic imagery was acquired over the study
area for January 1987 and September 1990. This imagery was digitally
processed and analysed using microBRIAN (MB) V3.01 software to derive
information on land cover and land use within the catchment. Multi-temporal
imagery was co-registered to a base map with sub-output pixel accuracy. In
order to improve spatial resolution, the multispectral imagery was merged with
panchromatic imagery acquired on the same day using HIS and HPF
techniques. The HPF technique retained more integrity of the original
multispectral data than did the HIS technique. Both HPF merged and unmerged
(original) image sets were used to assess the possibility of using higher
spatial resolution imagery in subsequent classification and change detection
analysis. On the basis of statistical calculation, non-vegetation classification
results were found to be consistent between merged and un-merged imagery,
but not consistent for vegetation classes. The inconsistency was found to be
the result of seasonal differences in phenology and sun angle. However more
small sub-pixel sized features such as houses and lawns were identified using
merged imagery. Regression differencing and post classification comparisons
were performed on both merged and unmerged image sets to detect temporal
changes which had occurred between both image dates. As expected, merged
imagery led to more sub-pixel sized examples of change being highlighted
using both the HPF and HIS techniques. However, errors associated with
multi-temporal image registration, compounded by classification errors arising

from seasonal differences, meant that the reliability of all identified incidences
of change could not be validated. Nevertheless, post classification change
detection was found to be the most useful approach for identifying the nature
of change from one type of land use to another.
The results of classification and change detection techniques were used to
diagnose likely changes in catchment hydrology attributable to changes in land
use. Preliminary hydrologic analyses found that catchment yield is more
sensitive to changes in land use than runoff volume or peak flood discharge.
This study confirms that SPOT imagery can be used for mapping and
monitoring land use change in urban areas. SPOT imagery was found to be
suitable for providing information on land use and land cover changes and
assessing the likely hydrologic consequences of such change. The use of
imagery from anniversary dates would further improve the reliability of
hydrologic assessments based on remote sensing of land use change.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="subject">land use change</field><field name="subject">hydrology</field><field name="subject">Tuggeranong Creek catchment</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.154118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards improving ESP testing in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Truong, Le Huy</field><field name="description">That this field study report has been carried out
originates from the fact that urgent remedies are needed to
improve ESP testing in Vietnam. This field study report
consists of five chapters as follows.
Chapter one gives an overall picture of language
testing in Vietnam, as well as dealing with the reasons why
ESP testing should be improved.
Chapter two covers questions such as the
terminology in assessing (evaluation, assessment, and
testing), role of testing, types of language tests, and main
characteristics of a good test.
Chapter three considers the problems concerning
ESP, for example, a definition of ESP, ESP in the teaching
learning process, ESP in Vietnam as well as ESP
classification.
Chapter four takes into consideration such
questions as the theoretical background of ESP testing,
proficiency tests in ESP testing, problems in ESP testing,
ESP testing in Vietnam together with comments, and
suggestions for improvements.
Chapter five reconfirms the aim of this field
study report - to improve ESP testing in Vietnam.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ESP</field><field name="subject">English for Special Purposes</field><field name="subject">language testing</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.154636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards teaching English vocabulary to Vietnamese tertiary students</field><field name="creator">Hoang, Tat Truong</field><field name="description">The English language is now widely used in Vietnam.
Consequently, the teaching and learning of English
has become more significant , but, on the other
hand, teaching methodologies, in Vietnam , still
reflect those used in the past to teach other
foreign languages. Vietnamese English teachers also
experience difficulty coping with the many new
problems which they now face. One of these
difficulties is the teaching of English vocabulary.
In order to develop an understanding of how best
English vocabulary might be taught in the
Vietnamese setting , this study identifies a
particular group of students: Vietnamese tertiary
students attending the Hanoi Foreign Languages
Teachers' College, and then explores ways how
teachers might introduce the teaching of English
vocabulary, both to these students, and to the
subjects the students will finally teach
themselves.
In order to prepare for an outline of how to carry
out this teaching role, the study investigates the
various problems associated with defining : the
word; the types of meaning conveyed by the word;
the relationship of phonology, syntax and semantics
to the word, and other related matters . The study
also looks at the problems which Vietnamese
students have with learning English vocabulary. In
this context a comparison is made of English and
Vietnamese lexical and related systems.
Subsequently, the study considers the different
types of foreign language methods which have and
are being used, with particular reference to how
they were used to teach vocabulary.
Finally, the study considers questions of the need
to select appropriate vocabulary for the targetted
students and details how teachers might effectively
teach vocabulary.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tertiary students</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">English vocabulary</field><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.155600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a syllabus for the teaching of writing for Vietnamese students</field><field name="creator">Vu, Ngoc Tu</field><field name="description">This Study considers some of the problems and solutions

The Study identifies that writing English as a foreign

Consequently, in order to understand the difficulty and
the needs of such students, this Study enters into a
consideration of the language and learning needs of the
target population and describes the teaching strategy
and syllabus content necessary to assist such students
to function in English writing more adequately.
In order to realise these aims, the Study reviews the
relevant literature with respect to: (i) the development
of the theory of the concept of writing in a foreign
language , and (ii) the teaching of different foreign
language teaching methods in the twentieth century.

Learning processes, learning theories and teaching are discussed.
Teacher-student relationships and their impact on learning by
creating sound learning environments are examined and a model of
sound learning environment is created. This model is tested by
investigation with final year certificate students.
The impact of the model on teacher selection and teacher education

of the Catholic schools including those in the Archdiocese of
Canberra and Goulburn. They have continued to be a
significant part of Australian education after decades of ups
and downs. The question today is not whether Catholic
schools will survive but rather how effective they will be
despite the changes which have taken place over the last few
decades. Catholic schools still aim to provide all the
elements of a State education, and in addition, to offer them
within a Catholic setting. They have tried to create an
environment that will continue to reflect the cultural values
of its members.
The Theses is on Catholic Education in Practice: A Case
Study of a Catholic High School in the A.C.T. The Theses is
based on historical and analytical approach. The results of
a case study involving random sampled students, their
parents/guardians and teachers in a Catholic High School in
the A.C.T. sets out to investigate what factors still attract
them to the Catholic school despite the significant changes
that have taken place since Catholic education was introduced
into Australia. By examining these three groups of
people who are directly involved in Catholic schools, it
is hoped that a more balanced assessment of the extent
to which ideals and practices of Catholic education have
been retained.
The results show that students attend Catholic schools
for a variety of reasons including academic and
religious and because of the traditional approach to
areas such as discipline. The religious values continue
to be an important part of the school which makes it
distinctively Catholic, but the integration is not as
pervasive as previous due to the change in the nature of
staff and students at the school.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic education</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.161949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An internship in painting conservation at the Australian National Gallery</field><field name="creator">Urquhart, Ian McLeod</field><field name="description">My employment in the Paintings Section of the Conservation Department
of the Australian National Gallery began in June 1983, however my
internship did not begin until March 1984 under the supervision of
Allan Byrne.
At that time, the paintings section was divided, rather arbitrarily,
into: paintings pre-1940, headed by Ilse King and; paintings
post-1940, headed by Allan Byrne.
Because of the departure of the then senior curator of conservation Dr
Nathan Stolow, Allan Byrne became acting senior curator. When Allan
Byrne took up the position of lecturer in paintings conservation at
C.C.A.E., Ilse King then became acting senior curator and my
supervisor; the division within the painting section was then
disbanded.
Jac Macnaughtan departed temporarily from the department to undertake
study and to work at the Tate Gallery and at the Courtauld Institute
in London leaving me with the paintings section.
I was fortunate enough to have at first one assistant Simon Hartas,
then two assistants, Mark Henderson and Les Cormack to help with the
task of backing, framing and restretching paintings.
There was no formal training programme for an intern - work was
undertaken as it came into the department and as it was allotted.
For the sake of simplicity and ease of handling the dissertation is
divided into 3 parts:
Part 1 includes the Functions and Facilities of the conservation
department.
Part 2 includes an outline of painting conservation practice within
the gallery and details of conservation work undertaken.
Part 3 comprises a project on some of the properties of hardboard.
As the gallery has in its collection a considerable number of
paintings on hardboard, to augment my knowledge and perhaps give some
insight into the nature of hardboard, this project was undertaken in
conjunction with the internship.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian National Gallery</field><field name="subject">painting conservation</field><field name="subject">internship</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.162330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Literary representations in western Polynesia : colonialism and
              indigeneity</field><field name="creator">Vaai, Sina Mary Theresa</field><field name="description">Images of Oceania and Polynesia have traditionally been exoticised and
romanticised by Western representations of a "paradise" populated by primitive
natives with grass skirts and ukuleles. However, the movement towards
political independence in the 1960s and 1970s has seen the emergence of a
corpus of indigenous representations that depict and portray the real situation.
These indigenous representations speak of subjugation and moreover testify to
the debilitating effects colonialism has on cultural identities.
The geographical area covered by this thesis is Western Polynesia,
specifically the Pacific Island nations of Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa and is
concerned with literary representations.
The thesis examines significant developments and trends in the
creative writing of indigenous and migrant writers in these three countries of
Western Polynesia: Western Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, seeing these literary
representations from within as a writing out of multi-faceted aspects of the
shifting identities of Pacific peoples in a post-colonial world.
The introduction focuses on the historical colonial/post-colonial context
of Western Polynesian writing and the socio-political imperatives for change
which have had an impact on these writers and the texts they have produced. It
also discusses the literary and anthropological representation of these
Islanders from the 'outside', from the perspective of a European hegemonic
self, forming the 'orientalist' stereotypes against which the initial texts written by
the Pacific's colonised 'others' in the early 1970's reacted so strongly. Chapter
One sets out the conceptual framework within which these texts will be
discussed and analysed, beginning with indigenous and local concepts which
indigenous and migrant Pacific Islanders use to connect and accommodate
different 'ways of seeing' this representative body of literature, then moving on
to other theorists concerned with literary representation and post-coloniality.
Chapters Two to Nine explore the writing of these three countries,
beginning with the fiction of Albert Wendt, one of the major writers from
Western Polynesia who has an established regional and international literary
reputation, and then progressing to focus on other selected representative
writers of the three countries, including those in the early stages of attempting
publication.
The thesis concludes by discussing the texts from all three countries and
tying them together in the various thematic strands of cultural clash, the
widening of borders, the quest for self-definition and national identity in the
contemporary Pacific, reiterating major points and examining possible future
directions in Western Polynesian writing.
The study takes an interdisciplinary approach to the critical analysis of
Western Polynesian literature, maintaining the importance of seeing them as
important forms of cultural communication in post-colonial contexts, as literary
representations from the inside, writing out of a cultural consciousness which
values the various 'pasts' of Polynesia as definitive 'maps' which provide the
grids and bridges which Pacific Islanders in this part of Oceania can utilise to
mediate their experiences and articulate their identities, to fit the widening
boundaries of the Pacific into a post-colonial global context.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literary representations</field><field name="subject">western Polynesia</field><field name="subject">colonialism</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.163049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a model of community development for health promotion</field><field name="creator">Van Der Heide, George</field><field name="description">The thesis is concerned with finding strategies of community development suitable
for health promotion and a matching method of evaluation. The thesis contains
two literature reviews. The first examines the history and practice of community
development, the problems in the field of drug abuse prevention, especially in its
evaluation, and recent developments in health promotion within the context of the
new public health movement. The second literature review chapter examines
qualitative methodology and in particular recent developments in the use of case
studies. The design of the study in the thesis utilises multiple-case studies and
explanation-building with data matrix construction as the method of analysis. Two
multiple case studies of thirteen and twelve cases respectively use data from the
Community Approach to Drug Abuse Prevention (CADAP) Project. Detailed
analysis of ten matrices are presented for the First Stage Multiple-Case Study and
three for the second. Major conclusions are drawn about how a successful performance
in the processes of preparation and training in community development
lead to later successful community activity. Whether the preparation and training
is done by staff of the CADAP Project or by trained staff of host organisations
makes no difference to this outcome. Conclusions are drawn about community
development in general, its application to health promotion and its evaluation.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.163647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Press coverage of social issues : am international comparative analysis</field><field name="creator">Vandermensbrugghe, Joelle</field><field name="description">This thesis offers an analysis of the reporting on unemployment, social welfare and
the environment in the quality press in Australia, Belgium, France and the United
Kingdom. The findings of this research are based on news about these issues
provided in a sample of two constructed weeks in 1998. The quality papers chosen
for analysis are: The Age and The Australian (Australia), De Standaard and Le Soir
(Belgium), Le Figaro and Le Monde (France), The Guardian and The Times
(England).
This thesis starts by examining the history and the principles governing the press in
the countries analysed, underlining the differences between the Anglo-Saxon and the
Continental press, mainly in terms of relations between the press and the State. It
questions the importance attributed to freedom of expression in a climate where the
concept is still analysed in terms of freedom from government intervention, while the
role played by business is generally accepted as unavoidable.
This research found that quality newspapers overall present social issues as primarily
economic issues, often neglecting their more social aspects. The world promoted is
one which is best run by business, while the role of governments as possible
managers of the environment and unemployment, and to some extent social welfare,
is largely dismissed. The press analysed does this with varying degrees, depending
on general attitudes held within countries and on the 'culture' of each newspaper.
This research clearly shows the existence of particular newspaper 'cultures'. Each
newspaper has its own priorities and news is generally framed according to those
priorities. Generally speaking, the emphasis placed by journalists on certain aspects
of news is in line with the 'culture' of the newspaper they are working for. The
choice of sources of information used to provide news also fits within existing
newspapers' 'cultures'.
The dominant economic emphasis put on information is systematically endorsed by
Le Figaro, The Australian, The Times and De Standaard. Only Le Monde and The
Guardian, Le Soir and The Age at times offer alternative views, while endorsing the
dominant economic frame. Le Monde and The Guardian, which are also the only two
newspapers of the sample that are not part of a big media consortium, regularly stress
the social aspect of unemployment and social welfare. These are also the only two
newspapers which consider the environment as a long-term quality of life issue,
reflecting that it is more than just an economic issue. Le Soir and The Age, which are
the two newspapers in our sample with a more local emphasis, also defend the local
environment against larger economic interests, and explore local social problems
related to unemployment and poverty.
In the case of The Age, this fits into a frame very common in the Australian press:
that of an uncaring government. Australian papers are very critical and even cynical
towards government and politicians. This cynicism is not found in the European
papers.
The findings of this research are based upon an analysis of the sources of information
used by the newspapers, as well as upon an analysis of the frames adopted. This
research has put a particular emphasis on sources of information, seen here as the
promoters of news frames. General professional practices, together with the
'cultures' held by particular newspapers, account for the lack of representation of
private citizens and lobby groups challenging economic interests. In turn their lack of
representation can be held responsible for the small amount of information
conflicting with dominant framing and dominant themes provided in the news.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social issues</field><field name="subject">press coverage</field><field name="subject">international comparative analysis</field><field name="subject">unemployment</field><field name="subject">social welfare</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.164209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kangaroos, koalas and business tycoons : Australia and

European press, particularly in the light of Australia's recent emphasis on
being a clever country, within the Asia Pacific region.
The research is based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of all articles
explicitly referring to Australia, in seven newspapers from Belgium (2),
France (2), Germany (1) and the United Kingdom (2), over a 6 month period.
The main hypothesis was that those newspapers without Australian based
correspondents or stringers picture Australia in a stereotypical way and that
"news" in those papers, instead of giving "news", reinforces existing ideas
and images held of Australia. My research supports the hypothesis, but also
uncovers the very important role played by editors at home. They decide
what is important, what is news and their choice will go to consonant
"news".
The research shows that newspapers in Europe largely portray Australia's
older images, with its kangaroos, koalas and beaches peopled by sportsmen.
Australia is largely portrayed as an almost untouched country inhabited by
animals to be found nowhere else, and by people (mainly white Anglo-
Saxon males) reputed for their friendliness, as well as for their laziness and
sometimes their strangeness. "Newer" images of Australia promoted by the
Australian government (e.g. Australia as a clever country and part of the
Asia-Pacific region) get relatively little coverage in the Western European
press.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">western European press</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">newspapers</field><field name="subject">media portrayals</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.164721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of cohesion in English and Vietnamese texts</field><field name="creator">Van, Ngo Thi Thanh</field><field name="description">This study aims at comparing English and Vietnamese cohesion
with the hope that it may contribute to the teaching and learning
of English in Vietnam.
It is hoped that the results of the study may help the teacher and
student to become more aware of cohesive devices in English
texts and thus make better use of them in the teaching and
learning of the English language.
The study reveals that the two languages have several similar
features in cohesion. It also points out the differences of
cohesion in texts of the two languages.
The first chapter is an introductory part in which background to
the study, the aim of the study, the source of information, and
the objectives and content of the study are presented.
Chapter 2 deals with the theoretical background related to the
study. Concepts such as text and cohesion are presented.
Chapter 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 discuss the five cohesive relations in
English and Vietnamese; that is. reference, substitution, ellipsis,
conjunction, and lexical cohesion.
In chapter 8. a comparison of English and Vietnamese cohesion
based on the analysis in chapters 3. 4. 5, 6 and 7 is made. As
well as this, it looks at common errors in the use of cohesive
devices made in the English writing of Vietnamese students at
the University of Canberra.
In the last section, the conclusion, the author tries to offer
some implications based on the results of the previous sections
and on the author's experience of teaching and learning foreign
languages. It is hoped that the implications may be of
significance to Vietnamese teachers and students of English.
And furthermore, that the analysis of cohesion in Vietnamese
may be beneficial to foreign students learning Vietnamese as a
foreign language.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">texts</field><field name="subject">cohesion</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.165600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening comprehension : a Vietnamese perspective</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thi Van</field><field name="description">A newly emerging, developing country has many high priority

the educational system. Education is viewed by many
political leaders (and also by citizens rich and poor) as
a 'Golden Key' which will unlock doors labelled with words
such as 'Development', 'Progress', 'Success', and 'the
English Language'.
The English Language, a modern technical, trade and
diplomatic language, is one of the avenues of communication
which may enhance development within Vietnam.
At the present moment, foreign language teaching and
especially Teaching English as a Foreign Language and
Teaching English for Special/Specific purposes, are given
high priority ratings by those who plan the development
stages for Vietnam. It is also recognized that EFL and ESP
teaching can and should be improved.
Australia is assisting this process of improvement by
supporting an assistance programme. Twenty two teachers
from tertiary language centres have been studying Teaching
English as a Foreign Language at the Canberra College of
Advanced Education. This writer is one of these students.
One of the requirements for the Master's Degree in
Teaching English as a Foreign Language is an extended

within four separate organisations. Three of these organisations were
participants in the Federal Government's Affirmative Action Pilot Program in
1984/5, and one was not.
It has been shown that change occurred in a continuous developmental
sequence, here called an "Affirmative Action Continuum", within each of
these six dimensions over the period of study, with each organisation
following a similar sequence of movement. Exceptions occurred where an
organisation made no movement at all, or where one or more of the
sequential processes was omitted or displaced, in a dimension. The
reasons for some of these exceptions, and some of their consequences for
later action, have been explored.
It has been shown that simultaneous activity occurred across several,
dimensions, so that no organisation acted upon only one dimension in
isolation from all others. There was some chronological sequencing between
dimensions.
The indicators of movement along the Affirmative Action Continuum within
each dimension were used to describe the change process in each
organisation. These indicators proved to be useful both in this regard,
and in placing each organisation an the Affirmative Action Continuum in
each dimension at two different points in time. In this way, the
indicators' usefulness was shown to generalise to four very different
institutions, thus suggesting applicability beyond the bounds of this
particular study.

               of prints</field><field name="creator">Vergara, Jose</field><field name="description">This research into intaglio printing, its materials and
techniques, deals with the three main conservation
problems specific to the process. They are: acidity of
the paper, buckling and/or tearing along the printed edge
of the plate caused by excess pressure during printing,
and yellow/brown staining, or halo, around the printed
image. Research done in the cause of this study reveals
that these problems are not confined to contemporary
printmaking practices, as believed by some conservators,
but can be traced back to the historic beginnings of the
Intaglio Printing.
The results of the analyses and tests performed in this
investigation indicate that these problems can be
partially, if not completely, eliminated by simple and
inexpensive improvements to the process of printing.
1 - An alkaline solution, used to dampen the paper prior
to printing, will act as a buffer, making the paper
resistant to future attack from acids. Importantly, it
will also accelerate the drying of the ink, which is
essential to the production of a thick solid ink-film.
2 - Excessive pressure during printing destroys the
natural resilience of the paper within the printed area
and should be kept to a minimum. Plates that have not
been bevelled sufficiently can also be very harmful to
the paper, cutting and/or tearing paper fibres. These
problems are not visually evident after printing, but are
ultimately very detrimental to the life of the print.
3 - The traditional method of drying prints, between
blotters and under weight, is a major cause of the
yellow/brown staining, or halo, formed around the printed
image. The vehicle in the ink, a product of linseed oil,
normally dries by polymerization and oxidation reaction
with oxygen from the atmosphere. Press-drying retards this
reaction causing the paper to absorb part of the vehicle.
Air-drying accelerates the drying process, producing a
much thicker and stronger ink-film and reducing absorption
of the vehicle into the paper. Although air-drying will
produce buckling, this can be easily remedied after seven
days by dampening the print and press-drying.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intaglio printing</field><field name="subject">printing process</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.172054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Privatization and development in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Waiyasusri, Pharuhat</field><field name="description">This research essay is intended to examine the link between
privatization and development in Thailand . It found that privatization in Thailand
can come in many forms. The government has tried to bring the private sector to
participate in infrastructural development to help relieve the government's
financial burdens. But it appeared that privatization still has a small role in
national development through infrastructural development This is because the
government does not have a clear policy to define the role of the private sector and
the public sector in this issue. In addition , Thailand's experience in bringing the
private sector to participate in infrastructural development through the methods
such as BTO(build-transfer-operate) and BOT(build-operate-transfer) has caused
many problems which have had an adverse effect on many projects. The paper
found that the state still retains its role as the developmental state . This can be
seen from the fact that the state has no intention to divest state enterprises which
it considers as important. Furthermore, state enterprises will continue to play a
major role in national development . However, the trend of state enterprises in
Thailand will move towards corporatization and commercialization in which more
state enterprises will change their status to state-owned companies and focus on
commercialization with a view to increasing their efficiency through competition
with the private sector.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">privatization</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.172544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiencing English through poetry : an integrated approach for EFL in China</field><field name="creator">Wang, Keping</field><field name="description">Like any other genre of literature, poetry straddles
two provinces. It can be considered to be one of the
arts or one of the humanities. When viewed as the
former, it consists essentially of a piece of verbal
art. When regarded as the latter, it is the expression
of human values and experiences.
Taking into account a real EFL situation in China, this
field study is intended to offer an integrated approach
for experiencing English through poetry.
This approach is actually a mixture, a combination of
two parental models - the linguistic and critical.
Since its key objective is to assist Chinese EFL
students to advance their target language performance,
it will inevitably focus on investigating the operation
of language in various literary communication components,
such as lexical choice, placement, polysemy, and association
in a poetic context. Nevertheless, it will also
attempt to help the students develop their literary
appreciation by reading poetry with critical scrutiny
of the message it aims to convey.
As a whole, through close examination of poetic diction
and function, it is supposed not only to heighten the
students' awareness of the "magic power" of words, but
also to increase their sensibility to the human
condition and aesthetic elements which are part of
the poets' artistry.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">English a a foreign language</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">poetry</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.173043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Questacon explainers : a study of the role of explainers at Questacon Science Centre, Canberra</field><field name="creator">Wanless, Jennifer H. F.</field><field name="description">The first participatory or inter-active science centre
in Australia was Questacon, which operated in Canberra for
the eight years, 1980-1988. Its very success lead to its
demise: it became the inspiration for the National Science and Technology Centre which opened in late 1988. Questacon,
in common with many of the World's new breed of science
centres and museums, was modelled on San Francisco's famous
Exploratorium. These new institutions have copied ideas and
even actual exhibits from the Exploratorium, but most of
them have failed to copy the Exploratorium's use of
Explainers, a feature which Exploratorium staff think is
integral to the whole concept. Questacon is one of the
institutions in which an explainer system was established,
although it differed in some significant respects from that
at the Exploratorium.
Participatory science centres have been seen as part of
the answer to the problem of increasing public awareness and
understanding of science. There is a growing body of
literature which is concerned with the learning of science
in informal educational settings, such as in these centres,
but there has been very little work done on the role of
museum docents or their equivalents in this learning. One
study of the Exploratorium's Explainers concentrated on the
value of their work as explainers for the people involved in
the system, in terms of their own personal development.
The aim of the present study was to compare the two
explainer systems and to investigate the work of Questacon
Explainers both in terms of their own personal development
and in their interaction with visitors to the centre.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">Questacon Science Centre</field><field name="subject">explainers</field><field name="subject">National Science and Technology Centre</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.173533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The literature of fact : a study of the representations of

study of the representation of Chinese society in a selection of
Australian fiction and non-fiction writings, based on the
assumption that how China is represented is as important as
what is represented. The three works that will be used to
represent travel literature, journalism and the novel are: The
East Is Red by Maslyn Williams, Real Life China by Richard
Thwaites, and the Avenue of Eternal Peace by Nicholas Jose,
all of which have been written by contemporary Australian
writers. The study re-examines the obligations and meanings
inherent in each of these genres, and discusses .these writers'
individual ways of experimenting with the genres in which
they write in order to cope with the complexity, ambiguity,
and the fictionally of reality. These works are analysed in
detail within two frameworks: the writers' relationships to
their writings, and the relationship between the text and the
external world, leading to the realization of the increasingly
important role writers' consciousness plays in reshaping and
fictionalizing their personal experience, as well as the
recognition of the increasingly important role fictionalization
plays in the representation of Chinese society in both fiction

participatory philosophy is working in practice in the ACT
school system. In particular, at the local level, does
the parent community have the power in decision-making
that is accorded them in theory?
The field study begins by setting out some
aspects of bureaucratic theory and contrasting models of
participation. It goes on to look at the philosophy
underlying the new ACT system of education and its
deliberate rejection of the traditional, highly
centralized systems of the States in favour of a
particular participatory model, participation as decisionmaking.
Such a model involves putting decision-making in
the hands of those most affected by the decisions. In
individual schools this means the parents, the teachers,
the students and the community.
The bulk of this study is devoted to
documenting a case study of a school in conflict with the
Schools Authority because it is during conflict that the
realities of power in a system are revealed. The crisis
in this case revolved around the proposal by the Schools
Authority to move an alternative secondary school into a
semi-vacant former infants building of an inner-city
primary school. The majority of the parent community at
the primary school were against the proposal. After
several joint meetings between the Boards of the two
schools and the Schools Authority, the Schools Authority
decided to go ahead with the move despite the opposition
of the primary school community.
The final section of this study deals with an
analysis of the participatory processes that were enacted
at both the school level and the Authority level, in the
resolution of the conflict. It would certainly appear
that in this particular example both parties to the
dispute moved outside the model of participation as
decision-making. The Schools Authority appeared to be
operating under the rationale of administrative expediency
and using a participatory model foreign to the intention
of the system, in which no real power was accorded to the
parent community. The school, having lost faith in the
participatory model as used by the Schools Authority,
resorted to familiar bureaucratic lobbying practices.
The study concludes that the real system in
this case deviated from the participatory model of its
founders. It raises the issue of how typical this case
study might be of the system as a whole, and what the
implications of this would be for the future of the ACT
Schools Authority.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">participatory processes</field><field name="subject">school community</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.174911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Principal facilitator behaviour in curriculum implementation</field><field name="creator">Warren, Stan</field><field name="description">In the past ten years the emergence of studies in the area of
effective schools has focused a good deal of attention on the
role adopted by principals in the process of change. Few can
deny the importance of this role in the development and
implementation of new/changing curriculum statements. This
is especially noticeable in schools that are part of a large
'centralised' system.
This study is concerned with the role adopted by four
principals in schools in Wollongong N.S.W. where a new
syllabus in Writing K-6 was being implemented. It examined
the implementation activities used and then focused
specifically on the role adopted by the principal in that
process.1
To enable the success or otherwise of the implementation
activities to be identified, the C-BAM techniques developed by
Hall, Hord et al were modified and used. The role adopted by
each of the four principals was then considered in an effort to
identify the contribution it made to the implementation
activities.
The findings suggest that the principal does play a significant
role in Curriculum Implementation and that he/she needs
additional skills and understandings to enable the process used
to be successful. It is recommended that the C-BAM techniques
would be one useful tool that principals could use.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Principals</field><field name="subject">curriculum implementation</field><field name="subject">Wollongong</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">C-BAM</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061109.175407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical outcomes of theoretical teaching of the nursing process in a tertiary programme</field><field name="creator">Bettiens, Rosanne</field><field name="description">Problem: While the educational preparation of students
in a tertiary nursing programme was the general focus of the
study, the specific concern was with the degree to which
students in the first and third year of the programme
implemented all aspects of the nursing process in their
delivery of patient care. The study developed out of a need
to evaluate the effectiveness of theoretical teaching in
regard to the students' ability to implement theoretical
principles in clinical practice. The desired outcome of the
study is that the data will be useful in developing more
appropriate and effective teaching approaches that will
result in improved clinical nursing practice.
Methodology A survey of patients receiving nursing
care from students in the first and third year of their
programme was conducted on completion of a one week block of
clinical experience for both groups of students. A
questionnaire was the instrument of data collection.
Factors included in the study were the patients' perceptions
of the students' attention to four of the five phases of the
nursing process: assessment, diagnosis, planning and
evaluation. Questions addressing the degree of patient
involvement in all of these phases were included throughout
the questionnaire. Questionnaires were returned from twenty
nine of the thirty one patients surveyed in the first year
student group and from thirty of the thirty one patients
surveyed in the third year student group; constituting a
93.5 percent and a 96.7 percent response respectively.
Results The scores achieved by each group of students
were compared against scores determined by the researcher to
indicate realistic educational and professional standards of
practice in each specified section and comparisons were also
made between the two students groups to identify development
of practice over the education programme. Scores indicated
that:
1. Within each section of the study both student groups
scored below the expected level on certain items, the
most notable deficiencies being related to the aspects
of patient empowerment through informing and involving.
2. The third year student group scored overall higher
than the first year students in regard to attention
to the more 'technical' aspects of the nursing process,
but did not give the same degree of attention to the
'human' aspects, scoring equal to, or lower than their
less experienced colleagues.
Conclusions:
1. There are apparent philosophical differences between
the graduates of the 'old style' training system and those
involved in the tertiary nursing programme in regard to the
individualization of patient care and the allocation of
priorities within a time frame.
2. Clinical application of theoretical principles relies
heavily on the reinforcement of these principles by the
clinical teacher/supervisor. There is a need for these
clinical supervisors to have:
(a) a better understanding of the educational objectives
for students in the clinical settings, and
(b) assistance towards developing teaching/organizational
strategies that will guide the student towards
objective attainment when such abilities are not
developed.
Recommendations: Among the recommendations presented
were:
1. that the nursing discipline within the university make
formal and informal opportunities to inform all clinicians
of the changes in nursing education and the implications
these changes have on the overall approach to the delivery
of patient care.
2. that there is an increased emphasis on the educational
preparation of the clinical supervisors and that their
commitment to the students' achievement of the clinical
objectives is enhanced through involvement in programme
planning and evaluation.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing education</field><field name="subject">clinical outcomes</field><field name="subject">theoretical teaching</field><field name="subject">tertiaty nursing programme</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.094014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of personality factors to the educational orientation of adult educators</field><field name="creator">Hoogendoorn, Anne Roberta</field><field name="description">This research study was in the field of adult education,
focusing on the role of adult educators. Sixty four adult
educators in the Australian Capital Territory, from a wide
range of institutions took part in the study. The
educational orientation of the adult educators, on an
andragogical-pedagogical continuum, was measured by The
Educational Orientation Questionnaire, (Hadley, 1974). This
test was based on Knowles, theory of andragogy "the art and
science of helping adults learn" and its corollary,
pedagogy, "the art of teaching children" (Knowles, 1985).
The E.O.Q. tested adult educators' attitudes in six areas of
education to discover the extent to which educators were
more andragogical or pedagogical in their orientation. Four
personality dimensions of adult educators were measured by
The Personal Style Inventory (Champagne and Hogan, 1979) - a
test based on Jung's theory of psychological types. The
data was analysed and four null hypotheses were tested. Two
were rejected and two were accepted. The findings revealed
that there was a statistically significant correlation at
the .01 level of significance, showing a definite
relationship between two of the dimensions,
extraversion-introversion and sensing-intuition, and the
educational orientation of adult educators: extraversion
and intuition with a more andragogical orientation and
introversion and sensing with a more pedagogical
orientation. The interpretation of these findings raised
numerous questions and issues on the role of adult educators
as well as recommendations for further research on the
correlation of other variables with the educational
orientation of adult educators.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult education</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">adult educators</field><field name="subject">educational orientation</field><field name="subject">Personal Style Inventory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.095037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 1989 literacy support program in the ACT TAFE</field><field name="creator">Chittock, Rae</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">literacy support program</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.095439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and validation of guidelines for special education support teachers</field><field name="creator">Driscoll, Sue</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">guidelines</field><field name="subject">support teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.100316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' attitudes towards single-sex and co-educational schools</field><field name="creator">Meuller, Fiona J.</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">single-sex schools</field><field name="subject">co-educational schools</field><field name="subject">teachers' attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.100834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation internship in

Applied Science in Materials Conservation were completed
in the Materials Conservation laboratory of
the Australian Museum under the direction of Miss Sue
Walston between November 30th, 1981 and July 9th,
1982.
The work programme focused upon the preparation
of artefacts for a permanent gallery display
entitled "The Abelam, a people of Papua New Guinea".
Wooden carvings, shell ornaments, bone implements,
ceramic and coconut bowls, and wooden spears were the
most common artefact types requiring treatment, prior
to display. Many objects were decorated with pigments,
shells, beads or feathers and were secured with plied
fibre string. Artefacts were photographed , condition
and proposed treatment reports were written, practical
work was carried out and final treatment reports were
finished.
Upon completion of the gallery, the Materials
Conservation laboratory staff reviewed their role in
the overall gallery plan. As a group, the problems
affecting the conservation and display of artefacts
were identified and analysed. A flow chart of exhibition
guidelines for Materials Conservation was prepared
for use when planning future galleries.
The relative humidity and temperature were
monitored regularly in various areas throughout the
museum. Accurate readings were obtained using a sling
psychrometer and thermohygrographs. Each week the
modes of the relative humidity charts were calculated,
analysed and recorded.
While treating objects for the Abelarn gallery,
the need for specifically coloured support materials
became evident. Dye types capable of permanently
colouring a diverse range of cellulosic materials were
investigated. Trichromatic colour cards were prepared
for each material.
A flood occurred in the Aboriginal gallery
which required immediate action by the conservation
staff. Affected artefacts were transported to the
laboratory, stabilized and reports on their condition
were written.
A workshop on microscopic examination of
cellulosic materials was organized by Mary-Lou Florian,
Conservation Scientist with the British Columbia
Provincial Museum, Canada. She also gave a lecture at
the Forestry Commission of N.S.W. on Conservation of
Aboriginal carved trees and Canadian totem poles.
Dr. P. Casey presented information on fungi to
the Australian Museum Conservation staff.

view, significant educational problems: how to tease out
and analyse those principles, concerning equity and social
justice, which underlie a particular program of teacher education. I want to discuss the kinds of principles,
issues and considerations which have to be faced when
designing such a program as the Diploma of Teaching (Early
Childhood Education) for Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander students at James Cook University. The issues I
will address are these:
(a) The extent to which the notion of equality of
educational opportunity is being addressed in the
provision of teacher-education programs in
Queensland in general, and James Cook University in
particular; (chapter 1).
(b) Ways in which the Diploma of Teaching (Early
Childhood Education) p r o g r am aims to produce
teachers able to act as agents of bi-cultural
transmission; (chapters 2 and 3).
(c) The value, usefulness and desirability of James
Cook University setting up a teacher-education
program specifically for Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander students from geographically remote
communities, thus increasing the participation
rates of Aborigines and Islanders in teacher-education programs; (chapters 4 and 5).
This process of analysis has led me to structure the
thesis around three dimensions:
(i) The historical context of the program;
(ii) The program as one response to the problems
faced by educational institutions in meeting
the educational needs of Aboriginal people;
(iii) A basis for the next phase in the development
of new programs of teacher - education for
indigenous students living in remote
communities.
This is a qualitative research project, based on my
interpretation of available documentation, my use of
relevant literature, and my own involvement as planner of,
and teacher in the program. It is not a quantitative
research project. The structure of the thesis has, as its
introduction, an analysis of the extremely complex situation
which exists at James Cook University. This analysis leads
to a search for a set of principles to provide the
theoretical underpinning of the program, which in turn leads
through a combination of theory and practice to the "praxis"
of the program as a model of equity and educational practice
in teacher-education. The thesis is concluded by the
presentation of the current stage in the development of a
program for teacher-education students in remote
communi ties.
The conceptual framework for my thesis has been
developed through my determination to increase my
understanding of the complexities of developing teacher-education
programs for indigenous students at James Cook
University. The thesis is developed through case study
techniques including: personal observation and recording of
my work as Program Planner; a situational analysis of the
historical background, leading up to the development of the
Diploma of Teaching (Early Childhood Education) ; a
discussion of the stages through which the development team
proceeded with intentionality and empathy towards its task
of constructing a specific program of teacher-education; and
my use of existing literature to comprehend the educational
and social problems which the program attemted to
alleviate.
Throughout my thesis the specificity of the "case", and
the eclectic position I have adopted, have acted as
boundaries of my conceptual framework. My thesis attempts
to show that the "case" of the development of teacher-education
programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
students at James Cook University, although an idiosyncratic
instance , is valuable as illumination , if not for
generalisation, and thus has a credibility and usefulness.
The characteristics of the case-study method are
frequently more appropriate to expansion is than
reductionist activities, and I have tried to show how the
different perspectives of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
people, together with the beliefs, attitudes and values of
such different interest-groups as university academics,
Commonwealth and State Education Department bureaucrats, and
teachers and parents in schools, have emphasised both the
importance of questioning assumptions and the importance of
critical, experiential understanding.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher education programs</field><field name="subject">James Cook University</field><field name="subject">North Queensland</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.103136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Properties and dating of silica skins associated with rock art</field><field name="creator">Watchman, Alan Leslie</field><field name="description">Hydrated amorphous silicon dioxide (Si02.nH-,O), or opal-A, is deposited naturally
from seepage and runoff water as white or brown rock surface coatings, called 'skins',
that often partly obscure rock paintings and engravings, but occasionally, a thin
translucent silica skin can form a protective film over rock art. White lustrous silica
skins, less than 1 mm thick, occur where seepage water regularly flows from bedding
and joint planes, whereas much thinner brown skins form on the sides of boulders and
cliffs where runoff water periodically flows. To find the degree of silica skin variability
and to determine how climate and rock type affect the properties of silica skins I
collected samples at seven Australian and two Canadian rock painting sites that were
located in temperate, tropical and sub-arctic regions. The skins had developed on
sandstone, quartzite, schist, gneiss and migmatite. I studied the effects of the skins on
rock art stability, documented their compositions, textures and structures to establish
their common properties, and searched for a way to date the silica which would provide
an indication of the minimum age of the underlying art. 1 also made replication
experiments to determine factors that influence the properties of artificial silica skins
and the rates of their precipitation so that I could propose a mechanism for natural silica
skin formation, and ascertain whether an artificial silica skin could act as a protective
rock art conservation measure.
I was able to subdivide the analysed samples into silica skin Types I, II and III on the
basis of their colour (translucent, white or brown), composition (SiO2, Al2O3 and
absorbed water contents) and texture (smooth vitreous or vermiform). I propose that
silica skins initially begin to form on stable rock surfaces by a process involving a
combination of evaporation- and ionic-induced polymerisation of silicic acid in seepage
and runoff water. Condensation reactions, random clustering of small silica spheres
and deposition of the resulting aggregates eventually produce a thin surficial silica film.
Deposition of silica often traps micro-organisms that live in the damp seepage and
runoff water zones, and these fossils in finely laminated skins enable the radiocarbon
dating of silica deposition, and therefore the dating of rock paintings enclosed by silica.
Micro-excavation of silica layers associated with rock art combined with accelerator
mass spectrometry gave preliminary radiocarbon determinations that were either
consistent with, or contradicted, prevailing opinions about the antiquity of the rock art
at selected sites. Experiments using a laser technique for combusting fossilised microorganisms
in finely laminated skins were unable to generate sufficient carbon for
dating. Catalysis of a mixture of equal proportions of methyl-trimethoxy silane and
water produces a translucent stable film that may be suitable as a consolidant, whereas
other artificial silica skins made from silica glass and tetra-ethoxy silane develop microfractures
on drying, and these are unsuitable as rock art consolidants.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silica skins</field><field name="subject">rock art</field><field name="subject">dating</field><field name="subject">hydrated amorphous silicon dioxide</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.104443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dissemination of an innovation : the structured experiences for use in the classroom project</field><field name="creator">Watson, Hugh J.</field><field name="description">This field study investigates the dissemination of an

and the advantages of this approach are documented
in the case studies in Part II.
The conclusions from this field study raise questions and seek

advances in the theory of ideology. These have developed
in the wake of the seminal work of the French Marxist
philosopher, Louis Althusser. They have attempted to continue
the insights found in Althusser's attack on empiricist
epistemoloqy and in his theory of the formation of human
subjectivity.
The central argument of this thesis is that the theory
of ideology, in terms of the "constitution of the subject",
is a valuable breakthrough which allows the concept of
ideology to be extended beyond its traditional (class)
parameters. However, the anti-empiricist epistemology which
has removed the object (ie. the material referent) from the
theory of ideology, has been a regressive step since it has
rendered the whole enterprise idealist. The standpoint of:
this thesis is a materialist one which forcefully maintains
that the real world is directly implicated in the knowledge
produced by social practices. Therefore, the theory of
ideology must include a concept of representations of that
real world if it is to be fully materialist.
This thesis does not explicitly present a materialist
theory of ideology. Instead, it examines the theoretical
principles of these recent advances and shows how they
ultimately degenerate into idealism at crucial points. The
thesis then employs some of my empirical interview material
and proceeds to show that the concrete application of these
theoretical principles also leads to idealist research
practices. The thesis concludes by suggesting that there
is, nevertheless, something of value in these recent
advances which a materialist research practice can incorporate.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theory of ideology</field><field name="subject">subject</field><field name="subject">object</field><field name="subject">materialist critique</field><field name="subject">Althusserian</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.105417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae outer membrane protein analysis, isolation, characterisation and vaccine potential</field><field name="creator">Webb, Dianne</field><field name="description">Heterogeneity in immunodominant outer membrane proteins has been
proposed as a significant factor in the failure of an NTHi infection to induce
immune protection against subsequent infections. This study has examined
the vaccine potential of three outer membrane proteins in an attempt to
identify conserved regions that could be targeted by an immune response
after vaccination. The three proteins investigated were: TbpB, P5 and P48
(HI0164). The optimal route of immunisation in clearing a bolus inoculum
of NTHi to the lung in the rat has been shown to be a combination of gut
sensitisation with a respiratory boost and this regime was used in the present
study.
A panel of NTHi isolates was assessed to determine the frequency with
which strains were able to bind transferrin and thus be targeted by a TbpBspecific
immune response. A high proportion of strains was able to bind
transferrin with similar frequencies in isolates associated with infection and
those from normal throat swabs. A protocol was developed to purify
nonlipidated recombinant TbpB from NTHi using a glutathione-Stransferase
(GST)-rTbpB fusion protein and Glutathione-Sepharose affinity
chromatography. Mucosal-directed immunisation with rTbpB significantly
enhanced clearance of an NTHi challenge to the lung, however, whilst
rTbpB-specific antibodies were cross-reactive on Western immunoblots, the
cross-reactivity was variable in both transferrin binding inhibition assays and
bactericidal activity. This suggested that the rTbpB-specific humoral response
would be variable in the recognition of heterologous NTHi isolates.
The secondary structure of P5 has been controversial with several reports
suggesting that P5 was a fimbrin protein composed of coiled coils. In this
present study the interstrain variation in P5 amongst isolates from diverse
anatomical sites, as well as computer prediction methods and
spectrophotometric analysis, generated a model of P5 based on the
homologous E. coli protein, OmpA. This model suggested a B-barrel
conformation with no evidence of coiled coils. Synthetic peptides
corresponding to conserved regions of P5 that were thought to be surface
exposed, as well as a region (H3) with some homology to a protective epitope
in the P. aeruginosa protein, OprF, were then combined with a
"promiscuous" T cell epitope from the measles virus F protein (MVF) and
used for immunisation studies. Whilst variable protection was seen with the
peptides, the MVF/H3 peptide was the most efficacious of the antigens
assessed in this study in enhancing clearance of NTHi. This occurred in the
absence of detectable peptide- or PS-specific antibody leading to the
suggestion that cell mediated responses may have played an important role
in enhancing clearance in this model. The highly conserved nature of the
region in P5 represented by the H3 peptide suggests that further study should
be focused on this peptide as a potential NTHi vaccine candidate.
The last antigen, P48, is homologous to a A. pleuropneumoniae antigen,
AopA, which has been proposed to have potential as a vaccine component
against pleuropneumonia in pigs. Sequence analysis of the gene encoding
P48 from several isolates showed that this protein was well conserved.
Recombinant P48 was purified from a GST-rP48 fusion protein and used for
immunisation, which also conferred significant protection. However,
immunisation with rP48 was not as efficacious as immunisation with the
MVF/H3 peptide. Whilst immunisation with rP48 induced high antibody
titres, no bactericidal activity could be detected indicating that bactericidal
antibody had not contributed to the observed clearance. In addition, the rP48-
specific serum IgG was predominantly of the IgG2a isotype suggesting that
Thl cell mediated responses had been induced by immunisation with rP48.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae</field><field name="subject">outer membrane proteins</field><field name="subject">immunisation</field><field name="subject">vaccines</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.105953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Provision of education and training opportunities for  youthworkers in the ACT : a study of policy development</field><field name="creator">Webber, Craig</field><field name="description">During the latter half of the twentieth century, youthwork has emerged as an
occupation responsible for the delivery of a broad variety of services for young
people. During the 1970's and 80's in particular, there has been a rapid
multiplication of the number of people employed in the role of youthworker.
As an occupation, youthwork has had placed upon it by society certain
expectations regarding the standard of the work performed. This is particularly
so with respect to the interaction between the youthworker and young people
with whom they work. This expectation is not unlike that placed upon other
occupations working directly with people (and young people), such as teachers
and social workers. It is a reasonable societal expectation that workers such as
teachers, social workers and youthworkers, should provide a service of a certain
standard, commensurate with the responsibility ascribed to the role of that
occupation.
Education and training is recognised as being fundamental to the attainment of
recognised standards of competency in both teaching and social work, as well as
many other occupations which have a direct service delivery role with people. A
spectrum of such opportunities have been developed and provided for these
occupations. There is an expectation that the practice of such occupations is
fundamentally linked with the education and training provided.
However, this has not been so with the youthwork occupation. The provision of
education and training has not grown with the expansion in the occupation.
Furthermore, the linkage between education and training, and practice, was not
recognised in this field for many years. Questions about how and why this has
occurred, and how and by whom it should be redressed, are to be explored in
this Study.
That youthwork is an occupation is a fact. There are thousands of youthworkers
employed around Australia. This Study asserts that the provision of education
and training opportunities provided for this occupation are inadequate in general.
A cohesive policy framework for such provision is also lacking.
Australian society sanctions the occupation of youthwork by providing millions
of dollars of resources per annum. It expects, rightly so, a quality standard of
performance from the occupation, and services who are employers. Monitoring
through formal evaluation and the application of performance indicators are part
and parcel of such resource allocation. But, the means to achieve such quality
standards - education and training - have not been adequately recognised or
provided. This situation is clearly anomalous, and must therefore be addressed
and resolved.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">youthworkers</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">policy development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.112745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morale within a health system</field><field name="creator">Webber, Daryl</field><field name="description">After outlining the structure of the Capital Territory Health Commission in Canberra, Australia and detailing the

examination reviews local research as well as overseas

morale to both quality of work life and quality of life
generally. The question of work within the local health
system is then investigated in detail using questionnaire
and search workshop procedures. The findings from these
two approaches both support and confirm each other,
thereby providing a comprehensive picture of the quality
of work life within the local health system. From the
results of these investigations the systemic nature of the
morale problem within the health system is noted and
discussed. The recommendations for remediation proposed
from within the system are examined and evaluated. The
study then explores the issue of potential conflict
between bureaucratically organised systems and the
delivery of effective health services. The study also
confirms the place of power, trust and communication in
changing morale. One conclusion is that continuing

helping the health service meet future objectives.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">Capital Territory Health Commission</field><field name="subject">morale</field><field name="subject">health system</field><field name="subject">work environments</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.113119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The research and development of a health assessment program for secondary school students</field><field name="creator">Webber, Kerry</field><field name="description">The Field Study reports on the research and development of a
Health Assessment Program (HAP) for secondary school
students over a period of three years in the ACT.
The 'original' HAP is described, and its early
implementation methods discussed. Changes are proposed and
trialled, and further refinements made, then trialled
again. Through this process a new HAP is developed. The
'Research and Development Cycle' (Borg and Gall 1983)
provides the theoretical framework for the planning of the
field study. (See 1.4).
The 'new' HAP exhibits the characteristics of an 'education'
program. The physical components have been developed to
enable them to be administered by the teachers who are
responsible for the organisation of the HAP in their school,
and health professionals are only used for those components
which require confidential counselling. This is in contrast
to the 'original' HAP which was organised and conducted by
health professionals.
The process by which the changes took place has determined
the quality of the new HAP. The developments have been
based on the views of the teachers who used the HAP, the
students who were tested, and the health professionals who
participated. The literature has also been used to provide
the direction for, and nature of, the changes. This process
has ensured a program which is highly suitable for use in
the school environment.
It is not envisaged that the HAP has reached its final stage
of development. Each school who uses the program is
encouraged to modify and adapt it to suit the needs of their
own teachers and students.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">health assessment program</field><field name="subject">secondary school students</field><field name="subject">HAP</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.113600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of colour systems to the perceptual

art classes in secondary schools face problems in manipulating paint
and discriminating colour. The kinds of base paints to be presented
to students could be an important factor in learning about colour
relationships and pigments.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether Year 7 students
generating colour mixes with paint using a triad of magenta, cyan
and yellow were able to mix and discriminate more colours than if
they used a triad of red(scarlet red), blue (ultramarine light) and
yellow (lemon yellow) which is a base triad commonly used in
schools.
The Weddell Colour Discrimination Test was developed for use in
this study which was a test that involved colour mixing with paint.
The study used quasi-experimental designs for both a pilot study and
a main study.
Results indicated a significant difference in the ability to mix paint
advantage of groups that used cyan , magenta and yellow.
Implications for the use of particular colour triads in art classrooms
and methods of teaching colour theory have emerged from this
study. The Weddell Colour Discrimination test instrument developed
in this study could be useful as both a diagnostic tool and a teaching

Australian Capital Territory High Schools regarding
their perceptions of who makes and who should make
decisions in their schools, the effectiveness of
present decision making structures and the relative
importance of a range of concerns that might be
affected by decisions made in their schools.
The survey instrument comprising of five separate
questionnaires (Parts A, B, C, D and E) was
administered to a random, stratified sample of 384
students drawn from three A.C.T. High Schools.
Variables included (a) School, (b) Year Group and (c)
Gender.
Part A and Part B of the survey instrument were
developed specifically to explore the perception of
students towards the involvement of parents, teachers,
the principal and students in school decision making
processes; particularly as this is evidenced in School
Board operations.
The results for each of the five questionnaires were
compiled into separate frequency and ranked percentage
tables. The tables were analysed in terms of the total
responses recorded for each questionnaire and as a
school by school comparison of responses. Use of the
Cochran Q Test indicated a positive statistical
significance in the overall shift of student
perceptions of decision making from Part A (What
happens in my school) to Part B (What should happen in
my school) of the survey instrument.
The findings of the study indicate that students are
concerned about their role in the decision making
process, and issues that affect their schooling and
would like a greater say in how their schools are run.
In particular, students would like to participate to a
greater degree than at present in decision making that
affects homework, the timetable, how teachers teach,
subjects offered, text books, and school sporting
activities.
As regards knowledge about decision making structures
within the school and about student representatives,
the findings indicate that the students surveyed are
not fully aware of the purpose or function of the
school board or its representatives. However the
majority of students surveyed indicate they would like
to have a greater say in how their schools are run.
In the comparative analysis of data recorded for each
of the schools surveyed, a considerable degree of
similarity is found in the responses to all Parts of
the survey instrument. Of major concern is the uniform
lack of knowledge and interest in survey items
connected with the School Board in each of the schools
surveyed. A more encouraging result is that in all
three schools respondents perceive that they are
encouraged to become involved in the School Board and
the Student Representative Council (SRC).
The survey findings demonstrate that the students would
like greater participation in a wide variety of issues
and concerns. However current official structures
which are designed to include students as equal
partners in school based decision making do not appear
to interest the majority of students surveyed in this
study.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.114343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study in the introduction of cable television : Taiwan, television and the international context</field><field name="creator">Wei, Jing-Huey</field><field name="description">Taiwan's new media have developed quickly since the mid-1980s.
However, media legislation has lagged behind the introduction of new
media technologies. For instance, the wide-spread but still entirely illegal
cable television-linked service, the Fourth Channel, is a unique feature of
the development of new media in Taiwan. This idiosyncratic situation in Taiwan's media industry cannot be simply described as due to the rapid

              schools : a retrospect</field><field name="creator">Welch, Ian</field><field name="description">The publication of the Curriculum Development Centre's
discussion paper 'Core Curriculum for Australian Schools' in June
1980 stimulated discussion of the concept of core curriculum in
Australia. The driving force came from the Foundation Director
of the CDC, Dr Malcolm Skilbeck. This study discusses the themes
and directions to which Skilbeck was committed through a study of
his work prior to his return to Australia in 1975 and his
subsequent writings.
The study considers Skilbeck's work against general thinking
on educational matters in Australia and overseas. The initial
discussion centres on Skilbeck's work in the United Kingdom prior
to 1975. This concludes that his views were moulded by his own
research on the American progressive educator John Dewey and that
Dewey's ideals of a democratic society moulded and sustained by a
democratic core curriculum have been dominant in all Skilbeck's
subsequent thinking. The study reviews the establishment,
working and conclusions of the CDC Core Curriculum and Values
Education Working Party.
In two subsequent chapters, the study looks at Skilbeck's
approach to cultural mapping and school-based curriculum
development as the two fundamental Planks of his approach to the
development and implementation of a core curriculum for
Australian schools. The study shows that Skilbeck's concept of
cultural mapping is helpful but does not succeed in providing an
effective basis for the articulation of national guidelines. In
consequence, the CDC did not succeed in providing a framework
sufficient to hold together the infinite range of possibilities
opened UP by school-based action.
The study considers the limited published reactions to the
CDC Paper. It notes that the termination of the CDC by the
Committee for Review of Commonwealth Functions in early 1931
prevented the fuller dissemination and debate of the topic during
19S1 and subsequently. The study notes that responses were
disaapointingly few and in many cases failed to address the
central questions raised by the CDC paper, in particular the idea
of national curriculum guidelines and their application through
school-based curriculum development. The major responses came in
the State of Victoria where local circumstances encouraged
discussion of the issues raised by the CDC.
The study concludes that the CDC discussion paper was a
valuable stimulus to discussion of curricular foundations at the
time it was released but represented a point of view that was not
fully understood or appreciated at the time. It laid the
foundation for the renaissance of the general concept as
'democratic curriculum' in 1986 and provides important
indications of the potential for the development of the
Participation and Equity Program.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">core curriculum</field><field name="subject">Australian schools</field><field name="subject">Malcolm Skilbeck</field><field name="subject">Curriculum Development Centre</field><field name="subject">CDC</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.121837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Promoting quality schooling in Australia : Commonwealth
              Government policy-making for schools (1987-1996)</field><field name="creator">Welsh, Mary</field><field name="description">Promoting the quality of school education has been an issue of international, national
and local significance in Australia over the past three decades. Since 1973 the pursuit
of quality in school education has been embedded in the rhetoric of educational
discourse and framed by the wider policy context.
This study focuses on the Commonwealth (federal) government's policy agenda to
promote the quality of schooling between 1987 and 1996. During this ten year period,
successive Labor governments sought to promote quality through a range of policy
initiatives and funding programs. Through extensive documentary research, fifty
semi-structured interviews and one focus group with elite policy makers and
stakeholders, the study examines how the Commonwealth government's 'quality
agenda' was constructed and perceived. An analysis of relevant government reports
and ministerial statements provides documentary evidence of this agenda, both in
terms of stated policy intentions and the actual policy initiatives and funding programs
set in place in the period 1987-1996. Set against this analysis are elite informants'
perspectives on Commonwealth policy-making in this period - how quality was
conceptualised as a policy construct and as a policy solution, the influences on
Commonwealth policies for schools, whether there was a 'quality agenda' and how
that agenda was constructed and implemented. Informants generally perceived quality
as a diffuse, but all-encompassing concept which had symbolic and substantive value
as a policy construct. In the context of Commonwealth schools' policies, quality was
closely associated with promoting equity, outcomes, accountability, national
consistency in schooling and teacher quality. Promoting the quality of 'teaching and
learning' in Australian schools took on particular significance in the 1990s through a
number of national policy initiatives brokered by the Commonwealth government.
An exploration of policy processes through interview data reveals the multi-layered
nature of policy-making in this period, involving key individuals, intergovernmental
and national forums. In particular, it highlights the importance of a strong, reformist
Commonwealth Minister (John Dawkins), a number of 'policy brokers' within and
outside government and national collaboration in constructing and maintaining the
Commonwealth's 'quality agenda' for schools. While several Australian education
ii
policy analysts have described policy-making in this period in terms of 'corporate
federalism' (Lingard, 1991, 1998; Bartlett, Knight and Lingard, 1991; Lingard,
O'Brien and Knight, 1993), a different perspective emerges from this study on policymaking
at the national level. Despite unprecedented levels of national collaboration on
matters related to schooling in this period, this research reveals an apparent
ambivalence on the part of some elite policy makers towards the Commonwealth's
policy agenda and its approach to schools' policy-making within the federal arena.
Policy coherence emerged as a relevant issue in this study through analysis of
interview data and a review of related Australian and international policy literature.
Overall, informants perceived the Commonwealth's quality agenda to be relatively
coherent in terms of policy intentions, but much less coherent in terms of policy
implementation. Perceptions of Commonwealth domination, state parochialism,
rivalry, delaying tactics and a general lack of trust and cooperation between policy
players and stakeholders were cited as major obstacles to 'coherent' policy-making.
An analysis of informants' views on policy-making in this period highlights features of
coherent policy-making which have theoretical and practical significance in the
Australian context.
This research also demonstrates the benefits of going beyond the study of written
policy texts to a richer analysis of recent policy history based on elite interviewing.
The wide range of views offered by elite policy makers and stakeholders in this study
both confirms and challenges established views about policy-making in the period
1987-1996. Elite interviewing lent itself to a grounded theory approach to data
collection and analysis (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1998). This
approach was significant in that it allowed relevant issues to emerge in the process of
research, rather than relying on 'up front' theoretical frameworks for the analysis of
data.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality schooling</field><field name="subject">education policy</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Government</field><field name="subject">policy-making</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.123723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective use of mother tongue in foreign language teaching in
               Chinese foreign language institutes</field><field name="creator">Wen-jian, Gao</field><field name="description">Whether or not the mother tongue is to be used in the
language classroom has long been a subject of heated
argument among language teachers in China. The great success
of the communicative approach in second language teaching
seems to have strengthened some peoples' belief that the
mother tongue should be completely avoided in language
teaching. It is, therefore, of great importance in China,
and perhaps of interest to foreign language teachers in
other countries as well, to analyse the situations of
foreign language teaching and learning, including the
difference between second language and foreign language
teaching, in order to see whether controlled use of the
mother tongue can in fact make teaching and learning
effective and efficient.
Chapter 1 reviews the major language teaching methods
and approaches now in use within and outside China. These
methods and approaches are categorized in accordance with
the ways of the learning they represent, and the advantages
and problems of these methods and approaches are analysed.
The differences between foreign language learning and
second language learning are examined in Chapter 2. Since
foreign language learners have different aims and objectives,
a different environment and possibly different motives,
their ways of learning are bound to be affected. Theories of
language learning compound and co-ordinate bilingualism,
independent and interdependent bilinguals, acquisition and
learning, are also discussed in relation to the
influence of these theories on language teaching as well
as the reasons why people use the mother tongue in foreign
language teaching. However, it is the teacher's
responsibility to select the appropriate techniques for
presenting and practising the target language. In the case
of foreign language learning the use of the mother tongue
is not only possible but can be effective and efficient.
Chapter 3 focuses on the foreign language teaching
situation in China. It includes a description of and
comments on the changes in methods in the last 50 years
as well as some important arguments in academic circles
associated with the issue of the use of the mother tongue
in foreign language teaching.
Chapter 4 describes the author's investigation in the
form of questionnaires sent to foreign language teachers and
observations of foreign language classrooms. Answers to
the questionnaires appear to confirm the existence of the
problems in the use of the mother tongue. Analysis of
the observations reveals possible solutions to the problems.
Practical suggestions about the actual use of the
mother tongue in the foreign language teaching are offered
in Chapter 5. For teaching, it seems possible to use the
mother tongue to teach/explain : 1) new concepts;
2) abstract ideas; 3) different points; 4) target
language grammar; 5) translation skills; and 6) target
language culture. Mother tongue is also very helpful
for teachers in their compiling of teaching materials.
On the other hand, students can use mother tongue in
their learning; it helps them practise as well as gather
historical and cultural background information.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">mother tongue</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chinese foreign language institutes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.124345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Value bases and program awareness : dimensions for
               evaluation in outdoor education</field><field name="creator">Westphal, Jnr, Edward F.</field><field name="description">The evaluation of Australian outdoor education activity
has been conspicuous by its absence.
While outdoor education in Australia is experiencing a
dramatic growth in facilities and programs, while state
departments of education are calling for 'school-based'
evaluations, while accountability is becoming an
increasingly likely prospect and while high-risk activities
are acknowledged as common elements in outdoor education,
Australian outdoor educators have yet to avail themselves of
the benefits available through formal evaluation.
One significant reason for this evaluation inactivity
arises from the massive and often conflicting evaluation
literature confronting outdoor educators.
To help outdoor educators overcome both the daunting
task of putting a sense of order into the myriad evaluation
methodologies and the possibility of implementing an
evaluation unsuited to the outdoor educator's needs, this
study presents two dimensions from which the outdoor
educator might usefully view evaluation methodologies.
The first dimension is that of the prepositional and
tacit knowledge value bases, which will help the outdoor
educator to understand better not only his own aims/approaches
to education, but also the type of knowledge valued as
important by specific evaluation methodologies.
The second dimension is that of program awareness, which
will aid the outdoor educator to identify the levels of
descriptiveness or depth and the type of personal involvement
by the evaluator which the outdoor educator would be
seeking through formal evaluation.
Application of these dimensions includes a review and
classification of evaluation literature within these
dimensions, commencing with the 'pre-Tyler' period, thence
Tyler, Glaser, Provus, Popham, Stufflebeam, Alkin, Cronbach,
Scriven, Atkin, Eisner, Stenhouse, Stake, and Parlett and
Hamilton. A number of outdoor education evaluations
conducted predominantly overseas are then classified
according to their propositional or tacit knowledge value
base as a further demonstration of the applicability of the
value base dimension for the outdoor educator hoping to
gain useful information from evaluations conducted previously.
Evaluations reflecting ambiguity in value base and outdoor
education guidelines representative of the propositional
and tacit knowledge value bases are also presented.
Although suggesting the bi-polar nature of the value
base dimension and the rather significant difference in
degrees of program awareness available through formal
evaluation, this study argues strongly that it is through
an appreciation and understanding of alternative evaluation
methodologies that outdoor educators might more capably be
able to establish the nature of communication needed within
a formal evaluation to best suit their needs and the needs
of other audiences to whom evaluation reports will be
directed.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian outdoor education activity</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.124947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">System level change : implementing a religious education curriculum in Catholic schools</field><field name="creator">Whelan, Anthony Peter</field><field name="description">In early 1983, the Catholic Education Authority in Sydney issued a major
curriculum document for the systems 210 Primary schools on Religious
Education. One year after the documents' release there was evidence of its
negligible impact in classrooms. Studies of overseas, Australian, and local
system-level changes supported the view that there was relatively limited
documentation of the processes followed in the implementation of system-level
change.
As its starting point, the Field Study pursues the development in eight schools of
a system-stimulated implementation process over twelve months. A historical
perspective of the system is given; implementation of change is defined; and the
approach used in the study is sited in the theoretical context of Action Research.
The body of the study is written in an 'inter-leaving' style. In each Chapter a
chronological descriptive approach is followed and, as appropriate, theoretical
considerations are introduced as a method of reflection and interpretation of the
process. Among the processes under investigation, major consideration is given
to planning, monitoring and collaborative staff development. The specific
strategy of change developed is that of a Co-operative Peer Support Scheme,
based on Goodlad's concept of a "league". Concerns - Based Adoption
Methodology (CBAM) is used as a monitoring technique. An original contribution
to the monitoring processes is the invention and application of a micro-computer
program for analysis of the Stages of Concern of the teacher participants in the
Project.
The salient findings of the Study are that the particular plan had been effective,
and that system planning can only be directional. Monitoring procedures that are
are amenable to use in system-level change were demonstrated to have been
useful. Clear focussing of issues, the generation of locally produced learning
materials, and conscious use of adult learning process enhances the outcomes of
the Project. Finally, the goal-free descriptive approach followed identifies more
sharply new questions requiring further exploration: mechanisms leading to
group formation; the interrelationship between psychic-group and socio-group
processes; the roles of change-agents and the support system; and the quality of
use rather than the percentage of users.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">catholic schools</field><field name="subject">religious education curriculum</field><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.125609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Female registered nurses and stress : a quantitative

Registered Nurses working in the clinical setting at both Calvary Public and Calvary
Private Hospitals ACT Incorporated.
A modified Gray-Toft, Anderson Nursing Stress Scale (1981) was used as the instrument
for the research. The questionnaire was modified by the addition of six questions.
The questionnaire was distributed to seventy female Registered Nurses. Twenty
questionnaires were distributed to staff working within the Private Hospital and fifty to
staff in the Public Hospital.
Relevant data dating back to 1956 was examined regarding stress and burnout amongst
nurses and allied health professionals.
The results of this study, not surprisingly, supported the finding of Gray-Toft, Anderson.
That is that nursing remains an inherently stressful occupation. Respondents working in
both public and private hospitals indicated that Lack of Funding and Death and Dying
were considered to be major sources of perceived stress.
Registered Nurses working in the Public Hospital perceive higher levels of stress than do
those Registered Nurses working within the Private Hospital with respect to relative
staffing levels, workload and funding.
Comparisons by age group indicated a generally higher reported level for the youngest age
group. Comparison of full time versus part time staff indicated a significantly higher level
of perceived stress from full time staff. Analysis of reported stress by ward type indicated
that staff working in the "medical" groupings experienced higher perceived levels of stress

              Territory : a study of the prevalence and patterns of use in
              women and the prescribing habits of general practitioners -
              implications for health education</field><field name="creator">White, Ian</field><field name="description">Psychotropic drugs are mind affecting compounds. They range in type
from illegal narcotic analgesics such as heroin, to prescribed major
tranquillisers used for treatment of psychotic states, to prescribed
minor tranquillisers such as the benzodiazepines, Valium and Mogadon,
to the freely available, over the counter drugs, Aspirin and Panadol.
Overseas and Australian data show the minor tranquilliser group,
benzodiazepines, first introduced on the pharmaceutical scene in
the early 1960s, to be the most commonly prescribed psychotropic
drugs. Their popularity with medical practitioners as prescription
drugs for conditions of anxiety, stress, insomnia and some forms
of epilepsy, arises from the advertised inference by drug companies
that they are free from any side effects in the patient such as
dependence, tolerance and on termination of treatment, absence of
withdrawal syndrome. Benzodiazepines were first introduced as a
substitute for the well known dependence producing barbiturate based
sedatives.
Overseas and Australian data show women are prescribed psychotropic
drugs, particularly benzodiazepines, twice as often as men and in
many instances for conditions unrelated to those for which the drugs
are recommended.
Australian data comes from two sources, official statistics such
as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and from surveys of drug use.
Both sources of data are incomplete, inaccurate and in many cases
misleading. The true picture of prescribed psychotropic drug use
in Australia therefore lacks resolution and in all probability
underestimates prevalence and patterns of use in the community.
There is no data on the prevalence and patterns of use of prescribed
psychotropic drugs in the Australian Capital Territory. It was therefore
deemed appropriate to conduct a survey to determine their prevalence
and patterns of use. The survey was confined to women for several
reasons: Women are a target group in the Commonwealth and State
Government 'Drug Offensive'; evidence from studies overseas and in
Australia shows that women are prescribed psychotropic drugs,
particularly benzodiazepines, twice as often as men; Australian data
suggests that this trend is uniform and therefore the Australian
Capital Territory should be no different.
Data shows that doctors, particularly General Practitioners, are
the main source of prescribed psychotropic drugs. The main psychotropic
drugs prescribed by general practitioners are benzodiazepines. It
was therefore deemed appropriate to conduct a survey of general
practitioner's attitudes, knowledge and beliefs about the appropriate
use of benzodiazepines as these factors carry weight in a doctor's
prescribing habits.
The survey of women was conducted using a standardised, structured,
telephone survey on a random sample of 120 women in the Australian
Capital Territory.
The results of the survey show that 40% of the sample had used
prescribed psychotropics at some stage in their lives. Most users
were older women, married, well educated and working full time. Level
of knowledge about the drug was low, compliance with respect to use
was high. Most prescribed psychotropic drugs were obtained from a
doctor. There appears to be little drug sharing or concurrent drug
use. Half of the prescribed psychotropics were benzodiazepines the
other half were mostly anti-depressants. Use of over the counter
psychotropics was very high.
The survey of general practitioners was conducted using a standardised,
structured mailed questionnaire distributed to a random sample of
25 general practitioners in the Australian Capital Territory.
The results show the majority of doctors prescribe the drugs for
common indications (anxiety, stress, insomnia and some forms of
epilepsy) in excess of one week. For specific anxiety states however,
most prescribe the drugs along with some form of counselling. The
majority of doctors (77%) think counselling is not as effective as
drug treatment. All doctors surveyed think patients should be advised
of the drugs effects on driving and machinery operation; the drugs
should not be shared with others; that the drugs should not be
terminated abruptly; the drugs should not be used concurrently with
alcohol. The majority (92%) believe benzodiazepines are over prescribed
and most doctors (77%) believe the drugs produce dependence in patients.
The majority (58%) believe women of child bearing age are at risk
using benzodiazepines while 50% think pregnant women are at risk.
The majority of doctors did not believe that people older than 60
years of age are at risk but most believe children are at risk.
The findings of both surveys have implications for health educators
and others with a concern for drug education in the community.
Recommendations arising from this study have been made. They are
presented at the conclusion of this thesis.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">psychotropic drug use</field><field name="subject">general practitioners</field><field name="subject">GPs</field><field name="subject">health education</field><field name="subject">prescriptions</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.130512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Educational considerations for a reduction in the incidence of
              hypercholesterolaemia in the Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="creator">White, Peter A.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of the incidence of
hypercholesterolaemia in a 1988 sample of male personnel
from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The thesis
defines hypercholesterolaemia as a plasma total cholesterol
level in excess of the risk threshold promulgated by the
National Heart Foundation of Australia (NHF). Since 1981,
RAAF personnel have been subjected to a series of regular
physical and physiological examinations, including a
comprehensive blood lipd profile, as part of a preventive
approach to reducing the incidence of coronary heart disease
in the Service.
The study presents data on the extent of
hypercholesterolaemia in the RAAF and illustrates the spread
of the condition through various age cohorts. In excess of
40% of the RAAF personnel studied had total cholesterol
levels in excess of the NHF "increased risk" threshold with
the prevalence varying from 11.8% of personnel aged 20-24
years to some 64% of personnel older than 49 years. The
increase in total cholesterol level with increasing age is
statistically significant.
The study compares these data with previously published
observations on certain motivational characteristics of
military communities, with a view to providing an evaluation
of the structure of the RAAF Health Promotion Programme as a
lifestyle based educational initiative. The data are further
compared with data from two conceptually similar studies of
male personnel in the United States armed forces. These
comparisons suggest that the age related frequency of
educational intervention which characterized the 1988 RAAF
programme may well have been inappropriate for optimal
effect.
The study further utilizes a tabular (matrix) analysis of a
number of educational strategies to identify several
preferred option(s) for programme design in the RAAF
community. The analysis suggests that the present mode of
educational intervention may also be inappropriate for
optimal effect (when addressing the 1988 RAAF population at
least).
The study concludes with the presentation of a series of
recommendations aimed fundamentally at a redesign of the
cholesterol monitoring component of the RAAF Health
Promotion Programme. The study recommends, however, that
given the multifactorial nature of coronary heart disease
risk, the cholesterol monitoring component of the programme
should not be redesigned in isolation. Instead, the findings
of this study suggest that a more wide-ranging study of the
educational basis for the client interface to the RAAF
Health Promotion Programme is warranted.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hypercholesterolaemia</field><field name="subject">Royal Australian Air Force</field><field name="subject">RAAF</field><field name="subject">health education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.130916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A school to work transition project : description, results and
              part evaluation</field><field name="creator">White, Peter J.</field><field name="description">The major purposes of this Field Study are twofold:
firstly, to examine, briefly, the major issues in the transition
of Australian secondary students from school to the world of
work, and secondly, to examine one school-based and school-developed
program which has been produced in response to perceived student
needs in one particular school within one particular community.
Whilst the emergence of school to work transition has only
recently been recognized as being of major importance, it is now,
as an educational issue, receiving widespread attention both in
Australian and overseas. Transition programs are now also receiving
considerable funding from Commonwealth Government Sources. The
opening two chapters of this Field Study focus on the process of
this raising of consciousness, both from the point of view of the
initiating forces in Australian Society, as well as from some of
the policy proposals and recommendations emerging from a national
examination of the problem of transition. In addition some attempt
is made to establish a particular philosophical stance - a stance
which embodies those characteristics of a program considered, by
this writer at least, to be essential components of any attempt
by schools to come to grips with the needs of their students who
are facing the process of transition.
The middle section of this Field Study examines the approach
that one particular school has adopted in the development of
such a program - an examination which highlights such areas as
the process of curriculum change, the clarification of expressed
student needs, development of philosophical bases, sources and
significance of Commonwealth funding and the political ramifications
of program adoption.
The final section of this Field Study commences an evaluation
of this particular school's transition program based loosely
upon evaluation guidelines developed by Robert Stake. Whilst this
can only be a part evaluation (both because of the on-going nature
of the program and the writer's involvement in the program as its
director. )it is hoped that such an evaluation will produce a
set of useful recommendations - useful both for the effective continuation
of the program and useful for the implementation of possible
future programs designed to assist Australian youth facing this
major, and often traumatic, transition form school to the "real
life world" outside school.
The reader's attention is drawn to the range of possible
future audiences of this report - audiences ranging from the
academic examination of the project as part of a masters' degree
to the clients of the actual program reported. Given this range of
audience, it has been the intention of the writer to produce as
"readable" a document as possible. It is the hope that in so doing
all audiences will be served.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">secondary school students</field><field name="subject">school to work transition</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.131322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of an intercultural studies innovation in an
              A.C.T. primary school</field><field name="creator">Wilkinson, Mervyn B.</field><field name="description">This field study is based upon research by a teacher into
the initiation, planning and implementation of an Intercultural
Studies Project in an A.C.T. Primary School. The
innovation was funded by the A.C.T. Schools Authority under
the Curriculum Projects Scheme.
The project's evaluation was undertaken from September 1978
until December 1980. The writer was one of the innovators,
the co-ordinator of the course and the evaluator. The
evaluation occurred mainly through the techniques of direct
involvement, observation, questionnaire and interviews. As
such this report is an acknowledged insider's view of the
innovation and its impact upon the children, the teachers
and the school generally. A picture of the perceptions
of pupils and teachers towards the process of this
particular curriculum innovation has evolved. It is hoped
that other teachers may be able to glean information from
this case study for specific application to similar types
of innovations.
This field study report is therefore an evaluation of the
process of development and implementation of an
Intercultural Studies innovation.
Initially, a description of the background and early
development of the programme is presented, followed by the
rationale upon which the innovation is based.
A literature review section studies various general themes
and specific concepts. Multiculturalism, intercultural
learning and teaching strategies are examined. Also, the
characteristics of an innovation are examined within the
context of the project's implementation process.
Aspects of the curriculum design involving innovation
implementation processes and the gradual development of the
curriculum framework are discussed, including a description
of a model of evaluation that the study utilises.
Finally, the process of the Intercultural Studies Project
innovation is examined in some detail. Data presentation
with data analysis and interpretation occurs accompanied by
general comments from the perspective of the evaluator.
Some major elements that have evolved during the process
of this curriculum change in an A.C.T. Primary School are
as follows:
1. It was easier to change curriculum objectives
than to facilitate change in methods of instruction.
2. Both internal and external sources influenced
the curriculum process from inception to evaluation stages.
3. Teachers needed extensive inservice training in
I.C.S. theory and practice in order to facilitate change of
approach, outlook and methods of teaching.
4. I.C.S. partial success as an innovation was due in
small degree to the nature of its aims and objectives and
most of its intrinsic nature being synonymous with that of the
school's Social Science Curriculum.
5. Staff changes affected curriculum continuity and
implementation according to original aims.
6. The complexity of the project in the area of new
materials and audio visual equipment produced an obstacle
to its implementation.
7. Energy dissipation by teachers which was massive
in relation to compilation of units of work, meetings, class
teaching, and gathering resources was a constraint as
teachers have limited time for curriculum development in
the primary school context.
8. A plan of change, an implementation framework,
resources linkage system, trouble-shooting interventionist
approaches to difficulties as these arose and evaluative
feedback mechanisms all existed, but much more needed to be
done to make all these elements contribute to the innovation's
successful implementation.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">intercultural studies</field><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">curriculum innovation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.131828</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher morale in A.C.T. primary schools</field><field name="creator">Wilks, Patricia A.</field><field name="description">This study investigates morale as perceived by primary
school teachers. A survey was administered to level 1
teachers in A.C.T. government schools. Of the 280
surveys distributed 165 returns were able to be
processed, a 59% response rate.
Teacher morale has an effect on the quality of teaching
and hence student outcomes and is currently an
important aspect of the education debate. Teacher
stress, a product of low morale, has been of concern to
teacher unions and to education departments across
Australia.
Morale, for the purpose of this study, is defined as
a confident and forward looking state of mind relevant
to a shared and vital purpose.
The survey used in this study was a modified version of
Smith's Staff Morale Questionnaire. This instrument
identifies three factors of morale : "Cohesive Pride",
"Leadership Synergy", "Personal Challenge". Responses
relating to these factors were analysed with respect
to age, gender, years of experience, school in which
the teacher is employed and type of teaching duties.
Results indicated that school attended has an influence
on the level of "leadership synergy" and gender has an
influence on the level of "personal challenge".

school teachers concerning their schools' organizational cultures, and also to examine the
degree to which perceptions were common amongst teachers in a school, and whether these
perceptions are related to levels of job satisfaction.
The setting for this research involves five secondary schools in the wider Auckland
metropolitan district, in New Zealand. These schools were a mixture of state and private, coeducational
and single sex, and were selected from different socio-economic locations.
The perceptions of the teachers were examined from the perspective of the conceptualization
of the early sociologist, Ferdinand Tonnies, and the study utilizes the antithetical model of
gemeinschaft and gesellschaft characteristics of an organization. The methodological strategy
includes a Questionnaire and Interview, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches.
Metaphorical descriptors were used as the methodological tools for determining the balance
of gemeinschaft to gesellschafl in each school. Overall trends were noted and correlation
between particular perceptions and job satisfaction levels were examined. An analysis of the
degree to which perceptions were shared in common was also an important consideration.
In both the Interview and the Questionnaire the participants were given the opportunity to
develop their own metaphors that were applicable to their school cultures, as well as
summarizing their ideals for the educational context.
The findings revealed five major observations.
The first is that gemeinschafl (community human relational) characteristics were both more
prevalent in schools, and were considered to be more desirable by teachers.
Secondly, there appeared to be a mixture of both gemeinschaft and gesellschaft
characteristics in each school, according to the perceptions of the teachers studied. Both of
these characteristics existed side by side, they were not mutually exclusive. The balances,
however, were idiosyncratic to each school.
Thirdly, there was a strong positive correlation between high gemeinschaft perceptions and
job satisfaction levels. Conversely, there was a negative correlation between gesellschaft
perceptions and job satisfaction levels.
Fourthly, the study indicated that metaphors were a useful research tool, and that teachers
respond well to them as enabling devices for reflecting on the nature of school organizational
culture.
Finally, this research revealed a strong tendency for teachers to hold similar perceptions of
their schools organizational culture. There existed clear patterns of commonality.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">organizational culture</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.132541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the worth of a partial withdrawal enrichment
              program for gifted children based on Maker's curriculum
              principles</field><field name="creator">Williams, E. Marion</field><field name="description">As a means of addressing observed inadequacies in school
curricula, the Catholic Special Education and Guidance Service, Brisbane Catholic Education Office in 1980 established a partial
withdrawal centre for counsellor-selected gifted children.
The Learning Enrichment Centre (L.E.C.) aimed to -
1) meet the needs of enrolled gifted students by -
a) providing appropriate learning experiences; and
b) providing an administrative arrangement (partial withdrawal)
which afforded them the opportunity to interact
with like minds;
2) meet the needs of the system by -
a) developing and evaluating units of work for gifted
students;
b) conducting workshops, seminars and in-service days for
teachers.
In 1984 the L.E.C. curriculum was designed and implemented in
accordance with Maker's model of curriculum modification for gifted
students (Maker, 1982). This model outlines a set of principles which
Maker claims, recognize the characteristics and needs of gifted
students and guide the development of a qualitatively different
curriculum. In making decisions about design and implementation of
Maker's curriculum modifications, factors related to the setting, the
teachers and the students were considered.
The overall purpose of the Study was to assist teachers in making
rational decisions about future L.E.C. provision. In particular the
Study was to collect information on the worth of the program - its
relative strengths and weaknesses - and the influence on the curriculum
of the administrative arrangement.
The program was evaluated by ascertaining levels of satisfaction
typically expressed by the students.
Of secondary concern was whether the organisational arrangement
of partial withdrawal had inhibited or enhanced the program's
intentions. It was acknowledged that unfavourable attitudes of
parents, classroom teachers or peers could conceivably alter students'
receptivity of the program.
In Term 4, two parallel questionnaires, one addressing the
L.E.C., the other the regular classroom, were administered to the
students. By comparing responses on matching items, levels of
satisfaction with the L.E.C. curriculum were determined. Selected
items on the L.E.C. instrument were further to reveal how students
felt about the administrative provision and whether classroom teachers
and peers were perceived to be supportive.
Subsequent to program completion, a questionnaire was mailed to
parents bo ascertain their support for the program by asking them how
their child's emotional behaviour had changed as a result of LEC
attendance. Also they were to indicate whether they preferred that
enrichment occur in the regular classroom or partial withdrawal
setting.
To confirm the students' impressions of classroom teacher support
and interest, parents were requested to comment on their understanding
of it.
Student responses indicated that they found their LEC experiences
to be particularly interesting and enjoyable, and the LEC teachers to
be kind, helpful, friendly and fair. These perceptions differed
significantly from their perceptions of school. Elements of the Maker
model which were consistently most valued by the group were the
Process modifications, 'Freedom of Choice' and 'Higher Levels of
Thinking'.
Parents proved to be supportive of the LEC program.
Although some would have preferred classroom enrichment
to partial withdrawal, they felt that schools could not
currently provide it.
It was the students' viewpoint that interactions
with peers and classroom teachers were not adversely affected
by their LEC participation. Classroom teachers were seen
to be generally supportive and interested - a perception
incidentally not shared by parents and LEC teachers.
Perceived positive attitudes towards their LEC involvement
most likely enhanced student satisfaction with the program.
The evaluation unequivocally indicated that the
LEC program based on Maker's model appealed to the students.
Though withdrawal from class possibly contributed to program
satisfaction, the level of satisfaction was very high
and could not be attributed solely to hidden curriculum
efects (the organisational arrangement).
The Study concluded that use of the Maker model
as a guide for developing LEC curricula should continue
but that parent and classroom teacher attitudes towards
the administrative arrangement should be regularly monitored
as they appeared to have the potential to enhance or

Schools Authority Task Force :
              review of provision for children with special needs</field><field name="creator">Williams, Esther</field><field name="description">This field study addresses the question of how one organisation
organised for the purposes of policy review and development. It does
so through a case study of the A.C.T. Schools Authority Review of
Provision for Children with Special Needs. This review, which took
place during 1981, was conducted by an intra-organisational Task Force
formed specifically for that purpose. In line with the principles
established as a basis for the A.C.T. government school system, the
review was organised in a way which encouraged wide participation by
educationalists and the community at large.
The field study comprises three main chapters, the first of which
traces the history and development of the A.C.T. school system. Here
the emphasis is upon the methods adopted to develop policy from the
earliest days of the organisation to the time of the review. The
second chapter provides an account of the establishment and conduct of
the review stressing the vital importance of matters related to
leadership and resources. In the third chapter various aspects of the
review are analysed in relation to selected literature on
organisations. It analyses the organisational context and structure
of the review, and in the light of this, considers questions of the
styles of leaderhsip actually adopted.
Throughout the study the aim is to understand the organisational
processes involved with an emphasis upon the appropriateness of the
means employed to meet the demands for policy review.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACT Schools Authority</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">children with special needs</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.133410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethics in acute psychiatry : a case study</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jenny</field><field name="description">This workplace study examined the every day ethical dilemmas of a multidisciplinary
team in one acute psychiatric setting and the social factors affecting their moral domain
of practice. The research design was a case study involving both qualitative and
quantitative data. The context that shaped the team's process of ethical dilemma
identification was conceptualised for the purpose of this research within a systems
theory framework of interrelated factors at a societal, organisational and clinical level
with ethics theory pervading the entire scene.
The findings indicated that dilemmas arose in situations concerning patient care, team
strain, and limited resources with the most common dilemma across disciplines arising
from lack of community resources. Further findings suggested that clinicians were
aware of various forces shaping practice but these ideas were not well connected
conceptually.
Staff felt wary of identifying ethical dilemmas because they were unsure of the process
and sensed a reticence in the unit's social processes around negotiation and problem
solving. Important social factors that were perceived to affect their abilities around
ethical dilemma identification included rational economics, professional socialisation,
medical-legal monopoly with a concomitant use of the ethic of justice, and managerial
strategies. The concept of transference and countertransference issues within the
staffing group was explored.
These results are useful for the team to understand the nature of their own particular
dilemmas and what factors constrain and enhance their abilities to identify dilemmas.
Other health care settings may find that replication of the research results in a similar
way may raise awareness of their moral situation. Generalisability at a theoretical level
contributes to the current research agenda in applied ethics about the effect of context in
the ethical domain of clinical practice.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">acute psychiatry</field><field name="subject">ethical dilemmas</field><field name="subject">clinical practice</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.143655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of Australian Catholic school enrolments into the
              nineteen eighties, particularly in respect to the developmentof a
              model for projecting enrolments and an analytical discussion of
              the variables involved</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Denis P.</field><field name="description">Catholic schools represent the major alternative to
government schools in providing formal primary and secondary
education for the Australian school-going population. The
organisational structure of the Catholic school "system", however,
differs significantly from that of government systems. Traditionally,
Catholic schools form a decentralised network of administrative and
governing authorities. Within this tradition, there are difficulties
in developing a conceptual model fur a state or national view of
Catholic school structures.
During the past couple of decades, changes of a sociopolitical,
economic, and ecclesiastical nature have caused public
and private education authorities in Australia to view Catholic schools
in an aggregated as well as individual sense. Along with increased
public subsidies for the establishment and operation of schools, public
accountability ana scrutiny for fiscal and other policy development
purposes have likewise grown. The future of the Catholic school system
is therefore of interest to both government agencies and Catholic
authorities.
To facilitate an analyses of the broad future for a school
system, one useful tool is a model of the system which can be used to
project enrolments. Enrolment projections in the very best of
organisationally structured environments are precarious predictors
of the future, so the business of applying a projection model to base
data requires qualification. Since Catholic schools form an irregular
organisational pattern which is undergoing change, projections of
Catholic school enrolments at state or national levels in Australia
require particular qualification.
This study is mainly concerned with the development of a
model for projecting Catholic school enrolments. It is aimed at taking
advantage of data produced by the 1976 Australian Census of Population
and Housing when this becomes available. However, it also analyses the
historical development of Catholic schools in a general sense, and
looks to a number of social, political, and economic trends which may
act as pointers towards future developments.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">school enrolments</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.144213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the Djwani project</field><field name="creator">Willmot, Eric</field><field name="description">During the 1970's a variety of special educational
programs were set up for adult Aboriginal people.
In general these programs were designed to meet the
needs of people who for a variety of reasons, were
at an educational or social disadvantage in comparison
to the rest of the Australian population.
The Djwani project stood out in sharp contrast to
these other programs. This project was designed
to serve Aboriginal people who had demonstrated
their ability to cope with tertiary education,and
who were likely to be able to occupy important
positions in Aboriginal Affairs.
The Djwani project aimed to maximise beginning
tertiary qualifications for the professions that
the students intended to enter, and pr pare them
to operate in positions of leadership. This was
to be achieved by an upgrading tertiary program,
coupled with a field experience system.
The project was operated at the Canberra College
of Advanced Education in the later part of the
1970's. It was discontinued in 1978.
This document is a report of an evaluative study
carried out during the operation of the Djwani
project. It provides a framework in which the
administration and activities associated with the
project can be, recorded and examined.
This study of the Djwani project, is escentially a
case study of the project, which also uses a number of
evaluative deviceses developed by the author in other
situations.
This study examines the activities of the actual
Djwani project, it does not attempt to provide longitudinal
information on the students after they
leave the project. It does however attempt to compare
the project with other adult educational projects
mounted for Aborigines, and to appraise the projects

philosophies and methodologies have already and could be applied more relevantly to the
public sector. The major proposition is that commercial planning methods and techniques
can be used selectively to enhance agency planning and management effectiveness and

delivering high quality government services as part of a purchaser/provider relationship.
Strategic planning and management theory and models are reviewed and a progressivestages

advantage in the Non-residential construction industry. Porter's Five Competitive
Forces Model has been used to analyse the existing industry structure both in Australia
and Thailand. In addition. Porter's Diamond Model has been used for identifying the key
determinants of Australia's competitive advantage in the industry.
The study has drawn upon industry data obtained from interviews with operation
managers and executives of major Australian firms in the non-residential construction
industry who have been successfully operating in Thailand over the last ten years.
Research, undertaken in Australia and Thailand, includes interviews and case study
information gained from industry, government and academia.
A key finding applicable to each case study was that Australian non-residential
construction firms operating in Thailand competed successfully on higher order
technological expertise in construction management and operation. Expertise and
innovation was created and sustained at home through vertically integrated clusters of
industry suppliers to the main contractor and replicated or adapted abroad to local
circumstances.
Australia's national competitive advantage in the industry has relied on the interaction of
key determinants. Favourable factor conditions have provided Australia with a key
advantage base, for example, skilled personnel, experience in a variety of construction
areas due to the demands of Australia's geography and development needs, and adequate
infrastructure provision both physical and capital. Favourable factor conditions
combined with intense service rivalry at home, supportive related industries, demanding
buyers, and effective competition policy are the key to Australia's success.
The study goes on to explain the role that industry and government can play to ensure
Australia remains internationally competitive in the industry. In addition summary
recommendations are provided of the steps that Thailand needs to take to improve its
competitiveness in general and the development of the construction industry in particular.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction industry</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">competitive advantage</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.145501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural preschool teachers : facts, problems, perceptions : a
              comparative study of rural and city preschool teachers to identify differences between these groups, as well as to identify problems which are similar for rural preschool teachers and rural primary and secondary teachers</field><field name="creator">Winer, Yvonne</field><field name="description">The central problem investigated in this field study was whether the
working conditions of rural preschool teachers were different from
those encountered by urban preschool teachers. And, if so, whether
the problems encountered by rural preschool teachers were similar to
those experienced by rural primary and secondary teachers.
For the purposes of this study, small rural towns were those towns
with populations of less than eight thousand and were geographically
remote from large rural and urban centres of populations of more than
twenty thousand.
The data were collected by means of a mail questionnaire. The questions
were devised around the issues raised in the literature about rural
primary and secondary teachers. The material reviewed was converted
into question format and placed in the context of preschool education.
Eighteen teachers from rural schools and seventeen teachers from city
schools participated in the survey.
The statistical package for the Social Sciences was used to analyse
the survey data. In all, nineteen hypotheses were tested. Further
data, more directly pertinent to preschool education, were derived from
four open ended questions.
The results of the tested hypotheses revealed the following outcomes
which were similar to those reported in the research on rural primary
and secondary education:
Rural Teachers
were younger and less experienced than city teachers
lacked resources and back up staff
lacked adequate inservice opportunities
were isolated from colleagues and advisers
had some difficulty coping with the values portrayed by some
members of the aboriginal community.
Unlike rural primary and secondary teachers, the rural preschool teachers
did not appear to have the same problems of adjusting to the rural
community and did not lack parental support.
The open ended questions suggested that rural and city preschool
teachers did not differ greatly in their perceptions of school readiness,
the role of parents, and the functions of preschool. However, rural preschool
teachers did nominate isolation and lack of resources as their
greatest problem. Both groups identified the complex and time consuming
administrative tasks as a major problem.
Since this is only a pilot study, this particular piece of research
should be developed much further. This study has implications for
further research in that it has identified a large number of areas to
be explored, especially in regard to the working environments of rural
preschool teachers, their relationship with their communities and the
problems they face.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural preschools</field><field name="subject">preschool teachers</field><field name="subject">urban preschool teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.162712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A review and analysis of Secondary Schools Community Extension Project (SSCEP)</field><field name="creator">Wingi, Hereuwar Walipe</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Secondary Schools Community Extension Project</field><field name="subject">SSCEP</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.163118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of music performance assessment : the effects of
              training and experience on criteria used by music examiners</field><field name="creator">Winter, Neal</field><field name="description">Music is both an art and a science involving emotional
appreciation and intellectual understanding. When music
performances are assessed, appropriate criteria should be
used by examiners who appreciate the art and understand
the science. This study examined the effects of training
and experience on the judgements made by individuals who
possessed an understanding of music performance (i.e.
qualified musicians and music educators), from
observations on videotape of three piano performances (by
the same pianist).
The thirty three participants were required to observe the
videotape and complete a separate music performance
assessment (MPA)sheet for each piece, and then rank the
three pieces in order of preference. The MPA sheet
contained (a) thirty three descriptive statements, under
five headings, to which the examiner responded on a . six
point Likert scale, and (b) a section for recording an
overall impression mark, with provision for comment.
There were four examiner categories: (1) untrained and
inexperienced, (2) trained and inexperienced, (3)
untrained and experienced, and (4) trained and
experienced. The term 'experience' was applied to those
participants who had previous involvement as examiners in
any formal music performance assessment situation. The
term 'trained' was applied to those participants who
attended a short preparation course presented as part of
the study. The responses of the four categories of
examiner were tested for significant difference (.05
level) through the use of multivariate analysis of
variance with repeated measures.
One of the performances (piece 1) was recorded digitally
by computer (using MIDI and the 'Vision' program) which
provided a printout of what occurred during the
performance. A comparison of the subjective analysis of
the 'Vision' printout results with the examiner responses
for piece 1, revealed that there was a link between the
judgements made by examiners and the actual performance by
the pianist.
Results of the study indicate that (a) experience and
training effects the criteria used by music examiners in
the assessment of music performances, (b) training
influenced the examiner responses more than experience,
(c) in the 'best' performance, the effects of examiner
training and experience were negligible, and (d) in the
area of 'global' and 'specific' assessment of music
performance, all examiners divorced the two approaches,
however judgements of the untrained examiners were more
obvious in their disparity.
The results of this study suggest that the training a
music examiner receives prior to the performance
assessment session may be more important in producing
consistent and accurate reports than the amount of
previous examining experience. The criteria used by the
music examiner should be clearly presented with
appropriate dimensions for the musical instrument on which
the student performs.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music performance assessment</field><field name="subject">music examiners</field><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.163509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Describing and assessing the culture of a primary school : an
              ethnographic study</field><field name="creator">Withnell, Helen Margaret</field><field name="description">This study describes and assesses the organisational culture of a particular primary school
in the Northern Territory through examination of two research questions: 1. To what extent
is the organisational culture of the school cohesive, strong and concentrated? 2. To what
extent can the organisational culture of the school be described as a particular type(s) of
culture?
The development of the concept of organisational culture is outlined through a survey and
analysis of the literature. This study takes the view of culture as 'root metaphor'. The
relationship between cultural strength and effectiveness, particularly in the school context,
is examined to provide a rationale for the study.
From the literature review the study develops a number of methodological, analytical and
interpretative frameworks to provide an underlying structure to address the research
questions.
The research methodology is qualitative, drawing largely on ethnographic approaches. The
researcher spent extensive time in the school under study as 'participant observer'. Data
gathering was carried out in four ways 1. Collection of written material.2. Researcher's
observational notes. 3. Interviewing, both informal and semi-structured 4. Administration
to school teaching staff of the Owens and Steinhoff (1989) Organisational Culture
Assessment Inventory.
The findings are presented under seven themes or sets of themes, seen to be indicative of
the core operating values of the school:
Stability, Tradition and Formality
Caring
Co-operation, Support and Sharing
Commitment and Participation
High Standards
Recognition and Pride
Flexibility.
The strength and inter-relationship of the seven themes is explored via a conceptual map.
The study concludes that the organisational culture of the school under study can be
considered to be cohesive, strong and concentrated to a significant extent but that it is
difficult to conclude that the culture can be described as any particular type. Rather, it is
concluded that it could be described as a number of particular types.
Finally, what emerges of particular significance from this study is the role played by the
principal of the school in forming, shaping and modelling its values system. It is
concluded that educational leaders must also be cultural leaders, be aware of the need for all
members of the school community to be involved in this process and engage, encourage
and reward their participation.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary schools</field><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="subject">enthnolography</field><field name="subject">NT</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.163842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The process of learning to read and the Test of Early Reading Ability (TERA)</field><field name="creator">Wong, Terry</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Test of Early Reading Ability</field><field name="subject">TERA</field><field name="subject">reading skills</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.164212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determination of phosphorus in turbid freshwaters using alkaline peroxodisulphate digestion</field><field name="creator">Woo, Lirasari</field><field name="description">Methods for determining phosphorus in turbid lake and river water using
heating with an autoclave or a microwave and employing alkaline
peroxodisulphate digestion have been investigated. Suspensions (up to 100
ugP/L) of two standard reference materials (NIES No. 3 Chlorella and NEES No.
2 Pond Sediment) were used to optimised procedures.
Quantitative recoveries of phosphorus were achieved when the final
solution to be digested contained 0.045 M potassium peroxodisulphate and 0.04
M sodium hydroxide and solutions were autoclaved at 120&#176;C for 60 min. or
microwaved at 450 Watts for 5-10 min. Complete recoveries of phosphorus (99-
103%) from 20 ugP/U 50 ugP/L and 100 ugP/L Chlorella suspensions were
obtained using autoclave and microwave heating. For the Pond Sediment
suspensions complete recoveries of phosphorus (99-104%) from the 20 ugP/L
and 50 ugP/L were obtained using both heating methods. Higher recoveries from
the 100 u.gP/L Pond Sediment suspensions were obtained using microwave
heating (96&#177;1%) than autoclaving (88&#177;5%). Further analysis of Pond Sediment
suspensions using the autoclave heating showed that complete recovery of
phosphorus (98&#177;l%) from 60 ngP/L suspensions was achieved with incomplete
recoveries (92.3&#177;0.7%, 91&#65533;2% and 91&#65533;1%) from 70 ugP/L, 80 ugP/L and 90 ug
P/L suspensions respectively. Recoveries of phosphorus compounds
(orthophosphate and phosphonates) added to distilled water and turbid lake water
were near quantitative (91-117%) for both digestion methods.
A range of turbid lake and river water (TP = 57-106 ugP/L; Turbidity =
16-200 NTU) were analysed for total phosphorus (TP) using the optimised
alkaline peroxodisulphate digestion procedures and the APHA AWWA WPCF,
sulphuric acid - nitric acid digestion procedure. No difference in total
phosphorus measurements were found between the microwave digestion
procedure and the APHA AWWA WPCF, nitric acid - sulphuric acid procedure.
The autoclave procedure gave significantly lower recoveries of phosphorus
(p&lt;0.01), however, differences were only 2-8%.
The effect of freezing (-20&#65533;C) water samples without or with the addition
of 1% hydrochloric acid before determination of total phosphorus (TP) and total
dissolved phosphorus (TDP) was also investigated. No significant change in total
phosphorus occurred when samples were stored frozen without the addition of
1% hydrochloric acid in high and low density polyethylene bottles for up to 20
weeks and 2 weeks respectively after collection. Significant changes were found
in total dissolved phosphorus when samples were stored frozen without the
addition of 1% hydrochloric acid in high and low density polyethylene bottles
after 1 day and 2 weeks respectively.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">turbid freshwaters</field><field name="subject">alkaline peroxodisulphate digestion</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.164738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pressures, priorities and politics : a study of certain

This thesis presents a number of studies and reviews a
range of literature which reach a conclusion that highlights
the paramount importance of the principal in relation to the
effective operation of the school. The paper discusses the
increasing conflicts and dilemmas facing the principal in
leading the school community. Because of the importance of the
principal's role and the increased pressures upon the person
holding that position, this study agrees that administrative
training is necessary and increasingly so. It goes on to
deveolop a basic training course for principals and for those
potential administrators who aspire to that position.
In developing this proposed course, this thesis
examines the principal in terms of his general description that
is age, sex, experience, the nature of his selection and
appointment and the roles undertaken by principals in general.
A review is undertaken of the professional development of
principals in Australia with particular reference to a
Queensland and to a South Australian programme. The Australian
scene is compared to that in England and Wales and a criteria
for 'good practice' is developed for such professional
development courses alongside a recommended methodology for
conducting such in-service activities. Criteria for the
content of the course is built upon examples from the courses
examined, the roles undertaken and the background from which
Australian administrators emerge. The 'good practice', the
methodology and the content statements are finally merged in

              discrimination and rhythm performance skills in five and six-year-
              old children</field><field name="creator">Woolcock, Pamela K.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the Yamaha
Junior Music Programme in developing pitch discrimination and rhythm
performance skills in five- and six-year old children over a six month period.
Specifically, it aimed to measure improvements in the ability to distinguish
between high and low-pitched tones, the ability to identify the pitch of tones,
the ability to imitate rhythms, and the ability to beat in time to music in four
groups of ten subjects. Two groups (Y1 and Y2) had been involved in the
Yamaha music programme, which aimed to improve the skills mentioned
above. The other two groups (K1 and K2) had attended Kindergarten but had
not been involved in any formal music programmes. Two of these groups (Y1
and K1) participated in pre-tests and post-tests. The other two groups (Y2
and K2) had participated in the post-tests only.
The two groups which were taught via the Yamaha method consisted of ten
students (male and female). The two other groups consisted of ten students in
each group. These groups comprised students randomly selected from two
Kindergarten classes at Fraser Primary school in the A.C.T.
All students were presented with three tests: one pitch test, and two rhythm
performance tests. Each test contained ten items. The three tests were trialled
in a pilot study, with only minimum changes to procedure being required.
The Yamaha groups were also given a pitch identification test at the
conclusion of the six-month period.
Each student's performance in the ten trials of the three tests was recorded on
audio tape. Three judges used these recorded responses to grade each
student's performance. The trials were also recorded digitally on an Apple II
Computer using a sequencing software package.
Detailed statistical analysis was carried out on both subjective and digital
scores.
The experimental design used in this research was the "Solomon's Four"
design, which was ideal in controlling for internal sources of invalidity.
A series of comparisons were drawn between the various groups involved, and
it was concluded that the six-month Yamaha aural training programme led to
the following outcomes:
* improvements in the ability of Yamaha students to determine pitch
height.
* a higher incidence of improvement for the experimental group in the
pitch pairs test (to determine pitch height) than for the control group.
* improvements in the ability of Yamaha students to identify the pitch
of notes.
* no statistically significant improvements for Yamaha students at the
end of six months for rhythm test A (rhythm imitation).

              increased risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome</field><field name="creator">Wright, Erica</field><field name="description">Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a potentially serious disorder requiring timely
diagnosis and management to prevent adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.
Of increasing concern today, when treating the woman with GDM, is the need
to provide every woman with an intensive management plan to optimise the
likelihood of favourable pregnancy outcomes. Early identification of those
women with GDM who require insulin therapy in addition to diet therapy would
be beneficial in the planning and standardisation of clinical management
protocols, to enhance pregnancy outcomes and increase cost benefits with
improved allocation of resources.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the fasting plasma glucose
level (FPG) at diagnosis to predict an increased risk to the fetus and the need
for insulin therapy in a pregnancy complicated by GDM.
A prospective longitudinal study design and recruitment by convenience sample
was used. Data were obtained from 327 women and their babies. Diagnosis of
GDM was made by a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using
Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society (ADIPS) criteria with the exception
of seven women diagnosed on a blood glucose level &gt;11.1mmol/l. Following
consent of the women data were collected by a self report questionnaire and
the medical record system at three points; at first intervention, following delivery
and at the postpartum OGTT. Demographic, social, medical, maternal and
neonatal outcome data were collected. The management protocol was similar
for all of the women. Following nutritional intervention any woman who could
not meet the glycemic targets of &lt;= 5mmol/l fasting and/or &lt;= 6.5mmol/l two hours
postprandial was commenced on insulin therapy.
The women had a mean age of 32 years, body mass index (BMI) of 25.7 and
parity of 2 (range 1-12). Diagnosis was made at an average of 30 weeks and
70 women required insulin therapy with a mean dose of 34 IU per day,
commencing at a mean of 31 weeks gestation. Mean birthweight was 3400G.
Of the babies 12% were &gt;4000G. Congenital abnormalities occurred in 3%,
neonatal morbidities in 2% and there was 1 death in utero.
Logistic regression analysis found the following significant associations:
Increasing maternal BMI was related to increasing FPG levels at diagnosis and
the requirement of higher insulin doses. There was a negative linear
relationship to weight gain. Ethnicity was associated with maternal BMI and
ethnicity with BMI was associated with birthweight in the specific ethnic group.
BMI with insulin therapy as a covariate and the FPG value at OGTT were
predictive of persistent glucose intolerance in 14% of women postpartum.
Each value of the OGTT was a significant predictor of the need for insulin
therapy as a function of the week of gestation. The FPG level was the
statistical model of best fit. A 50% probability for requiring insulin was reached
with a FPG at diagnosis of 4.0 mmol/l if tested at 10 weeks gestation, 5.1mmol/l
at 20 weeks and 6.1 mmol/l at 30 weeks (p&lt;.001).
These results support the substantive research aim of the study. The model
has the power to predict the probability (risk) of requiring insulin therapy based
on the maternal FPG level at the OGTT according to the week of gestation.
The study results demonstrate that glucose intolerance is linked to a number of
adverse maternal and fetal outcomes in a continuous and graded fashion. The
degree of reversibility of maternal and fetal risk through therapeutic
interventions such as nutrition therapy, blood glucose monitoring, exercise and
active patient participation aimed at improving glucose tolerance is unknown.
Therefore, the rationale for, and feasibility of, new treatment strategies such as
the application of this statistical model as a management approach require
large scale randomised intervention studies, oriented toward measuring
maternal and fetal outcomes amongst different populations.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gestational diabetes</field><field name="subject">management approach</field><field name="subject">adverse pregnancy outcomes</field><field name="subject">fetal outcomes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.171500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary health care : the health care system and nurse education

introduced by the World Health Organization In the mid 1970s. Initially
viewed as a means of health promotion and advancement of wellness in
developing countries., it was soon to be adopted by industrialised countries to
assist in relieving the demand on acute care services. This was to be achieved
through education of the community towards good health practices and the
preparation of nurses to practice in the community, outside of the acute care
environment Australian nurses were slow to respond to this philosophy of
health care and this study has sought to examine why this is so. It has been
found that there are a multitude of reasons for the lack of action In the decade
or more following the Declaration of Alma Ata and the major Issues have been
identified and elaborated.
Some of the major reports of the time that were associated with and had some
Influence on health care and nurse education have been examined to identify
recommendations and how much they support the ethos of primary health
care. These include the Sax committee report of 1978 and a submission by
the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations In 1987.
As part of the investigation, nursing curricula from around Australia in the
mid 1980s have been examined to determine the degree of the primary health
care content according to guidelines recommended by the World Health
Organization. It was found that generally at that time, there was a deficit In
the preparation of undergraduate students of nursing for practice In the area
of primary health care when the world, including industrialised nations, was
making moves towards this model of health care delivery.
Factors Influencing the slow response of nursing have been examined and
finally recommendations for further studies have been put forward.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">nurse education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.171759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thai students' opinions on adding communicative tasks to grammar-

conventional teaching approach for years, on adding communicative tasks in grammarbased
classes drawing from relevant literature and previous studies. The results of the
study suggest that Thai students want to have communicative tasks in grammar learning,
but only with formal instruction prior to the tasks. The study also shows how
communicative tasks may be integrated into conventional language pedagogy from Thai
students in the study's perspectives and relevant literature.
As expected, the results indicated that Thai students were reluctant to complete tasks in
English because of shyness, particularly when conversing with peers, a lack of
competence in language skills, and fear over losing face. The interviews conducted with
students revealed instructional techniques that they themselves believed would be
beneficial in encouraging greater participation in tasks without inhibitions.
Finally, the study concludes that Thai EFL students are ready to be trained in
communicative tasks and that instruction in Thai EFL classes should shift from
substantially form-based to more communication-based instruction.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">communicative tasks</field><field name="subject">grammar</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.172231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural identity and communication among the Chinese diaspora
              in Australia in the 1990s : a Canberra case study</field><field name="creator">Xiao, Jun</field><field name="description">As a contribution to understanding the Chinese immigrants and their
community, this study seeks to explore the factors influencing the formation and
development of cultural identity among members of the Chinese diaspora in
Australia. These include Chinese community life, family and professional
networks, media use and its influences, and the changes that have taken place
over the past ten years.
Chinese communities in Australia are not homogeneous. Although they may all
call themselves Chinese, they differ among themselves according to dialect,
subdialect, clan and family, all of which are linked to their place of ancestral
origin in China, as well as by country of birth outside of China. The degree to
which these differences are considered important varies from individual to
individual, but a community, whether it is constituted for social or business
purposes, always comprises individuals who share one or more of these
secondary characteristics in addition to their collective cultural characteristics.
The study focuses on Canberra as a case study. First, it examines the
similarities and differences within the Chinese diaspora coming from different
geographical origins. It uses interviews and narrative analysis to examine the
nature of Chinese immigrants and to assess their social, political and cultural
context, with the aim to challenge the monolithic view that only one kind of
Chinese community exists. It investigates how cultural background and other
factors affect the formation and development of people's identity. In addition, as
a point of secondary comparison, this study also analyses the differences
between the Chinese diaspora in Canberra and Sydney. The aim here is to
assess how the different locations and different characteristics of these cities
communication networks affect migrants' adaptation to Australian society.
Special attention will be given to differences between Dalu ren (the mainland
Chinese), who came to Australia after the events of Tiananmen Square in 1989,
and the other diasporic Chinese groups in Australia, which include Taiwan ren
(Taiwanese), Xianggangren' (Honkongese), Malaixiya hua ren (Malaysian
Chinese), and Xinjiapo hua ren (Singaporean Chinese). Since mainland China
has had a different political system and the Communist Party replaced much
Chinese tradition, people from the mainland have kept the least Chinese
cultural traditions. Chinese from other regions try to keep the Chinese tradition
as it was. However, the culture in mainland China has already changed.
Therefore, the understanding of the Chinese tradition and culture among the
Chinese from different regions varies greatly.
This thesis explores the changing understanding within the members of the
diasporic community of cultural identity. It attempts to show the strong
influence of the notion of an original culture on the Chinese diaspora and how
these ideas influence the way that diasporic Chinese community members
interact within Australian society. It will investigate the changing
characteristics, both social and individual, of mainlanders and other groups of
Chinese immigrants in the 1990s, in the context of their professional, social and
family networks. It will examine areas such as media use, languages and
involvement with community development activities, and whether there are
significant differences in their acculturation according to their different gender
and places of origins.

The whole study consists of two parts : theoretical

on the second part. It starts with a brief discussion on
the inseparable connection between language learning and
literature (Chapter 1), followed by a close examination at
the specialities and potentialities short stories can offer
to language teaching (Chapter 2), which leads to a detailed
discussion (accompanied by an exemplified demonstration
through sample lessons) of the actual use of short stories
in an EFL class (Chapters 3, 4, and 5).
The practical value of the study lies in two aspects : it
brings about, by analysing its substances, the awareness of

foreign language teaching for many years. Unfortunately,
not all the language laboratories have been fully utilised
and well administered. It is therefore essential for
Chinese EFL teachers to become aware of the existing
problems and explore avenues for improving the use of the
language laboratory. This study aims to identify and to
analyse the problems involving materials, methodology
and administration in the use of the language laboratory
and to discuss possible ways of solving or, at least,
reducing these problems.
The language laboratory itself is only a mechanical
teaching aid. Language laboratory materials, teaching
methods and the administration of the language laboratory
are fundamental parameters which determine the effective
use of the language laboratory. In this study, a review
on the different theories and recent developments of
language laboratory usage are examined. This is followed
by a description of the problem areas in the use of the
language laboratory in China. A survey on language
laboratory use in Australia is offered as a model for
comparison. Finally, implications are put forward and
suggestions are made to Chinese EFL teachers in the hope
that this may lead to more effective and efficient use of
language laboratories in the future.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">language laboratory</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061110.174810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metal-reducing microorganisms in petroleum reservoirs</field><field name="creator">Yacob, Shahrakbah</field><field name="description">Metal-reducing microorganisms reduce a variety of metals in metabolic processes
coupled to the oxidation of organic compounds. These bacteria play an important role
in the biogeochemical cycling of metals and organic matter in anaerobic aquatic and
sediment ecosystems. It has been proposed recently that metal-reducing
microorganisms also are active in deep subsurface environments such as petroleum
reservoirs. Only two metal-reducing bacteria have been isolated from petroleum
reservoir fluids, Shewanella putrefaciens and Deferribacter thermophilus. This project
studied the occurrence and distribution of metal-reducing microorganisms in petroleum
reservoirs. The research focused on the isolation, characterisation and identification of
anaerobic bacteria from petroleum reservoirs that were capable of reducing metals and
the potential roles of these isolates in the microbial ecology and biogeochemical cycling
of petroleum reservoirs.
Petroleum reservoirs were selected for this study on the basis of physio-chemical
conditions such as temperature, salinity, pH and the presence of organic and inorganic
compounds, that were likely to provide a suitable environment for anaerobic bacteria
capable of reducing metals. Factors such as the stratigraphic features of the
sedimentary basin, age of reservoir and past oil field practices also were considered in
choosing the reservoir for study. Seven petroleum reservoirs in the USA and
Azerbaijan were chosen for extensive investigations. The physico-chemical conditions
in these reservoirs varied substantially.
A systematic study of the production water from these petroleum reservoirs revealed a
consistent presence of iron- and manganese-reducing microorganisms. It was found
that salinity and temperature play a significant and defining role in the occurrence and
distribution of these metal-reducing microorganisms. Biotic metal reduction was
detected from production waters from all but one of the oil wells sampled. It was
significant that the water from this well (Neftcala #1074) was the most saline (78 g/l
NaCI). Metal-reducing activity was detected at temperatures up to 70&#176;C.
Two pure cultures, strains RED1 for Redwash petroleum reservoir (USA) and NEF1
from the Neftcala petroleum reservoir (Azerbaijan) were isolated and characterized.
The strains had diverse physiological and metabolic properties including the ability to
oxidize a wide range of carbon compounds and reduce a variety of metals. Their
temperature, salinity and pH optima varied markedly. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S
rRNA of strain RED1 showed that the strain represented a new species of a new genus
in the domain Bacteria. The bacterium most closely related to strain RED1 is the
fermentative Fe(III)-reducer, Pelobacter acetylenicus (similarity value, 92.8%). Strain
NEF1 possesses a unique combination of phenotypic traits and a low mol % G+C.
From preliminary analyses and comparative biochemistry, NEF1 appears to be a novel
metal-reducing bacterium of the Flexistipes group.
The bacteria isolated in this study were able to grow at temperatures and salinities
consistent with the reservoir from which they were isolated. This indicated that
petroleum reservoirs are a new source of physiologically diverse, novel, metal-reducing
microorganisms. The bacteria isolated also demonstrated a number of characteristics
that would enable them to survive and persist in extreme subsurface conditions and
develop a selective ecological advantage in petroleum reservoir environments.
Significantly, the metal-reducing bacteria isolated were able to utilize an array of
metabolic products produced by bacteria indigenous to petroleum reservoirs. This has
resulted in a new proposed model for the ecological succession of bacteria in petroleum
reservoirs.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metal-reducing microorganisms</field><field name="subject">petroleum reservoirs</field><field name="subject">metabolic processes</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.102729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Increasing student autonomy in the learning of English as a
              foreign language at university level in China</field><field name="creator">Yan, Ling</field><field name="description">The present field study report comprises two major
components:
1. the theories of autonomy and self-directed
learning and the analysis of needs and
reasons for increasing student autonomy.
2. some practical issues concerning
acquisition of autonomy in E.F.L.
learning.
The modernization of China requires a high level of
education of the whole nation. But because of the large
population and limited educational facilities, the
formal educational institutions cannot meet the needs of
the country. To solve the problem, self-directed
learning (S.D.L.) is recommended and encouraged by the
government. Although S.D.L. is considered to be a
practical way to cope with the situation, the problem is
that most people do not know how to undertake
independent study. The reason is that the dominance of
traditional pedagogy in Chinese formal education leads
to passive and dependent school learning which
suppresses students' potential to become autonomous in
their learning. Therefore, after leaving school, they
are not capable of continuing their learning by
themselves.
In order to deal with the problems in traditional
Chinese teaching, the significance of increasing student
autonomy needs to be fully recognized in the Chinese
educational context, and self-directed learning should
be introduced to formal educational institutions.
Some practical issues must be considered in
undertaking S.D.L. in the E.F.L. context.
First, the role of the teacher needs to be
redefined. The teacher will primarily act as a
counsellor and facilitator who will guide the students
in their learning, and secondarily as a resource for
content information.
Secondly, S.D.L. materials need to be prepared.
These materials will not only help to improve the
students' language competence but also encourage them to
learn how to learn. This study discusses the types and
sources of materials and suggests certain criteria and
procedures for selecting and producing these materials.
Thirdly, self-assessment is a central and crucial
feature of S.D.L. In autonomous learning, it is the
learner's responsibility to assess his own progress. In
order to take this responsibility he needs to acquire
self-assessment skills. Some techniques of
self-assessment are introduced.
Finally, in considering how to provide the learners
with an effective learning environment, this study puts
forward suggestions for establishing a self-study
center. Some language skills and learning activities
which can be practised in the center are also described.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">English a a foreign language</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.103824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Preparation, implementation and evaluation of a course in

of an introductory course in educational media for first year teacher
education students.
The introduction provides the rationale (theoretical and practical) for
such a course and outlines the nature and purpose of the project. The
approach used is clarified and justified.
Basically the approach is on formal, traditional lines with regard to
curriculum development; but the intention is to provide the first detailed
written account of such proceedings in the educational media field.
Necessary terms (educational media, multi-media, older and newer media) are
defined and general aims and objectives are developed taking into account the
usual constraints as well as the results of classroom surveys, consultations
and case studies.
Appropriate reviews of literature and previous research which are relevant
to the topic are dealt with under the following headings: the need for the
course; the operation of equipment; selection and production of materials;
application to the classroom; the place of media in the curriculum; theory,
background and attitudes.
The plan follows systematic lines along the model provided in Teaching and
Media. A Systematic Approach, (Gerlach and Ely: 1971:7). This involves
providing the detailed objectives, specifying content, assessing time and
space, selecting resources, evaluating performance and finally analysing
feedback.
Experiments conducted fall into three categories. Firstly, students were
evaluated by means of a multi-media kit of materials, ability to operate
equipment and a multi-choice test. Secondly, the course itself was evaluated
by means of a questionnaire given to the students. This questionnaire was
subsequently rewritten to eliminate the predictability of some of the
responses.
The third experiment involved two classroom surveys on media use (details
included in the introduction). These provided useful evidence in connection
with the project.
Findings and recommendations for better practice are provided under
the following headings:

              government schools</field><field name="creator">Yates, Jennifer M.</field><field name="description">This study examines teachers' perceptions of the work of School Counsellors
within government schools in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Data
were drawn from questionnaires returned by a representative sample of 279
teachers and principals, from 16 primary and 8 high schools.
The purpose of the study was to: (i) partially replicate a study by Leach
(1989) of Western Australian teachers' perceptions; and (ii) investigate
whether or not teachers could be considered to be supportive of a general
trend towards a broadening role for school psychologists which is evident in
the literature. This trend suggests that practitioners of applied psychology in
schools may prefer an expanded role which encompasses indirect service
delivery in addition to the more traditional, child centred role.
Respondents were asked to indicate their perceptions of the frequency of 65
tasks performed by School Counsellors, the competence with which those
tasks were performed and the usefulness of those tasks. Also examined were
perceptions of the process and quality of service delivery, and of actual and
preferred qualifications and experience of School Counsellors. These results
were compared with those of Leach (1989). Respondents were invited to
prioritise service delivery in light of their professional needs. A factor
analysis of respondents' perceptions of School Counsellors was undertaken.
The results were similar to Leach's (1989) findings and indicated a general
endorsement of the current work of School Counsellors, with traditional,
direct service delivery tasks generally perceived as being performed more

frequently and with more competence than the more innovative, indirect
types of service delivery. There was a strong indication that respondents
would like more of both types of service delivery, particularly indirect
services, made possible through increased resourcing.
Increases in respondents' classification level positively correlated with
increased perceptions of task frequency and competence with which tasks
were performed. A positive correlation was also found between the
frequency of professional contact that respondents perceived they had with
School Counsellors and their perceptions of the process and quality of
service delivered by these practitioners.
In relation to the process and quality of service delivery, few teachers
perceived that School Counsellors communicated clearly about the services
they offer, procedures used or results gained. This concern with
communication was reinforced through examination of the factors
underlying teachers' perceptions of both the frequency and usefulness of
tasks.
This study suggests that ACT teachers and principals are, to some extent,
already experiencing and valuing some aspects of the trend in service
delivery reflected in the literature. Discussion highlights the important role
communication plays in indirect service delivery, and links it with the
findings of this study, particularly as it relates to teachers' and
administrators' apparent lack of knowledge of the qualifications and
experience of School Counsellors.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School Counsellors</field><field name="subject">government schools</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.104819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of student referrals in ACT primary

primary school teachers for referral of students for specialist
assistance, and the type of specialist assistance given to referred
students.
The study also compared student referrals in Resource Teacher and
Non-Resource Teacher Schools, and examined what patterns were
reflected in this sample of primary school student referrals.
This study had two sections; an examination of: 1) primary school
student referrals and 2) primary school teacher attitudes towards
learning difficulties and behavioural difficulties children. The
identification of courses undertaken by teachers which were helpful
in teaching students with learning and behavioural difficulties were
also compared to teacher attitudes. These results were compared
with those of Bourke (1985), a previous study of ACT teacher
attitudes towards learning difficulties students.
The study confirmed findings within the literature review that
classroom teachers were the major source of student referrals for
specialist services and that two important student variables
impacted upon referral. The student variables, student gender and
behaviour were found to have a significant effect upon referral.
Boys were referred more often in both samples of schools with girls
more likely to be referred in Resource Teacher Schools. Referred
students were more likely to have no reported behaviour problems
in Resource Teacher Schools.
There were differences in the patterns of referral in Resource and

writing, which then provided the theoretical framework for the construction of
hypotheses. These hypotheses asserted that dialogue journal writing brings about
educational as well as interpersonal benefits. In educational terms, this task enables
learners to attain proficiency in speaking, reading and writing, gain functional
competence, and develop critical thinking skills. In interpersonal terms, dialogue
journal writing helps in the development of the relationship between the teacher and
the learner and offers a source of cultural information.
The next stage involved assigning and collecting the journals and then
analysing them to check for the presence of particular features which were asserted to
bring about the benefits as stated in the hypotheses.
The writer conducted her research with a class of Cambodian students at
Phnom Penh University. Within the journals of the eighteen learners, most of these
features were discovered, thus supporting the hypotheses that journal writing offers
particular educational and interpersonal benefits. Where the features were absent or
variant, explanations for this based on the culture of the learners, the conditions of the
country during the period of the study, and the culture of the teacher were offered.
Finally, the writing in the dialogue journals of the subjects provided strong
evidence that dialogue journal writing offers learners a scope for genuine studentteacher
communication and for personal communication and mutual understanding
between each individual student and teacher.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">dialogue journal writing</field><field name="subject">teaching writing</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.110437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Western education and social change in Papua New Guinea
              society</field><field name="creator">Yoko, James</field><field name="description">Papua New Guinea, a society with diverse natural environments
(muddy swamps to soaring mountains, snake-shaped winding
rivers, open seas) and cultural environments (different languages,
customs, traditions) is undergoing massive and rapid social changes.
The occurrence of these social changes and social problems are due
to a combination of diverse exogenous and endogenous changes in
different areas such as politics, economic, cultural, bureaucratic
structure, technology and changes in other societies. These changes
are explicitly stipulated and reflected during the process of the
discussion and analysis.
The purpose of this paper is an attempt to analyze social change and
the emerging social problems in light of the colonisation process
right up to the post independence era. The social functions and
dysfunctions of the innovated Western type education system
during the contemporary modernisation and development process
are also examined. The theoretical frameworks used to analyze
social change are (1) the structural functionalism theory, (2)
modernisation theory, and (3) the theories of change and
development.
The rapid social changes, modernisation and other developments
occurring in Papua New Guinea are a new experience. Prior to this,
people have lived in Papua New Guinea for 50,000 years,
developing material and nonmaterial cultures such as the use of
simple technology including stone axes, digging sticks, dug out
canoes etc., houses made of sago or kunai grass, reciprocity or
gift-exchanges, interdependence, sharing, consensus, behaviour
controlled by established social norms, and the overall social,
political, economic and cultural structures and functions fused into a
single dynamic institution, predominantly through the family units
and kinship relationships. The destabilisation of this traditional
social structural system occurred as a consequence of the
introduction of profound changes and transformations when Great
Britain annexed Papua and Germany proclaimed New Guinea in
1884. Further developments that occurred during the colonisation
process are discussed in the paper.
Education, a powerful agent of social change, has and is playing a
crucial role during the modernisation and development process in
meeting such requirements as manpower needs of the country or
enabling political and economic development. Not only that but it is
maintaining the new social strata that are emerging in the society.
The top cream of the new social strata, called here the social,
political, and economic elite are enjoying the perks and privileges
associated with the positions they hold. They have been
emancipated from the hard rural life as far as Western schooling is
concerned.
Simultaneously, being a heterogeneous society, the dysfunctions of
education are also playing a role in which students are screened
using examinations as the criteria and a majority of them are
leaving school annually along the different levels of the education
system. This is contributing to the over-production of educated
people for the limited supply of jobs in both the government and
private sectors,'consequently leading to unemployment and an
upsurge in social problems. It is argued here that it would be
completely a false assumption if people believe that education is
wholly responsible for the social stratification, social inequality,
instability and unemployment related problems such as the break
down of law and order, disrespect for authority and established
social norms, or rascalism.
According to Etzioni and Etzioni, all efforts to explain societal
change, whether positive or negative, as originating in one single
factor have so utterly failed, thus, contemporary sociologists have
almost unanimously have adopted a multifactor approach (1964:7).
Etzioni and Etzioni also claim that social change may originate in any
institutional area, bringing about changes in other areas, which in
turn make for further adaptations in the initial sphere of change.
Technological, economic, political, religious, ideological, invention,
demographic and stratificational factors are all viewed as
potentially independent variables which influence each other, as
well as the course of society.
The current social situation in Papua New Guinea appears daunting
and pessimistic and for the masses of the people, the prospect is one
of rising inequalities, more intensive exploitation, chronic
unemployment and insecurity, misgovernment, social disruptions
and blighted opportunity during the modernisation and
development process. The paper suggests some ways in which the
national education system and the national government could
address some of these socio-economic problems to bring about
positive social changes in society. There is a need for strong genuine
political will, firm policy direction, diversification and
industrialisation of the economy, prudent planning, educational
reforms, constitutional reforms, increased training of skilled
manpower, coordinated integration, wise spending of available
resources and critical examination and analysis of wider social,
political, economic, and cultural issues and implications by those in
power. Perhaps these actions may help in some ways to bring about
equilibrium in the different components that make up the whole
social system, consequently creating a more just and stable society.
Social, political, and economic stability is vitally essential for
economic investment, modernisation and industrial growth.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.110812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a curriculum in oral skills for training Chinese tour
              guides</field><field name="creator">Yong-ming, Gao</field><field name="description">During the last seven years or so, China has adopted
an open-door policy, which has brought about an increase
in diplomatic intercourse, and cultural and technical
exchanges between China and other countries. And, above all,
the number of tourists coming to visit China has been
growing rapidly year by year. Together with this increase
comes the demand for tour guides, especially Englishspeaking
tour guides.
Since most Chinese tour guides who are presently
working in the travel service have not been able to receive
professional training, they encounter difficulties of
various kinds in their work. Such a situation demonstrates
an urgent need for designing a special curriculum for
training Chinese tour guides.
Problems with the current situation are analysed in
detail in Chapter 2. The analysis reveals that there are
problems with the existing arrangement for recruiting tour
guides and also tour guides' weakness in oral communication
with tourists which is a result of inadequate training.
In order to have an objective picture of Chinese tour
guides' oral English &#65533; both strengths and weaknesses &#65533; a
questionnaire was designed, and interviews were conducted
as part of the field study. The whole of Chapter 3 is
devoted to the analyses of the questionnaire and interviews,
which includes the designing and distribution of the
questionnaire and the data analysis.
Chapter 4 focuses on the discussion of the importance
of aims and objectives in the curriculum. It offers
guidelines for the other elements of the curriculum which
are stated in relation to students' future needs.
Students are expected to achieve the goals set for
them in the course through studying the course materials.
Therefore, teaching materials have to be selected in order
to be able to serve the basic aims and objectives of the
course. Considerations need to be given to both language
and content. Details of how to choose course content are
dealt with in Chapter 5.
The final chapter gives suggestions for teaching
and evaluation.
This field study report is not intended to present a
proper curriculum. Instead, it is hoped to suggest some
aspects worthy of consideration when the training in oral
English for tour guides is being planned.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">tour guides</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.111426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching English newswriting skills to Chinese students : a
              comparative study of news writing in Chinese and English and some
              suggestions on teaching</field><field name="creator">Yueming, Yu</field><field name="description">Journalism education in China began early this century.
However, the drastic changes in the Chinese society since the First
World War have greatly hindered the development of journalism
education. With the fall of the "gang of four" in 1976, China entered
a new period in its history which is marked by a strong desire of the
CPC and the people to modernize their country in the shortest possible
time. This situation has produced an ever-increasing need for better
journalists, especially international journalists who are able to use
foreign language to promote mutual understanding and exchange between
China and other countries. To meet this demand, the speciality of
international journalism, a combination of journalism training and
foreign language learning, has come into existence in many
institutions.
However, to teach Chinese students English journalism,
particularly the skill of news writing in English, is not easy.
Students constantly encounter difficulties in writing English news
articles. They have problems in both language use and organisations.
Their writing is very often unnatural and sometimes hard to comprehend
for English-speaking readers. The reasons are mainly as follows.
First, news writing, unlike any other form of writing,
involves particular requirements which need to be carefully studied
and analysed, such as the criteria for news value, the special
structure of the article and the special choice of words.
Secondly, as China's policy towards journalism is very
different from that of the west, its approach towards news is also
different. Therefore, what is included in a Chinese news article is
not always of news value to western readers.
Thirdly, Chinese and English are two very different
languages. Many dissimilarities exist in all aspects of the two
languages, linguistic and rhetorical. Chinese students often find it
difficult to free themselves of mother tongue interference.
To solve these problems, a comparative study of the news
writing styles in both languages should be made by the teachers and
students so that they can realise the similarities and dissimilarities
between the two languages and their relative strengths and weaknesses
in news writing.
In addition, practice is also essential in the training of
journalists. Extensive exposure to good English news writing styles
and practices in producing them will surely benefit the students in
their study of journalism.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">journalism education</field><field name="subject">news writing</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.111902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching English pronunciation in the context of the Chinese
              education system</field><field name="creator">Yu-Zhen, Wang</field><field name="description">Pronunciation is an important component of English teaching,
particularly in a non-English speaking country like China,
where students' exposure to the target language may be only
listening to tapes or to the teacher in class, or occasionally
watching a film in English, if these audio-visual facilities
are available.
However, the majority of teachers do not pay enough attention
to pronunciation because it always competes for class times
with other aspects of language teaching. Moreover, it is not
usually tested. As a result, after several years of studying
English, some students still cannot speak or read aloud with
any degree of accuracy or fluency.
Therefore it is essential that in China, the teacher's
professional inventory should include acquaintance with basic
articulatory phonetics and the phonological system of English,
because the teacher is inevitably a pronunciation model for the
student. Furthermore, the correction of students' aberrant
pronunciation is a continuing task throughout years of teaching
at different levels, and one which requires patience and
alertness as well as effective techniques.
With the rapid development of education in China, the problem
of effective teaching of pronunciation has become more
prominent. According to the government's plan, the number of
students planned to be enrolled in tertiary institutions alone
will increase by 42.2 per cent from 1981 to 1985. Foreign
language teaching, in theory, starts from the third year of
primary school and continues right through the second year of
college. The training of teachers at these levels, especially
at the primary and secondary levels, is a serious problem.
Pronunciation is an inescapable part of language teaching. The
questions raised in this paper and the suggestions made may, in
part, assist with the training of the large numbers of
effective speakers of foreign languages that China needs.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">pronunciation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.112225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In disunity, weakness</field><field name="creator">Zadnik, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The National Farmers Federation (NFF) is a peak producer organisation. Its
executive has purported to represent all Australian farmers with a unified
voice. This thesis argues that primary producers are too heterogeneous a
group ever to have developed much solidarity in articulation of or action
for the furtherance of common interests and that this fact is reflected in the
NFF.
Heterogeneity results from farm size, product specialisation, level of
technology adopted, geographical location and special needs. Successive
farm organisations and the National Party (and predecessors) have
attempted to encompass these differences since the 1890s. Producer
differences either have led to secession or to unification when political and
economic circumstances have warranted it.
This diversity has prevented farm groups becoming united. The lack of
unity at first prevented all farmers joining in one organisation, and when
they did, they kept on splitting up. The charisma of Ian McLachlan allowed
farmers to get together, but the diversity meant that the getting together
benefited some not only without the others, but sometimes at the expense of
others.
This thesis explores the heterogeneity of the agricultural sector within the
political and economic context of Australian agriculture and discusses its
consequences, in the constant re-forming of farm organisations and the
institutional framework of the NFF in the context of politicisation of
agricultural interest groups.
This thesis concludes that producer differences in terms of size and product
specialisation determine how effectively they are represented. Corporate
farmers have fared much better than family and family-plus farmers, who
would probably be better represented by a small business organisation, with
which they have more in common, rather than a farming organisation.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National Farmers Federation</field><field name="subject">NFF</field><field name="subject">Australian farmers</field><field name="subject">farming organisations</field><field name="subject">agricultural sector</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.112712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology acceptance in modern organisations : the role of past

used to their full capacity. It is therefore important to be able to understand, explain and predict the
factors affecting technology acceptance. One model which has been successful at this is the
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM; Davis, 1986). This study tests an extension of the TAM in
a mandatory usage environment. The extended TAM proposed here incorporates two new
independent measures; past behaviour and perceived behavioural control. Participants were 285
members of an Australian Government Department who had been using a new information system
for approximately 4 months. Usage of the system was mandated in organisational policy and there
were no alternative systems or processes available to participants to complete their job
requirements. Results indicate that when information system usage is mandatory (or nonvolitional)
perceived behavioural control significantly increases the ability of the extended TAM
to predict system acceptance behaviour. Furthermore, self-reports of system usage were not related
to the participants intention to use the system and user satisfaction was the only dependent variable
accurately predicted by the model. Past behaviour did not predict either behavioural intention or
behaviour in this study. The implications of these findings for technology acceptance in modern
organisations and areas for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">technology acceptance</field><field name="subject">behavioural control</field><field name="subject">Technology Acceptance Model</field><field name="subject">TAM</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.114544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Chinese literature in Australia during the last

importance and urgency for the Chinese EFL teaching profession to be

Chinese EFL learners and to strive for ways and means of reducing it.
This study was undertaken as an exploratory study of this problem.
As recognised by many now, linguistic competence alone is not sufficient
for a successful foreign language learner, one needs to acquire
communicative competence as well. In this study, a historical overview
of the theory of communicative competence is provided. Following it
is a detailed description of a survey which aimed to measure several
areas of communicative competence of Chinese learners of English and to
find out existing problems. Possible causal factors of those problems
are also discussed and are categorised into two groups: communicative
interference and weaknesses in the present curriculum, teaching
methodology and teaching materials. Finally, implications of this
study are examined and tentative suggestions are made in the hope that
more and more Chinese EFL teachers will respond to the problem and
search for ways to bring about effective learning.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">English a a foreign language</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">communicative competence</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.121322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of social competence and EFL teaching in China</field><field name="creator">Zheng, Zhong</field><field name="description">Linguistic competence is a person's knowledge of the
forms of a language. This knowledge is not sufficient
for communication because communication involves a
knowledge of appropriate ways to use the language, that
is, when to say what to whom. A part of this total
capacity which may be termed 'social competence' is the
knowledge and ability to create and maintain a harmonious
atmosphere in social interaction.
&#65533; Social competence is acquired as a person grows up
in a given society, learning to play different roles. In
social interaction, social competence enables a person to
live up to the expectations of these roles, and to act in
such a way as to satisfy the interests of others in
exchange for satisfaction of his own. One of the
individual's interests in interaction is 'face': a desire
for freedom from imposition and for appreciation. The
preservation of a harmonious atmosphere in social
interaction largely depends on how well the interactants
preserve their own and each other's face. Certain speech
acts are intrinsically face threatening, so mitigating
strategies must be used to redress these acts.
Owing to the differences in social values and
personal relations in different societies, Chinese speakers
of English may not perceive the threat to face involved in
doing certain acts in the same way that English native
speakers would perceive it. As a result, they may
unwittingly threaten native speakers' face. Moreover,
Chinese speakers may not be able to use mitigating
strategies appropriately and may therefore be unable to
maintain the desired harmonious atmosphere in
interaction with native speakers of English.
Therefore, in addition to learning the forms of
English language, Chinese speakers should be encouraged
to develop social competence, by learning the target
language culture and by practising the appropriate
polite strategies in social interaction.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages</field><field name="subject">EFL</field><field name="subject">English a a foreign language</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">social competence</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.121832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The friction in China-Japan trade co-operation (1979-1985) : a
              case study on the impact of the different developments of two
              Confucian societies</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Jonathan</field><field name="description">After a long period of isolation, China embarked on an open
door policy in 1978. Keen to modernize her economy and
improve her living standards, China sought to intensify her
economic relations with Japan, one of her closest neighbours
and one of the most advanced and dynamic economies in the
world.
An air of optimism marked the signing of the Japan-China
Long Term Trade Protocol in 1978. China was confident that
this agreement would launch her into the path of modernization
in a relatively short period of time. This process of
intensification of economic links with Japan, however, was not
without difficulties. Over the years between 1979 and 1985,
the Chinese failed to fulfil key obligations of the agreement
including the non-payment for service received and the
permiting of, severe shortfalls in the supply of agreed goods.
The execution of the agreement was beset with problems. The
agreement from which both sides had hoped to reap
substantial economic benefits did not bear fruit; instead friction
developed, which had ensued with disastrous consequences
for both sides.
What was the root cause of this friction? Was it the
consequence of the incompatibility of the economic systems,
one communist and the other capitalist? Or was the failure the
result of political factors? Or could it be a much deeper reason
relating to inherent socio-cultural factors which affected the
decision-making processes in each of the countries?
This thesis seeks to examine closely the root cause of the
Chinese-Japanese trade friction. The writer argues that while
different ideologies and political systems contributed to the
problem, the dominant reason has socio-cultural origins, which
have to do with the way the Chinese and Japanese societies
evolved historically. Although both societies had Confucian
ethical underpinnings of their social systems, they began to
develop their own distinct characteristics. This coloured their
world views and had a major impact in the way each society
evolved its management practices. The Chinese rejection of
some key aspects of Confucianism and its acceptance of Qinstyle
authoritarianism, as subsequently modified by Sino-
Marxist principles, produced an organisational framework and
set of practices that did not prepare China to meet the
demands of economic modernisation. This had adversely
effected China's abilities to manage its trade relations with the
economically advanced Japan.
Section One of this thesis, which includes Chapters 1 and 2,
outlines the framework of Chinese-Japanese trade cooperation
beginning in the late 1970's. Chapter 1. seeks to give
an overview of the rationale behind China's new open-door
policy and its expectations of trade co-operation with Japan. It
outlines the nature of trade co-operation including the structure
of China-Japan trade. Chapter 2. proceeds to discuss the
ensuing difficulties and the responses of the Chinese and
Japanese governments. The writer then discusses the
subsequent actions taken by the two governments to revive the
co-operation that had gone wrong. An analysis of the faults of
both governments that led to the disastrous consequences is
then made.
Section Two, which includes Chapters 3 and 4, seeks to
examine the fundamental causes of the friction in the trade
relations between the two countries. The writer examines the
role played by socio-cultural factors and how they affected the
decision-making processes in both countries. In particular,
Chapter 3. analyses the role of feudalism in China as modified
by the emergence of the centralized bureaucracy which
characterize the Qin dynasty (221 to 207 BC). The impact of
the anti-merchantilism, which was the direct consequence of
Qin-style bureaucracy, and the question of the destruction of
the urban middle class by the bureaucracy are highlighted.
The writer argues that the absence of the urban middle class is
one of the fundamental reasons why China is unable to
produce an economically-progressive, capitalist-oriented
society. This led to a state of economic backwardness.
Chapter 4. contrasts the Chinese situation with Japan, by
analysing the ideological underpinning of Japanese society. It
outlines the various reform movements in Japan that led to the
development of a society that is economically dynamic . A
modern state has emerged in Japan in contrast to the
emergence of a backward society in China. The writer also
discusses the influence of Japanese Confucian values in the
development of this modern state. This was to have a
significant impact on Japanese management philosophy and
practices.
The last Section, which includes Chapter 5, 6, and 7,
discusses the lessons to be learnt from the trade friction
betwen the two countries. In particular, Chapter 5. analyses
the vastly different approaches taken by the Chinese in
contrast to the Japanese. The Chinese decision-making
process which is characterized by chaos, inefficiency and
bureaucratic bungling is contrasted with the Japanese style.
The latter's approach is systematic, well thought out and
meticulously planned. The Japanese, however, failed to take
into account the vastly different operating environment in their
dealings with China. Chinese behavioural responses were a
variable that the Japanese were unprepared to deal with. This
resulted in chaos in the strategic management of the trade
relations between the two countries. Notwithstanding this
friction, however, both China and Japan realize that they must
proceed with their trade relations and minimize whatever
frictions emerged over time. The last part of the thesis, Chapter
6. outlines the possible approaches that both sides can adopt
in their dealings with each other. An approach with Lindblom's
"muddling through" perspective is recommended by the writer.

The purpose of the research was to present a comparative
study on teachers' responses, in both educational settings, examining
their understanding of the curriculum change, the concerns of
individuals and the levels of curriculum usage in relation to the factors
affecting implementation.
The application of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model of
Change (Hall and Loucks, 1987), enabled the study to focus on the
various forms of the innovation, including the innovation configuration,
stages of concern, and the levels of use from the two given
perspectives, teachers in Support Units and teachers in Special

The study findings highlighted that in both educational
settings, change is accomplished by individuals and is a highly personal

through appropriate actions, in order to assist effective and successful
implementation of the change.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New South Wales Department of Education</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">South Coast</field><field name="subject">support units</field><field name="subject">special schools</field><field name="subject">h severe intellectual disability</field><field name="subject">curriculum document</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.124101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian Heritage Commission : a thing we want to keep?</field><field name="creator">Davies, Graham</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Heritage Commission</field><field name="subject">AHC</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061112.125611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The features of interactive discourse that characterise a
               reasoning-based teacher approach to classroom discussion</field><field name="creator">Triglone, Robyn J.</field><field name="description">This study takes a theoretical stance that relies on the notion that cognitive
development is predominantly a process of learning. The study rests
particularly on the Vygotskian theory that children learn within a social
environment by practising cognitive skills, under expert tutelage, that they
will later perform independently. If children are to develop skills in
reasoning the classroom needs to be a place where reasoning skills are
modelled, practised and reinforced. Certain features of interactive discourse
may have the effect of emphasising the content of a discussion at the
expense of the reasoning process and therefore of the practice of reasoning.
This study investigated the interactive discourse of a classroom discussion
that had reasoning as the sole objective of the discussion and identified the
discourse features that characterised the discussion. One experimental
kindergarten group and two experimental grade 1/2 groups were introduced
to a reasoning-based approach using the Elfie package. A discussion, based
on a children's story, was then held with these groups and with two
experimental kindergartens that had received no previous exposure to the
reasoning-based approach. Examination was also made of the discourse
features of a control kindergarten discussion and a grade 1/2 discussion.
Important differences were identified between the discourse features of the
control and experimental classrooms.
Analyses of the experimental discussions found a lower proportion of
teacher utterances that were psuedo questions, and that included evaluation
of pupil comments; a higher proportion of teacher invitations to explore the
logical implications of an idea; a higher proportion of pupil utterances that
were in response to other pupil comments and a higher proportion of pupil
utterances that included reasons.
Analyses of control discussions found that the prevailing pattern of
discourse involved teacher initiation (often a pseudo question) - pupil
response - teacher evaluation and re-elicitation. Discussion is included about
the role such a pattern plays in emphasising content at the expense of the
process of reasoning.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interactive discourse</field><field name="subject">classroom discussion</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.083357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Healthy school communities : a way forward for the twenty

ecological health- a notion that health, using a broad
definition, is a product of the societies and environments in
which we live. It is the aim of the WHO to achieve "Health for
All by the Year 2000." This reform agenda incorporates
education as a tool for social change. This study investigates
the role of education in social change, with local and global
health as an objective. The background to the development of
this concept is outlined, as are the social issues that make
this such an important perspective. Theories of social
formation and the role of the school in relation to society are
discussed, and the research that confirms that schools do
"make a difference" reported. Definitions of change, factors
affecting social change and models of change are described.
Factors relating specifically to educational change are outlined
and related to examples of educational change, designed to
promote social change, in Australia. Case studies, composed
of descriptions of schools written by staff members to
illustrate the process of working towards becoming "Healthy
School Communities" and transcripts of interviews, are
analysed to determine the extent and type of change that is
taking place within each school, and how the changes are
happening. Schools reported changes to attitude,
understanding, policies and practice. The analysis is then
discussed, and the conclusion reached that this construct of
education has some useful conceptual frameworks, for the
cultural changes that are occurring in Australia and other
Western cultures.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational change</field><field name="subject">healthy school communities</field><field name="subject">educational reform</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.082047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of design patterns in framework development</field><field name="creator">Della, Lewis</field><field name="description">Since the coining of the term "Design Patterns" in the software engineering context, and
specifically as related to object-oriented applications, there has been an increasing
emphasis placed on the relevance of patterns in successfully designing object-oriented
software, by the provision of generic, recurring designs. Various authors have produced
design pattern catalogues as a record of applied design pattern experiences
[Buschmann+96] [Gamma+95] [Coad92]. These catalogues are invaluable to
experienced practitioners. However, the examples are frequently given in the context of a
complex application with partially coded examples. Also, there is no standard with
regard to the name used to designate a particular design pattern and, in some cases,
different designers have designated relatively similar patterns with quite different names.
This limits their accessibility to less experienced designers who require fully coded
examples applied in a familiar landscape. Thus, while patterns have dramatically shaped
the manner in which object-oriented solutions are developed, the full realisation of their
use and reuse potential by inexperienced practitioners is limited by lack of completely
coded examples.
In this thesis we consider the implementation (in Java), using fully coded examples, of a
number of design patterns applied to business oriented applications. These will be applied
in an application specific environment, with the resultant framework being capable of use
across a family of similar applications. The source code examples are compact enough so
that the pattern structure can be readily appreciated, while at the same time being large
enough to demonstrate the pattern in a practical, viable sense. These are applied in a
familiar application domain, business-oriented applications, resulting in an application
framework, that is, a partially completed system that provide the core architecture
functionality, suitable for reuse across a family of systems. In this way, the link between
design patterns and their implementation via these coded frameworks will be easier to
comprehend. It is anticipated that the end result will be a better appreciation of design
patterns and a clearer understanding of how to apply these patterns, with the availability
of a set of useful, reusable software components, with appropriate interface connection,
to be used as central building blocks, in developing object-oriented solutions for business
applications.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design patterns</field><field name="subject">framework development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.084526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing the risks to the revenue : a new model for evaluating
              taxpayer audit programs</field><field name="creator">Wickerson, John</field><field name="description">Traditionally, tax administrations have used taxpayer audit program resources
principally to deter deliberate noncompliance, 'encourage' due care in the
exercise of tax obligations, and recoup otherwise forgone Revenue.
Usually, a corresponding perspective has been adopted by those policy analysts
concerned with identifying and modelling the 'optimal' design characteristics
of taxpayer audit programs. But, in the process, they have presumed that tax
administrations make no efforts to learn from the results of taxpayer audits.
Equally, most policy analysts have presumed that taxpayer audit programs can
play no part in tax administrations' efforts to improve the underlying
willingness and ability of taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations.
One important adverse consequence of these presumptions has been that the
taxpayer compliance behavior literature has paid very little attention to the
major policy issue of how tax administrations should go about allocating their
taxpayer audit program resources so as to best manage what the candidate has
termed the risks to the Revenue. These risks are defined to be those which stem
from the lack of information available to tax administrations about both deliberate
and inadvertent noncompliance by taxpayers.
In the empirical part of the taxpayer compliance behavior literature it is now
well-appreciated that both the nature and the degree of taxpayer noncompliance
can vary considerably across different categories (populations) of taxpayers.
Thus the 'risks to the Revenue' can likewise vary considerably across taxpayer
populations. In turn, different taxpayer populations may well require different
program 'treatments'. Accordingly, it is now being recognised in the empirical
literature that much more attention needs to be paid to the types of information
tax administrations require about taxpayer noncompliance so as to better
perform their central role.
It is already widely agreed by policy analysts that a tax administration's central
role is a broad one, and that it entails ensuring, as far as is practicable and
socially desirable, all taxpayers pay the correct amounts of tax - preferably
voluntarily. However, a tax administration's performance in this regard has to
be assessed largely on the results obtained from taxpayer audit programs.
There is therefore a need for a new conceptualisation (model) of what might
constitute an 'optimal' taxpayer audit program, and which better captures both
the various aspects of taxpayer noncompliance and the information
requirements of tax administrations.
The need for such a model has now become an urgent one. This is especially
because a number of tax administrations, including the Australian Taxation
Office, are no longer seeking to use taxpayer audit program resources
principally in the traditional deterrence, 'encouragement' and Revenue-recovery
mode. Instead, these resources are increasingly being used to help identify
those taxpayer populations, as distinct from individual noncompliant taxpayers,
which represent the greatest 'risks to the Revenue'. In turn, the results from
taxpayer audits conducted in the 'high risk' populations are being used to help
the tax administration determine the most appropriate strategies for improving
future compliance in these populations.
It will be argued in this thesis that the capture of these important strategic
characteristics of modern taxpayer audit programs cannot be achieved by
augmenting the existing deterrence-based models. A complementary model,
more suitable for wider policy analysis, is therefore developed which can
readily encompass these characteristics. This model is based on the construct of
a budget-constrained tax administration seeking to manage the risks to the
Revenue in (what is described in the organizational literature as) a Learning
Organization environment, and where market segmentation techniques are drawn
on when making inter-population resource allocation decisions.
The policy value of this model is then demonstrated by applying it to both
quantitative and qualitative data compiled by the candidate for the Business
Audit Program of the Australian Taxation Office. In the process, a number of
separate, substantive contributions are made to the program monitoring,
program evaluation and taxpayer compliance behavior literatures.
Collectively, these contributions provide support for the central argument of
this thesis that both taxpayer compliance behavior researchers and policy
analysts now need to pay much more attention to the information-gathering and
strategic resource allocation challenges confronting tax administrations. The
policy issues arising here, it will be argued, go to the heart of what constitutes
successful and accountable tax administration, and (in turn) a 'high integrity'
tax regime which is both efficient and equitable.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">taxpayer audit programs</field><field name="subject">taxation</field><field name="subject">revenue</field><field name="subject">tax administrations</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.085145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-mastectomy self-perceptions and breast restoration decision-
              making in women who wear external breast prostheses and women who
              have had breast reconstructions : implications for health
              professionals</field><field name="creator">Lewis Reaby, Linda</field><field name="description">Women diagnosed with breast cancer and who have the disease surgically treated by
mastectomy experience a health crisis. This thesis focused on the behaviours, feelings
and attitudes of women during their breast cancer and mastectomy experiences. The
overall purpose was to identify therapeutic factors that can be used by health
professionals to improve the psychological and physiological well-being of women with
this disease. The conceptual scaffolding for the thesis was drawn from the fields of
perceptual psychology and decision-making.
The thesis was supported by a study that examined specific areas concerning the breast
cancer and mastectomy experience. These areas were self-perceptions, the
psychological milieu resulting from a breast cancer diagnosis, and post-mastectomy
breast restoration decision-making. The population included: a prosthesis group of 64
women who had mastectomies and wore external breast prostheses, a reconstruction
group of 31 women who had mastectomies and underwent breast reconstructions, a
control A group of 75 women who had not experienced mastectomy, and a control B
group of 65 women who also had not experienced mastectomy.
Self-perceptions:
The perceptions of the prosthesis, reconstruction and control A groups regarding their
body-image, self-concept, total self-image, and self-esteem were compared by using
Polivy's (1977) Body-Image Scale and Rosenberg's (1965) Self-Esteem Scale. The
body-image, total self-image, and self-esteem mean scores indicated that the prosthesis
and reconstruction groups had more positive feelings regarding their bodies than did the
control group. There were no significant differences in self-concept among the three
groups. These findings challenge a common assumption that mastectomy automatically
results in psychiatric morbidity caused by an altered body-image and suggest that health
professionals should not make assumptions about how a woman will psychologically
respond to mastectomy.
Quality of life perceptions were compared among the prosthesis, reconstruction and
control B groups using the Ferrans and Powers (1985) Quality of Life Index. The mean
scores of the prosthesis and reconstruction groups were higher than the control group's
scores, with higher scores indicating more positive quality of life perceptions. The
findings suggest that the women in the mastectomy samples had found ways to cope
with their health crises. Over time, they learned not to define all existence in terms of a
cancer diagnosis and had gained or maintained a positive perspective on life.
Post-mastectomy attitudes in the prosthesis and the reconstruction groups were
compared. Using the Mastectomy Attitude Scale the results indicated that both groups
were satisfied with their bodies, had a positive outlook towards their lives, implied that
sexuality entailed more than having breasts, and felt that mastectomy treatment was
necessary to save their lives. Neither group concealed that they had a mastectomy, nor
were the women prone to discuss their mastectomy experiences. The findings from the
study indicate that the women post-mastectomy already had or developed positive
attitudes towards themselves and life in general and the method chosen for breast
restoration had no apparent impact on these attitudes.
The self-perception data indicated that women do adjust and cope with breast cancer
surgically treated by mastectomy. These women should be encouraged by health
professionals to develop a helping relationship with other women who are newly
diagnosed with the disease. This alliance could engender hope in those women who are
beginning their journey along a similar road to survival. More hope for these women
and less fatalism would decrease their sense of crisis and facilitate their abilities to take
an active part in the decision-making processes relating to their treatment.
Psychological Milieu:
The women in the prosthesis and the reconstruction groups were interviewed about their
breast cancer and mastectomy experiences. The findings supported the premise that
receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer plunged the women into a health crisis and caused
an instant disruption to their lives. The women found that they had to suddenly deal
with several complex issues all at the same time, such as what must be done in the
immediate future to treat the cancer, as well as the more frightening issues of the
meaning of the illness on their ultimate life expectancy. All of this turmoil played
havoc with their ability to make informed decisions regarding their breast cancer
treatment alternatives. This finding suggests the need for more individualised
interventions and support for women when they are making decisions during this
stressful period. Health professionals need to keep in mind that simply hearing the
word "cancer" often prevents a person from assimilating the complete diagnosis,
indicated treatments, and possible prognosis. Therefore, care-givers must be prepared
to repeat and elaborate upon information previously given to the affected individual and
the family.
Breast Restoration Decision-Making:
To evaluate the prosthesis and the reconstruction groups' abilities to undertake
competent breast restoration decision-making, a 5 Stage process was devised, modelled
after Janis and Mann's (1977) seven criteria for competent decision-making. Analysis
of the data revealed that both groups displayed passive information seeking behaviour
in relation to breast restoration alternatives. They had either no knowledge or limited
knowledge regarding the alternatives. Their lack of knowledge was due either to (1)
anxiety about their disease, or (2) deficiencies in the interpersonal skills of individuals
presenting information to them, or (3) the perceptions that they had insufficient time to
gather information, or (4) a combination of these factors.
Because the prosthesis and the reconstruction groups were under stress they used coping
styles to accomplish decision-making. To measure their coping styles five categories
were defined, based on Janis and Mann's (1977) conflict model of emergency decisionmaking
and Simon's (1957) notion of "bounded rationality". Two styles emerged. The
prosthesis group used the "Sideliner" style that allowed the women to make a quick,
conflict-free decision. They were not aware of alternative choices resulting in their
decision-making experience being uncomplicated and effortless. The reconstruction
group used the "Contented" style that also allowed them an uncomplicated and
effortless decision-making experience. The women decided that breast reconstruction
was their only viable option. Many of them did not even think that they had made a
decision about an alternative because of the strong salience towards breast
reconstruction.
A breast restoration decision-making model has been developed and proposed for
women to use when considering their alternatives. This model offers to health
professionals and women a realistic and useable decision-making process that can be
implemented when individuals are experiencing a health crisis. The model can be
modified and used for numerous situations that require decisions regarding treatment
alternatives.
This inquiry has demonstrated that there is a need for a specific health professional to
assist women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. This individual would assume
several roles that include one of advocacy for the women, and the important role of
ensuring that these individuals have the information and knowledge to make competent
decisions regarding their breast cancer treatments.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breast restoration</field><field name="subject">mastectomy</field><field name="subject">breast prostheses</field><field name="subject">breast reconstructions</field><field name="subject">breast cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.091439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Straits Times' reporting of Singapore's communication news,

Singapore's communication news between May 1992 and October 1995,
with a focus on Singapore's communication regionalisation. This study is
a modest attempt to depart from some of the approaches taken by recent
communication related studies of the Singapore experience. They tend to
focus on the domestic side of state-press relationship and the issue of
Singaporean press freedom, without sustained consideration of external
forces, such as globalisation.
This analysis provides a synthesis of secondary sources and a qualitative
content analysis of communication news in the Straits Times. The results
suggest there has been a convergence between the stories in the Straits
Times and official views about two themes - business regionalisation and
'Asian' media standards. Results suggest the government has an
extensive influence over Singapore's communication, especially with
regard to media content. Also, the analysis shows Singapore's
identification with Asia, despite bilateral and regional tensions in business
and culture, and suggests an uneasy relationship between Singapore and
the West, in particular, with the US. That is, while Singapore's business
relations with the US are good, its cultural relations are not, especially
when Singapore's practice of media standards does not accept the
American interpretation, but one based on its national interests.
This study provides a glimpse of global communication forces which
are influencing Singapore's communication development, as interpreted
in the stories from the Straits Times. Although there remains
uncertainties about Singapore's communication future, this study may
provide an insight as to whether Singapore has taken the right direction
in becoming a leading country in advocating an 'Asian voice'.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Straits Times</field><field name="subject">news reporting</field><field name="subject">communication news</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.101002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of contraction : a case study</field><field name="creator">Rooney, J.

Perhaps people of different nations and races and cultures

This study takes a look at a unique approach to the hope
that education is a force which can be used to unite nations and

whether a person educated internationally is or is not contributing

The work starts with a review of developments in international
education and moves to a consideration of what this mode of
education is. It then deals with the only known vehicle of international
education operating at the secondary level, the International

of the international organization set up by Lord Mountbatten
to co-ordinate the efforts of all those around the world who

1976-1979 saw the development of H.D.C.V. Guidelines to form the
basis for designing school-based curricula, together with some initial
implementation of H.D.C.V. within the schools.
This curriculum differs from other human development programs in
that life issues are explored from a particular philosophical background
- that of the Catholic - rather than being completely open-ended
in approach. In this sense the project is innovatory.
The basic principles and processes in the H.D.C.V. Guidelines are
identified and illuminated by describing the project and its preliminary
events, justifying the project in terms of Church and modern
educational criteria, examining the curriculum design, reflecting on
early implementation in a sample school, and by discussing the problems

In summary, the study serves to underline the difficulty and

     enrolments</field><field name="creator">Wells, John L.</field><field name="description">The Report of the Field Study is a descriptive record of:-
(i) the development of the A.C.T. Schools Authority
according to a particular philosophy and operational
structure of devolution of responsibility to schools
and community participation in decision making at
school and system level.
(ii) the impact which changes in government policy in the
areas of
(a) growth of the Australian Public Service and Canberra
(b) funding of the A.C.T. government schools
have on the A.C.T. Schools Authority operations.
(iii) the mechanism by which policy is being developed for
the maintenance of small high schools as individual
organizations in a situation of contracting enrolments.
The functions of the A.C.T. Schools Authority are, amongst
others, to establish and conduct,pre schools, primary schools,
high schools and secondary colleges.
In 1980 there were 165 schools and of these only three were
outside the city of Canberra.
During the 1960's Canberra underwent extensive expansion of
the city boundaries because of rapid increases in population
as a result of government policy in establishing the city as
the seat of government. Government departments were moved
from rented premises in other cities to new purpose built
buildings in Canberra. Economic conditions and government
funding supported all aspects of the expansion as it continued
into the '70's.
The government school building programme was one of many which
had to be integrated into the city growth plan. In 1960 there
were three secondary schools, in 1970 there were nine and in
1980 there were twenty three.
This Field Study is concerned with the A.C.T. Schools Authority's
approach to its responsibilities under the following changed
circumstances.
1. Change in growth rate of Canberra.
From 1976, as a result of a change in government policy and in
different economic conditions and policies there was a dramatic
and unpredicted decrease in the rate of population increase.
Movement of government departments to Canberra was severely
curtailed and the service industries and building industries
consequently also dramatically reduced their expansion. By
1978 there was evidence of a severe contraction in these
industries and the growth of Canberra in the 60's to mid 70's
had changed to a no-growth and then a decline.
2. Schools with small enrolments.
Added to the nil or very slow population increase in some
suburbs is the decline in the number of school age children
in the inner suburbs of the city resulting in schools
accommodating down to half of their previous numbers of
students and the completion of school buildings in the as yet
underpopulated outer suburbs. This latter situation developed
because the lead time required for the planning and building
of new schools is such that irreversible decisions had been
made in the context of the population growth period and the
resulting building programme was overtaken by the unexpected
policy reversal causing a no growth situation to develop.
The empty school buildings provoked the sparsely populated
new communities to press for their opening and so provide what
were seen to be essential community facilities.
3. Strict controls on costs.
Allied to its policy restricting the growth rate of Canberra
the government introduced strict controls on the cost of
government education services in the A.C.T. The real
difficulty was in the nature of the controls. Per-pupil costs
were not to rise in real terms after 1976/77. With "fixed"
costs such as cleaning, heating, maintenance, lighting and
janitor rising or at least remaining constant whilst school
enrolments decline, there was little hope of meeting the
government directive. The Authority therefore considered the
possibilities of deferring the opening of new schools and
phasing out some inner Canberra schools as the only means of
carrying out its responsibility.
The proposal evoked strong community reaction. It was claimed
that such an edict from the central authority was in contravention
of the philosophical and legal foundations of the
A.C.T. system. School Boards and communities were the places
where decisions could be made that would enable their schools
to remain as functioning entities, providing their students
with creative educational programmes and still adapt to the
economic constraints of the total system.
Faced with this resounding community disapproval the Schools
Authority established a Working Party on llth June 1979
"To consider the problems of declining and shifting school
populations and its effect on the A.C.T. school system. In
particular it will examine educational, financial and staffing
problems associated with conducting small secondary schools
and report to the Authority no later than June 1980".
The Working Party then mounted a programme of enquiry throughout
the A.C.T. Teachers, parents, students, School Boards, P &amp; C
committees and public meetings were asked to submit proposals,
express opinions and respond to models. The resulting report
Declining and Shifting Enrolments in A.C.T. Secondary schools
was presented and public response invited. Once again the
philosophy of the A.C.T. government school system was being put
into practice.
The study also investigates some of the issues in respect of
the individual small school facing declining enrolments and
consequently reductions in staffing and financial resources.
Some conclusions are posed for the individual school, the A.C.T.
Schools Authority and the various government instrumentalities
which service and to some extent control, the A.C.T. government
school system.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small high schools</field><field name="subject">enrolments</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT Schools Authority</field><field name="subject">government schools</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.132508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bloody footprints : learning to be with woman</field><field name="creator">Browne, Jennifer</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">midwives</field><field name="subject">Footprints Collective</field><field name="subject">midwifery</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.133355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences on calcium intake levels in premenopausal and
               postmenopausal women in the Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="creator">Onyango, Lilian Awuor</field><field name="description">Evidence has accumulated for a link between the adequacy of lifetime calcium intake,
and osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases in prevalence with age and is of concern as it
results in irreversible and debilitating effects. The result has been an increased
recognition of the need to survey the consumption patterns of foods that contribute to
calcium intake levels in Australia, the focus being milk and milk products.. A better
understanding of calcium intake in women and the factors influencing it across the lifespan
is of increasing importance as the longevity of Australian women continues to
increase. Without preventive measures the costs incurred in managing osteoporosis will
continue to escalate.
An understanding of women's food behaviour is important if calcium intake levels in
women are to effectively increase. A self administered questionnaire assessed the
calcium intake levels and food sources in 158 premenopausal and 142 postmenopausal
women. It also assessed significant differences in calcium intake levels and the relative
contributions of food sources to this intake. The questionnaire comprised a semiquantitative
food frequency questionnaire and closed end questions. The closed ended
questions measured psychosocial factors, stage of dietary change, levels of physical
activity and demographic factors. These factors formed the basis of an investigation
into factors best associated with the levels of adequacy of intake. The results suggest no
significant difference in calcium intake (milligrams per day) in the two groups of
women. There was a significant difference in the relative levels of adequacy of the
estimated calcium intake levels.
Milk and milk products contributed up to 84% of the daily calcium intake with 72.2 and
84.7% as the respective contributions in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
Fortified milk types have a relatively higher calcium content than unfortified types. A
higher consumption of fortified milk noted in the postmenopausal women could explain
the higher though not significant mean intake values post-menopausally.
Several of the enabling factors but none of the predisposing factors were noted to
influence intake of fortified milk. Taste generally influenced intake of fortified milk in
the whole sample of 300 women whereas perceived costs and health concerns were an
issue with the premenopausal women only. Other enabling factors such as the
perceptions of the adequacy of the present diet, and the feeling that there was too much
nutrition information that was in itself confusing influenced the intake of fortified milk
in postmenopausal but not premenopausal women.The influence of change related
factors was also noted. The importance ratings for nutrient issues influenced the intake
of fortified milk intake in the whole sample.
Food preference was the only enabling factor found to influence the adequacy of
calcium intake in the both the premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Change
related factors, were also noted to influence the adequacy of calcium intake in the
premenopausal and postmenopausal women and these included; the stage of change for
adopting a high calcium diet, the importance ratings for; increasing intake of milk and
milk products and the perceived adequacy of this intake. The other suggested
determinants of the adequacy of intake varied between the two groups of women.
These inc1uded;enabling factors; perceived cost of milk and milk products, milk
allergies, social support, availability of milk at home on a daily basis and the frequency
of meal preparation in the premenopausal group. Change related factors on the other
hand determined the postmenopausal intake and these included importance ratings for
eating low fat foods, perceived adequacy of fruit and vegetable intake, and importance
rating for an increased dietary calcium intake. The enabling factors; preferences, social
support and perceived adequacy of milk and milk products' intake were the best
predictors of the adequacy of premenopausal calcium intake whereas the change related
factors; the importance rating for a high calcium diet and the reluctance to change a diet
considered to be enjoyable best predicted the adequacy post-menopause.
Knowledge is a predisposing factor for behaviour change. The results show that
knowledge on the importance of a high calcium intake exists in the sample population.
This knowledge is however not being effectively translated into food behaviour. This
highlights the need for Nutrition education programs that stress the importance of food
behaviours. These programs should aim at increasing women's calcium intake levels
and destroying the few existing misconceptions regarding milk and milk product
consumption. The factors identified as determinants of intake in the premenopausal and
postmenopausal women are the basis of these education programs.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">calcium intake</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">postmenapausal</field><field name="subject">premenapausal</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.090046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The faith of marriage counseling clients -- naive or justified?
              : the experiences of seventy clients of the Canberra Marriage Counseling Service</field><field name="creator">Szuty, Helen</field><field name="description">Ideas for this research were conceived
following a discussion I had with the Director of the
Canberra Marriage Counseling Service (CMCS) in 1979.
Three aims of the research were identified.
Firstly, to collect information about the
counseling received by clients at the CMCS, from their
points of view. Secondly, to collect information about
the premature termination of some clients from marriage
counseling interviews at the CMCS. Thirdly, to discuss
other research findings in the light of this research
and so provide a structure from which future research
could be conducted.
Clients were interviewed according to a
questionnaire which I designed. Before the study began,
a pilot study was conducted with a small group of
clients, primarily, to assess the adequacy of the
questionnaire.
Clients who were involved in the study itself,
all completed initial interviews with new counselors
between and including the first day of February and the
last day of March, in 1981.
I interviewed all clients by telephone, who
were usually at home between eight and nine o'clock, on
Monday to Thursday evenings inclusive.
Clients were asked questions about the counseling
process, from the time that they presented with precipitating
problems to the time that they considered
returning to the CMCS or recommending its services
-. to others.
Raw data was collected on the following topics:
clients' precipitating problems, expectations, motivation
to attend counseling, rapport with their counselors,
experiences during the counseling process, premature
termination and counseling outcomes.
Results were compiled by cross-correlating the
raw data to obtain a composite picture of clients'
counseling experiences. Many statistically significant
findings were obtained and numerous recommendations have
been made on the basis of the findings.
Further research is recommended in three areas.
Firstly, a study similar to this one should be conducted
on a national scale to ascertain general standards of
marriage counseling across Australia. Secondly, a series
of experimental studies should be conducted on a number
of specific issues raised in this research. Thirdly, case
studies of individual clients should be conducted by CMCS
counselors which would enable them to easily incorporate
research work into their training and supervision
programmes.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marriage counseling</field><field name="subject">Canberra Marriage Counseling Service</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.163440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy decision-making in respect of some aspects of staffing in non-government schools : a case study</field><field name="creator">McCabe, Joseph W.</field><field name="description">Using 'policy studies' research the case study

and privacy regulation are also examined providing a legislative/political context

The fieldwork component of the thesis attempts to unravel individual

examination of the effects of Internet technology on a conceptual understanding
of privacy.
There is no doubt that the discussion of privacy and the electronic age is
extensive but discussion with individuals about their place in the debate and,
indeed, the legislation is yet to be tackled in an extensive manner. Until we
mesh the views of individuals in the community about their place in the new
communications technology and privacy debate, we will not reap the full
benefits of advances in communications technology. Consumers will remain
reluctant about and suspicious of breaches of their privacy via the Internet.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">regulation</field><field name="subject">privacy</field><field name="subject">email</field><field name="subject">Australian Privacy Act</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061114.094402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mammals of the dreaming : an historical ethnomammalogy of the
              Flinders Ranges</field><field name="creator">Tunbridge, Dorothy</field><field name="description">This work is a linguistically based historical ethnography of the mammal species of the Flinders Ranges, South Australia, from pre-European times to the present day.
The research was motivated by linguistic evidence in the Adnyamathanha people's
language, Yura Ngawarla, for the recent existence of a number of mammals in the Flinders
Ranges region. The work aims firstly to identify each species represented by those
language terms and to discover the identity of other species also present in the past 200
years. Secondly, it aims to present an exhaustive ethnography of mammals for that region.
This work is essentially cross-disciplinary, with research extending into the
often overlapping fields of linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, applied science,
historical zoology and history. Comparative linguistics, oral tradition, historical records,
scientific data and sub-fossil material are used to identify the species present at European
occupation and their role in traditional Aboriginal life, and in passing, to establish the
former existence and distribution of those species throughout the region of the two South
Australian gulfs. An inventory of extant and extinct Flinders Ranges species is
established. Linguistic, ethnographic, zoological and historical data are used to estimate
when species extinction occurred, and what may (or may not) have been the main factors
involved.
A significant outcome of this work is the documentation of a part of
Aboriginal knowledge which itself was on the verge of extinction, and the affirmation of
well attested Aboriginal oral tradition as an authentic 'authoritative source'.
Conclusion: Prior to European occupation the Flinders Ranges had a rich
mammalian fauna comprising around 60 native species. These played a significant
part in Aboriginal people's diet, manufacturing industry and cultural and spiritual
life. By the end of the first half century of European occupation or soon after
around two thirds of the terrestrial species had vanished. The effect of these events
on Aboriginal people's ability to survive in their own territory was devastating and
irreversible.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethnomammalogy</field><field name="subject">Fliders Ranges</field><field name="subject">SA</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="subject">Adnyamathanha people</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal oral tradition</field><field name="subject">dreaming</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.161511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ergonomics and user inclusivity : developing design critieria
              and specifications for a medical examination couch</field><field name="creator">Sjukriana, Juke</field><field name="description">A medical examination couch is a primary piece of equipment in the health care
delivery system. Unfortunately, the current design of examination couches used
by Australian general and nursing practitioners is inadequate. Incompatibility of
the couches with physical (anthropometric) dimensions and a majority of
medical procedures contribute to risks of Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs)
or musculoskeletal problems among practitioner-users. The inappropriate
height, width and gynaecological attachments of the existing couches also
cause patient discomfort.
This research aimed to develop a new examination couch design in order to
improve practitioners' effectiveness, efficiency, health and safety while
enhancing patient comfort. Ergonomics and user inclusivity were implemented
in the vital stages of the couch development process. Practitioner and patient
surveys, reviews of patient positions, medical procedures and equipment,
Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and an ergonomic analysis of couches in the
Australian market were conducted to develop design criteria. The design
criteria development demonstrated that adjustable height, head, body and foot
sections were the major features, and adjustable gynaecological footpads and
instrument placement (drawers) were the most important attachments. A wide
variety of anthropometric data was applied to the development of design
specifications and adjustments.
To produce a prototype for a new examination couch design developed from
the ergonomic research and initial user surveys, the researcher collaborated
with a medical couch manufacturer, Metron Medical Australia Pty Ltd. Through
this collaboration, the developed criteria and specifications were applied to
actual production processes.
User trials (a focus group, practitioner and patient surveys and personal
communication) were conducted to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency
of the couch prototype in a real clinical environment.
From the trials, modifications to
particular couch features were
identified if they were considered
difficult to operate, unnecessary or
uncomfortable for patients. For
example, the mechanism of the
gynaecological footpads, which
comprised three different adjustment controls, had to be simplified in order to
avoid confusion and time consumption. The footpads had also to be equipped
with straps or half a shoe to increase patient comfort and security.
The collaborating manufacturer will need to adapt the design modifications from
the user trials and conduct more extensive engineering research and value
analysis for a final production couch model. Nevertheless, this research
succesfully demonstrated the significance of ergonomics and user-centred
design in developing design criteria more effectively, detecting usability
problems before the couch is brought to the market, and in saving the
manufacturer's overall product development costs.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ergonomics</field><field name="subject">user inclusivity</field><field name="subject">medical examination couch</field><field name="subject">industrial design</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.160732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of trees on temperate native pasture productivity</field><field name="creator">Wallace, Richard Paul</field><field name="description">The goal of this work was to quantify the effects of eucalypt woodland blocks on the
productivity of native pastures. This research was conducted on the Southern Tablelands
of New South Wales. Tree planting or retention is seen by many as an important tool in
addressing the problems of soil degradation resulting from clearing and pasture
improvement that threaten the sustainability of pasture systems. In particular these are
dry land salinity and erosion, both of which affect large areas of agricultural lands in the
south east of Australia. Whilst native tree cover remains over substantial portions of
Australian pasture lands, mainly on steeper slopes and poorer soils, little has been done
to measure the effects of trees on pasture productivity and soil fertility on the Southern
Tablelands. Previous studies in other areas have shown a range of effects&#65533;from
facilitation to inhibition&#65533;of pasture growth in the presence of trees. Soil fertility
beneath trees has been shown by a number of workers to be elevated in comparison with
situations in the open. Given that the range of effects may be highly site dependent,
application of results from one area to another may not be valid. Thus it is necessary to
measure tree effects on a regional scale if results are to be reliable.
Pasture productivity was assessed over a two year period on four sites in the vicinity of
Bungendore, New South Wales. A pair of plots was selected on each site, one plot in a
block of eucalypt woodland, and the other nearby in an exposed, open situation. Plots
were chosen to be as similar to each other as possible with the exception of tree cover.
Treed plots had a tree basal area of between 10 and 20 m2 ha-1 and plots had an area of
900 m2. Two of the sites were on granitic soils and had a tree cover consisting
predominantly of Eucalyptus pauciflora. The remaining two sites were on soil derived
from sedimentary rocks with tree cover consisting mainly of E. mannifera, E. dives and
E. melliodora. Perennial native pasture species present were similar across all sites,
although their relative contributions to standing biomass varied between sites. As the
plots were grazed during the period of measurement, productivity and offtake were
measured seasonally using exclosure cages on each plot. Pasture standing biomass was
assessed using the comparative yield technique.
Microclimate was monitored in each plot by automatic weather stations. Soil moisture
to a depth of 45 cm was measured by time domain reflectometry using permanent
probes in each plot. Ten additional survey plots on each site, covering the range of tree
basal area from 0 - 30 m2 ha-1, were assessed each season in the second year for standing
biomass, soil fertility and pasture quality; expressed by nitrogen content and dry matter
digestibility. Pasture floristics were measured using the dry-weight-rank method. These
additional plots were chosen to be as representative of the paddocks as possible.
Over the two years that productivity was measured, it was found to be higher under
trees than in the open. This was predominantly due to higher winter and spring growth
within treed plots. Grazing offtake was also found to be higher under trees, partly
accounting for lower standing biomass found in the treed plots.
Wind run, evapotranspiration and photosynthetically active radiation were all reduced
by the presence of trees. Beneficial effects of shelter from winds may largely explain
the higher productivity observed in the treed plots, and could outweigh negative effects
of below ground competition and radiation interception by tree canopies at low to
moderate tree densities. Soil moisture was not affected by the presence of trees. Soil
fertility also did not differ between treed and open plots nor was there any difference in
pasture nitrogen content or dry matter digestibility.
On the sites where soils were derived from sedimentary rocks, pasture floristics were
found to be related to tree basal area. Themeda ausfralis biomass was negatively related
to tree basal area, and was partially replaced by large tussock species such as Poa
sieberiana and Chionochloa pallida. A reduction of pasture quality resulted, particularly
as the latter species is not grazed to any significant extent.
Given the desirability of having deep rooted perennial components in grazing lands, the
results of this study indicate that it may be possible to utilise trees to assist in preventing
or reducing a range of adverse environmental consequences arising from agricultural
activities, without unduly compromising pasture productivity. Additionally, the wide
range of environmental conditions provided by a mix of treed and open pasture
promotes a higher degree of heterogeneity of the herbaceous layer. This may assist in
maintaining productivity over a greater range of climatic conditions than would be the
case with a more homogeneous pasture.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">temperate native pasture</field><field name="subject">productivity</field><field name="subject">trees</field><field name="subject">eucalypt woodland</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.160245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical disturbance of Potamogeton tricarinatus and
     sediment by carp (Cyprinus carpio) in experimental ponds</field><field name="creator">Swirepik, Jody</field><field name="description">The impact of carp on a rhizomatous macrophyte was examined in two consecutive years
using three outdoor aquaculture ponds with naturally established beds of Potamogeton
tricarinatus. Each pond was divided with wire fencing to form a carp (500 kg ha-1) and
control treatment. After 6 weeks, plant biomass had declined to the same extent in the
carp and control treatments, indicating that direct physical disturbance by carp was not
reducing the biomass of P. tricarinatus. In a second experiment, carp were added to two
of the same ponds when plants were regenerating after a 9-11 month drying period. After
8 weeks, P. tricarinatus biomass in the carp treatments was between one half and one
tenth of the biomass in the control treatments and one control treatment supported more
Najas tenuifolia than the paired carp treatment. The lower biomass of Potamogeton in
the carp treatments was a result of fewer shoots and less growth per shoot. Rhizomes
had been undermined in the carp treatment with less than 1% of plants growing from
rhizome compared to 36% in the control treatment. Accumulation of sediment into traps
was significantly higher in the carp treatments (2.5 to 77.5 times more than the control).
On average, carp resuspended 662 kg dry sediment ha-1 for each 100 kg ha-1 of carp or
6.6 times their wet weight biomass in dry sediments each day. Some implications of high
sediment resuspension are discussed. The research demonstrates that well anchored
macrophyte species can show tolerance to the physical disturbance associated with carp
benthic feeding, however, these same species are vulnerable during regenerating and
recruitment stages. It is suggested that anchorage is the most important factor for
determining plant tolerance to carp. The implications for aquatic plant and riverine
management are discussed, including the importance of excluding carp from newly
flooded wetlands and the role of carp in determining alternative stable states.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carp</field><field name="subject">rhizomatous macrophyte</field><field name="subject">Potamogeton tricarinatus</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">Cyprinus carpio</field><field name="subject">experimental ponds</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.155736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular systematics of the native Australian waterfowl (Aves: Anseriformes)</field><field name="creator">Sraml, Michaela</field><field name="description">A consensus classification for the waterfowl (order Anseriformes) has never been
reached. There have been many revisions of the relationships within the order
including those of the monotypic Australian genera. The Southern Hemisphere
anseriforms comprise a large number of monotypic, endemic genera which have
traditionally been linked to the established genera and tribes of the Northern
Hemisphere. More recently, however, with the recognition of endemic Australian
radiations of marsupial mammals (Main and Bakker 1981) and passerine birds (Cracraft
1976; Sibley and Ahlquist 1985; Christidis et al. 1988; Christidis and Schodde 1991),
the affinities of the six monotypic Australian genera of anseriforms have been
questioned (Delacour 1954; Frith 1955, 1964a, b, 1982; Johnsgard 196la, b, 1966;
Davies and Frith 1964; Fullager 1990). In particular, whether they are more closely
related to one another, or whether some or all of these monotypic genera have closer
affinities with the Northern Hemisphere genera. Classification of the taxonomic
relationships of the aberrant Australian endemic species may also corroborate or refute
the recently advanced hypothesis of a Southern Hemisphere origin for the Anseriformes
(Cracraft 1976, 1980; Livezey 1986; Olson 1988).
A 307bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of the 19 native Australian
anseriforms and four Northern Hemisphere species was enzymatically amplified by
PCR and manually sequenced. The Chicken (Gallus gallus) and Muscovy Duck
(Cairinia moschatd) cytochrome b sequences were obtained from Genbank.
The patterns of evolutionary dynamics within the cytochrome b gene of Anseriformes
appear to conform to those reported in studies of avian and other vertebrate mtDNA. A
new phylogenetic classification for the Anseriformes is proposed. The phylogenetic
trees generated in this study indicate that the monotypic Australian genera, the pygmygeese
and the swans and geese are members of the subfamily Anserinae which appears
to represent a Southern Hemisphere radiation. Within the Anserinae, the Cape Barren

appears to be closely related to the true geese, the Musk Duck is a sister taxon to the
Pink-eared Duck and may be less closely related to the Oxyura than previously thought
and the Magpie Goose is the most divergent member of the Anseriformes included in
this study. The Maned Duck and the remaining native Australian anseriforms are
members of the established European genera and tribes of waterfowl. These species
probably represent a secondary radiation of recent Northern Hemisphere invaders of

The EIA methodology includes techniques for land cover and soil classification, land capability and
suitability assessment. The biophysical classifications and assessment techniques are based on the
application of various para and non- parametric approaches. The study area for the application of the
EIA methods and techniques was the Singleton Training Area (STA) in the Hunter Valley of central
New South Wales.
Defence estates are required to provide a wide range of terrain and other environmental conditions to
support the development of combat related tactics. The maintenance of these areas for sustainable use
is fundamental in achieving both military and land use management objectives. The EIA of the STA
provided a means of testing the efficiency of the methods and techniques developed in this thesis.
The baseline resource inventory data used in the EIA includes land cover and vegetation maps derived
from satellite digital data and soils maps derived from both conventional methods and airborne gammaradiation

              Wales</field><field name="creator">Wahl, Douglas E.</field><field name="description">Throughout their world distribution, fruit bats (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) play an extremely
important role in forest ecology through seed dispersal and pollination. However, the
recognition of their role in maintaining forest ecological diversity has been largely
overshadowed by the fact that fruit bats are known to cause damage to a wide variety of
cultivated fruits and, as a result, significant effort is undertaken to control fruit bat numbers
in areas where crop damage frequently occurs.
In Australia, fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (or flying foxes) are well known for their role
in destroying valuable fruit crops, particularly along the east coast from Cairns to Sydney.
Historical evidence suggests that flying foxes have been culled as an orchard pest in large
numbers for the past 80 years. Uncontrolled culling both on-farm and in roosts coupled
with extensive habitat destruction in the past century, has resulted in noticeable declines
both in flying fox distribution and local population numbers.
In New South Wales, flying foxes have been 'protected' under the National Parks and
Wildlife Act (1974) since 1986. From that time, fruitgrowers have been required to obtain
a licence (referred to as an occupier's licence) from the National Parks and Wildlife Service
(NPWS) to cull flying foxes causing damage to fruit crops. However, despite the
'protected' status of the species, flying foxes continue to be culled in large numbers as an
orchard pest.
An examination of the management of flying foxes in NSW, has shown that, between
1986-1992, fifteen NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service Districts issued a combined
total of 616 occupier's licences to shoot flying foxes with an total allocation of over
240,000 animals. In addition, most flying foxes are culled when the female is carrying her
young under wing or when the young remain in the camp but continue to be dependent on
her return for survival. Further evidence on the extent of culling includes a widely
distributed fruitgrower survey with responses indicating that as few as 50% of the
fruitgrowers shooting flying foxes in NSW obtain the required licence from the National
Parks and Wildlife Service.
While the NPWS has undertaken research into the role of flying foxes in seed dispersal and
pollination, management effort largely continues to focus on resolving conflicts between
fruitgrowers and flying foxes primarily by issuing culling permits to fruitgrowers. At
present, there is no NPWS policy on the management of flying foxes in NSW to guide the
administration of the permit system. As a result, the process of issuing permits for flying
foxes is largely inconsistent between NPWS Districts.
The absence of comprehensive goals and objectives for the management of flying foxes has
resulted in the current situation where large numbers of flying foxes are being culled both
legally and illegally in the absence of any data on the impacts of unknown culling levels on
local flying fox populations.
The NPWS has a statutory obligation to manage flying foxes consistent with the 'protected'
status of the species in NSW and several well known principles of wildlife management.
However, current management of flying foxes in indicates that the Service may be in
violation of the requirement to 'protect' and 'conserve' flying foxes as required under the
National Parks and Wildlife Act (1974).
This study recommends that licences issued to fruitgrowers to cull flying foxes be
discontinued immediately and that adequate enforcement be engaged to reduce illegal
shooting. This action should continue until such time that research on flying fox
populations is able to demonstrate that the culling of flying foxes will not lead populations
into decline. Furthermore, management effort should focus on the development of
alternative strategies to reduce crop damage by flying foxes and provide incentives for
growers to utilize existing control strategies such as netting.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fruit bats</field><field name="subject">Pteropus spp</field><field name="subject">Chiroptera Pteropodidae</field><field name="subject">flying foxes</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.152804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imprints in the dust : historical and archaeological evidence of

industrialised countries. In the U.S.A. for example, 2.3 million individuals
suffer from chronic heart failure, with an annual increase in numbers of 17%.
It is estimated that 17,000 to 35,000 of them per year will die from this
disease if they are not given either a heart transplant or an artificial heart.
Unfortunately, the numbers of heart donors cannot meet the demand for
transplantation, and, at present, the artificial heart is a prohibitively
expensive alternative.
The total artificial heart (TAH) intended for the total replacement of the
natural heart is still some years away from realisation. However, the
ventricular assist device (VAD) which is used temporarily to maintain an ailing
heart is available now, although only in restricted numbers due to difficulties
in processing the biocompatible materials used during manufacture.
Consequently, such devices are expensive, costing anywhere from
AUS$30,000 for the pump head to AUS$200,000 for a complete system.
In this study, the Australian designed $quot;Spiral Vortex$quot; VAD was used to
investigate fabrication techniques for use in the eventual cost-effective
manufacture of a pump head costing approximately AUS$4,000. A second
VAD originally designed at the Kolff Laboratory, University of Utah, U.S.A.
was also used for comparative evaluation. The hard-shell Spiral Vortex VAD
is intended to be used outside the body, while the soft-shell Kolff VAD has the
advantage of being implantable for long-term use. They were cast from
epoxy resin and vacuum formed from polyurethane, respectively. Several
units of each were fabricated, including 60 of the Kolff VAD, for use in vitro
and in vivo experiments. From these experiments it was found that both the
Spiral Vortex and Kolff VADs could be fabricated to quality controllable
standards. The Kolff VAD was used exclusively in chronic animal
experiments, and was able to sustain sheep and goats for periods of up to
five weeks. Furthermore, it became evident that techniques used in
fabrication of the Kolff VAD could be adopted for use in the mass production
of the Spiral Vortex VAD.
The two other areas investigated in this study were the prosthetic heart
valves and drive systems used for an artificial heart. A high percentage of
the cost of an artificial heart is accounted for by the inflow/outflow valves.
The trileaflet valve used in the Kolff VAD, which mimics the natural heart
valve, was fabricated using inexpensive vacuum-forming techniques. Quality
control was found to be adequate, with good flow characteristics which could
be maintained for several weeks in animal experiments. Both the Spiral
Vortex and Kolff VADs are pulsation pumps which require a pneumatic driver
unit. This driver is the single most expensive component in a VAD system,
costing upwards of AUS$150,000. The theoretical efficiency of a compact
hydromechanical drive unit was investigated using a test rig to simulate an
original design based primarily on proprietary components. Results obtained
so far indicate that the proposed driver can operate only under limited
conditions as a result of its severe reduction in size.
By adopting mass production techniques wherever possible in the fabrication
of the VAD (pump head) and valves, and by reducing the cost and size of the
driver unit, it may therefore be possible to produce a cost effective ventricular
assist device system.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">artificial heart</field><field name="subject">heart disease</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.151545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CoastWalk : a case study of environmental education in the
              community</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Jocelyn Katrina</field><field name="description">Walks organised at the community or 'grass roots' level both in Australia and
internationally have been organised as a means to highlight environmental and social
issues to the wider community.
This thesis focuses on a coastal walk from Melbourne to Sydney during November 1993
to March 1994 called CoastWalk which was organised as part of the Australian Conservation Foundation's 'Coasts in Crisis' campaign. The Walk aimed to highlight
environmental management problems specific to the coastal zone at both local and national
levels using mass media, information evenings and targeting groups within local
communities.
Using a case study approach to the methodology, combined with principles from both
social (interpretive) and empirical methods, this study involved determining the impact of
CoastWalk, i.e. whether it changed individuals at the levels of awareness, understanding
or action. The scope of the study does not include a detailed analysis of the communities
themselves, nor does it explore the psychological aspects of individual and social change.
It was found that the mass media aspect of the CoastWalk campaign created a short term
awareness of the need to have concern for coastal management issues in those who did
not participate in the Walk. For those who did participate, the impact was deeper and
profound, changing individuals understanding and actions towards coastal management
and translating into other areas of their lives. The impact of the Walk on local community
groups who supported the Walk was negligible and it was determined that CoastWalk did
not meet their needs.
Community involvement in environmental management or campaigning equates to long
term ownership and responsibility being taken for those issues. However, neither
community nor government intervention in environmental management alone can resolve
these issues successfully. This thesis argues that a combined approach from both
community and government organisations is required - but as exemplified by CoastWalk,
the success of this approach requires equality in communication and co-operation.
As other environmental awareness walks have occurred, it is evident that they are
perceived as worthy events by the community, and that there is potential for them to occur
again in the future. It is therefore essential for an evaluation to occur of the techniques
used to achieve their environmental education aims. Thus, the learning from previous
Walks can be built into future Walks enhancing their success.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coastal walks</field><field name="subject">CoastWalk</field><field name="subject">Australian Conservation Foundation</field><field name="subject">Coasts in Crisis</field><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.150337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology of the European red fox and the free roaming dog on
              Bherwerre Peninsula, Jervis Bay</field><field name="creator">Meek, Paul D.</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an insight into the biology and ecology of foxes Vulpes vulpes
from a coastal habitat and free roaming dogs Canis lupus familiaris from an Aboriginal
community, both in SE NSW. In particular, the study examines the home range and
movement patterns of both canids from a view point of population and disease control.
Additional base line information was collected for these species on diet, parasites and
population biology.
A total of 14 foxes and 10 dogs were collared and radio tracked to determine the home
range and movement patterns of the animals. The data collected provides information on the
behaviour of foxes in coastal habitat and represents the first detailed biological study of freeroaming
dogs in Australia. The results provide a better understanding of dog movements,
particularly the differences in behaviour between wandering and sedentary dogs. Home range
sizes varied greatly between the dog groups from 1 ha to 2451 ha. There was evidence that
dog forays were influenced by prey availability, particularly medium sized macropods.
Occasional sallies, size and shape of fox and dog home range is discussed in relation to the
richness of habitat at Jervis Bay with comparisons being made with other studies from the
literature. Foxes in Jervis Bay had home ranges between 60-270 ha which is comparable to
foxes living in the forests of Germany and in coastal habitat in the Netherlands
This study also provides data on the diet of foxes and dogs presenting quantitative and
qualitative data on food preferences. Foxes tended to be opportunistic in food selection
although critical weight range mammals ie. ringtail possums were favoured. The high
prevalence of the parasite Spirometra spp. in foxes indicated that considerable numbers of
amphibians and reptiles are consumed by this species. A comprehensive inventory of the
parasites of the two canid species showed a high proportion of hookworm in foxes and dogs
and Spirometra spp in foxes. These results are discussed in light of the potential health
implications for local Aboriginal people.
Analysis of fox scats revealed that they have the potential to spread the seeds of bitou
bush. A more detailed pilot study revealed the potential impact of foxes on the environment
through the spread of weed seeds. Germination trials recorded high viability of seeds that
were eaten and deposited by foxes. The management implications of this behaviour are
discussed in context to weed control.
This thesis has provided new information on foxes and dogs in Australia. Discussion
on these species in the thesis has been framed around the benefits of this information for
population and disease control.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">European red fox</field><field name="subject">free roaming dog</field><field name="subject">Bherwerre Peninsula</field><field name="subject">Jervis Bay</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.145750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feral donkeys in northern Australia : population dynamics and
              the cost of control</field><field name="creator">Choquenot, David</field><field name="description">(1) Rate of increase was measured for feral donkey
populations in parts of northern Australia as the average
exponential rate of increase, r, in a population subjected
to substantial reduction.
(2) The annual rate of increase was estimated to be r =
0.21. This estimate was compared with the exponential rate
of increase in another recovering donkey population and
found to be in close agreement.
(3) Ultimate and proximate factors regulating the
abundance of feral donkey populations were examined by
monitoring and sampling two populations; one at or close to
equilibrium density, the other below equilibrium density and
recovering from reduction.
(4) The size of the population at equilibrium density
remained stable over the 12 months of monitoring while the
size of the recovering population increased by 20 percent
(r = 0.18/yr).
(5) Growth and body condition were significantly
depressed in the population at equilibrium density
suggesting that donkey populations are limited by the food
resources available to them.
(6) Breeding occured over a discrete season, with
births occurring between September and February.
11
(7) Fecundity was high, with more than 75 percent of
mature females breeding in each year, and was independent of
population density.
(8) Adult and juvenile mortality were density
dependent, with mortality over the first six months of life
the most important demographic factor influencing rate of
increase in donkey populations, and hence population
abundance.
(9) Implications of the estimated rate of population
increase for the cost of long-term control of feral donkey
populations were examined by constructing numerical models
predicting the relative cost of ongoing control.
(10) These models were constructed using functions to
describe density dependent variation in population
productivity and the cost per donkey removed.
(11) The cost of removing donkeys at various population
densities was estimated using predator-prey theory. The
cost, measured in hours of helicopter time per removal, was
found theoretically and empirically to take the form of an
inverted functional response curve, with cost saturated at
high donkey densities.
(12) The utility of models predicting the cost of
continuing pest control is illustrated by comparing the
relative costs of two potential strategies for feral donkey
control.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feral donkeys</field><field name="subject">northern Australia</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.145306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pasture response following rabbit control on grazing land</field><field name="creator">Brown, Peter Robert</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis were designed to assess changes in pasture
dynamics (biomass and species composition of pasture) of grazing land on the Southern
Tablelands of ACT and NSW, after 16 combinations of rabbit control treatments had been
applied. The rabbit control performed by CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology
consisted of all combinations of presence-absence of Poisoning (using sodium
monofluoroacetate, 1080: POIS), Ripping (ripping warrens using a tractor fitted with
ripping tynes: RIP), Fumigation (pressure fumigation using chloropicrin: FUM) and
repeated follow-up fumigation (using phostoxin pellets one, six and eighteen months after
completion of the initial treatment: ANN). The pasture was assessed before treatments
were applied, and every six months after rabbit control treatments. Treatment
combinations were assigned randomly in a 24 factorial design on a total of 32 sites.
There was a significant increase of pasture biomass at the RIP+ANN treatment at
post-treatment sample 5. The analysis of covariance did not detect any other significant
increase or decrease of pasture biomass for any rabbit control treatment, at any posttreatment
sample.
A significant increase of grass species occurred for the treatments of
POIS+RIP+FUM, POIS and RIP+ANN for the post-treatment samples of 1, 3 and 5
respectively. There was a significant increase of thistles at the rabbit control treatments of
POIS+RIP+FUM+ANN (post-treatment sample 1), RIP, ANN, RIP+FUM,
RIP+FUM+ANN and POIS+RIP+FUM+ANN (post-treatment sample 3) and RIP and
FUM+ANN (post-treatment sample 5). A significant increase of weeds occurred at FUM
(post-treatment sample 3) and at FUM+ANN (post-treatment sample 5). No significant
changes in the amount of herbs or legumes was apparent for any rabbit control treatment or
post-treatment sample. There were no significant decreases for any species group. Except
for the significant results for post-treatment sample 1, all significant increases of biomass
for any species group occurred during spring (post-treatment sample 3 and 5) which
suggests a growth phase during spring then subsequent dieback (particularly for thistles and
weeds), as any change was not detected in the following autumn sample. No strong trend
is evident for any particular rabbit control treatments, or any combination of treatments.
Analysis of covariance revealed that the rabbit control treatment of RIP+ANN
showed significant increases in both total biomass of pasture and grass biomass during
post-treatment sample 5. This treatment reduced the number of active entrances the most.
Significant positive correlations were found between pasture biomass (total) with
grass, herb, legume, thistle and weed species groups. Significant negative correlations
between grass biomass and the number of active entrances were found when the rabbit
control had been highly effective in reducing the number of active entrances. When rabbit
control had not been very successful, there was a significant positive but low correlation
with the number of active entrances. There was no significant relationship between the
number of active entrances with the weight of rabbit dung pellets. It is reasoned that they
are different measures of rabbit abundance. More rabbit dung pellets were found closer to
the warren than further away from the warren, but there was no correlation between rabbit
dung and pasture biomass.
Rainfall was above average for most of the experiment, biomass increased
accordingly, and rabbit control was highly successful. The resulting changes in the pasture
were difficult to detect, although some increases in species composition groups occurred.
It is reasoned that the changes observed are partly attributable to seasonal conditions, and
to high rainfall. Grazing by domestic animals, sheep and cattle, had been found to be
consistent throughout the experiment.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pasture response</field><field name="subject">grazing land</field><field name="subject">rabbit control</field><field name="subject">rabbits</field><field name="subject">Southern Tablelands</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.144813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outdoor leadership preparation in Australia in 2002: a cross-sectional analysis and recommendations</field><field name="creator">Mann, Kathleen A.</field><field name="description">This research explores the notion of outdoor leadership preparation in the context of the emerging

In
Australia, nature-based tourism represents an important part of the tourism sector and is to
a large extent dependent on protected areas such as World Heritage areas, marine parks
and national parks. While tourism and recreation can benefit protected areas, some are
under pressure from visitation and marketing should play a role in managing visitor
demand. To this end, a number of authors have suggested demarketing as a management
tool to address situations of excess visitor demand, however, research on demarketing in
protected areas is limited. To address this research gap, this thesis examines the use of
demarketing in Australian national parks that face excess visitor demand using a case study
on the Blue Mountains National Park. The thesis investigates factors that contribute to high
visitor demand for the park, the use of demarketing to manage demand and factors that
influence when and how demarketing is applied. Demarketing is that aspect of marketing
that deals with discouraging customers in general or a certain class of customers in
particular on either a temporary or permanent basis. In protected areas specifically,
demarketing is concerned with reducing visitor numbers in total or selectively and
redistributing demand spatially or temporarily.
Six factors that contribute to high visitor demand for the national park were identified
including the attractiveness of the park, its proximity to Sydney and the fact that the park is
a renowned destination with icon sites. It was established that no holistic demarketing
strategy is currently employed in the park and that the demarketing measures that are
applied are not consciously used as demarketing. The measures used in the Blue Mountains
National Park were discussed according to their association with the marketing mix
components (4 Ps). Demarketing measures related to &#65533;product&#65533; include limiting
recreational activities by defining specific areas where they can be conducted, limiting the
duration of activities and closures of sites or features in the park. The measures related to
&#65533;place&#65533; are the use of a booking system, limiting visitor numbers and group sizes,
commercial licensing and limiting signage. Measures related to &#65533;price&#65533; are not extensively
used in the park. The promotional demarketing measures applied include stressing
restrictions and appropriate environmental behaviour in promotional material and nonpromotion
of certain areas or experiences in the park. Importantly, these demarketing
measures are not employed across the whole park or for all user groups, but are used for
certain experiences in specific contexts and circumstances.
Three types of factors influence the use of demarketing in the Blue Mountains National
Park: pragmatic considerations, resource considerations and stakeholder interests.
Pragmatic considerations include the feasibility and effectiveness of certain demarketing
measures, which are influenced by the specific context of the national park. Resource
considerations relate to financial, human and temporal resources and the findings suggest
that a lack of resources influences and at times inhibits the use of demarketing measures. It
was also found that various stakeholders have a profound influence on the use of
demarketing measures. The stakeholder groups have diverse interests and therefore
influence the use of demarketing in different ways by supporting or impeding certain
measures.
Based on the findings and limitations of this study, recommendations for government and
future research are made. These emphasise among others the need for more consistent and
comprehensive collection of visitor information to tailor management actions more
effectively. It is also suggested that a more conscious and holistic application of
demarketing measures may help to manage visitor demand to parks proactively to ensure
that the resource remains for future generations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nature-based tourism</field><field name="subject">recreation</field><field name="subject">demarketing</field><field name="subject">Australian national parks</field><field name="subject">Blue Mountains National Park</field><field name="subject">visitor demand</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061114.125254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Taman Sari" Yogyakarta : a cultural perspective in landscape design</field><field name="creator">Tjahjani, Indra</field><field name="description">This thesis is a critical review of Taman Sari, Yogyakarta in particular how the Old City Planning including the Pleasure Garden which has multi functions was established in Indonesia during the ancient time ( in the past ), the development during the Dutch era, and current conditions and how the future generation should take care of the place.

One line of this research is that the use of plants which had been planted in Taman Sari area was related with the tradition, symbolism and the daily needs. As assumption in this research some plants possibly are classified as a Javanese traditional plant.
A series of photographs which have been taken from different time support the analysis of this research report.
At the end of the report there is a recommendation to the Indonesia Government for maintaining the cultural heritage asset value, because this could be a national valuable asset which could be handed to the future generation.
Based on the Guidelines to the Burra Charter define we Cultural Significance as :
.....a concept which helps in estimating the value of places. The places that are likely to be of significance are those which help an understanding of the past or enrich the present, and which will be of value to the future generations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taman Sari</field><field name="subject">Yogyakarta</field><field name="subject">city planning</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">cultural heritage</field><field name="subject">landscape design</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061122.123558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Open education : a definition and an exploratory survey of some ACT teachers and parents attitudes</field><field name="creator">Coates, Jim</field><field name="description">PART I Open education is defined operationally in terms of the
Roland Earths (1971) open education scale plus Bob Young's
curriculum scale based upon Basil Bernstein's classification
of educational knowledge (collected versus integrated codes).
Young's scale on the organization of curriculum knowledge
is considered to make explicit ideas partially implicit in
the Barth Scale as well as adding a new dimension.
This definition of open education has three unifying closely
related principles:
(i) respect for students as persons
(ii) a view of knowledge being in part a personal construct
(iii) the extent by which the contents of the curriculum
stand in open relation to each other.
The limitations of the study and its relevance to ACT schools
are stated.
The literature on open education is reviewed and criticism is
examined. The most important writers on open education
influencing the development of the authors ideas were -
Roland Barth, Tinsley Beck, Basil Bernstein, Hugh Petrie,
Herbert Walberg and Susan Christie Thomas, and Bob Young.
PART II A short personal history of the study is given. This outlines
the development of the author's ideas and explains how the survey
was conducted (plus its problems).
An extensive analysis of the survey data was undertaken in terms
of ten research questions posed. These related to:-
(i) characteristics of respondents
(ii) representativeness of the samples
(iii) reliability of the instruments (Barth, Young)
(iv) unity of the total Barth-Young scale
(v) differences between primary teachers, secondary teachers
and parents' responses
(vi) factorial composition of the scales
(vii) a comparison of the logical and factorial dimensions of
the scales
(viii) comments of respondents
(ix) implications of the research
(x) further research required.
In general the survey data was consistent with the theory in
Part I, though it also indicated there was a need for further
development of the Barth-Young Scale.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">open education</field><field name="subject">Roland Earth</field><field name="subject">Bob Young</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060629.092313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Involvement, motivation and setting preferences of participants in the adventure tourism activity of SCUBA diving</field><field name="creator">Tschapka, Michael Karl</field><field name="description">Adventure tourism is a growing market sector worldwide including Australia. A range of
research exists that examined participation in adventure tourism activities by consideration
of various aspects such as socio-demographics, motivations, activity/setting preferences
and involvement in the activity to understand the adventure tourist. While studies have
been conducted that included several of these aspects, a holistic investigation of
involvement, motivations and setting preferences together has not been conducted
previously regarding adventure tourism in Australia in general and SCUBA diving in
particular. Furthermore, in Australia, only limited information is available about those who
participate in the adventure activity of SCUBA diving. The aim of this research is to
investigate differences and similarities of involvement, motivations and setting preferences
of SCUBA diving club members in Eastern Australia.
In this study 294 SCUBA diving club members in New South Wales and Queensland were
surveyed by utilisation of a web-based questionnaire in order to identify their involvement
in SCUBA diving, socio-demographic characteristics, participation motives and setting
preferences.
Descriptive analysis was used to investigate the socio-demographic characteristics of
divers, their motivations and setting preferences. Principal component analysis was applied
on involvement variables as well as motivations to investigate the underlying constructs.
Agglomerative and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to derive clusters of divers that
differed in their involvement in SCUBA diving. Exact Pearson chi-square tests were
conducted to test whether there were significant differences concerning sociodemographics
between clusters. In addition, analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were
conducted to determine differences and similarities of motivational components and setting
preferences between clusters.

This study found that SCUBA diving club members are a heterogeneous group regarding
their involvement in SCUBA diving. Five clusters of divers emerged that differed in their
involvement in SCUBA diving. While differences in socio-demographics across the
different involvement clusters were revealed, they proved to be less valuable for
interpretation purposes. Regarding divers&#65533; setting preferences, similar structures were
observed across all clusters regardless of differences in involvement. Motivations showed a
complex structure across the clusters in regard to divers&#65533; involvement in SCUBA diving.
Based on the studies findings, recommendations for future research were suggested. These
emphasised the need for a holistic examination of motivations and setting preferences of
adventure tourists based on the concept of involvement, which would be important for
theory development and segmentation of tourists. The same holistic approach would also
be valuable for examining other types of tourists such as events tourists and heritage
tourists to better understand tourist behaviour.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SCUBA diving</field><field name="subject">adventure tourism</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Pearson ch-square tests</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061128.125036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scenario planning in Australian government</field><field name="creator">Thomson, Nicolas Maxwell</field><field name="description">Is scenario planning a process that can be used by agencies of the Australian Public Service to generate and develop information that is relevant to the future, and thereby make possible improved strategic planning? This is the core question of this dissertation. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the case for investigating the benefits of scenario planning. Literature defining and describing the benefits of scenario planning for both private and public sector organisations is examined, and factors that appear to be critical to effective implementation of the process are discussed.
Against this theoretical background the empirical evidence of seven cases of the application of scenario planning in six agencies of the Australian Public Service is considered. Several conclusions are drawn on the basis of the data obtained from the seven cases studied. Scenario planning is more likely to make possible improved strategic planning of public sector agencies such as those that comprise the Australian Public Service (irrespective of their function or size) if it has the active involvement of senior management during the developmental phase of the process, and their ongoing support for any follow-up activity. In addition, a well resourced and in-depth research phase is integral to the success of the process. Even if these elements are not present to a high degree, a well managed scenario planning exercise will improve to some degree the ability of an agency&#65533;s senior executive to think more openly and proactively about its future business context. In addition, well resourced and properly supported scenario planning can also help a public sector agency to improve the quality of its information gathering, test the viability of its strategy options and develop appropriate contingency plans.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scenario planning</field><field name="subject">Australian government</field><field name="subject">APS</field><field name="subject">Australian Public Service</field><field name="subject">strategic planning</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061129.091600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of Olympic, World and Commonwealth Sculling champion Peter Antonie</field><field name="creator">Poke, Robin</field><field name="description">This thesis is a biographical case study of Olympic, World and Commonwealth sculling champion Peter Antonie, whose career at the elite or high performance level spanned some 23 years &#65533; from 1977 to 2000.
The thesis examines the exploits of an oarsman and sculler regarded within his sport as one of Australia&#65533;s greatest ever, despite his being considered physically disadvantaged at every phase of his career. Antonie was, most notably, a man of small stature &#65533; widely considered a handicap at the level of rowing to which he aspired, and at which he ultimately succeeded. The study also examines what it was, despite those perceived disadvantages, that drove him to excel. The thesis further examines, in thematic form, parallel developments within Australian rowing and sculling in the quarter of a century in which Peter Antonie competed. This was a period during which fundamental changes were seen in Australian sport, notably in the areas of funding and administration, and which saw a transformation from amateur to professional participation at the Olympic, Commonwealth Games and world championships levels. There were also marked changes to high performance rowing as a result of technological advances that produced new types of equipment, and scientific developments that brought new training and selection methodologies.
The research was carried out as part of a systematic attempt to examine and investigate Peter Antonie&#65533;s reputation, particularly as it compares with his better-known contemporaries, the so-called Oarsome Foursome, and to analyse that reputation in light of the administrative developments in Australian rowing and Australian sport. The historical approach used was the biographical method of research and analysis, with the preferred technique the obtaining of oral testimony from 50 interviewees, some of whom were interviewed more than once.
The research clearly indicated that throughout his career Peter Antonie continually defied assumptions about his potential, particularly where science-based preconceptions about talent identification were concerned, and achieved success far beyond initial expectations. As a result his achievements, nationally and globally, are perhaps unparalleled, and he is held in the highest regard, particularly by the higher profile Oarsome Foursome. Despite this accolade, however, Antonie&#65533;s public profile
remains very low, to the extent that beyond the rowing fraternity he is virtually unknown. Despite, too, rowing&#65533;s status as an Olympic sport and the commensurate increases in funding during Antonie&#65533;s career, he himself maintains a fundamentally amateur approach to his participation in rowing and is critical of several facets of its current &#65533;professional&#65533; administration. Despite, too, rowing and sculling once being among Australia&#65533;s major sports a hundred or so years ago, within contemporary Australian society it has a low profile, a situation which, given that current administration, appears likely to continue.
Problems encountered during the research included some diffidence on the part of an essentially humble and self-effacing subject and a lack of literature relating to Antonie and his sport. But these were to an extent offset by the enthusiasm displayed for the project by other interviewees. The results of the research are significant in that, like the subject, they defy some precepts concerning facets of Australian rowing and sculling, which in turn might encourage further investigation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">athletes</field><field name="subject">Olympic</field><field name="subject">World</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth</field><field name="subject">sculling</field><field name="subject">champion</field><field name="subject">Peter Antonie</field><field name="subject">rowing</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061207.104628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian Broadcasting
Tribunal's Australian Content
Inquiry 1983 - 1990: a case study in
The dynamics of a public policy
debate</field><field name="creator">Radcliffe, Jeanette</field><field name="description">Since their inception in the early 1960s, Australian content requirements for commercial television have been subjected to
considerable scrutiny through a series of formal inquiries. Over
the last ten years this process has intensified. In recent years
there have been a number of academic criticisms regarding the
state of debate about the regulation of Australian content on
commercial television and the capacity of the debate to generate
genuine criticism and embrace change.
This thesis examines the dynamics of debate about Australian
content. It focuses on the ABT's Inquiry into Australian Content
on Commercial Television (ACI) which ran from 1983 to 1989.
It takes as its basic point of reference Jurgen Habermas' concept
of the 'public sphere'. This concept refers to a realm of social life,
separate from the state and private spheres, in which 'public
opinion' can be formed. Habermas has argued that, with the
refeudalisation of the public sphere, the state and private
interests have increasingly collaborated to close off the public
sphere. The thesis concludes that in many respects Habermas'
concept of a refeudalised 'public sphere' is a useful explanatory
tool for understanding the dynamics of the ACI and the limited
degree of criticism generated by it. However, Habermas' model
is limited in so far as it fails to accord adequate recognition to the
complexities and significance of the mediation of the 'public
interest' by key participants in the inquiry and the strategic role
of rhetoric for these participants.
Habermas concludes that with the refeudalisation of the public
sphere and the disappearance of the historical conditions which
supported its operation, the public sphere must now be
reconstructed on a case by case basis. Attempts to achieve this,
have tended to focus on the facilitation of citizen participation in
public policy debate. However, as this analysis of the ACI
demonstrates, the dynamics of the debate itself appear to limit
I the degree to which 'public opinion' can be elevated above
'private interest'.
This thesis demonstrates that the mediation of the 'public
interest' assumed a central role in the rhetoric and strategy of
the ACI. Each of the key players represented distinct interests and were largely unaccountable to the 'public' they claimed to
 serve. This thesis concludes that in order to gain a more detailed
understanding of how communication works in such a context,
and in order to conceive of alternative participatory forms, we
need to focus on those aspects of public discourse which Habermas neglects: the rhetoric and the strategic nature of public
representation. It suggests that fruitful avenues for further
study may lie with Bantz's notion of communicative structures or
Luhmann's systems approach to communication.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Habermas</field><field name="subject">Australian content requirements</field><field name="subject">commercial television</field><field name="subject">ABT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061207.162525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bert the bold</field><field name="creator">Hooper, Darrell</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">screenplays</field><field name="subject">films</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060726.151754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences on career development in Australian tourism</field><field name="creator">Ayres, Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis explored careers within Australian tourism with the aim of developing a
model of influences on career development in the tourism industry. As tourism is still
an emerging profession, careers have yet to be clearly defined and career paths are not
easily identifiable. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that the industry is prone
to high turnover, low retention rates, is often viewed as a low skilled industry and has
difficulty attracting employees with a view to serious career development.
While some research into careers into hotel management is available, in depth career
studies in the tourism industry have yet to emerge. This thesis addresses this gap in
the literature and provides industry stakeholders with information to assist in human
resource management and policy development.
The researcher drew finding from an electronic survey that was designed from
information collected from an exploratory study conducted by the researcher, from
literature available on both career development and research on the tourism industry,
and from earlier research projects. This electronic survey was designed to collect
primarily qualitative data and was disseminated to the Australian tourism industry.
Results from this study suggest that careers in the tourism industry are influenced by a
variety of mentoring relationships. Both formal education and on-the-job training was
found to be increasingly important for those wanting to advance in the industry and
remaining mobile between jobs, between organisations, within industries and
geographically was advantageous. A motivation to work in tourism and a "passion"
for the industry was found to be a strong influence on career development in the
current study.
This study should add to our understanding of careers in Australian tourism and, more
specifically to our understanding of the role of formal education and on-the-job
training in career development and the perceived value of such training. The current
study reinforces previous knowledge of high levels of mobility within the tourism
industry and suggests the need to change job, organisation, industry or geographical
location is influential on career development in Australian tourism. In addition, the
results suggest that although structured mentorship programs are currently unavailable
to many in the tourism industry, mentorship in the form of informal and networking
relationships assists career development.
While this thesis has contributed to our understanding of career development in the
tourism industry, because of inevitable limitations with the sample obtain for this
study, it would be useful to replicate this survey with other sectors of the tourism, to
explore influences on careers in tourism in other countries, to investigate gender
issues in the industry and to further explore the influences of education, mobility and
mentorship.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian tourism</field><field name="subject">career development</field><field name="subject">tourism industry</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070119.100212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational culture and the
communication of loyalty : an
ethnography</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, Sophia Mawani</field><field name="description">Loyalty management has emerged over recent years as a topic of significant importance in
both academic and practitioner discourse, articulating the benefits of an extended relationship
with key stakeholders including, but not limited to, customers, employees and shareholders.
This research explores the theory and practice of loyalty management from a communications
perspective. The thesis attempted to discover how the integration or non-integration of
internal and external communication affects the communication of loyalty, in addition to how
loyalty management contributes towards the organisation&#65533;s perceived creation of value. In
doing so, it also examines how the practice of customer relationship management (CRM),
integrated marketing communication (IMC) and the use of information and communication technology (ICT) plays a role in the communication of loyalty.
The research entailed a three-year ethnographic study of a business-to-business financial
services organisation specialising in vehicle fleet leasing and management services,
comprising a review of relevant academic literature; and participant observation, focus group
studies, qualitative surveys and document analysis. Besides evaluating loyalty management
from a communications perspective, the thesis contributes towards the body of knowledge on
Australian organisations from an organisational culture perspective, as well as exploring
communication beyond the traditional boundary of within the organisation itself. Unlike
most loyalty management approaches, the holistic stance considers other stakeholders besides
customers, in detail. The study does not seek to establish validity and generalisability.
Rather, the mainly interpretist approach preserves the form and content of human behaviour
by detailing descriptions of the concrete experience of life within a particular culture and of
the social rules, patterns and perceptions that constitute it.
The findings showed that organisational communication has to be integrated and cohesive to
enable the effective management of loyalty. Furthermore, the results confirm that the notion
of organisational boundaries comprising &#65533;internal&#65533; and "external" communication is limited.
Involved protagonists, acting together from within and external to an organisation, create,
sustain and manage meanings through the use of signs and symbols within a particular
context to form a unique culture or community. In addition, the notion of loyalty and the
creation of value for the consequent success of the organisation is an important and valid
perception for most of the stakeholders. For this organisation, the use of ICT and practice of
CRM and IMC has varying degrees of impact, mainly enhancing the communication of
loyalty. The detraction of value is caused primarily by the fragmentation of communication
between the stakeholders, in addition to the existence of sub-cultures with conflicting needs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">loyalty management</field><field name="subject">organisational communication</field><field name="subject">customer relationship management</field><field name="subject">CRM</field><field name="subject">integrated marketing communication</field><field name="subject">IMC</field><field name="subject">information and communication technology</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070119.152841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The builders of Shoalhaven 1840s-1890s : a social history and cultural geography</field><field name="creator">Hobbs, Roger</field><field name="description">According to architect Robin Boyd (1952 rev. ed. 1968), &#697;the Australian country house took its pattern, not directly from the English countryside, but second&#8208;hand from the Australian city&#697; in the nineteenth century.  This thesis explores the introduction of domestic architectural ideas in the Shoalhaven Local Government Area (LGA) from the 1840s to the 1890s, and concludes that Boyd&#697;s premise, including his five principal plan types, applied in general, subject to regional geographical parameters.
   
 
The Illawarra and South Coast districts dominated New South Wales dairy farming by the 1860s.  The transfer of architectural ideas to the Shoalhaven LGA was facilitated by steam shipping lines from 1855, as the dominant vector, which provided access to the Sydney markets.  Architectural development began with a masonry construction boom during the 1860s and 1870s, followed by a timber construction boom in the 1880s and 1890s.  In the Ulladulla District development was influenced by local stonemasons and Sydney architects from the 1860s&#8208;1870s, as well as regional developments in the Illawarra, which also influenced Kangaroo Valley in the 1870s.  The Nowra Area, the administrative and commercial focus of the Shoalhaven District from 1870, was where architectural developments in timber and masonry were greatest, influenced by regional developments, Sydney architects and carpenters and builders of German origin and training.  A local architectural grammar and style began to develop in the 1880s and 1890s, assisted by the railway, which arrived at Bomaderry near Nowra in 1893.  However, the depression and drought of the 1890s resulted in a hiatus in construction, exacerbated by the First World War 1914&#8208;1918, in common with the rest of New South Wales.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shoalhaven</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">Robin Boyd</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070122.163159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the design studio in relation to the teaching of industrial &amp; product design</field><field name="creator">Green, Lance Noel</field><field name="description">In this thesis the industrial design studio has been investigated with particular reference to
studio thinking and learning and project-based activity. This investigation has been set in
the context of a final-year, degree program in industrial design that includes a substantial
research and development project. From a critical review of the relevant literature the
characteristics of studio culture have been identified, together with its role in the teaching
of both creative and systematic endeavour. In addition, the history and context of the role
of the industrial/product designer is reviewed in order to understand the nature and the
required skills of the discipline.
In this thesis, an initial study surveyed academics involved in teaching industrial design in
Australia, and overseas. The study sought to determine the approach of students, in
various industrial design degree programs, to their final-year projects and the extent to
which design process and design methods were incorporated in their project reports. The
findings revealed a number of operational needs associated with studio-based learning,
particularly those associated with final-year, project-based activity. These findings,
together with teachings from the literature concerning how students go about design in the
studio and the needs associated with project activity, led to the proposal of a generic
model, entitled the Major Project Development Model "MPD Model". The operational
criteria in the MPD Model guided the development of a computer-integrated system of
design methods allocated to the respective phases of the process. This system, called the
"MPD System", is designed to support and enhance student design work in major projects.
A second study was conducted that analysed: student performance in their project reports;
the extent to which their design research conformed to the MPD Model; and the extent to
which design methods were used in their final-year projects. Criteria and guidelines for the
successful conduct and evaluation of such projects have been proposed and set up as
part of the experimental programme. The experimental work, reported in this thesis, is
based on an in-depth, comparative investigation of a range of major project reports, firstly
those produced in the year 2003 during which final-year students did not have access to or
knowledge of the MPD System and secondly, those produced in 2004 where students
were provided with the MPD System, hence providing two cohorts for comparative
purposes.
The theoretical and experimental work have been related, with appropriate results and
conclusions, to the following issues: Design theory &#65533; an MPD Model has been proposed
and applied in keeping with a set of operational criteria; design methods - a model
reflecting a range of methods aligned to phases of the MPD Model have been established
in keeping with needs of designers in their execution of phases of the process; brainbased
learning theory &#65533; a model of the integration of the MPD System as a means of
linking systematic and creative thinking in the studio process is proposed; academic
performance &#65533; the academic performance of students has been studied and data have
been derived which provide valuable information for the design educational process.
The results of this research will encourage use of a more structured teaching and learning
approach and the employment of design methods in major projects. This comprehensive
research thesis provides a framework for further research and recommendations for further
research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design studios</field><field name="subject">industrial design</field><field name="subject">product design</field><field name="subject">MPD Model</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070129.124614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient, organic carbon and suspended solid loadings in two

Communication)</field><field name="creator">Herbert, Elanna</field><field name="description">The creative component of my doctoral thesis articulates narratives of female
experience in Colonial Australia. The work re-contextualises and re-narrativises
accounts of events which occurred in particular women&#65533;s lives, and which were
reported in nineteenth century newspapers. The female characters within my novel are
illiterate and from the lower classes. Unlike middle-class women who wrote letters
and kept journals, women such as these did not and could not leave us their stories.
The newspaper accounts in which their stories initially appeared reflected patriarchal
(and) class ideologies, and represented the women as the &#65533;other&#65533;. However, it is by
these same textual artefacts that we come to know of their existence.
The multi-layered novel I have written juxtaposes archival pre-texts (or intertexts)
against fictional re-narrativisations of the same events. One reason for the use of this
style is in order to challenge the past positioning of silenced women. My female
characters&#65533; first textual iterations, those documents which now form our archival
records, were written from a position of hegemonic patriarchy. Their first textual
iteration were the record of female existence recorded by others. The original voices
of the fictionalised female characters of my novel are heard as an absence and the
intertext, as well as the fiction, now stands as a trace of what once existed as women&#65533;s
lived, performative experience.
My contention is that by making use of concepts such as historiographic metafiction,
transworld identities, and sideshadowing; along with narrative structures such as
juxtaposition, collage and the use of intertext and footnotes, a richer, multidimensional
and non-linear view of female colonial experience can be achieved. And
it will be one which departs from that hegemonically imposed by patriarchy. It is the
reader who becomes the meaning maker of &#65533;truth&#65533; within historical narration.
My novel sits within the theoretical framework of postmodern literature as a variant
on a new form of the genre that has been termed &#65533;historical fiction&#65533;. However, it
departs from traditional historical fiction in that it foregrounds not only an imagined
fictional past world created when the novel is read, but also the actual archival
documents, the pieces of text from the past which in other instances and perhaps put
together to form a larger whole, might be used to make traditional history. These
pieces of text were the initial finds from the historical research undertaken for my
novel. These fragments of text are used within the work as intertextual elements
which frame, narratively interrupt, add to or act as footnotes and in turn, are
themselves framed by my female characters&#65533; self narrated stories. These introduced
textual elements, here foregrounded, are those things most often hidden from view
within the mimetic and hermeneutic worlds of traditional historical fiction. It is also
with these intertextual elements that the fictional women engage in dialogue. At the
same time, my transworld characters&#65533; existence as fiction are reinforced by their
existence as &#65533;objects&#65533; (of narration) within the archival texts. Both the archival texts
and the fiction are now seen as having the potential to be unreliable.
My thesis suggests that in seeking to gain a clearer understanding of these events and
the narrative of these particular marginalised colonial women&#65533;s lives, a new way of
engaging with history and writing historical fiction is called for. I have undertaken this
through creative fiction which makes use of concepts such as transworld identity, as
defined by Umberto Eco and also by Brian McHale, historiographic metafiction, as
defined by Linda Hutcheon and the concept of sideshadowing which, as suggested by
Gary Saul Morson and Michael Andr&#65533; Bernstein, opens a space for multiple historical
narratives.
The novel plays with the idea of both historical facts and historical fiction. By giving
textual equality to the two the border between what can be considered as historical
fact and historical fiction becomes blurred. This is one way in which a type of textual
agency can be brought to those silenced groups from Australia&#65533;s past. By juxtaposing
parts of the initial textual account of these events alongside, or footnoted below, the
fiction which originated from them, I create a female narrative of &#65533;new writing&#65533;
through which parts of the old texts, voiced from a male perspective, can still be read.
The resulting, multi-layered narrative becomes a collage of text, voice and meaning
thus enacting Mikhail Bakhtin&#65533;s idea of heteroglossia.
A reading of my novel insists upon questioning the truthfulness or degree of reliability
of past textual facts as accurate historic records of real women&#65533;s life events.
It is this which is at the core of my novel&#65533;an historiographic metafictional
challenging by the fictional voices of female transworld identities of what had been
written as an historical, legitimate account of the past. This self-reflexive style of
historical fiction makes for a better construct of a multi-dimensional, non-linear view
of female colonial experience.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colonial Australia</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">creative fiction</field><field name="subject">novel</field><field name="subject">historical fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070122.150626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating the wealth of Australians:
a new approach using microsimulation</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Simon John</field><field name="description">The distribution of economic wellbeing is generally regarded as one of the key performance
indicators of a society and economic wellbeing is strongly influenced by income, wealth and
consumption. Despite this, almost all studies of inequality in Australia have relied upon income
as the sole measure of economic wellbeing, due in large part to the ready availability of income
data. This thesis attempts to redress that deficiency.
This thesis provides an insight into an under-researched but vitally important topic &#65533; the
distribution of wealth. Specifically the research has three goals. The first is to provide estimates
of the level and distribution of wealth in Australia at the current time and the trends over the
past decade or two. The second aim is to provide projections of the future wealth distribution.
The final goal is to see if there are significant differences between the distribution of lifetime
wealth and the annual cross-sectional distribution of wealth.
The research uses a technique not previously used in Australia to estimate wealth in the future &#65533;
dynamic microsimulation. The microsimulation model used is based on a starting sample of
150,000 individuals and this large number allows a large range of experiences to be modelled,
while not having the high costs, years of commitment and other problems associated with
undertaking panel studies.
This thesis estimates that the average levels of wealth will increase significantly over the
40-year period from 2000 to 2040 but that wealth inequality will increase over the same period.
The reasons for the increases in wealth inequality appear to be due to changes in asset
ownership, particularly lower levels of home ownership; the ageing population; and increases in
inequality within age cohorts.
The research found that lifetime wealth inequality for a sub-group of Generation X differed
from the distribution based on annual data. The lifetime wealth inequality was significantly less
than the annual wealth inequality.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microsimulation</field><field name="subject">economic wellbeing</field><field name="subject">inequality</field><field name="subject">wealth distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070130.111024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transfer of learning from the Out-country Training Programs (Ministry of Education, Bhutan)
Royal Government of Bhutan</field><field name="creator">Dorji, Tshewang</field><field name="description">This study explores the effectiveness of the out-country training programs, undertaken by the Ministry of Education personnel in Bhutan, between the period 1999 and 2003. The particular emphasis is on the Transfer of Learning.
The transfer literature shows that there are several factors affecting the transfer process (Baldwin &amp; Ford, 1988; Cheng &amp; Ho, 2001). They range from trainees&#65533; personal characteristics through training design to organisational support. The transfer process is also said to differ according to the types of organisations, types of training, and duration of training (Holton et al., 2003). While some factors can be influenced by the organisation, some may be beyond the control of the organisation. Therefore, transfer evaluation should focus on those parts of the transfer system that the organisation can influence (Noe, 2000).
Baldwin and Ford&#65533;s (1988) theoretical framework was adapted to help answer the research questions. This framework is based on the concept that the transfer of learning is governed by several pre-conditions viz. pre-training motivation, training design and work environment factors. These three pre-conditions consist of several factors, and have been placed under three stages of the training process: pre-training, training and post-training. Through the perspectives of trainees and their supervisors, this research can look back into all the three stages of the transfer system and identify what parts of the transfer system need intervention (Holton et al., 2003).
Both quantitative data and qualitative data have been used. Quantitative data were collected using a trainee survey questionnaire, and the qualitative data were gathered using trainee in-depth personal interview and supervisor structured interview. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive normative figures, means, percentages, tables and graphs. The Software Product for Social Studies (SPSS) has been used to generate the descriptive figures, means and percentages. On the other hand, dominant themes of the qualitative data have been extracted and grouped in rank order.
The training process was split into three main stages, pre-training, training and post-training, in order to assess the effectiveness of the whole training process through self-reported data. The questions were geared towards ascertaining the trainees&#65533; motivational level prior to training, quality of training and work environment factors that have affected the process of transfer.
Overall, the trainees participated in their training with a good level of pre-training motivation. However, trainees&#65533; attitude towards their training changed once they experienced the training. For example, the level of perceived ability to transfer learning to workplaces by the trainees in the academic category reduced after they experienced the training. Perceived utility of the training differed between job utility and career utility. While trainees in all the categories foresaw job utility of their training to be positive, a few trainees in the technical category did not foresee career utility of their training.
There are several direct and indirect factors that affected the transfer process. The direct factors include excessive workload, inadequate requisite materials and mismatch of jobs and skills after training. On the other hand, the indirect factors range from lack of clearly laid training objectives to lack of monitoring and evaluation after training. The lack of these main elements in HR system limited opportunities for trainees and their supervisors to ensure transfer of learning acquired from training.
On the whole, the out-country training programs were effective. However, there is a great scope for optimising the benefits of out-country training programs and enhancing the rate of transfer. The Ministry of Education needs to streamline and strengthen its HRD system, particularly in terms of clearly identifying training objectives and pursuing monitoring and
evaluation after the training.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">out-country training programs</field><field name="subject">Ministry of Education</field><field name="subject">Bhutan</field><field name="subject">Royal Government of Bhutan</field><field name="subject">Transfer of Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070122.131430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How events affect destination image: analysing the national capital</field><field name="creator">Simoncini, Marina</field><field name="description">Despite the growing importance of both destination image and event tourism, a
research gap exists when the two fields are combined. Destination image and event
tourism have been subject to separate research efforts in the tourism field, however
there has been little evidence of research in how events can affect destination image.
The thesis attempts to address the research gap that currently exists by using
Canberra, the National Capital of Australia and two annual events in the Capital -
Stegbar Canberra 400 and Floriade 2002 as case studies.
The thesis illustrates the importance of destination image in regard to the destination
selection process, the meaning and measurement of image and the growing interest
in event tourism. Several studies have illustrated that destination images do influence
tourists' behaviour and subsequently decision making (Hunt 1975). Image, among
other variables can be the deciding factor in choosing one destination over another.
In spite of the importance of this research line, several authors recognise a lack of an
agreed way of conceptualising destination image. A conceptual framework of
destination image was developed by Echtner and Ritchie (1991) which forms the
foundation of the thesis. Although the framework has its flaws, it has been pointed
out that the Echtner and Ritchie Destination Image Framework has been useful in the
assessment of destination images.
Importantly, how events can be used to influence the image of a destination is put
forward. Canberra and its image, being the focus of the study, is discussed in detail
with reference also to Tamworth and Sydney. Although much of the research into
event tourism has focused on the economic benefits that events can provide to a
destination, the effect an event can have on the destination image has not been well
demonstrated.
Research on Canberra has indicated various studies in regard to the perceptions
Australians have of the destination, community attitudes towards Canberra and event
related research, however the effect that events have on Canberra's image has not
been addressed.

The thesis incorporates studies of events to measure the effect that they have on the
image of a destination. The two main studies were conducted in conjunction with the
Centre of Tourism Research (CTR) at the University of Canberra. Two events, held
annually in the National Capital, were the focus of the research - Stegbar Canberra
400 and Floriade 2002. Event attendees at the two events were the target sample
consisting of both locals and interstate visitors to Canberra. Two key questions
related to destination image were added to the existing questionnaires and were the
focus of the research. Primary research commenced in June 2002 and concluded
November 2002.
Destination image responses were derived from both the Stegbar Canberra 400 and
Floriade 2002. Results indicated that event attendees regard the two events as being
very positive in respect to the destination image of Canberra. The Top 15 responses
from both studies also indicate a positive correlation between events and the
destination image of Canberra.
The Top 15 image responses from the events indicated that events do have an
influence on the image of the destination with many event related characteristics
appearing in the Top 15 image responses. This was further emphasised when the
results from the two events were compared to that of 'Australians' Perceptions of
their National Capital' (Richards 2002). General destination images in all three
studies were mentioned however Stegbar Canberra 400 and Floriade 2002 image
responses were more events driven. The Perceptions study illustrated more unique
characteristics of the National Capital along with National attractions. Further, the
image results derived from Stegbar Canberra 400 and Floriade illustrates the notion
of 'multiple' images that a destination may possess.
It is postulated that events have a Life Cycle, and that their influence on destination
image varies according to their life cycle stage. It was found that events that lay in
the introduction stage of the life cycle have more varied image results that are
directly related to the event itself. On the other hand, events that reside in the
maturity stage possess strong images related more to the destination itself as
opposed to the event. These 'older' events become synonymous with the destination
and therefore images are associated with the destination.

In conclusion, the research has illustrated that events do have an impact on the
image or images of a destination. In this case, the image of Canberra was subject to
influence from both Stegbar Canberra 400 and Floriade 2002 event attendees.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business analysis</field><field name="subject">events</field><field name="subject">destinations</field><field name="subject">canberra</field><field name="subject">business</field><field name="subject">business image</field><field name="subject">business research</field><field name="subject">influx</field><field name="subject">population movement</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050630.094111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Smart Clients for small E-business framework</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Phu-Nhan</field><field name="description">Businesses with less than 20 employees are regarded as small businesses. The four main
types of small business structures are mostly Sole Trader, Partnership, Trust, and
Company. E-commerce is the transformation of key commerce processes through the
use of the Internet. E-commerce consists of the buying, selling, marketing and servicing
of products and services over the Internet. The benefits of E-commerce are reduction in
costs, convenient communication and performance of the business process. Several
models for E-commerce are Business to Business (B2B), Business to Customer (B2C),
Business to Employee (B2E), Business to Government (B2G), and Customer to
Customer (C2C).
This thesis considers the small typical business structures in Australia to build a
framework for small business. Small Business Framework (SBF) is developed to
provide a framework to design and implement Web applications for Smart Clients and
applications for E-commerce and M-commerce models which are mainly B2B and B2C.
The SBF&#65533;s components are database, email, electronic payment, products, orders, and
login. The technology requirements to operate the SBF are Personal Digital Assistants
(PDA), Unicode, Web Server, Visual Studio .NET 2003 (VS .NET) and provision of
services through Internet. In order to test and evaluate SBF, an Online Asian Grocery
Mobile (OAGM) application has been developed for B2C using MS Visual Studio .NET
2003 (VS.NET). Results showed that the SBF is a good framework for small businesses
and the OAGM is a sucessful application prototype since OAGM provides good
accessibility, saves time, and is effective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">E-business</field><field name="subject">E-commerce</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">Small Business Framework</field><field name="subject">SBF</field><field name="subject">Smart Client Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060803.104619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The population genetics of the invasive Psocoptera
(Liposcelididae) species Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel
and Liposcelis decolor (Pearman) in Australian grain storage
systems</field><field name="creator">Mikac, Katarina Maryann</field><field name="description">This thesis is a comprehensive treatment of the invasion genetics of two major
Liposcelis pest species, Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel and L. decolor
(Pearman), in Australian grain storage systems. Randomly amplified polymorphic
DNA (RAPDs) and microsatellite DNA markers were used to investigate Liposcelis
invasions in grain storage systems. The RAPD and microsatellite markers used
provided insights into the genetic diversity of L. bostrychophila and L. decolor
populations both in Australia and internationally, providing information integral to
gaining an understanding of Liposcelis invasions in Australian grain storage systems.
The thesis is divided into discrete chapters, and for each chapter an abstract is
provided. Chapter 1 provides background on Liposcelis invasions in Australia in
relation to the biology of Liposcelis species, the infrastructure of the Australian grain
industry and the history of invasions in comparison to other invasive invertebrate
species. The use of DNA and PCR technologies to investigate Liposcelis invasions
are discussed and the aims and objectives of this thesis are introduced. Chapter 2 uses
RAPDs to trace the geographic origin of L. bostrychophila populations in Australia
from unknown geographic sources internationally. High levels of clonal genetic
diversity among populations of L. bostrychophila in Australia and internationally
were found. In addition, multiple introductions, from a wide range of international
source populations were detected and this obscured our ability to accurately determine
the geographic origin of L. bostrychophila in Australia. Given the high clonal genetic
diversity found in populations of parthenogenetic L. bostrychophila in Australia,
diagnostic Wolbachia PCR primers were used in Chapter 3 to investigate whether L.
bostrychophila individuals from these populations were infected by Wolbachia and if
infected, to investigate the strain of Wolbachia characteristic of Australian L.
bostrychophila populations. Results from Chapter 3 provide the first evidence of
multiple Wolbachia infection from strains A and B in Australian L. bostrychophila
populations.
Chapter 4 details the extensive molecular procedures undertaken to isolate
microsatellite loci from Liposcelis decolor using both enrichment and nonenrichment
methods. Microsatellite loci were optimised for use in PCR in single individuals
following extensive troubleshooting. Troubleshooting efforts focused on elucidating
the factors controlling the specificity, efficiency and sensitivity of the PCR to amplify
small Liposcelis individuals known to be rich in lipids and proteins, all inhibitory to
PCR. In Chapter 5 lipids and proteins were investigated from L. decolor and L.
entomophila to determine total concentrations and characterize the lipids from these
species. This chapter discusses whether the lipid and protein concentrations found
were of a level that could be inhibitory to PCR in relation to the microsatellite
techniques used in this study. From the work conducted in both Chapters 4 and 5 a
troubleshooting protocol adapted for use in L. decolor was developed and
implemented to determine the endogenous and exogenous parameters responsible for
the function and reproducibility of PCR of microsatellite loci in L. decolor. In
Chapter 6, the novel microsatellites isolated from L. decolor in Chapter 4 were used to
investigate genetic structure and gene flow from Australian and international L.
decolor populations. In Chapter 6 the first evidence of population differentiation, gene
flow and dispersal in invasive populations of L. decolor was found.
In addition, the eleven microsatellites isolated from L. decolor were cross-amplified
in five other important Liposcelis pests, L. bostrychophila, L. entomophila, L. paeta,
L. rufa, and L. corrodens, from which informative population genetic studies are now
possible. Finally, Chapter 7 comprises the thesis synopsis, implications and future
research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian grain storage</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel</field><field name="subject">Liposcelis decolor</field><field name="subject">Liposcelis invasions</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070301.154014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Walking together" :
the elements of the retrospective construction of safety in marriages
where the wife is a survivor of incest.</field><field name="creator">Graham, Lydia</field><field name="description">Many intimate relationships do not survive the process of working through
issues to do with incest. However, some relationships do well despite these upheavals.
Therefore the focus of the current study was on how lasting marriages manage to
construct emotional safety in order to maintain emotional intimacy.
The relationship issues of marriages where one partner is a survivor of incest
have not been widely researched. Yet it is in the survivor's relationship where many
issues arising from the incest may be played out.
Literature in the survivor area focuses on the need for safety and support.
Therefore, models of couple counselling may need to include these issues in their
notions of healing within the process of counselling.
This study was conducted using qualitative research methods. Focus groups
were a primary source of data. The study examined the construction of safety in longterm
intact marriages of incest survivors. This examination looked at the three-stage
model of counselling for trauma proposed by Judith Herman, and the relationship
between these three stages of healing and the construction of safety.
The research participants included female incest survivors and husbands of
survivors of incest. Participants were asked to individually make written constructions
of safety related to each of the three stages of healing. A group construction process
followed these individual constructions and differences within the written materials
were also highlighted.
Segregated groups met three times, each time concentrating on a particular stage
of healing. A single validating group of the combined women and men's groups met
later to do an overall construction of the notion of safety.
Results indicate that emotional safety is indeed an important issue for both
partners in relationships where the wife is a survivor of incest. There are differences
between survivors and partners about the significance of the three stages. A model of
the retrospective construction of safety has been developed. This model includes the
important elements of the experience of emotional safety that arose. These elements
were knowledge, negotiated control, negotiated trust, communication, how anger is
managed and directed, and managing the difficult times and issues such as the times of
the disclosure of incest.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">incest</field><field name="subject">relationship counselling</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">marriage</field><field name="subject">anger management</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050411.140236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The teacher's voice : appraisal, development, and

policy, and union levels, to their involvement in the development and implementation of
Teacher Review and Development (TRAD) and Individual Development Plans (IDP).
Through a case study methodology that uses a phenomenological approach, this research
found that TRAD and IDP had little credibility as tools of teacher development or appraisal
for teachers because of a range of complexities that included the politicisation of the
processes, a lack of financial and resource support, and varied quality control measures.
The research elicited a list of criteria for successful design and development of appraisal
processes. These are detailed in Chapter Five of the thesis. They are rigorous monitoring and
modelling of the processes, clear goals with stated end dates and recognition for involvement,
appraisal that is integrated in existing work practices and based on shared understandings of
work value, the provision of resources and time targeted at the appraisal process, a
commitment to identifying and acting on inefficiencies, appraisal that is focused on teacher
development and not directly linked to salary "reward".
The research concludes that authentic teacher review and development will not take place
until teachers themselves take on the responsibility, as a professional group, external to
their employer, for the design of teacher review and development.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australain Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">Teacher Review and Development</field><field name="subject">TRAD</field><field name="subject">Individual Development Plans</field><field name="subject">IDP</field><field name="subject">appraisal</field><field name="subject">teacher development</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061129.131120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Considering design for automatic speech

(ASR) systems are difficult to use and yet they are used by many
people in their daily work. This thesis addresses the question: How is
ASR used and made usable and useful in the workplace now?
To answer these questions I went into two workplaces where ASR is
currently used and one where ASR could be used in the future. This field
work was done with designing in mind. ASR dictation systems are currently
used in the Australian Public Service (APS) by people who suffer
chronic workplace overuse injuries and in the Hansard department of Parliament
House (Hansard) by un-injured people.
Analysing the experiences of the users in the APS and at Hansard
showed that using an ASR system in the workplace follows a broad trajectory
that ends in the continued effort to maintain its usefulness. The
usefulness of the ASR systems is &#65533;performed into existence&#65533; by the users
with varying degrees of success. For both the APS and Hansard users,
they use ASR to allow work to be performed; ASR acts to bridge the gap
between otherwise incompatible ways of working.
This thesis also asks: How could ASR be used and made usable and
useful in workplaces in the future? To answer this question, I observed
the work of communicating sentences at the ACT Magistrates Court.
Communicating sentences is a process that is distributed in space and
time throughout the Court and embodied in a set of documents that have
a co-ordinating role. A design for an ASR system that supports the process
of communicating sentences while respecting existing work process
is described.
Moving from field work to design is problematic. This thesis performs
the process of moving from field work to design, as described above, and
reflects the use of various analytic methods used to distill insights from
field work data.

The demand aspect of the theory of diffusion of innovation enabled the formulation of a number of research propositions which formed the focus for this research. Seventy-five randomly-selected SMEs within the ACT were interviewed. Of these seventy five, fifty had adopted e-commerce and twenty-five had not.
Findings complemented results from other studies, but also added to them. Factors from the demand aspect of the theory of time, resources (personnel, financial, technological), business organisation, size, return on investment, push by outside agencies or clients, and communication channels were found to be of little importance. Of greater importance were characteristics of the SME operators themselves (such as their innovativeness, their relative youth and educational level), the size of their business, the number of years it had been operating, and marketing issues. A prime consideration was that of attaining and maintaining a competitive edge over their competitors. Security and privacy issues were of little consideration prior to the adoption process, but became of much greater importance once SMEs had adopted e-commerce.
Some things discovered by this research that have not appeared in the reporting of other studies included:
&#65533; The importance of tertiary education for the primary decision-makers in the organisation;
&#65533; The role banks played in the adoption process;
&#65533; The high cost and difficulty of compliance with government regulations, especially regarding the employment of staff; and
&#65533; The lack of use of specifically established communication channels, set up by government bodies or associated industry organisations to educate and inform SMEs about the potential and process of e-commerce.

species of marine phytoplankton cultured, to represent the different marine environments that
primary producers inhabit. Organisms selected were compared to species within their own
environment and then a comparison made between the varying ecosystems.
In the salt marsh and mangrove ecosystems, the leaves of four species, the mangrove
Avicennia marina, the samphire Sarcocornia quinqueflora, the seablight Suaeda australis,

(0.13 &#65533; 0.06 &#65533;g g-1 to 0.46 &#65533; 0.22 &#65533;g g-1), S. australis (0.03 &#65533; 0.06 &#65533;g g-1 to 0.05 &#65533; 0.03 &#65533;g g-1)and P. australis (0.34 &#65533; 0.10 &#65533;g g-1 to 0.65 &#65533; 0.26 &#65533;g g-1). Arsenic concentrations were
significantly different between species and locations but were consistently low compared to
marine macroalgae species. Significant relationships between As and Fe concentrations for A. marina, S. quinqueflora and P. australis and negative relationship between As and Zn
concentrations for S. quinqueflora could partially explain arsenic concentrations in these
species. No relationship between As and P concentrations were found in this study. All
terrestrial species contained predominantly inorganic arsenic in the water extractable and
residue fractions with minor concentrations of DMA in the water-soluble fraction. P. australis
also contained dimethylated glycerol and phosphate arsenoriboses. The presence of
arsenobetaine, arsenocholine and trimethylated glycerol arsonioribose is most likely due to
the presence of epiphytes on fronds on P. australis.
In contrast, macroalgae contained higher total arsenic concentrations compared to marine
terrestrial angiosperms. Total arsenic concentrations also varied between classes of algae: red macroalgae 4.3 &#65533;g g-1 to 24.7 &#65533;g g-1, green macroalgae 8.0 &#65533;g g-1 to 11.0 &#65533;g g-1 and blue green algae 10.4 &#65533;g g-1 and 18.4 &#65533;g g-1. No significant relations were found between As
concentrations and concentrations of Fe, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, Mg, P and Zn concentrations,
elements that are required by macroalgae for photosynthesis and growth. Distinct differences
between algal classes were found for the proportion of arsenic species present in the lipid and water-soluble fractions, with green algae having a higher proportion of As in lipids than red or estuarine algae. Acid hydrolysis of the lipid extract revealed DMA, glycerol arsenoribose and TMA based arsenolipids. Within water-soluble extracts, red and blue-green algae contained a greater proportion of arsenic as inorganic and simple methylated arsenic species compared to green algae, which contained predominantly glycerol arsenoribose. Arsenobetaine, arsenocholine and tetramethylarsonium was also present in water-soluble extracts but is not normally identified with macroalgae and is again likely due to the presence of attached epiphytes. Residue extracts contained predominantly inorganic arsenic, most likely associated with insoluble constituents of the cell.
Mean arsenic concentrations in the green microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta were 13.3 &#65533;g g-1 to 14.5 &#65533;g g-1, which is similar to arsenic concentrations found in green macroalgae in this
study. Diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum arsenic concentrations were 1.62 &#65533;g g-1 to
2.08 &#65533;g g-1. Varying the orthophosphate concentrations had little effect on arsenic uptake of microalgae. D. tertiolecta and P. tricornutum metabolised arsenic, forming simple methylated arsenic species and arsenic riboses. The ratio of phosphate to glycerol arsenoriboses was higher than that normally found in green macroalgae. The hydrolysed lipid fraction contained DMA arsenolipid (16-96%) with minor proportions of phosphate arsenoribose (4-23%).
D. tertiolecta at f/10 phosphate concentration, however, contained glycerol arsenoribose and
another arsenic lipid with similar retention as TMAO as well as DMA. The similarities
between arsenic species in the water-soluble hydrolysed lipids and water-soluble extracts,
especially for P. tricornutum, suggests that cells readily bind arsenic within lipids, either for membrane structure or storage, releasing arsenic species into the cytosol as degradation of lipids occurs. Inorganic arsenic was sequestered into insoluble components of the cell.
Arsenic species present in D. tertiolecta at lower phosphate concentrations (f/10) were
different to other phosphate concentrations (f/2, f/5), and require further investigation to
determine whether this is a species-specific response as a result of phosphate deficiency.

Although there are similarities in arsenic concentrations and arsenic species in marine
photosynthetic organisms, it is evident that response to environmental concentrations of
arsenic in uncontaminated environments is dependent on the mode of transfer from the
environment, the influence of other elements in arsenic uptake and the ability of the organism
to metabolise and sequester inorganic arsenic within the cell. It is not scientifically sound to generalise on arsenic metabolism in &#65533;marine plants&#65533; when species and the ecosystem in which
they exist may influence the transformation of arsenic in higher marine organisms.
There is no evidence to suggest that angiosperms produce AB as arsenic is mostly present as
inorganic As, with little or no arsenic present in the lipids. However, marine macro- and
microalgae both contain lipids with arsenic moieties that may be precursors for AB
transformation. Specifically, the presence of TMA and dimethylated arsenoribose based
arsenolipids both can transform to AB via intermediates previously identified in marine
organisms. Further identification and characterization of As containing lipids is required.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arsenic</field><field name="subject">marine photosynthetic plants</field><field name="subject">algae</field><field name="subject">marine photosynthetic organisms</field><field name="subject">salt marsh</field><field name="subject">mangrove</field><field name="subject">estuary</field><field name="subject">inter-tidal</field><field name="subject">south-east coast</field><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070521.120826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WOMEN&#65533;S LIFE IN A FIJIAN VILLAGE</field><field name="creator">Yabaki, Tamarisi</field><field name="description">The impact of the market economy is a significant challenge facing Fijian rural
communities. It is especially challenging for indigenous rural women who are managing
the shift from a subsistence way of living to engagement in money generating activities.
The challenge is more acute amongst disadvantaged populations such as women in rural
communities who lack the resources and the political power to manage these challenges.
The thesis provides a critical ethnographic, action-research study of the daily socioeconomic
experiences of a group of Fijian village women, at this time of significant
change. It provides and in-depth case study of a rural Fijian village located in the upper
reaches of the Sigatoka Valley. The case study focuses on the women&#65533;s perspectives
about their daily lived experiences and actions that followed from reflection on these,
drawing out from these implications for indigenous Fijian women&#65533;s social progress and
development. Herself, a member of the community, the researcher gathered data by a
combination of participant observation, survey, diaries, focus groups and interviews. The
researcher&#65533;s observations and understandings were fed back to the participants in the
form of a workshop with the intention of confirmation and to provide and opportunity for
action based on this reflection. It is argued that the success of managing the influence of
the market economy on the villagers is to create social and political spaces and
opportunities to hear and understand local epistemologies and daily lived experiences,
reflexively.
As an indigenous scholar, the researcher interrogates and deconstructs her own academic
epistemologies and positions as a knowledge broker in order to co-construct new
practices with her people. The research promises to make public Fijian village women&#65533;s
knowledge, values, practices and experiences so that they can be understood by local
scholars and local government development officers. Privileging the village women&#65533;s
knowledge and bringing it to the core is a significant political act that might form the
basis of proceeding political encounters that women will face in the development process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">market economy</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">Fijian</field><field name="subject">rural communities</field><field name="subject">village</field><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">Fish Pond Project.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070525.122849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cracked and Broken Media in 20th and 21st Century
Music and Sound</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Caleb</field><field name="description">From the mid 20th century into the 21st, artists and musicians manipulated,

Yoshihide pulled apart the technologies of music playback, both the playback
devices &#65533; phonographs and CD players &#65533; and the recorded media &#65533; vinyl records

avant garde, this practice connects the interdisciplinary Fluxus movement with
late 20th century sound art and experimental electronic music. Cracked and
broken media techniques play a significant role in 20th century music and sound,
and continue to be productive into the 21st. The primary contribution of this
thesis is to provide a novel and detailed historical account of these practices. In
addition it considers theoretical approaches to this work. After considering
approaches through critiques of recording media, and concepts of noise, this
thesis proposes novel theorisations focusing on materiality and the everyday.
Ultimately it proposes that these practices can be read as precursors to
contemporary new media, as music and sound art cracked open the fixed

in the warm-up, on hamstring flexibility using a reliable set-up for measurement.
Static and dynamic flexibility was measured using five modifications of the Straight Leg Raise

hamstring flexibility was measured using a Static-passive, Static-active, Dynamic-supine and
Dynamic-standing tests. The results of this study were used to calculate reliability statistics and
to compare the various static and dynamic flexibility tests. There was a significant difference
between Static-passive (SPH) and the Dynamic-supine (DSUH) tests (p less than .05).
This was followed by an intervention study (n = 12) where participants were randomly assigned
to three intervention treatments of 225 seconds on separate days: No stretching (Treatment I),
Static stretching (Treatment 2) and Dynamic stretching (Treatment 3) in a cross-over study
design. Static stretching had no impact on dynamic hamstring flexibility; however, dynamic
stretching improved dynamic flexibility while simultaneously increasing static flexibility. This

Development for an Ecologically Sustainable Future:
The Contributions of Three Spiritual or Wisdom Traditions
to Constructions of Self and Other in Educational Contexts.</field><field name="creator">Schmid, Eva</field><field name="description">The core premise of the thesis is that our global environmental and social crises are of our own making and can only be transformed by us. Therefore it is imperative that humanity finds ways of protecting and sustaining the natural environment for our collective survival. This necessarily depends on human beings&#65533; ability to co-exist in harmony with other humans and species and to feel connected to and protect nature.
This thesis examines three spiritual or wisdom traditions &#65533; Aboriginal spiritualities, the Goddess movement and Tibetan Buddhism, as they relate to Arne Naess&#65533;s concept of the &#65533;ecological self.&#65533; The ecological self is a psychological construct that suggests that human beings can evolve from a narrow egocentric way of being and relating to others, to one that is more open, inclusive of the &#65533;other&#65533; and where one sees all lives as important. One is ultimately able to embrace the whole earth community, so that nothing is excluded as &#65533;other&#65533;. This process of increasingly &#65533;wide identification&#65533; Naess defined to be the process of the development of the ecological self.
There is much written about spirituality and the environment but little relevant research that specifically examines spiritual traditions as they relate to the ecological self. The insights of transpersonal psychology elucidate the maturation from ego consciousness to eco-consciousness &#65533; a process of progressively inclusive identification with &#65533;others&#65533;, including the environment. However, transpersonal psychology does not directly &#65533;converse&#65533; with Naess&#65533;s construct of an ecological self. This thesis examines the nexus between Arne Naess&#65533;s ecological self, transpersonal psychology and the three spiritual traditions.
 &#65533;Aboriginal spiritualities&#65533; refers to Australian Aboriginal spiritualities, unless other wise stated.
The literature review covers relevant background to the ecological self in relation to Western science and thought; this includes constructions of self and &#65533;other&#65533; and story. Literature reviews of the three traditions informed in-depth interviews with five research participants who practise or identify with their particular spiritual tradition. I believe this research will enable the reader to gain an overview of the ecological wisdom of these three spiritual traditions, grounded in the lived experience of practitioners who embody these traditions.
Each wisdom tradition has a long history of imparting psychological, social and ecological insights and understandings that are profoundly helpful and relevant to the current period of ecological crisis. The interviews are analysed under the broad conceptual themes of ecology, compassion and story. These traditions will be shown to encourage compassion, connectedness, interdependency and impart ecological wisdom - all vital to the realisation of the &#65533;ecological self&#65533;.
Story, lifelong learning and the ecoeducational model are used as frameworks for examining the educational potential of the spiritual traditions involved.
A choice must be made: will we continue to base our knowledges on Western science or will we examine alternate constructions of reality, such as those of the three spiritual traditions examined in this thesis? The three spiritual traditions provide a compassionate and non-violent view of human consciousness with the potential to transform into an ecologically sensitive creative force. This thesis argues that great wisdom is held by these three wisdom traditions in the context of education for sustainability. This thesis examines this context.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal spiritual traditions</field><field name="subject">Goddess Movement</field><field name="subject">Tibetan Buddhism</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">transpersonal psychology</field><field name="subject">ecopsychology.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070706.094423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of Time Series Data</field><field name="creator">Matus Castillejos, Abel</field><field name="description">Every day large volumes of data are collected in the form of time series. Time series are
collections of events or observations, predominantly numeric in nature, sequentially recorded
on a regular or irregular time basis. Time series are becoming increasingly important in
nearly every organisation and industry, including banking, finance, telecommunication, and
transportation. Banking institutions, for instance, rely on the analysis of time series for
forecasting economic indices, elaborating financial market models, and registering
international trade operations. More and more time series are being used in this type of
investigation and becoming a valuable resource in today&#65533;s organisations.
This thesis investigates and proposes solutions to some current and important issues in time
series data management (TSDM), using Design Science Research Methodology. The thesis
presents new models for mapping time series data to relational databases which optimise the
use of disk space, can handle different time granularities, status attributes, and facilitate time
series data manipulation in a commercial Relational Database Management System
(RDBMS). These new models provide a good solution for current time series database
applications with RDBMS and are tested with a case study and prototype with financial time
series information. Also included is a temporal data model for illustrating time series data
lifetime behaviour based on a new set of time dimensions (confidentiality, definitiveness,
validity, and maturity times) specially targeted to manage time series data which are
introduced to correctly represent the different status of time series data in a timeline. The
proposed temporal data model gives a clear and accurate picture of the time series data
lifecycle. Formal definitions of these time series dimensions are also presented. In addition,
a time series grouping mechanism in an extensible commercial relational database system is
defined, illustrated, and justified. The extension consists of a new data type and its
corresponding rich set of routines that support modelling and operating time series
information within a higher level of abstraction. It extends the capability of the database
server to organise and manipulate time series into groups. Thus, this thesis presents a new
data type that is referred to as GroupTimeSeries, and its corresponding architecture and
support functions and operations. Implementation options for the GroupTimeSeries data type
in relational based technologies are also presented.
Finally, a framework for TSDM with enough expressiveness of the main requirements of time
series application and the management of that data is defined. The framework aims at
providing initial domain know-how and requirements of time series data management,
avoiding the impracticability of designing a TSDM system on paper from scratch. Many
aspects of time series applications including the way time series data are organised at the
conceptual level are addressed. The central abstraction for the proposed domain specific
framework is the notions of business sections, group of time series, and time series itself. The
framework integrates comprehensive specification regarding structural and functional aspects
for time series data management. A formal framework specification using conceptual graphs
is also explored.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time series data management</field><field name="subject">TSDM</field><field name="subject">Design Science Research Methodology</field><field name="subject">relational database system</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070111.095300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">River conservation planning:
accounting for condition,
vulnerability and connected
systems</field><field name="creator">Linke, Simon</field><field name="description">Conservation science in rivers is still lagging behind its terrestrial and marine counterparts,
despite increasing threats to freshwater biodiversity and extinction rates being estimated as
five times higher than in terrestrial ecosystems. Internationally, most protected rivers have
been assigned reserve status in the framework of terrestrial conservation plans, neglecting
catchment effects of disturbance. While freshwater conservation tools are mainly index based
(e.g. richness, rarity), modern terrestrial and marine conservation planning methods use
complementarity-based algorithms - proven to be most efficient at protecting a large number
of taxa for the least cost. The few complementarity-based lotic conservation efforts all use
broad river classifications instead of biota as targets, a method heavily disputed in the
literature. They also ignore current condition and future vulnerability.
It was the aim of this thesis to develop a framework for conservation planning that:
a) accounts for the connected nature of rivers
b) is complementarity based and uses biota as targets
c) integrates current status and future vulnerability
I developed two different approaches using macroinvertebrate datasets from Australia,
Canada and the USA. The first new method was a site/based two-tiered approach integrating
condition and conservation value, based on RIVPACS/AUSRIVAS &#65533; a modelling technique
that predicts macroinvertebrate composition. The condition stage assesses biodiversity loss by
estimating a site-specific expected assemblage and comparing it to the actual observed
assemblage. Sites with significant biodiversity loss are flagged for restoration, or other
management actions. All other sites progress to the conservation stage, in which an index of
site-specific taxonomic rarity is calculated. This second index (O/E BIODIV) assesses the
number of rare taxa (as defined by &amp;lt50% probability of occurrence). Using this approach on a dataset near Sydney, NSW, Australia, I was able to identify three regions: 1) an area in need
of restoration; 2) a region of high conservation value and 3) an area that had high
conservation potential if protection and restoration measures could counteract present
disturbance.
However, a second trial run with three datasets from the USA and Canada highlighted
problems with O/E (BIODIV). If common taxa are predicted at lower probabilities of
occurrence (p&amp;lt50%) because of model error, they enter the index and change O/E (BIODIV).
Therefore, despite an attractive theoretical grounding, the application of O/E (BIODIV) will
be restricted to datasets where strong environmental gradients explain a large quantity of
variation in the data and permit accurate predictions of rare taxa. It also requires extensive
knowledge of regional species pools to ensure that introduced organisms are not counted in
the index.
The second approach was a proper adaptation of terrestrial complementarity algorithms and
an extension to the Irreplaceability-Vulnerability framework by Margules and Pressey (2000).
For this large-scale method, distributions for 400 invertebrate taxa were modeled across 1854
subcatchments in Victoria, Australia using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs). The best
heuristic algorithm to estimate conservation value was determined by calculating the
minimum area needed to cover all 400 taxa. Solutions were restricted to include rules for the
protection of whole catchments upstream of a subcatchment that contained the target taxon. A
summed rarity algorithm proved to be most efficient, beating the second best solution by 100
000 hectares. To protect 90% of the taxa, only 2% of the study area need to be protected. This
increases to 10% of the study area when full representation of the targets is required.
Irreplaceability was calculated by running the heuristic algorithm 1000 times with 90% of the
catchments randomly removed. Two statistics were then estimated: f (the frequency of
selection across 1000 runs) and average c (contribution to conservation targets). Four groups of catchments were identified: a) catchments that have high contributions and are always selected; b) catchments that have high contributions and are not always selected; c)
catchments that are always chosen but do not contribute many taxa; d) catchments that are
rarely chosen and did not contribute many taxa. Summed c, the sum of contributions over
1000 runs was chosen as an indicator of irreplaceability, integrating the frequency of selection
and the number of taxa protected.
Irreplaceability (I) was then linked to condition (C) and vulnerability (V) to create the ICVframework
for river conservation planning. Condition was estimated using a stressor gradient
approach (SGA), in which GIS layers of disturbance were summarised to three principal axes
using principal components analysis (PCA). The main stressor gradient &#65533; agriculture &#65533;
classified 75% of the study area as disturbed, a value consistent with existing assessments of
river condition. Vulnerability was defined as the likelihood that land use in a catchment
would intensify in the future. Hereby current tenure was compared to land capability. If a
catchment would support a land use that would have a stronger effect on the rivers than its
current tenure, it was classified as vulnerable. 79% of catchments contained more than 50%
vulnerable land.
When integrating the three estimators in the ICV-framework, seven percent of catchments
were identified as highly irreplaceable but in degraded condition. These were flagged for
urgent restoration. Unprotected, but highly irreplaceable and highly vulnerable catchments
that were still in good condition made up 2.5% of the total area. These catchments are prime
candidates for river reserves.
The ICV framework developed here is the first method for systematic conservation planning
in rivers that is complementarity-based, biota-driven but flexible to other conservation targets
and accounts for catchment effects, thus fulfilling all the gaps outlined in the aims.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wetland ecology Australia</field><field name="subject">river conservation</field><field name="subject">catchment based conservation planning</field><field name="subject">freshwater microbiology mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070716.155500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance and Physiological Monitoring of Highly Trained Swimmers</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Megan</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the benefits of physiological and performance testing of elite swimmers.

miniaturised and automated smart sensor technology to monitor the stroke and performance
times of swimmers in training. The experimental approach involved the retrospective
analysis of five years of physiological and performance testing of elite level swimmers, the
development of a new accelerometry-based smart sensor device to monitor swimmers in the
pool, a cross-sectional study comparing the physiological and performance responses of
swimmers of different levels, and the effects of an intensive 14-day training program on
submaximal physiological and performance measures. Collectively, the outcomes of these
studies provide a strong justification for the physiological and performance testing of elite
swimmers, a quantitative framework for interpreting the magnitude of changes and
differences in test scores and sources of variation, and highlight the potential utility of new
smart sensor technology to automate the monitoring of a swimmer&#65533;s training performance.
The first study (Chapter 2) characterises the changes and variability in test performance,
physiological and anthropometric measures, and stroke mechanics of swimmers within and
between seasons over their elite competitive career. Forty elite swimmers (24 male, 16
female) performed a 7 x 200-m incremental swimming step test several times each 6-month
season (10 &#65533; 5 tests, spanning 0.5 to 6.0 y). Mixed linear modeling provided estimates of
change in the mean and individual responses for measures based on submaximal performance
(fixed 4-mM lactate), maximal performance (the seventh step), and lean mass (from skinfolds
and body mass). Submaximal and maximal swim speed increased within each season from
the pre to taper phase by ~2.2% for females and ~1.5% for males (95% confidence limits
&#65533;1.0%), with variable contributions from stroke rate and stroke length. Most of the gains in
speed were lost in the off-season, leaving a net average annual improvement of ~1.0% for
females and ~0.6% for males (&#65533;1.0%). For submaximal and maximal speed, individual
variation between phases was &#65533;2.2% and the typical measurement error was &#65533;0.8%. In
conclusion, step test and anthropometric measures can be used to confidently monitor
progressions in swimmers in an elite training program within and between seasons.
The second study (Chapter 3) quantified the relationship between changes in test measures
and changes in competition performance for individual elite swimmers. The primary question
addressed was whether test measures could predict a swimmers performance at the major end-of-season competition. The same sample group as in Study 1 was examined. A 7 x 200-m
incremental swimming step-test and anthropometry were conducted in up to four training
phases each season. Correlations of changes in step-test and anthropometric measures
between training phases between and within seasons, with changes in competition
performance between seasons, were derived by repeated-measures mixed modeling and linear
regression. Changes in competition performance were best tracked by changes in test
measures between taper phases. The best single predictor of competition performance was
skinfolds for females (r = -0.53). The best predictor from the step-test was stroke rate at 4-mM lactate (females, r = 0.46; males, r = 0.41); inclusion of the second-best step-test
predictor in a multiple linear regression improved the correlations marginally (females, r =0.52 with speed in the seventh step included; males, r = 0.58 with peak lactate concentration
included). Changes in test measures involving phases other than the taper provided weak and
inconclusive correlations with changes in performance, possibly because the coaches and
swimmers took corrective action when tests produced poor results. In conclusion, a
combination of fitness and techniques factors are important for competitive performance. The
step test is apparently a useful adjunct in a swimmer&#65533;s training preparation for tracking large
changes in performance.
These initial studies identified stroke mechanics as a major determinant of a swimmer&#65533;s
performance. Chapter 4 details the development of a small tri-axial accelerometry-based
smart sensor device (the Traqua) that enables continual monitoring of various
performance/stroke characteristics in swimming. The initial focus was to develop a device
that automated the detection of a swimmer&#65533;s movements, specifically lap times, stroke rate
and stroke count. The Traqua consists of a tri-axial accelerometer packaged with a
microprocessor, which attaches to the swimmer at the pelvis to monitor their whole body
movements while swimming. This study established the failure/error rate in the first
generation algorithms developed to detect the swimming-specific movements of stroke
identification, laps (start, turn and finish), and strokes (stroke count and stroke rate) in a
cohort of 21 elite and sub-elite swimmers. Movements were analysed across a range of
swimming speeds for both freestyle and breaststroke. These initial algorithms were
reasonably successful in correctly identifying the markers representing specific segments of a
swimming lap in a range of swimmers across a spectrum of swimming speeds. The first
iteration of the freestyle algorithm produced error-rates of 13% in detection of lap times, 5%
for stroke rate, and 11% for stroke count. Subsequent improvements of the software reduced
the error rate in lap and stroke detection. This improved software was used in the following
two studies.
The next study (Chapter 5) evaluated the reliability and validity of the Traqua against
contemporary methods used for timing, stroke rate and stroke count determination. The
subjects were 14 elite and 10 sub-elite club-level swimmers. Each swimmer was required to
swim seven evenly paced 200-m efforts on a 5-min cycle, graded from easy to maximal.
Swimmers completed the test using their main competitive stroke (21 freestyle, 3
breaststroke). Timing was compared for each 50-m lap and total 200-m time by electronic
touch pads, video coding, a hand-held manual stopwatch, and the Traqua. Stroke count was
compared for video coding, self-reported counting, and the Traqua, while the stroke rate was compared via video coding, hand-held stopwatch, and the Traqua. Retest trials were
conducted under the same conditions 7 d following the first test. All data from the Traqua presented in this and the subsequent studies were visually inspected for errors in the
automated algorithms, where the algorithms had either failed to correctly identify the start,
turn, finish or individual strokes and corrected prior to analysis. The standard error of the
estimate for each of the timing methods for total 200 m was compared with the criterion
electronic timing. These standard errors were as follows: Traqua (0.64 s; 90% confidence
limits 0.60 &#65533; 0.69 s), Video (0.52 s; 0.49 &#65533; 0.55 s); Manual (0.63 s; 0.59 &#65533; 0.67 s). Broken
down by 50-m laps, the standard error of the estimate for the Traqua compared with the
electronic timing for freestyle only was: 1st 50-m 0.35 s; 2nd and 3rd 50-m 0.13 s; 4th 50-m
0.65 s. When compared with the criterion video-coding determination, the error for the stroke
count was substantially lower for the Traqua (0.6 strokes.50 m-1; 0.5 &#65533; 0.6 strokes.50 m-1)
compared to the self-reported measure (2.3 strokes.50 m-1; 2.5 &#65533; 2.9 strokes.50 m-1).
However, the error for stroke rate was similar between the Traqua (1.5 strokes.min-1; 1.4 &#65533; 1.6
strokes.min-1) and the manual stopwatch (1.8 strokes.min-1; 1.7 &#65533; 1.9 strokes.min-1). The
typical error of measurement of the Traqua was 1.99 s for 200-m time, 1.1 strokes.min-1 for
stroke rate, and 1.1 strokes.50 m-1 for stroke count. In conclusion, the Traqua is comparable
in accuracy to current methods for determining time and stroke rate, and better than current
methods for stroke count. A substantial source of error in the Traqua timing was additional
noise in the detection of the start and finish. The Traqua is probably useful for monitoring of
routine training but electronic timing and video are preferred for racing and time trials.
Having established the reliability and validity of the Traqua, Chapter 6 addressed the ability
to discriminate the pattern of pacing between different levels of swimmers in the 7 x 200-m
incremental step test. This study also sought to quantify the differences in pacing between
senior and junior swimmers. Eleven senior elite swimmers (5 female, 6 male) and 10
competitive junior swimmers (3 female, 7 male) participated in this study. Each swimmer
was required to swim seven evenly paced 200-m freestyle efforts on a 5-min cycle, graded
from easy to maximal. The Traqua was used to measure time, stroke rate and stroke count.
The senior swimmers were better able to descend in each of the 200-m efforts. Overall the
senior swimmers were ~2-3 s per 50 m faster than the junior swimmers. Both groups were
fastest in the first 50-m lap with the push start. The senior swimmers then descended the 50-
m time for each of the subsequent laps, getting ~0.5 s faster per lap, with the final lap the
fastest. In contrast, the junior swimmers swam a similar time for each of the subsequent laps.
The junior swimmers were marginally more variable in their times (coefficient of variation:
~2%) compared with the senior swimmers (~1.8%). In comparison to junior swimmers, the
senior swimmers in this study were faster, adopted a more uniform negative split strategy to
pacing within a 200-m effort, and were more consistent in reproducing submaximal and
maximal swimming speeds.
The final study (Chapter 7) analysed the effect of 14-d of intensive training on the
reproducibility of submaximal swimming performance in elite swimmers. Submaximal
physiological and performance testing is widely used in swimming and other individual sports
but the variability in test measures, and the effects of fatigue, during intensive training have
surprisingly not been quantified systematically. Seven elite swimmers (3 male and 4 female)
participated in an intensive 14-d training camp one month prior to the National
championships. The aim of the study was to characterise the intra-session, daily and training
block variability of submaximal swimming time, physiological and stroke characteristics in
elite swimmers. The swimmers performed a specified submaximal 200-m effort in most
sessions, after the warm-up and at the end of the session for both morning and afternoon
sessions. During the efforts, swimming time and stroke mechanics were measured and
physiological measures were recorded immediately on completion. The Traqua was worn by
all swimmers in every training session. Mixed linear modeling was used to provide estimates
of changes in the mean and individual responses (within-athlete variation as a coefficient of
variation) for all measures. The swimmers were moderately slower (1.4%; &#65533;1.4%) over the
14-d training camp. The mean submaximal 200-m effort was very likely to be faster (0.7%;
confidence limits &#65533;0.7%) in the afternoon compared with the morning session. The females
were more variable in their submaximal performance times (CV=2.6%) than the male
swimmers (1.7%). Blood lactate concentration was almost certainly lower (-23%; &#65533;10%)
following higher volume in the previous session; however a higher intensity workout the
previous session almost certainly leads to higher lactate (21%; &#65533;15%) in the current session.
Considered together, these results indicate that the 200-m submaximal test is useful in
monitoring submaximal physiological and performance measures and the negative effects of
cumulative fatigue.
In conclusion, changes in the physiological and performance measures derived from the poolbased
progressive incremental step test are moderately correlated with changes in end-ofviii.
season competition performance. The magnitudes of changes and differences in test measures
between phases within a season, from season to season, and between males and females,
established in this study can be applied to similar elite level swimmers preparing for major
competition. The quantification of typical error of the same measures demonstrates that
coaches and scientists can distinguish real and worthwhile improvements using the 7 x 200-m
step test. Continual pool-based monitoring with the automated smart sensor Traqua device
may provide more accurate and detailed information about a swimmer&#65533;s training adaptation
than current fitness tests and monitoring methods. Finally, submaximal testing in trained
swimmers is useful in monitoring progress in physiological and performance measures, and
the impact of cumulative fatigue during an intensive period of training. Collectively, the
outcomes of these studies indicate that routine physiological and performance testing can
provide measurable benefits for elite swimmers and their coaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">swimming monitoring device</field><field name="subject">performance evaluation -  swimmers</field><field name="subject">Traqua</field><field name="subject">elite swimming - Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070717.115408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning Styles of Adults in Education Centers</field><field name="creator">Seifert, Linda</field><field name="description">Given the median age of today's workforce and the aging of the

The research problem, that learning styles do not change as people
age, was addressed. People will resort to different styles when situations
necessitate they do so to learn a particular item. The data revealed that
environmental factors have different effects on people's learning styles.
Implications of this study are far reaching into many areas of research.
An implication is in the area of child psychology, as to &amp;quotwhen are learning

of the individual learners and with added factors that may be influencers of
history and conditions. The complexity of learning styles is influenced by
background experiences of learning, as opposed to the basic cognition
acquisition generally utilized. There are undisputed facts that: no thing

will try to replicate situations they find to be successful as much as possible.
The things learners can control are: selecting the course as close to the time

What is apparently needed is a public sector that is smaller, less costly, more efficient and more effective.
The search for alternative and better ways to organise and undertake work to meet these reform objectives is at the heart of the rapid expansion of Competitive Tendering and Contracting (CTC) within the public sector in the last two decades. But increased reliance on government contracting does not always lead to outsourcing. Some government agencies allow, indeed encourage, their current employees to also bid for the work on offer by including an In-House Option (IHO) within their CTC processes. In a number of cases these IHOs have been selected ahead of their commercial competitors.
IHOs are effectively internal tenders that, if selected, must be implemented by work areas within the confines of the policies and practices of their parent organisation. The reasons commonly expressed in support of IHOs are to do with addressing the potentially problematic aspects of organisational review and possible outsourcing, and to assist the parent organisation achieve its reform intentions in the most effective and least disruptive manner possible.
This research examined the achievements of six IHOs within the Australian Defence Organisation. It also asked what can be learned from their experiences? The findings show that IHOs can contribute to reform and enhance the effectiveness of CTC processes but that these achievements come at a price&#65533;borne primarily by the staff who work within selected IHOs.
IHOs add to the competition of CTC exercises. They also act as an insurance policy against being caught with no reasonable bids and offer a benchmark against which to assess unknown bids. But competition can also focus bidders on doing what is necessary to win rather than what is best for an organisation or its staff. Having IHOs increases the uncertainty for staff about their future employment while at the same times raising expectations that if they can be successful they will be able to make changes and improve their work areas. This research has shown that this does not always occur and staff can find the whole experience frustrating and demoralising.
Organisations that include IHOs within their CTC methodologies need to assist them if they are to have the best opportunity to propose new and innovative ways of working. And they must be prepared for the possibility that their IHOs could win. Selected IHOs need support to successfully implement changes, and as the IHOs examined here have shown, they can make significant improvements in work practices and more efficient use of resources if given the chance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Defence force - private contractors</field><field name="subject">public sector - Australia</field><field name="subject">Competitive Tendering and Contracting (CTC)</field><field name="subject">In-House Option (IHO)</field><field name="subject">Australian Defence Organisation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070719.122229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immunomodulation in the context of developing a
nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae vaccine</field><field name="creator">McGrath, John Francis</field><field name="description">One of the major challenges of vaccine development is the conservation of immunogenicity
and protective efficacy through the stages of design, production, formulation and delivery.
The critical issue is that how and in what form an antigen is taken up by antigen presenting
cells for proteolytic processing and presentation to the immune system bound to MHC can
have dramatic effects on the activation of Th cells to drive clonal responses and induction of
immunological memory.
Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a pathogenic commensal of the human
respiratory tract that causes diseases with enormous socioeoconomic burdens. There is no
licensed vaccine, although the potential for vaccination with outer membrane components to
reduce the incidence of disease caused by NTHi has recently been demonstrated in clinical
trials. The issue of immunomodulation was explored in this thesis in the context of the further
evaluation of a leading NTHi vaccine candidate, the outer membrane protein OMP26. The
efficacy of recombinant OMP26 (rOMP26) against NTHi challenge has been previously
demonstrated in mice, rats and chinchillas. In rats, efficacy was shown to be restricted to the
precursor form (containing the signal peptide) and not the mature form of rOMP26. The
immunodulatory effects of changes to the rOMP26 structure were further investigated in this
thesis. A range of structural variants of rOMP26 were constructed in view of reducing
extraneous plasmid-derived sequence from the antigen and to introduce a unique cysteine
residue as a potential conjugate site for multivalent vaccine development (Chapter 2). It was
demonstrated that minor structural changes to rOMP26 such as the addition, deletion,
modification or relative positioning of a single amino acid or bulky group, designed to
increase the efficiency of production or introduce (cysteine) conjugation sites, altered the
expression of the protein in E. coli and the immunogenicity in Balb/C mice. Furthermore, in
contradiction to the published report (El-Adhami et al. 1999) and a new study in rats (Chapter
3), there was no positive effect of the signal peptide in mice, with precursor and mature forms
of rOMP26 equally immunogenic (Chapter 2). Following confirmation of the need to retain
the signal peptide for the immunogenicity of rOMP26 in rats, a precursor form (rOMP26VTAL)
in which the conserved n-region of the signal peptide was deleted, and shown to reduce the
efficiency of the cleavage of the signal peptide by signal peptidase during protein overexpression
in E. coli (Chapter 3). Not only did this deletion result in an increase the yield and
stability of the purified precursor protein, but rOMP26VTAL was highly immunogenic and
enhanced the clearance of NTHi from the lungs of challenged rats. The potential for signal
peptides to be exploited as an immune-enhancing moiety in a proteinaceous vaccine is
discussed.
Following the development of rOMP26VTAL as a production optimised variant of rOMP26, the
next step was to test the feasibility of rOMP26VTAL as a component of a multivalent vaccine
(Chapter 4). Two chimeras were constructed with LB1(f)2,1,3, a trivalent synthetic B-cell
epitope from the extracellular loop 3 region of the P5 fimbrin protein of NTHi, positioned at
the N- or C-terminus of rOMP26VTAL. The solubility of rOMP26VTAL was affected by the
fusion, with both chimera constructs expressed only in the insoluble fraction, thus requiring a
denaturing protocol for purification. Although rLB1(f)2,1,3-OMP26VTAL was expressed and
purified as a more stable protein and in greater yield than rOMP26VTAL-LB1(f)2,1,3, the
relative positioning of the fusion was important and rOMP26VTAL-LB1(f)2,1,3 was significantly
more immunogenic in rats than rLB1(f)2,1,3-OMP26VTAL. In addition, rOMP26VTALLB1(
f)2,1,3, but not rLB1(f)2,1,3-OMP26VTAL induced a significant degree of bacterial clearance
following pulmonary challenge with NTHi, in levels comparable to the highly efficacious
rOMP26VTAL construct.
In the third part of the thesis, bacterial ghosts were evaluated as a novel mucosal delivery
technology for rOMP26VTAL and rOMP26VTAL-LB1(f)2,1,3, (Chapter 5). To mimic the natural
presentation of OMP26 and P5 fimbrin antigens on the cell surface of NTHi, an OmpA&#65533;
sandwich fusion surface display system was developed for the outer membrane expression of
the OMP26 constructs in E. coli ghosts. Following gut immunisation, but not intranasal
immunisation even when co-administered with the cholera toxin&#65533;derived adjuvant CTA1-DD,
bacterial ghosts were successful at presenting OMP26VTAL and rOMP26VTAL-LB1(f)2,1,3 to the
immune system for the induction of enhanced clearance of NTHi in the rat pulmonary
challenge model. Although this study was the first to demonstrate enhanced bacterial
clearance induced by heterologous antigens expressed in the outer membrane of bacterial
ghosts, future studies with ghosts will require optimisation of the expression levels of the
OmpA&#65533; fusion proteins possibly to avoid cross-reactive responses related to high doses of
ghosts in the inoculum.
This thesis presents data that both supports the further evaluation of rOMP26 constructs for
clinical trials, and has demonstrated the significant effects of structural changes, method of
production and delivery system can have on the immunogenicity of a candidate vaccine. Such
knowledge will contribute to and provide some new approaches for enhancing the efficiency
of vaccine development against a range of diseases including those caused by NTHi.
Major Outcomes:
1. Demonstration that the immunogenicity of rOMP26 antigen constructs is affected by
structural modifications and their positioning within the construct, and by the delivery
system.
2. Development of rOMP26VTAL, an rOMP26 construct with the KNIAK sequence
deletion of the signal peptide n-region. This protein retains the immunogenicity and
protective efficacy of rOMP26, but is produced with reduced cleavage of the signal
peptide, resulting in higher yields and a stable protein. Lacks extraneous plasmidderived
multiple cloning site sequence, and is produced in high yield as a stable
protein.
3. Construction of a NTHi rOMP26VTAL-LB1(f)2,1,3 chimera antigen that induced
enhanced clearance of NTHi in an acute pulmonary challenge model in rats.
4. Development of an OmpA&#65533; surface display system for the expression of rOMP26
antigen constructs in the outer membrane of E. coli/bacterial ghosts
5. Bacterial ghosts were successful as delivery vehicles for rOMP26 candidate vaccine
constructs when delivered in the gut.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vaccine development</field><field name="subject">Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae</field><field name="subject">NTHi</field><field name="subject">bacterial ghosts</field><field name="subject">immunisation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070726.152419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY AND HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY IN A
DRYLAND, ANABRANCHING FLOODPLAIN RIVER SYSTEM</field><field name="creator">McGinness, Heather M.</field><field name="description">Riverine landscapes are complex. More than just a single channel, they comprise a
shifting mosaic of hydrogeomorphic patches with varying physical and biological
characteristics. These patches are connected by water during flows of varying magnitude
and frequency, at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Combined, landscape
complexity and hydrological connectivity create biological diversity that in turn
maintains the productivity, ecological function, and resilience of these systems. This
thesis investigates the ecological importance of spatial heterogeneity and temporal
hydrological connectivity in a dryland floodplain river landscape. It focuses on
anabranch channels, and uses major carbon sources in these and adjacent landscape
patches as indicators of ecological pattern and process.
A conceptual model was proposed, describing the potential effects upon the distribution
and availability of major carbon sources of: a) a spatial mosaic of hydrogeomorphic
patches in the landscape (e.g. anabranches, river channel, and wider floodplain); and b)
four primary temporal phases of hydrological connection during flow pulses
(disconnection, partial connection, complete connection, and draining). This was then
tested by data collected over a three year period from a 16 km reach of the lower
Macintyre River (NSW/QLD Australia). Results were examined at multiple spatial
scales (patch scale &#65533; river channel vs. anabranches vs. floodplain; between individual
anabranches; and within anabranches &#65533; entry, middle and exit sites).
The data indicate that spatial heterogeneity in the lower Macintyre River landscape
significantly influences ecological pattern. Carbon quantity was greater in anabranch
channels compared to adjacent river channel patches, but not compared to the floodplain;
while carbon quality was greater in anabranch channels compared to both adjacent river
channel and floodplain patches. Stable isotope analysis indicated that carbon sources that
were predominantly found in anabranch channels supported both anabranch and river
organisms during a winter disconnection phase. Other carbon sources found in the main
river channel and the wider floodplain appeared to play a comparatively minimal role in
the food web.
Different phases of hydrological connection between anabranch channels and the main
river channel were associated with differences in the availability of carbon sources. In the
river channel, draining of water from anabranches (the draining phase) was associated
with relatively high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and low
concentrations of phytoplankton. Conversely, the disconnection phase was associated
with relatively low concentrations of DOC and high concentrations of phytoplankton in
the river channel. In anabranch channels and their waterbodies, the disconnection and
draining phases were associated with high concentrations of both DOC and
phytoplankton. Concentrations of these carbon sources were lowest in anabranches
during the partial and complete connection phases.
Different hydrological connection phases were also associated with changes in trophic
status in the aquatic components of the landscape. On the riverbanks, relatively low rates
of benthic production and respiration during the complete connection phase were
associated with heterotrophy. The remaining phases appeared to be autotrophic. Benthic
production on riverbanks was greatest during the disconnection phase, and respiration
was greatest during the partial connection phase. In the anabranch channels, rates of
production and respiration were similar during the disconnection phase, and were
associated with heterotrophy in the anabranch waterbodies. The remaining phases
appeared to be autotrophic. Respiration was greatest in anabranches during the
disconnection phase, and production was greatest during the draining phase. Both
production and respiration were lowest during complete connection. These differences
and changes varied according to the landscape patch examined.
At a landscape scale, anabranch channels act as both sinks and suppliers of carbon. High
rates of sediment deposition facilitate their role as sinks for sediment-associated carbon
and other particulate, refractory carbon sources. Simultaneously, anabranch channels
supply aquatic carbon sources from their waterbodies, as well as via processes such as
inundation-stimulated release of DOC from surface sediments. Modelled data indicated
that water resource development reduces the frequency and duration of connection
between anabranch channels and the main river channel. This loss of landscape
complexity via loss of connectivity with anabranches has the potential to reduce the total
availability of carbon sources to the ecosystem, as demonstrated by a modelled 13%
reduction in potential dissolved organic carbon release from anabranch sediments.
This thesis has demonstrated the importance of spatial heterogeneity in riverine
landscapes, by documenting its association with variability in the distribution and quality
of primary energy sources for the ecosystem. It has shown that this variability is
augmented by different phases of hydrological connectivity over time. Spatial
heterogeneity and hydrological connectivity interact to increase the diversity and
availability of ecological energy sources across the riverine landscape, at multiple spatial
and temporal scales. This has positive implications for the resilience and sustainability of
the system. Anabranch channels are particularly important facilitators of these effects in
this dryland floodplain river system. Anabranch channels are &#65533;intermediate&#65533; in terms of
spatial placement, temporal hydrological connection, and availability of carbon sources;
of high value in terms of high-quality carbon sources; and relatively easy to target for
management because of their defined commence-to-flow levels. Further research should
be directed toward evaluating other ecological roles of anabranch channels in dryland
rivers, thereby providing a more complete understanding of the importance of
connectivity between these features and other patches. This knowledge would assist
management of floodplain river landscapes at larger regional scales, including
amelioration of the effects of water resource development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RIVERINE LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY</field><field name="subject">SEMI-ARID FLOODPLAIN RIVER SYSTEMS</field><field name="subject">ANABRANCH CHANNELS</field><field name="subject">CARBON EXCHANGE</field><field name="subject">MACINTYRE RIVER CATCHMENT</field><field name="subject">STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070731.094606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Method for Efficient Transmission of XML Data across a Network</field><field name="creator">Ridgewell, Alexander Graham</field><field name="description">Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format derived from SGML (ISO 8879), which is a well defined, public standard. It uses plain text to encode a hierarchical set of information using verbose tags to allow the XML document to be understood without any special reader. The use of schemas in XML also allows a well defined contract describing what a single XML document means. The self-contained nature of XML and the strong contract provided by its schemas makes it useful as an archival storage format and as a means of communicating across system or organizational boundaries. As such XML is being increasingly used by businesses throughout the world. These businesses use XML as a means of storing, transmitting and (with the use of style sheets) displaying information.
The simple, well defined structure of XML does present some problems when it is used by businesses and similar organizations. As it is an open, plain text based standard care must be taken when looking at security. The use of plain text with verbose tags also results in XML documents that are far larger than other means of storing the same information.
This thesis focuses on the affect of the large size of XML when it is used to communicate across a network.

Organic Matter Inputs to Rivers under
Different Flow Conditions</field><field name="creator">Bowen, Patricia Margaret</field><field name="description">The timing and composition of organic matter (OM) inputs to rivers are important as
carbon plays a major role in river functioning. Management of Australian rivers since European
settlement has altered inputs of organic matter to these systems. Heterotrophic microbes play a
critical role in the transformation of OM in rivers, allowing transfer of carbon to other biota.
Alteration to the proportions of OM from different sources affects microbial functioning due to
differences in OM composition. Macrophytes can represent important sources of carbon to
rivers, however their inputs and in-stream processing are poorly understood. The aim of my
study was to examine inputs and microbial processing of macrophyte OM in Australian lowland
rivers under different flows.
Distributions of dominant macrophytes (Typha orientalis, Phragmites australis,
Vallisneria gigantea and Persicaria prostrata) were mapped in three lowland river reaches in
south eastern Australia. Integration with flow data in a GIS allowed the determination of
macrophyte inundation patterns under different flows. Resource allocation (biomass and
nutrients), live and dead shoot densities and litter production were monitored in the field over 18
months. DOM release from different macrophyte tissues was examined in the laboratory and
leachate composition was assessed using nutrient and spectral analyses. Responses of riverine
microbial communities to different OM sources were assessed from substrate-induced respiration
and enzyme activity experiments and field measurements of respiration and enzymatic responses
to varied OM inputs. Finally, all data were integrated into a model of microbial responses to
macrophyte OM inputs induced by different flows.
Large populations of macrophytes occurred at all three sites, at bed level, on in-channel
benches and on banks. Bank slope, channel heterogeneity and the vertical distribution of
macrophyte beds all affected macrophyte inundation patterns. Substantial differences in biomass
allocation, nutrient dynamics and litter composition were observed among different plant growth
forms and over time. While leaves represented the major shoot component in litter for all
species, stems and reproductive structures were also important in some species. Aside from the
litter pool, translocation to rhizomes represented a major sink for annual production in emergent
plants.
Patterns of shoot density and litter production over time varied among species, providing
a source of variation for particulate, and hence dissolved OM inputs upon inundation. The
majority of DOM release from POM occurred within 24 hours of inundation. Growth form,
tissue type (blade, stem, etc.) and status (live or dead) affected rates, quantities and composition
of DOM release, with implications for microbial utilisation. Both overall activity and patterns of
carbon utilisation in riverine microbes changed in response to altered OM inputs. Patterns of
microbial carbon use were shown to be specific to the carbon source which induced them.
Modelling showed that flow regulation had a major impact on OM inputs and microbial
metabolism, through the effects of flow variability on macrophyte vertical distributions,
macrophyte bed inundation and dilution. Positive relationships between discharge, DOM inputs
and microbial metabolism were observed at the most highly regulated site (drought &lt; current &lt; historic &lt; flood). While a similar pattern occurred at the less regulated site in terms of total
loading, dilution effects resulted in a reversal of this trend on a reach volume basis. Microbial
metabolism and DOM inputs were restricted to summer/autumn under regulated flows compared
to a greater emphasis on winter/spring inputs and microbial activity under unregulated flows.
Continual OM inputs during winter with pulsed inputs in spring under natural flows probably
benefit larger, slow-growing macro-invertebrates. River regulation promotes pulsed macrophyte
OM inputs during spring/summer, potentially favouring riverine microbial and zooplankton
production, although at lower levels due to the overall reduction in OM inputs.
The predictive model of macrophyte OM inputs and microbial responses developed
throughout this thesis represents a major step forward in our understanding of macrophytemicrobe
interactions and our ability to manage our river systems. This work has shown that flow
manipulation can be used to influence macrophyte organic matter inputs to rivers and microbial
responses, affecting whole stream metabolism and food web interactions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian lowland rivers</field><field name="subject">organic matter</field><field name="subject">macrophyte</field><field name="subject">carbon</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070802.104452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EMPLOYMENT AND POPULATION ADJUSTMENT IN RURAL AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Garnett, Anne Margaret</field><field name="description">Rural regions in Australia have been, and continue to be, distinguished by very different population and labour market characteristics than those of more urbanised areas. Since the 1980s, rural regions have been exposed to a range of economic events and policies which has impacted on the structure and composition of the population and the labour force. These changes include trade liberalisation and globalisation, deregulation, declining numbers of agricultural establishments, advances in technology, increases in productivity and changes in the levels of public and private provision of goods and services. In addition, in recent years, serious shortages of labour, particularly skilled labour, has emerged as a major issue facing rural regions.
However, there has been little economic research into rural labour markets relative to other labour markets, particularly since the 1980s. While there has been significant public discussion and political debate in recent years on the apparent changes experienced by rural regions, evidence regarding the nature, causes and impacts of these changes has often been anecdotal. For example, there is the popular notion of the &#65533;tree change&#65533; which refers to the idea that people are leaving metropolitan areas and moving to rural areas. Concurrently, there is also the significant discussion on the &#65533;rural downturn&#65533;, which refers to the belief that rural regions are declining in term of population and employment growth. Further, the agricultural sector has continued to be cited as the likely cause for downturns in rural population and employment growth rates in rural areas. However, again, there is a lack of economic research to substantiate these claims.
The aim of this thesis is to redress the lack of economic research and to provide a comprehensive analysis of rural labour markets and population in Australia since the 1980s. Analysis focuses on the changing structure and composition of rural labour markets and the impact of population shifts on rural localities. Evidence is provided on the extent to which two decades of significant structural, technological and regulatory change have impacted on rural labour markets in Australia. This then provides a sound basis for the policy discussion in this thesis on population and labour market changes in rural Australia and the causes and implications of these changes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural Australia</field><field name="subject">labour market</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">population changes.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070802.130527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antecedents to Attitude Change from School-based Mental Illness Education</field><field name="creator">Crisp, Dimity</field><field name="description">Although attitudes toward stigmatised groups are difficult to change, education programs and opportunities that promote direct contact with people who have experienced mental illness have demonstrated success in increasing mental health literacy and reducing stigma surrounding mental illness. The present study examined the effectiveness of a mental illness education program directed at adolescents and the factors influencing its impact. A sample of 694 students (251 males, 443 females), aged between 11 and 19 years, across 13 public and private high schools and colleges throughout the ACT was obtained. Students completed self-report questionnaires relating to stigma, mental health knowledge and help-seeking intentions before and after participating in the education program and their results were compared with a control group. Students participating in the program also completed measures of empathic concern and affect immediately following the program. Results indicated the program was effective in decreasing stigma and increasing knowledge and intentions to seek help. The impact of knowledge, empathy, affect, and similarity to program presenters, on program outcomes was also examined.

poorly understood, greatly hindering the ability of researchers and managers to address
declines in fish assemblages. Recent insights gained from landscape ecology suggest
that small, uni-scalar approaches are unlikely to effectively determine those factors that
influence riverine structure and function and mediate fish-habitat associations. There
appears to be merit in using multiple-scale designs built upon a geomorphologically-derived
hierarchy to bridge small, intermediate and large spatial scales in large rivers.
This thesis employs a hierarchical design encompassing functional process zones
(referred to hereafter as zones), reaches and mesohabitats to investigate fish-habitat
associations as well as explore patterns of in-channel habitat structure in one of
Australia's largest dryland river systems; the Barwon-Darling River.
In this thesis, empirical evidence is presented showing that large dryland rivers are
inherently complex in structure and different facets of existing conceptual models of
landscape ecology must be refined when applied to these systems. In-channel habitat
and fish exist within a hierarchical arrangement of spatial scales in the riverscape,
displaying properties of discontinuities, longitudinal patterns and patch mosaics. During
low flows that predominate for the majority of time in the Barwon-Darling River there
is a significant difference in fish assemblage composition among mesohabitats. There is
a strong association between large wood and golden perch, Murray cod and carp, but
only a weak association with bony herring. Golden perch and Murray cod are large
wood specialists, whereas carp are more general in there use of mesohabitats. Bony
herring are strongly associated with smooth and irregular banks but are ubiquitous in
most mesohabitats. Open water (mid-channel and deep pool) mesohabitats are
characterised by relatively low abundances of all species and a particularly weak
association with golden perch, Murray cod and carp. Murray cod are weakly associated
with matted bank, whereas carp and bony herring associate with this mesohabitat patch
in low abundance.
Nocturnal sampling provided useful information on size-related use of habitat that was
not evident from day sampling. Both bony herring and carp exhibited a variety of
habitat use patterns throughout the die1 period and throughout their lifetime, with
temporal partitioning of habitat use by juvenile bony herring and carp evident. Much of
the strong association between bony herring and smooth and irregular banks was due to
the abundance of juveniles (&amp;lt100mm in length) in these mesohabitats. Adult bony
herring (&amp;gt100mm length) occupied large wood more than smooth and irregular banks.
At night, juvenile bony herring were not captured, suggesting the use of deeper water
habitats. Adult bony herring were captured at night and occupjed large wood, smooth
bank and irregular bank. Juvenile carp (&amp;lt200mm length) were more abundant at night
and aggregated in smooth and irregular banks more than any other mesohabitat patch.
Adult carp (&amp;gt200mm length) occupied large wood during both day and night.
There is a downstream pattern of change in the fish assemblage among river zones, with
reaches in Zone 2 containing a larger proportion of introduced species (carp and
goldfish) because of a significantly lower abundance of native species (bony herring,
golden perch and Murray cod) than all other zones. In comparison, the fish assemblage
of Zone 3 was characterised by a comparatively higher abundance of the native species
bony herring, golden perch and Murray cod. A significant proportion of the amongreach
variability in fish assemblage composition was explained at the zone scale,
suggesting that geomorphological influences may impose some degree of top-down
constraint over fish assemblage distribution. Although mesohabitat composition among
reaches in the Barwon-Darling River also changed throughout the study area, this
pattern explained very little of the large-scale distribution of the fish assemblage, with
most of the variability in assemblage distribution remaining unexplained. Therefore,
although mesohabitat patches strongly influence the distribution of species within
reaches, they explain very little of assemblage composition at intermediate zone and
larger river scales. These findings suggest that small scale mesohabitat rehabilitation
projects within reaches are unlikely to produce measurable benefits for the fish
assemblage over intermediate and large spatial scales in the Barwon-Darling River. This
indicates the importance taking a holistic approach to river rehabilitation that correctly
identifies and targets limiting processes at the correct scales.
The variable nature of flow-pulse dynamics in the Barwon-Darling River creates a
shifting habitat mosaic that serves to maintain an ever-changing arrangement of habitat
patches. The inundation dynamics of large wood habitat described in this thesis
highlights the fragmented nature of mesohabitat patches, with the largest proportion of
total in-channel large wood remaining unavailable to fish for the majority of the time.
At low flows there is a mosaic of large wood habitat and with increasing discharge more
potential large wood habitat becomes available and does so in a complex spatial
manner. What results in this dryland river is a dynamic pattern of spatio-temporal
patchiness in large wood habitat availability that is seen both longitudinally among
different river zones and vertically among different heights in the river channel. Water
resource development impacts on this shifting habitat mosaic.
Projects undertaking both fish habitat assessment and rehabilitation need to carefully
consider spatial scale since the drivers of fish assemblage structure can occur at scales
well beyond that of the reach. Fish-habitat associations occurring at small spatial scales
can become decoupled by process occurring across large spatial scales, making
responses in the fish assemblage hard to predict. As rivers become increasingly
channelised, there is an urgent need to apply research such as that conducted in this
thesis to better understand the role that in-channel habitats play in supporting fish and
other ecosystem processes. Habitat rehabilitation projects need to be refined to consider
the appropriate scales at which fish assemblages associate with habitat. Failure to do so
risks wasting resources and forgoes valuable opportunities for addressing declines in
native fish populations. Adopting multi-scalar approaches to understanding ecological
processes in aquatic ecosystems, as developed in this thesis, should be a priority of
research and management. To do so will enable more effective determination of those
factors that influence riverine structure and function at the approariate scale.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">dryland river system</field><field name="subject">Barwon-Darling River</field><field name="subject">fish habitat assessment</field><field name="subject">mesohabitat</field><field name="subject">river habitat survey</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070807.112943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population Dynamics of Eastern Grey Kangaroos
in Temperate Grasslands</field><field name="creator">Fletcher, Donald Bryden</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the dynamics of eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) populations
and their food supplies in temperate grasslands of south-eastern Australia. It is based on the
study of three populations of eastern grey kangaroos inhabiting &#65533;warm dry&#65533;, &#65533;cold dry&#65533;, and
&#65533;warm wet&#65533; sites within the Southern Tablelands climatic region. After a pilot survey and
methods trial in early 2001, the main period of study was from August 2001 to July 2003.
The study populations were found to have the highest densities of any kangaroo populations,
450 to 510 km-2. Their density was the same at the end of the two year study period as at the
beginning, in spite of a strong decline in herbage availability due to drought. The eastern grey
kangaroo populations were limited according to the predation-sensitive food hypothesis.
Fecundity, as the observed proportion of females with late pouch young in spring, was high,
in spite of the high kangaroo density and restricted food availability. Age-specific fecundity
of a kangaroo sample shot on one of the sites in 1997 to avert starvation was the highest
reported for kangaroos. Thus, limitation acted through mortality rather than fecundity.
Population growth rate was most sensitive to adult survival but the demographic rate that had
the greatest effect in practice was mortality of juveniles, most likely sub-adults. The
combination of high fecundity with high mortality of immatures would provide resilience to
low levels of imposed mortality and to fertility control.
The normal pattern of spring pasture growth was not observed in the drought conditions and
few of the recorded increments of growth were of the magnitude considered typical for sites
on the southern and central tablelands. Temperature was necessary to predict pasture growth,
as well as rainfall, over the previous two months. The best model of pasture growth (lowest
AICc) included negative terms for herbage mass, rainfall over the previous two months, and
temperature, and a positive term for the interaction between rainfall and temperature. It
accounted for 13% more of the variation in the data than did the simpler model of the type
used by Robertson (1987a), Caughley (1987) and Choquenot et al. (1998). However this was
only 63% of total variation. Re-evaluation of the model based on measurements of pasture
growth in more typical (non-drought) conditions is recommended. Grazing had a powerful
influence on the biomass of pasture due to the high density of kangaroos. This is a marked
difference to many other studies of the type which have been conducted in semi-arid
environments where rainfall dominates.
The offtake of pasture by kangaroos, as estimated on the research sites by the cage method,
was linear on herbage mass. It was of greater magnitude than the more exact estimate of the
(curved) functional response from grazedowns in high&#65533;quality and low&#65533;quality pastures.
The widespread recognition of three forms of functional response is inadequate. Both the
theoretical basis, and supporting data, have been published for domed, inaccessible residue,
and power forms as well (Holling 1966; Noy-Meir 1975; Hassell et al. 1976, 1977; Short
1986; Sabelis 1992). Eastern grey kangaroos had approximately the same Type 2 functional
response when consuming either a high quality artificial pasture (Phalaris aquatica), or dry
native pasture (Themeda australis) in autumn. Their functional response rose more gradually
than those published for red kangaroos and western grey kangaroos in the semi-arid
rangelands, and did not satiate at the levels of pasture available. This gradual behaviour of
the functional response contributes to continuous stability of the consumer-resource system,
as opposed to discontinuous stability.
The numerical response was estimated using the ratio equation, assuming an intrinsic rate of
increase for eastern grey kangaroos in temperate grasslands of 0.55. There is indirect
evidence of effects of predation in the dynamics of the kangaroo populations. This is
demonstrated by the positive relationship between r and kangaroo density. Such a
relationship can be generated by predation. A desirable future task is to compile estimates of
population growth rate and simultaneous estimates of pasture, in the absence of predation,
where kangaroo population density is changing, so that the numerical response can be
estimated empirically.
The management implications arising from this study are numerous and a full account would
require a separate report. As one example, kangaroos in these temperate grasslands are on
average smaller, eat less, are more numerous, and are more fecund, than would be predicted
from other studies (e.g. Caughley et al. 1987). Thus the benefit of shooting each kangaroo, in
terms of grass production, is less, or, in other words, more kangaroos have to be shot to
achieve a certain level of impact reduction, and the population will recover more quickly, than
would have been predicted prior to this study.
Secondly, of much importance to managers, the interactive model which can readily be
assembled from the products of Chapters 4, 5 and 8, can be used to test a range of
management options, and the effect of variation in weather conditions, such as increased or
decreased rainfall. For example, the model indicates that commercial harvesting (currently
under trial in the region), at the maximum level allowed, results in a sustainable harvest of
kangaroos, but does not increase the herbage mass, and only slightly reduces the frequency of
crashes when herbage mass falls to low levels. (To demonstrate this with an ecological
experiment would require an extremely large investment of research effort.) However, an
alternative &#65533;national park damage mitigation&#65533; formula, which holds kangaroo density to about
1 ha-1, is predicted to increase herbage mass considerably and to reduce the frequency of
crashes in herbage mass, but these effects would be achieved at the cost of having to shoot
large numbers of kangaroos. Thus, aside from many specific details of kangaroo ecology, the
knowledge gained in this study appears to have useful potential to illustrate to managers the
dynamic properties of a resource-consumer system, the probabilistic nature of management
outcomes, and the consequences of particular kangaroo management proposals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eastern grey kangaroo</field><field name="subject">food supply</field><field name="subject">pasture sampling</field><field name="subject">kangaroo population</field><field name="subject">predators</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070808.152438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governmental Information
&amp; Communications Technology
Outsourcing Since 1996 to 2000:
A Risk Profiling Model</field><field name="creator">Martin, Anthony Phillip</field><field name="description">In 1996 the Howard Government came to power in Australia. At that point in time
the commonwealth budget was in significant deficit, the economy was weak and there
was significant commonwealth debt. To address these issues the Howard
Government moved to implement several cost savings and income generating projects
began under the outgoing ALP government. In addition, part of the Howard reforms
was the move toward the private side in the public / private mix in the delivery of
government services.
One of the high profile and significant projects was the outsourcing of the
commonwealth public sector Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
delivery. It was called the IT Initiative and was managed by the Minister for Finance,
the Honourable Mr Fahey. Mr Fahey had earlier attempted significant outsourcing
projects whilst in NSW government; at one time Mr Fahey was NSW Premier. The
intent of the IT Initiative as policy was to achieve better and more cost effective ICT
services for the commonwealth.
This research reviews the efficacy of the IT Initiative. Under the Westminster system,
governments can implement government policy as approved by the parliament.
However not all policy is reviewed by the parliament. In this case the IT Initiative
was part of the Howard pre-election policy and therefore was considered 'mandated'
by the electorate. Irrespective of this approval, was the IT Initiative supported by the
research at the time and did the IT Initiative and its implementation make sound
business sense when compared to the research and models and in particular
effectiveness, efficiency and economy.
This thesis will review the IT Initiative using both static and dynamic models using
Transaction Based Economics (TCE). Both models will support the view that the IT
Initiative as practiced was a relatively high risk strategy. The thesis will utilise TCE
and risk management to develop a risk profiling model for ICT with effectiveness,
efficiency, economy as the three dimensions. Finally, the risk-profiling model, while
based on earlier modelling, provides a new insight into the issue of centralising versus
decentralising of government operations especially as these approaches relate to novel
technological applications across various departments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IT</field><field name="subject">Information Management Initiative</field><field name="subject">Australian government</field><field name="subject">public service</field><field name="subject">outsourcing</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070809.121919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi Agents for Heterogeneous Operating
System Environments</field><field name="creator">Mathur, Abhishek</field><field name="description">As IT industries develop, upgrade and diversify, heterogeneous operating
environments running a mix of new and legacy systems become increasingly
important. Such environments are currently inadequate due to lack of compatibility
with each other. This thesis investigates how agents can be utilised to facilitate
such heterogeneous environments, aiding enterprise systems in building bridges
between incompatible software and hardware systems. An autonomous agent has
independent agency and decision-making astuteness. When placed in
heterogeneous environments to interact with other such agents, the consequences of
its action and its preferred choice of actions are greatly influenced by actions of
other agents interacting in heterogeneous environments.
The main objectives of this thesis include examining the roles of agents in
heterogeneous operating environments, development of a novel multi agent base
architecture and an associated framework for single and heterogeneous
environment. The research work also studies the plausible application to test the
developed proof of concept by developing application and using the framework
that utilises Windows services in a totally incompatible Solaris based Sun Ray ultra
thin client environment.
The work includes a novel method of modeling agent based communication
architecture suitable for correspondence between two inherently different operating
systems - Solaris and Microsoft Windows. The circumstances in which
coordination or coordination failure occurs between these systems are investigated.
The proposed method of agent based communication that can potentially overcome
the barriers formed by two completely different software and hardware
architectural regimes.
An analysis of printing services in MS Windows and Solaris environments, review
the age long problem of lack of device drivers for commonly (and cheaply)
available Ink Jet printers for Unix (and like) operating systems. A novel method is
proposed that uses agents in heterogeneous environment to overcome this problem.
A new architecture that utilises Windows based printing services on a Sun Ray
ultra thin client is presented to test and evaluate the proof of concept.
This thesis is motivated by the need to provide a low cost printing solution to Sun
Ray users. Most Windows based desktop users currently have access to variety of
low cost printing solutions. Printer vendors ship device drivers only for Windows
or at most Macintosh, as other operating systems such as Solaris, MVS, z/OS are
used for corporate solutions and low cost desktop printing have not been a major

Standards-Based Curriculum in the Thai School System</field><field name="creator">Kulsiri, Supanit</field><field name="description">The status of English language has increased over the years as a tool for international
communication. The Thai government emphasises that English language education
has now become part of the full driving force for national development. This research
implies that in order to cultivate Thai learners of English to meet social demands,
sound theoretical and coherent philosophical bases of curriculum are essential in the
curriculum planning process. This research analyses the new official English language
curriculum for the Thai school system: "English language learning strands and
standards under Basic Education curriculum 2001" (English language standards-based
curriculum, ESB Curriculum), which in 2001 was promulgated as the new official
English language curriculum. This research reveals both the coherence and
incoherence of the theoretical and philosophical bases of the Thai ESB curriculum,
identifies strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum and makes recommendations
for curriculum revision and curriculum development that could result in positive and
effective changes in English language teaching and learning in Thailand. This thesis
rests on the premise that principles underlying decisions made in curriculum planning
will have a major impact on the effectiveness of the curriculum. It follows that
difficulties with foreign language education nowadays are a consequence of the
incoherence of philosophical, theoretical, and social bases of curriculum design.
This research analyses the English language curriculum by asking questions about
who was involved in the curriculum planning process and what were the decisionmaking
mechanism and processes involved in its planning. The research is different
from other research in curriculum studies in Thailand that aim only at curriculum
implementation and evaluation. Three sources of data have contributed to the analysis
of the curriculum: curriculum-related documents, interviews with the curriculum
committees, and interviews and questionnaires with school teachers.
The analysis has shown that (1) the curriculum was developed with input from
numerous experts and various groups of stakeholders which affected the underlying
principles, philosophical and theoretical bases of education and English language
teaching and learning; (2) the theoretical and philosophical bases of the curriculum
were found to be incoherent among curriculum elements; (3) the curriculum has
problems at the level of meaning and this has led to the difficulty of conveying the
philosophy of Thai education to the school level. The study has found that the
incoherence of the theoretical underpinnings of the curriculum elements leads to
misunderstanding, misinterpretation and misuse of the curriculum.
The implication for future research is to stress a critical literacy approach to English
language education and curriculum development. In this way, English language is
seen as a language for empowerment, knowledge enhancement, social development
and development of learners as a part of Globalisation and Information Age in the 2 lst
Century as also stated in the Thai National Education Act 1999.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">primary education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070813.123324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The MDOT Study:
Prevalence of Menstrual Disorder of Teenagers;
exploring typical menstruation, menstrual pain
(dysmenorrhoea), symptoms, PMS and endometriosis</field><field name="creator">Parker, Melissa</field><field name="description">There are few data available about the menstrual patterns of Australian teenagers and
the prevalence of menstrual disorder in this age group.
Aims
To establish the typical experience of menstruation in a sample of 16-18 year
old women attending ACT Secondary Colleges of Education.
To determine the number of teenagers experiencing menstrual disorder that
could require further investigation and management.
Method
The MDOT questionnaire was used to survey participants about their usual pattern of
menstruation, signs and symptoms experienced with menses and how menstruation
affected various aspects of their lives including school attendance, completion of
school work, relationships, social, sexual and physical activity. Data analysis included
exploration of aggregated data, as well as individual scrutiny of each questionnaire to
determine menstrual disturbance requiring follow up. Those participants whose
questionnaire indicated a requirement for further investigation, and who consented to
being contacted, were followed up through an MDOT Clinic.
Results
One thousand and fifty one (1,05 1) completed questionnaires - 98% response rate.
The typical experience of menstruation in the MDOT sample includes: bleeding
patterns within normal parameters for this age group; menstrual pain, 94%; cramping
pain, 71 %; symptoms associated with menstruation, 98.4%; PMS symptoms, 96%;
mood disturbance before or during periods, 73%; school absence related to
menstruation, 26%; high menstrual interference on one or more life activity, 55.8%;
asymptomatic menstruation, 1 %; True response to 'My periods seem pretty normal'
7 1.4%.
Statistically significant associations were found between each and all of: menstrual
pain, symptoms, interference on life activities and school absence. The prevalence of
significant menstrual disturbance in the sample is approximately 25% where: 2 1 %
experienced severe pain; 26% reported school absence; 33% had seen a GP about
periods; 26.9% think there is something wrong with periods; 23.5% require follow up
based on individual scrutiny of each questionnaire; 10- 14% require further
investigation to rule out endometriosis. Referral and investigation of menstrual pain,
symptoms, and diagnosis of menstrual pathology in the sample was low.
Conclusion
The MDOT questionnaire has helped to establish a clearer picture of typical
menstruation in the population sample. Where 1% of girls reported having
asymptomatic menstruation, the majority of teenagers in the study reported menstrual
pain and symptoms that could be experienced as part of the dysmenorrhoeic syndrome
of symptoms, PMS, or underlying pathology such as endometriosis. Due to the
overlap in symptoms and a propensity to be dismissive of menstrual pain and
symptoms, many girls are suffering menstrual morbidities that could be well managed
with NSAIDs and the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) if non-pathological, or
investigated further if a menstrual pathology is suspected.
Considering these results the reported school absence rate of 26% is not surprising.
Whilst this study does not cost the true impact of menstrual disturbance on schooling,
the results of the MDOT questionnaire reflect significant physical and emotional
impact on a considerable number of teenager's lives which could also have
repercussions on education, schooling performance and other areas of their lives.
Future research is planned to determine the MDOT questionnaire's validity for
identifying pathological menstrual disorder so it can act as a screening tool to
facilitate earlier detection. Replication of the MDOT study should be done in younger
teenagers (from menarche) to determine menstrual disturbance in the younger age
group.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">menstrual pain</field><field name="subject">dysmenorrhoea</field><field name="subject">PMS</field><field name="subject">menstrual disorder</field><field name="subject">endometriosis</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070813.161519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A COMPARATIVE CASE STUDY OF KNOWLEDGE
SUPPLY AND ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS</field><field name="creator">Burton-Jones, John Alan</field><field name="description">It has been widely observed that economic activities are increasingly dependent on
intangible, knowledge-based resources (Hayek, 1945; Drucker, 1966; Bell, 1973;
Brinkley, 2006). One result of the move to a knowledge economy is that traditional
notions of work and human resources have broken down and organizations have adopted
new methods of sourcing knowledge. This thesis addresses the question of how
organizations can optimally determine their requirements for knowledge from within and
outside their boundaries. The objective of the thesis is to develop a theory of
organizational knowledge supply and to test the theory in explaining and predicting the
effectiveness of an organization's knowledge sourcing strategies. The research question
driving this thesis therefore is: &amp;quoteCan knowledge-based theory of the firm explain the
relationship between organizations' mix of internal and external human resources and
organizational effectiveness?&amp;quote
The aim of this thesis is to contribute to human resources and organizational theory
through its theoretical model and empirical evidence of the relationship between
knowledge sourcing and organizational effectiveness. The thesis also aims to contribute
to practice by informing organizations about the effectiveness of different human
sourcing practices.
Knowledge-based theory of the firm and contingency theory were used to develop an
initial theoretical model of fit and effectiveness. To extend existing theoretical models,
and to support the case study, the initial theoretical model was refined so that it not only
included fit and effectiveness (as in past research), but it also posited a model of the
intervening process by which fit leads to effectiveness.
To test the posited theoretical model, a comparative case study was commenced in mid-
2004, in two 4.5 star inner city hotels in Australia, each a member of a different hotel
group. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used, with semi-structured
interviews and questionnaires as the key data collection methods. The main data
collection process was completed in April 2005.
The findings from the study generally support the theoretical model. The case study
however also revealed that much of the effect of the fit of human capital on
organizational effectiveness was constrained and enabled by two other organizational
resources (hotel systems and processes, and the hotel brand standard). This finding
suggests that existing theoretical models that suggest an independent effect of human
capital fit on performance may be incomplete.
In summary the thesis research question was answered with a conditional affirmative. In
other words, knowledge-based theory can explain the relationship between organizations'
mix of internal and external human resources and organizational effectiveness, but
existing knowledgehuman capital-based models of this relationship can be extended and
thus improved in two ways:
1) By positing a model of the intervening process by which human capital fit leads to
organizational effectiveness.
2) By positing a model of the degree to which the effect of human capital fit on
organizational effectiveness depends on other organizational resources.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledgement management</field><field name="subject">human capital</field><field name="subject">hotel industry</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070814.114351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medical Outcome Prediction:
A Hybrid Artificial Neural Networks Approach</field><field name="creator">Shadabi, Fariba</field><field name="description">This thesis advances the understanding of the application of artificial neural networks
ensemble to clinical data by addressing the following fundamental question: What is the
potentiality of an ensemble of neural networks models as a filter and classifier in a
complex clinical situation?
A novel neural networks ensemble classification model called Rules and
Information Driven by Consistency in Artificial Neural Networks Ensemble (RIDCANNE)
is developed for the purpose of prediction of medical outcomes or events, such
as kidney transplants. The proposed classification model is based on combination of
initial data preparations, preliminary classification by ensembles of Neural Networks,
and generation of new training data based on criteria of highly accuracy and model
agreement. Furthermore, it can also generate decision tree classification models to
provide classification of data and the prediction results. The case studies described in
this thesis are from a kidney transplant database and two well-known collections of
benchmark data known as the Pima Indian Diabetes and Wisconsin Cancer datasets. An
implication of this study is that further attention needs to be given to both data
collection and preparation stages. This study revealed that even neural network
ensemble models that are known for their strong generalization ability might not be able
to provide a high level of accuracy for complex, noisy and incomplete clinical data.
However, by using a selective subset of data points, it is possible to improve the overall
accuracy.
In summary, the research conducted for this thesis advances the current clinical
data preparation and classification techniques in which the task is to extract patterns that
contain higher information content from a sea of noisy and incomplete clinical data, and
build accurate and transparent classifiers. The RIDC-ANNE approach improves an
analyst&#65533;s ability to better understand the data. Furthermore, it shows great promise for
use in clinical decision making systems. It can provide us with a valuable data mining
tool with great research and commercial potential.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">Rules and Information Driven by Consistency in Artificial Neural Networks Ensemble (RIDCANNE)</field><field name="subject">KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS</field><field name="subject">MEDICAL DECISION MAKING</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070816.130444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing Technical Advice for Regulation:
The Case of Petroleum Exploration and Production</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Paul Edwin</field><field name="description">Governments, the community and industry expect public policy to be implemented
effectively and efficiently, particularly when that policy and regulation affects the
economic well being and environmental values of the nation. The offshore petroleum
exploration and production industry is a case where public policy and regulation are
attracting national focus through discussions on the timing of world peak oil production
and the future of national and global oil and gas production. An overseas history of
famous environmental disasters associated with petroleum exploration and production
and transportation also ensures a specific focus on the environmental regulation of the
industry.
This study elaborates the history and characteristics of the offshore petroleum E&amp;Pindustries in Australia and the US, and the systems and processes used to provide
technical advice that informs and advises the regulation of those industries. The study
then analyses the management of technical advice for government regulation of the
offshore petroleum exploration and production (E&amp;P) industry in Australia using the US
equivalent as benchmark. Further, the analysis develops a model that incorporates
strategic and operational elements of such advice. Strategic elements include openness,
transparency and accountability, and operational elements include use of expertise,
timeliness and peer communication.
The study illustrates the relative challenges to providing technical advice under
Australia&#65533;s Westminister form of government which can be less open, transparent and
accountable when compared to the US Congressional form of government. The study
also shows the greater use of expertise and peer communication associated with the more
extensive petroleum research effort in the US, reflecting the greater age and size of its
petroleum industry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Petroleum Exploration and Production</field><field name="subject">oil</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">technical advice</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070820.123307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Knowledge Based System for Diagnosis of Lung Diseases from Chest X-Ray
Images</field><field name="creator">Al-Kabir, Zul  Waker Mohammad</field><field name="description">The thesis develops a model (that includes a conceptual framework and an
implementation) for analysing and classifying traditional X-ray images (MACXI)
according to the severity of diseases as a Computer-Aided-Diagnosis tool with three
initial objectives.
&#65533; The first objective was to interpret X-ray images by transferring expert knowledge
into a knowledge base (CXKB): to help medical staff to concentrate only on the
interest areas of the images.
&#65533; The second objective was to analyse and classify X-ray images according to the
severity of diseases through the knowledge base equipped with an image
processor (CXIP).
&#65533; The third objective was to demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of several
image-processing techniques for analysing traditional chest X-ray images.
A database was formed based on collection of expert diagnosis details for lung images.
Five important features from lung images, as well as diagnosis rules were identified and
simplified. The expert knowledge was transformed into a Knowledge base (KB) for
analysing and classifying traditional X-ray images according to the severity of diseases
(CXKB). Finally, an image processor named CXIP was developed to extract the features
of lung images features and image classification.
CXKB contains 63 distinct lung diseases with detailed descriptions. Some 80-chest X-ray
images with diagnosis details were collected for the database from different sources,
including online medical resources. A total of 61 images were used to determine the
important features; 19 chest X-ray images were not used because of low visibility or the
difficulty of diagnosis. Finally, only 12 images were selected after examining the
diagnosis details, image clarity, image completeness, and image orientation. The most
important features of lung diseases are a pattern of lesions with different levels of
intensity or brightness. The other major anatomical structures of the chest are the hilum
area, the rib area, the trachea area, and the heart area.
Seven different severity levels of diseases were determined. Development and
simplification of rules based on the image library were analysed, developed, and tested
against the 12 images. A level of severity was labelled for each image based on a
personal understanding of all the image and diagnosis details. Then, MACXI processed
the selected 12 images to determine the level of severity. These 12 images were fed into
the CXIP for recognition of the features and classification of the images to an accurate
level of severity. Currently, the processor has the ability to identify diseased lung areas
with approximately 80% success rate.
A step by step demonstration of several image processing techniques that were used to
build the processor is given to highlight the effectiveness and limitations of the
techniques for analysing traditional chest X-ray images is also presented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">xray</field><field name="subject">x-ray</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="subject">Computer Aided Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">image-processing</field><field name="subject">CXIP</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070823.160921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PUBLIC POLICY.

In particular the thesis examines the difficulties of mergers attempted in the case of Monash University (a successful amalgamation), the University of New England (a partially successful amalgamation), and the Australian National University (an amalgamation which never took place). The thesis argues that the best available model of policy implementation in the tertiary education sector is that set out by Cerych and Sabatier (1986), and that even this is less than adequate through its omission of several relevant factors, notably the factor of leadership. The thesis accordingly presents a modification of the Cerych and Sabatier (1986) model as well as suggestions for inclusion of factors omitted in the broader implementation literature.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">mergers</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20071005.123202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Documentary Transforms into Video Installation via the Processes of Intertextuality and Detournement</field><field name="creator">de Berigny Wall  (onacloV), Caitilin</field><field name="description">My argument is that documentary texts can be transformed into artworks via the
processes of intertextuality and detournement, when they are exhibited as video
installations. I argue that early 1920s modernist avant-garde painter-filmmakers
shared with contemporary documentary video installation painter-filmmakers
particular tendencies, characteristics and interests. The bodies of work in each period
explore the generic properties of documentary through (primarily) abstract visual
associations, rather than through a conventional linear space.
Important 1920s modernist avant-garde films by Dziga Vertov, Luis Bunuel, Salvador
Dali, Joris Ivens, Man Ray and others will be considered in highlighting the
relationship between documentary and avant-garde cinema. I use this discussion as a
basis for examining my own work: for the creative component of this thesis, I filmed
and edited a three screen video installation. I interviewed 67 Australian Muslims and
used these interviews to explore the use of documentary in video installation.
The theoretical framework I used is based on the following: Julia Kristeva?s notion of
intertextuality, derived from Mikhail Bahktin?s work on dialogism, to interpret how
documentary texts take on conventions appropriate to other genres; Guy Debord?s
concept of d&#40239;urnement to provide a theory for the reuse of pre-existing artistic
elements found in documentary film; genre theory to interpret interactions between
documentary texts; Ludwig Wittgenstein?s notion of ?family resemblance? to explore
the indistinct boundaries of documentary; and Pascal Beausse?s analysis of how artists
have hijacked documentary. I also draw on Bill Nichols?s analytical framework of
documentary modes (poetic, expository, observational, participatory, performative,
reflexive) to explore documentary in cinema and installation art.
The documentary genre is not habitually discussed outside film, television,
photography or the web. My research demonstrates that the genre has found its place
in other areas of artistic practice and can also apply to medium of video installation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">documentary</field><field name="subject">video installation</field><field name="subject">Avant-garde</field><field name="subject">intertextuality</field><field name="subject">detournement. onacloV</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20071017.094719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'For the sake of our customers': A case study of the links between Coordination, Communication and TQM</field><field name="creator">Srismith, Karinrat</field><field name="description">This study is a qualitative case study approach to theory building that aims to develop
a more holistic understanding of the patterns of coordination in an organisation that
has successfully implemented TQM using a communication perspective. The data
were gathered at a large private hospital in Bangkok where 36 respondents from nonmedical
treatment areas were interviewed. The study used in-depth interviews as the
primary data source, complemented with participant-observations and document
analysis to address the main research question: In what ways have the effects of TQM
on communicative attitudes and practices contributed to coordination?
Influenced by the notion of social construction, the analysis suggests that despite
TQM consisting of several contributing principles and tools, it is the role of leadership
that demonstrated the most significant value to communication and coordination
outcomes. Three key patterns of coordination emerge in the study: (1) shared meaning
and common purpose derived from management?s interpretation and articulation of
TQM reality from a customer perspective, (2) shared understanding as a result of
management?s construction of TQM influenced administrative arrangements, and (3)
emotional experiences as a result of staff members? social interaction. The finding of
this study suggests that achieving coordination is far more complex, and can be
difficult to control by management, specifically one emerging from an emotional
experience which was found to have more effect on staff members? decisions in
investing or reserving their energy in coordination, as compared to the other two
patterns.
The findings demonstrate that organising coordination is not always rational and
static, as previously discussed in the dominant organisation design-based literature.
Rather, coordination is highly dependent on the process of social construction,
communication, and interaction between organisational members. For this reason, the
role of management in ensuring consistency in interpretation and construction of the
shared reality, and in ongoing communication is imperative, not only to guide and
maintain coordinated actions, but also to achieve meaningful and mindful
coordination of members within the organisation.
The practical theory developed in the study makes a direct contribution to
coordination theory, specifically on the emergence of multi-dimensional coordination
patterns which suggests the need to reconsider a research approach that could
accommodate the complex nature of coordination which is also driven by
communication, social interaction, and reciprocal relationships. Future studies on
coordination could be positioned within a relativist, constructionism or interpretivist
paradigm and investigate interrelated multiple ontological domains, not only the
conventional organisational structure, but also cognition, discursive and social
interaction. The study also offers some useful insights into both coordination and
communication aspects for practitioners who aim to successfully implement TQM.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">Total quality management</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">coordination</field><field name="subject">Bangkok</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080226.141311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ross River Virus Infection: Disease
Mechanisms and Potential Treatment</field><field name="creator">Rulli, Nestor Ezequiel</field><field name="description">Ross River virus (RRV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus and the aetiological agent of
epidemic polyarthritis (EPA). Arthropod borne-Alphaviruses that are related to RRV,
such as Chikungunya virus, Sindbis virus and Barmah Forest virus, are usually
associated with epidemics of infectious arthritides in different parts of the world. In
humans, RRV-induced disease symptoms include fever, rash, myalgia and pain and
stiffness of the joints. Muscle and joint pain are the most debilitating symptoms in RRV
patients and the best treatment available is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAID). Previous studies in mice have demonstrated that RRV infection results in
inflammation of skeletal muscle and joints and that macrophages play a primary role in
disease.
The present study was carried out to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms
mediating RRV-induced muscle and joint pathology. Previous studies have reported
that encephalitic alphaviruses trigger apoptosis of brain cells in mice and that blocking
apoptosis reduces mortality rates. In the present study, the ability of RRV to induce
muscle apoptosis was investigated in vitro, using a murine myoblast cell line (C1C12),
and in vivo, using a mouse model of RRV disease. RRV-infected C1C12 myofibres
displayed an array of morphological and biochemical makers of apoptosis. Apoptosis
was also observed in the skeletal muscle of RRV-infected C57BL/6J mice. Blocking
apoptosis by general caspase inhibition resulted in milder disease symptoms, reduced
myofibre damage and decreased inflammation of muscle and joint tissues. The total
number of cell infiltrates as well as the number of macrophages infiltrating muscle was
significantly reduced by the treatment with a caspase inhibitor.
The effects of RRV infection on the skeletal system were also investigated. Primary
human osteoblast cells were infected with RRV and monitored for viral-induced
cytopathic effect. Osteoblasts supported rapid virus growth and, by 48 hours after
infection, succumbed to viral-induced necrosis. In addition, histological examination of
bone tissue from RRV-infected C57BL/6J mice showed clear evidence of bone
resorption. Tibias from infected mice showed an increased number of activated
osteoclasts, a reduction in bone density and thinning of cortical bone.
The expression of host factors involved in inflammatory responses and bone
remodelling was studied in RRV-infected myofibres and osteoblast cell cultures and in
the muscle and joint tissues from infected mice. RRV-infected muscle cells and tissue
showed elevated mRNA levels for the chemokines CCL-2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL1,
all of which are known to mediate the migration of monocytic cells. With the exception
of CXCL1, these chemokines were also found to be up-regulated in RRV-infected
osteoblast cultures and in joint tissues from infected mice. Muscle and joint tissue from
infected mice also showed elevated mRNA levels for type I and type II interferons,
TNF- and NOS2. In addition, joint tissues from infected animals contained high levels
of IL-6 and IL-1, two cytokines known to mediate bone remodelling.
Finally, the therapeutic potential of the drug bindarit was investigated using the mouse
model of RRV disease. Bindarit is a known inhibitor of CCL-2 and TNF- and has
been found to prevent protein denaturation. Treatment with bindarit resulted in mice
developing milder disease symptoms, reduced muscle damage and decreased
inflammation of muscle and joint tissues. In particular, bindarit significantly reduced
macrophage infiltration into skeletal muscle tissue.
This thesis has contributed to the understanding of RRV pathogenesis. It has identified
novel mechanisms of RRV-induced muscle and bone pathology and provided further
evidence that associate pro-inflammatory host factors to RRV disease. This work has
also demonstrated that bindarit should be considered as a candidate for treating RRV
disease in humans.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ross River Virus</field><field name="subject">Infectious disease</field><field name="subject">mosquito</field><field name="subject">alphavirus</field><field name="subject">polyarthriris</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080227.091948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australia's policy approach to Foreign Direct Investment
1968-2004 as a case study in globalisation, national public
policy and public administration</field><field name="creator">Sadleir, Christopher John</field><field name="description">Since the latter half of the twentieth century patterns of economic flows
and the deployment of systems of production have encouraged greater political and
social integration between nation states. This phenomenon, called globalisation,
has reinvigorated debate about the nation state as a mode of organisation, and
created the conditions for an ongoing natural experiment concerning state
adjustment. This experiment, while on a global scale, has led to different responses
from national governments, as each grappled with how best to accommodate both
domestic and international interests. One neglected aspect of analysis in these
processes is the role played by national bureaucracy in state adjustment as a means
to move with globalising pressures or to resist their impact.
This thesis presents a qualitative analysis of the interaction of one
globalising process, foreign direct investment (FDI), and the workings of the
nation state, as a means of assessing the way in which the national government has
used regulatory processes and its bureaucracy to control FDI. An extended
historical case study is used to examine changes in policy, regulation and the
organisation of the national bureaucracy concerned with FDI in Australia. The
period examined is from 1968 to 2004 enabling comparisons to be made across the
experience of seven successive national governments (those led by prime ministers
Gorton, McMahon, Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke, Keating and Howard) in the way they
managed the domestic and international circumstances that impacted on FDI.
This thesis makes a contribution to the literature on the interaction of
globalising processes, the nation state and the role played by national public
bureaucracies where national and transnational interests intersect. In particular, this
thesis identifies the national bureaucracy as a key agent for government in enabling
and domesticating the processes of globalisation. This finding demonstrates that
national bureaucracy is significant as both a facilitator and the inhibitor of
processes of globalisation, and therefore is a key factor in understanding the issues
of state adjustment in studies of globalisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">nation state</field><field name="subject">foreign direct investment</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">regulation</field><field name="subject">national bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">Gorton</field><field name="subject">McMahon</field><field name="subject">Whitlam</field><field name="subject">Fraser</field><field name="subject">Hawke</field><field name="subject">Keating</field><field name="subject">Howard</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080304.145454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pedagogic Antecedents of
Classroom Writing</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Patricia</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on aspects of a large observational study of writing lessons in a range of
ACT primary classrooms. The observational study followed students at risk of failure, who
had made literacy gains through the Scaffolding Literacy pedagogy developed at the Schools
and Community Centre, with a view to investigating their subsequent interactions in
mainstream writing classrooms. This thesis is concerned with the extent to which teaching in
these classrooms supported the children?s access to literate discourse.
In order to ascertain the pedagogic antecedents of the lessons, this study focuses on the
section of the lessons prior to children being asked to write. It explores two areas of
preparation for writing: the first regarding building of the field of enquiry (what to write
about); the second, the extent to which children are shown how to write an appropriate text.
The study proposes a level of explicitness that delivers a fine degree of knowledge about
language while supporting students who might otherwise be disadvantaged in the classroom.
The analysis in this study attempts to categorise the different kinds of interactions within the
discourse of representative lessons by applying a framework for the pedagogic register of
writing lessons proposed by Christie (1991, 2002) with particular reference to convergence of
instructional and regulative registers. It was found that convergence alone was insufficient to
?Patricia Bennett 4
provide explicitness in teaching. However, when convergence was combined with a particular
form of classroom interaction as developed in Scaffolding Literacy pedagogy a high degree of
explicitness was made available to promote learning.
Little effective preparation for writing was found in classrooms dominated by ?whole
language? orientations, especially where writing lessons were based on personal experience.
However, use of literate texts provided more powerful access than personal experience to
effective writing. The most productive classroom teaching resulted from building shared
experience based on a model text which itself provided the resources for the teaching of
writing.
The study raises questions about the importance of access to literate language when teaching
writing and the role of constructive, purposeful questioning to build the knowledge of field as
well as modelling features of language necessary for children to produce their own written
texts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">writing</field><field name="subject">classroom</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">Scaffolding Literacy</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080306.141328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multi-scale investigation into the effects of permanent
               inundation on the flood pulse, in ephemeral floodplain wetlands
               of the River Murray</field><field name="creator">Francis, Cathy</field><field name="description">Using a multi-scale experimental approach, the research undertaken in this thesis investigated the role
of the flood pulse in ephemeral floodplain wetlands of the River Murray, in order to better understand
the impact of river regulation (and permanent inundation) on these wetlands.
An ecosystem-based experiment was conducted on the River Murray floodplain, to compare changes
in nutrient availability and phytoplankton productivity in three ephemeral wetlands (over a drying/reflooding
cycle) with three permanently inundated wetlands. In the ephemeral wetlands, both drying
and re-flooding phases were associated with significant increases in nutrient availability and, in some
cases, phytoplankton productivity. It was demonstrated that the ?flood pulse?, as described by the
Flood Pulse Concept (FPC), can occur in ephemeral wetlands in dryland river-floodplain systems,
although considerable variation in the nature of the pulse existed amongst these wetlands. Results of
this experiment suggest that factors such as the degree of drying and length of isolation during the dry
phase, the rate of re-filling, timing of re-flooding and the number of drying/re-flooding cycles may be
potentially important in producing the variation observed.
Permanent inundation of ephemeral wetlands effectively removed these periods of peak nutrient
availability and phytoplankton productivity, resulting in continuously low levels (of nutrient availability
and phytoplankton productivity). It was concluded that alteration of the natural hydrological cycle in
this way can significantly reduce nutrient availability, primary production and secondary production,
essentially changing the structure and function, the ecology, of these wetlands. Equally, the results of
this experiment indicate that some of the changes resulting from river regulation and permanent
inundation can be somewhat reversed, within a relatively short period of time, given re-instatement of
a more natural hydrological regime.
A mesocosm experiment was used to examine the influence of the dry phase, specifically the effect of
the degree of wetland drying, on patterns of nutrient availability and primary productivity comprising
the flood pulse. Compared to permanent inundation, re-flooding of completely desiccated sediments
increased carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability while partial drying generally decreased, or had little
effect on, C and N availability after re-flooding. However, degree of drying had little effect on
phosphorus availability or rates of primary production measured after re-flooding, and it is possible
that these two factors are related. Partial drying reduced rates of community respiration after reflooding,
possibly a reflection of the reduced carbon concentrations measured in these mesocosms in
this phase of the experiment. Degree of drying also influenced the macrophyte community (measured
after three months of flooding), with plant biomass generally decreasing and species diversity
increasing as the degree of drying increased (with the exception of complete sediment desiccation
which had lasting negative effects on both macrophyte biomass and species diversity).
The results of the ecosystem and mesocosm experiments were utilised, in addition to results collected
from the same experiment conducted at two smaller scales (minicosms and microcosms), to assess
whether the effects of hydrological regime on nutrient availability at the ?wetland? scale could be
replicated in smaller-scale experiments. None of the smaller-scaled experiments included in this
investigation were able to replicate the specific response to hydrological regime recorded at the
ecosystem scale, however the mesocosm experiment did produce results that were more similar to
those at the ecosystem scale than those produced by the mini and microcosm experiments. The
results of this study indicated that extrapolation of results from small-scale experiments should be
undertaken with caution, and confirmed that a multi-scale approach to ecological research is wise,
where large-scale field experimentation and/or monitoring provides a check on the accuracy, and
hence relevance, of conclusions reached via mesocosm experiments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wetlands</field><field name="subject">floodplains</field><field name="subject">Murray River</field><field name="subject">Murray-Darling</field><field name="subject">floods</field><field name="subject">inundation</field><field name="subject">multi-scale experimental approach</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061128.153926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An appraisal of the use of numerical features in the forensic examination of hair</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Elizabeth M</field><field name="description">The advent of nuclear DNA (nuDNA) analysis altered the way forensic biology
was both practised and viewed by the forensic biologists, police, the legal system
and the general public. The ability of nuDNA to individualise analysis of evidence
and attach a statistical frequency ratio to the result, created an expectation that
numerical objectivity should be part of all forensic analysis. There are few
scientists who would disagree with both the need and desirability of objective
measures of their results. Forensic hair examiners are no exception as indicated by
numerous scientific publications specifically discussing means of objectively
assessing hair and its characteristics. While mitochondrial DNA offers a partially
objective measure of hair the result is destructive of the sample. A method that
objectively supports the hair analysts' microscopic findings and is non destructive
would be beneficial to forensic hair examination. This project attempted to develop
an objective measure of hair analysis by using both traditional light microscopic
comparative techniques combined with a high end digital imaging and image
analysis capacity.
Where objectivity equals an empirical set of numbers that can be manipulated for
statistical significance, the comparative biological sciences such as histology,
anthropology and forensic hair examination struggle. Forensic hair examiners have
long acknowledged the difficulty, even inability, of assigning numerical values to
the features that characterise one hair as being different from another. The human
scalp hair is a "morphological" unit that is not readily split into component parts or
even that these parts lend themselves to a number value. There have been at least
nine separate studies which favourably compare the specificity of microscopic hair
examinations. The challenge this study addressed was to appraise the use of
numerical features in forensic hair examination, with particular emphasis on those
features currently resisting numerical evaluation; specifically, colour and
pigmentary characteristics.
The techniques used were based on obtaining high quality digital images, and using
the pixels inherent in the images to obtain numerical values of such features as
colour and pigmentation. The project sample was taken from the telogen scalp hairs obtained from the hairbrushes of ten nominally brown haired Caucasians, both
male and female. The focus was twofold:
o Compare colour analysis of hair images from brown haired Caucasians
within three standard, internationally recognized colour models, namely
Red-Green-Blue (RGB) colour model; CIE XYZ Tristimulus (1931) colour
model; and CIE L*a*b* (1976) colour model.
o Using the same sets of digital images, undertake pattern recognition
analysis both intra and inter individual hair samples.
Discriminate analysis of the mean colour values collected for each of the inherent
colour variables in the three colour models (red, green, blue; X, Y, Z and L*, a*,
b*) indicated the RGB colour model gave the least separation of brown haired
individuals; CIE XYZ and CIE L*a*b* separated several individuals for all their
individual samples and several other individuals were mostly separated with only
one of their own samples overlapping with another.
Pattern analysis used a small area that represented the overall pigment patterning
observed along the length of the hair shaft. This area was extracted from the digital
image within V++ Digital Optics image analysis software. The extracted pattern
piece was then compared with other sample images within the same hair and four
other hairs from the same individual. Pattern extracts were also compared between
person hair samples. The comparisons generated a set of numerical values based
on the pixel number on the "x" axis of the whole image and the average difference
between the extracted pattern image and the whole image. Analysis of this data
resulted in log distributions when persons were matched with themselves. It was
also possible to refer an unknown pattern extract to this distribution and based on
probabilities, predict as to whether or not the unknown sample fell within any of
the known sample's distribution.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hair fibres</field><field name="subject">forensic analysis</field><field name="subject">digital imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080624.144159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Costing Constitutional Change:
Estimates of the Financial Benefits of
New States, Regional Governments,
Unification and Related Reforms</field><field name="creator">Drummond, Mark Lea</field><field name="description">There have been numerous proposals to reform Australia's government structures, both prior to
and since Federation in 1901, including calls for New Colonies and New States, Unification
plans, Regional Government models spanning across the federal-unitary continuum, and
proposals to transfer functions between Commonwealth and State governments, such as the
modern day attempts by the Commonwealth government to establish a national Industrial
Relations system. But while several functions have been transferred from the States to the
Commonwealth since Federation, major changes sought by supporters of New States, Regional
Governments and Unification have never been achieved.
The financial benefits possible through various reformed government structures are first
examined in terms of claims and estimates that have accompanied past reform proposals.
Financial benefits are then estimated for the four years from 1998-99 to 2001-02 using
population and expenditure data, per capita expenditure comparisons, and various linear and
non-linear regression techniques.
New States appear likely to cost in the order of $1 billion per annum per New State, and
possibly more if costs associated with State-Territory borders are taken into account, but their
financial viability could be vastly improved if New State formation follows or is accompanied
by functional transfers to achieve national systems in areas such as health and education.
It is estimated that Unification and some Regional Government models could achieve financial
benefits in the order of five to ten per cent in both public and private sectors and the economy as
a whole, which, in June 2002 dollar terms, would amount to some $15 billion to $30 billion per
annum in the public sector, $25 billion to $50 billion in the private sector, and hence $40 billion
to $80 billion per annum across both public and private sectors and the entire Australian
economy. It is also estimated that for several functions, including education and health, unitary
national systems under Commonwealth control could generate significant financial benefits,
whereas for other functions, notably transport and communications, national systems could
prove more costly.
Additional research could clarify estimates, but ultimately the only way to fully check estimates
is to observe and measure actual reforms in action. If all State-Territory level health care
functions, for example, were transferred to the Commonwealth government to achieve a fully
national health system, then the benefits and costs of such reform could be assessed with much
more certainty than is possible through pre-reform empirical estimates. The establishment of a
national health system could also diminish concerns that New States or Regional Governments
might exacerbate problems associated with separate State laws, regulations and systems -
problems likely to be tolerated least in health care given its life-and-death gravity. And for
Unification advocates, a national health system would represent a significant step towards
complete Unification across all functions.
Estimates appear to be robust when assessed in light of Commonwealth Grants Commission
methodologies, differential levels of tax expenditures and privatisation across the current States
and Territories, and Australia's economic and industrial geography, and on balance suggest that
intelligent government structure reforms have the potential to significantly enhance Australia's
financial and economic strength, and hence provide the financial capacity to achieve
significantly improved social and environmental outcomes as well.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian government</field><field name="subject">unification</field><field name="subject">regional government model</field><field name="subject">state unification</field><field name="subject">estimates</field><field name="subject">financial benefits</field><field name="subject">restructure</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080825.143939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The home-school connection: Immigrant family literacy practices and use of technology in home/first language learning</field><field name="creator">Marti-Bucknall, Wendy</field><field name="description">The study addressed immigrant families' and mainstream school systems' support for young children's home language learning in Basel, Switzerland. In Switzerland, as in many European countries and in Australia, early childhood educators work with growing numbers of children from immigrant, refugee and asylum seeking families. The culturally, linguistically and ethnically diverse groups of children that now characterise childcare centres, kindergartens and primary schools result from these patterns of immigration and present challenges for teachers and other educators who cater for the needs of increasingly diverse student populations. The literature on home languages acknowledges the importance of the relationship between a child's first language and development in the second language and the essential role of language proficiency in academic success. Despite knowledge from extensive studies on the interdependency of first and second language development (Cummins, 1979, 1981b, 1991, 2001) and evidence that continued development in a child's first language is crucial for overall cognitive development and transfer to second language learning (Collier, 1995), there is little focus on helping children maintain their home language in the early years of education. Arguably too, information and communication technologies (ICTs) lead to increased availability and opportunities for global communication, affecting the nature of communication, and creating possibilities for new forms of learning in the home and school. Children must therefore have the opportunity to become proficient users of these new and evolving forms of technology in order to acquire the skills, including language skills that they will need for future employment. In the light of this conceptual background, the present research focused on: (1) Immigrant parent beliefs and attitudes to home language use and how languages were used at home. (2) The strategies families used to promote home language learning in oral and written forms. (3) The extent to which ICTs were used as a tool to support home languages in the family and school environment. (4) The kinds of support offered in school and communities and what government policies and initiatives were afforded to home languages.
(5) The nature of school and community policies and practices on the promotion and maintenance on home languages. These issues were addressed through a qualitative interpretive research approach drawing on the traditions of phenomenography (Marton 1986) and Grounded Theory (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990). The research was based on three main data sources: (1) analysis of policy and curriculum documents from school systems, (2) interviews with key education personnel and (3) interviews with ?immigrant? parents (n=58) from diverse socio-economic backgrounds living in Basel. Families were drawn from 16 countries including the former Yugoslavia, (Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia), Spain, South and Central America, and Turkey. All children, whose parents participated in the study, attended state run kindergartens and primary schools. A major focus in the data collection and analysis was on (a) parents' perspectives and experiences as they negotiated home language learning in the home, school and community and the extent to which they used ICTs to enrich home language development, and (b) mainstream teachers' perspectives on the role home languages played in linguistically and culturally diverse classrooms, as well as the role ICTs and media played in teaching children from immigrant families. The results of the study showed that: (a) immigrant children's home languages and culture as well as bilingualism and multilingualism are prominent features in Basel integration policy and curriculum documents but this focus is rarely translated to early childhood classroom practice, (b) classroom teachers focus predominantly on children learning their second language (German), (c) immigrant children's home language and culture is valued and respected but formal opportunities for children to learn to read and write in their home languages begin only when they have reached second grade, (d) there were a range of perspectives, reasons and strategies for maintaining and promoting home languages within families, (e) ICT was not an integral part of children's classroom experiences in kindergarten and scarcely integrated in primary classrooms, but was used in a variety of ways within homes to promote home language and communication, (f) there were wide variations in parents' and teachers' perspectives on what constitutes parent involvement in children's learning and education, and
(g) links between home and school were mostly 'one way' and formal and some parents desired more frequent, more informal and spontaneous contact with teachers. These findings have considerable implications for Basel school and classroom practice and for early and middle year policy makers. They show that embedded assumptions of both teachers and parents may have a negative impact on children's positive identification with both majority and minority language learning. Limited financial support for home language classes is likely to have a negative effect on immigrant children's home language literacy learning. Dialogue needs to be sought on the potential for ICT use in home language learning. Policy makers' efforts towards developing multilingualism in all children are problematic. Some parents drew attention to the challenge of learning a third language through a second language, L1 + L2a +L2b + L3+L4. (L1 = home language, L2a= German Swiss dialect, L2b = Standard German, L3= French, L4 = English). To help better explain and increase awareness of the interrelationship between home languages, ICT use and the home-school connection, a model was developed that reflects the range of immigrant family perspectives on home language learning and the influences that appear to promote home language development within children's environments. This 'multilingual social cohesive communications model' should assist in understanding the important links between home languages, ICTs and home-school communication. The model emphasises the importance of developing bottom up local level strategies and recognises the vital role of positive interactions between parents and teachers. It builds on a sociocultural view of language learning, tapping on the potential of new learning tools (ICTs) in real and virtual communities. It recognises the importance of intercultural identity formation and at the same time the inhibiting effects of discrimination both overt and covert. The model incorporates the strategies schools need to improve communication with families and to strengthen links between home and school with the view to improving educational outcomes and prospects for immigrant children.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Home and school</field><field name="subject">Switzerland</field><field name="subject">bilingualism</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">immigrant</field><field name="subject">parent participation</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20080826.151654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Dyadic Brand

This thesis seeks to show how current legislation at federal, state and territory level is
largely inconsistent in defining key terms; to explain why this is problematic; and to
propose a workable solution.
An examination is made of the common law as it currently stands, followed by an
investigation of federal, state and territory revenue, superannuation, workers'

principal-contractor relationships.
The thesis recognises that there currently exists no comprehensive solution to the
problems plaguing the employee-contractor dichotomy, and an all encompassing
solution is proposed. The solution presented moves away from the traditional common
law approach, rejects a statutory definitional approach, and instead adopts the principles
of the Torrens Title system to land ownership in Australia.

              hierarchical organisation of river systems</field><field name="creator">Parsons, Melissa</field><field name="description">The distribution of macroinvertebrate communities is influenced by a myriad of abiotic
environmental factors. However, many of these environmental factors do not occur
randomly within a river system. Rather, they occur as a result of geomorphological
processes that operate hierarchically to constrain the expression of environmental
factors at successively nested levels. As a result of the hierarchical expression of
geomorphological processes, environmental factors occur at characteristic scales within
a river system and can be used to define spatial scales of river system organisation.
Previous studies have examined multiscale patterns of benthic macroinvertebrate
community distribution using scales of measurement such as ecoregions, catchments,
rivers, reaches and functional habitats. However, none of these studies used scales
derived from a geomorphological hierarchy to examine patterns of macroinvertebrate
distribution. Given that macroinvertebrates are often deterministically influenced by
environmental factors, and these environmental factors occur at characteristic scales
within a geomorphological hierarchy, it is possible that the multiscale distribution of
macroinvertebrate communities may correspond to the hierarchical arrangement of a
river system. This study used scales of measurement derived from a geomorphological
hierarchy to examine whether there was any congruence between the distribution of
macroinvertebrate communities and the organisation of a river system at the catchment,
zone, reach and riffle scales.
The Upper Murrumbidgee River Catchment study area (13 005km/2) was divided into
catchments, zones within catchments, reaches within zones and riffles within reaches.
Macroinvertebrate collection was stratified across these scales according to a balanced
nested hierarchical design, and environmental data were also collected at the catchment,
zone, reach and riffle scales. Simultaneous multiscale treatment of biological and
environmental data allowed identification of multiscale patterns of macroinvertebrate
distribution in relation to the hierarchical organisation of a river system, as well as
identification of hierarchical interactions between macroinvertebrate communities and
environmental factors. Multivariate (ANOSIM, classification, ordination) and
univariate (Nested ANOVA) statistical techniques were employed, and each analysis
was performed at the species and family levels of taxonomy.
Macroinvertebrate communities were highly similar within a reach, because this is the
point in the geomorphological hierarchy where environmental conditions become more
homogeneous, relative to larger scales. Conversely, communities were dissimilar at the
larger zone and catchment scales because environmental conditions become more
heterogeneous, relative to smaller scales. However, the reach within zone scale also
represents the point where sampling reaches become distinct across the landscape, and
the similarity of macroinvertebrate communities within a reach may also be related to
the spatial proximity of samples. Hence, macroinvertebrate community distribution is
only congruent with the smaller scales of river system organisation.
Despite the lack of congruence between macroinvertebrate community distribution and
the larger catchment and zone scales of river system organisation, there was a strong
regional pattern of distribution in the Upper Murrumbidgee River Catchment. This
regional-scale pattern self-emerges from biological information, and is larger than the
geomorphologically derived catchment scale. Partitioning of macroinvertebrate data
into regional groups subsequently revealed some congruence between
macroinvertebrate distribution and the catchment and zone scales of river system
organisation. An alternative hierarchy consisting of biological regions, biological
clusters, geomorphological reaches and geomorphological riffles was marginally better
able to capture patterns of macroinvertebrate distribution than the original catchment,
zone, reach and riffle scales. Thus, consideration of the hierarchical organisation of
stream systems from a purely physical perspective may fail to encompass scales that are
relevant to biota, and biological information should be included as a primary
hierarchical component of landscape-scale studies of macroinvertebrate distribution.
The pattern of region and reach-scale macroinvertebrate distribution was matched by a
general pattern of large catchment and local reach-scale environmental influence. This
occurred despite testing of catchment, zone, reach and riffle-scale environmental
variables against both the scaled and non-scale pattern of macroinvertebrate
distribution. Macroinvertebrate communities were influenced by local reach-scale
characteristics such as riparian vegetation character and channel morphology, but rifflescale
hydrological variables were also associated with some headwater communities.
However, macroinvertebrate communities also sit within a broader landscape context
and are influenced by large catchment-scale factors such as landuse, or by factors
indicating the geographical position of the sample or the size of the stream. The large
and local-scale environmental variables that influence macroinvertebrates are related
within a geomorphological hierarchy, and macroinvertebrates may respond
deterministically to the same type of environmental factor expressed at different scales.
These responses should not be treated as statistical correlates, but rather, they should be
viewed in the context of a hierarchy of river system organisation.
There was little difference in the overall scale-related findings between species and
family level. Family-level macroinvertebrate communities were similar within a reach
and dissimilar among reaches, zones and catchments and there was a large regionalscale
pattern of family-level community distribution. Local reach-scale and large
catchment-scale environmental factors were most strongly associated with family-level
macroinvertebrate distribution. Replication of these scale-related findings at both levels
of taxonomy indicates that aggregation from species to family level does not result in
loss of ecological information pertaining to primary hierarchical patterns. However, the
difference between species and family level was pronounced when tracing the
hierarchical occurrence of individual taxa, in the context of theories such as the
landscape filters hypothesis and habitat based model. In particular, there was a shift in
the scale at which families began to be removed from the hierarchy from the region to
the smaller cluster scale. This shift was related to the lowered distinctiveness of familylevel
regional macroinvertebrate groups, but also suggests that environmental filters
may act differently on species and families. The use of family-level data is not
recommended for the testing of theories of hierarchical taxon occurrence, because these
theories rely on the accurate detection of precise macroinvertebrate-environment
relationships.
The use of scales of measurement derived from a geomorphological hierarchy provides
a process-based foundation for marrying the biological and physical domains, and for
examining the hierarchical interactions that may occur between these domains.
However, the results of this study indicate that overlaying the biological and physical
domains is not a straightforward task, because the biological domain may be influenced
by factors other than the deterministic relationship between macroinvertebrates and
environmental conditions. Regardless, this study has taken some basic principles of
fluvial geomorphology and incorporated them into the design of a standard stream
ecology study. Given the relatively advanced state of knowledge that exists
individually in the disciplines of fluvial geomorphology and stream ecology, integration
and application of concepts across disciplines represents an exciting future opportunity
in aquatic science.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macroinverterbrate</field><field name="subject">river systems</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20061113.150809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of immunity to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae in the lung</field><field name="creator">Foxwell, Alice Ruth</field><field name="description">Pulmonary infection caused by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality in both industrialised and developing
countries. Previous work from this group resulted in the development of a respiratory
model in rodents which has precipitated studies into the pathogenesis of infection by
NTHi and investigation of the humoral and cellular mechanisms by which the bacteria
are cleared from the lung. Comparison of mucosally immunised with non-immunised
animals has demonstrated that not only are bacteria cleared more rapidly from the lungs,
but there is a more rapid response and resolution of inflammatory factors in the
mucosally immunised animals following challenge with NTHi.
This inflammatory response is partially regulated by the ability of the mucosally
immunised animals to rapidly produce, then control the production of tumour necrosis
factor (TNF)-a. The TNF-a is produced by both macrophages and type I pneumocytes
in the alveoli and also by the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels in the lungs.
Immunocytochemical studies have identified cellular subsets accumulating in the lung
at various time points following infection. Marked differences in cellular infiltration
into the lung tissue were noted between immunised and non-immunised animals after
challenge with NTHi. Immunised animals demonstrated an early influx of
macrophages, CD8+ T cells and Y8+ T cells, followed by enhanced expression of the
MHC-II marker, cellular infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and finally an
increased number of both B cells and CD4+ T cells. In contrast, non-immunised
animals did not demonstrate any proliferation nor extravasation of lymphocytes or
increased expression of MHC-II before total bacterial clearance had occurred.
Polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration occurred in the non-immunised animals,
however at a later time than that seen in immunised animals.
Challenging rodents to establish persistent infection highlighted the inappropriately
aggressive white blood cell response to an initial challenge when bacteria may be
masked by other substances, followed by the inability to amplify the
polymorphonuclear leukocyte response on repeated challenge with NTHi. This
hyporesponsiveness in the macrophage population, shown by lack of detectable TNF-a
production, concomitant with low numbers of NTHi resulted in a continuously high
number of macrophages in the alveoli and the possibility of increased damage to the
lung tissue.
The requirement for cell surface TNF-a and CD8+ T cells to enhance the clearance of
NTHi from the lungs further strengthens previous in vitro and in vivo findings of the
possible significance of cellular invasion as a mechanism of pathogenicity for NTHi.
This thesis has contributed to the understanding of both the immune response to and the
pathogenicity mechanisms of pulmonary infection with NTHi. Kinetic studies
identifying cellular responses and cytokine levels have emphasised the ability of
mucosal immunisation to increase the rate of immune response and resolution of
inflammation to NTHi infection in the lung. Observations demonstrating a requirement
for macrophages and CD8+ T cells in mechanisms associated with enhancing NTHi
clearance from the lung will lead to further investigations.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pulmonary infection</field><field name="subject">nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae</field><field name="subject">NTHi</field><field name="subject">lungs</field><field name="subject">immunity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060710.142114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The long fall : Australian speculative fiction for adolescents as 'literature of anxiety'</field><field name="creator">Barry, Michael</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speculative fiction</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">Australian literature</field><field name="subject">literature of anxiety</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060607.165243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing critical thinking of
undergraduate Thai students through
dialogic inquiry</field><field name="creator">Buranapatana, Maliwan</field><field name="description">This thesis sets for itself the task of testing the viability of a dialogic model of
learning as a methodology for teaching critical thinking in reading and writing to
undergraduate students of Thai in Thailand. To this end, we conducted an
experiment involving twenty-one undergraduate students of Thai at KhonKaen University, Thailand. This study presents the intellectual background of the
pedagogic framework supporting the experiment and a discussion of its outcomes.
The assessment of the results of the experiment focuses on the forms of evidence
resulting directly from this pedagogic framework. The study concludes with a
number of considerations for future research in critical thinking which our project
helped us to identify.
For the purpose of our work, we adopt the model of dialogic learning which
involves students in looking for perspectives enabling them to challenge, and as a
result to enhance, the relevance of the understandings in which they frame their
interactions. The process is dialogic because it involves students in working with
different points of view by identifying challenging perspectives, constructing
conflicting arguments and exploring the strategic potential that the interaction of
these arguments may have on the students? initial assumptions. In this sense, the
concept of dialogue that we use refers to the methodology of students? inquiry
(learning), rather than a specific form of linguistic genre. In our view, this
definition is suitable to all fields of inquiry considering that each field deals with
evaluation of the strategic (enabling) power of its assumptions.
In the course of this work, we establish the relevance of the above concept of
dialogic inquiry against a multitude of ideas regarding the suitability of different
approaches to the teaching of critical thinking. We illustrate that, typically,
teaching approaches value questioning as a means for generating reasoned
arguments. However, the originality of the dialogic model used in this thesis lies
in its ability to focus pedagogic environments on students? strategic engagement
in social interactions, rather than on the process of questioning alone.
Consequently, in our study we assess the quality of students? learning by
identifying the contexts indicating the quality of students? social engagement.
These included gauging the community?s interest in the students? project, the
depth of students? exploratory work, their ability to work together and students?
own personal involvement in their project. These outcomes helped us to reflect on
the quality of the teaching model which we designed in order to promote the
critical thinking process.
The emphasis on students? strategic engagement in social interactions allowed us
to break away from the conventional concerns with the link between classroom
learning and real-world tasks. Instead, our students engaged in the task of creating
a Thai News Network (TNN), an Internet-based broadcasting channel, involving
students in generating for themselves the meaning of the objectives of their
academic subject in the contexts of challenges that they experienced when
creating the channel and its (news) articles. Our data analysis shows that the
concept of a Thai News Network proved very successful despite the conventional
beliefs that Thai students would find it difficult to be critical thinkers. As we
demonstrate throughout the entire thesis, the main issue in teaching critical
thinking is not, as it is often assumed, to ask students to critique the teacher or
other authority texts. Rather, it is to create conditions enabling students to
identify, and to work with, conflicting perspectives in order to create for

from paint loss. In the past, assumptions have been made that
this phenomenon was caused by a low binder concentration,
although binder presence had not been investigated, confirmed
or it's type identified.
Simple laboratory methods which can detect the presence of
binders on a painted object are outlined. They are based on
tests developed for the medical industry and modified by the
author for routine use in conservation. Methods presented
outline procedures to identify three broad chemical groups of
binders used in the manufacture of traditional Australian
Aboriginal painted objects :
1. lipids (fats and/or oils) using Sudan Black B
Bromination test and the Sigma GCI Triglyceride test;
2. proteins (egg and blood) using Sulphosalicylic Acid
test, Sigma GCI Protein test and the GCI Heme test;
3. carbohydrates (honey and orchid juice) using the Sigma GCI
Glucose test.
Close comparison was found between the reported binders used on
certain object types and those identified.
Literature findings based on anthropological information on
binders and pigments are summarised. They indicated that fat or
oil binders have higher binder concentrations than originally
expected. Rapid lipid binder deterioration has lead to their
present matte appearance. Compared to protein and carbohydrate
binders, used as a paint vehicle or facilitator and/or for
symbolic representation (blood), where used on a range of
ceremonial objects with no long term expectancy and therefore
no requirement to adhere or bind the pigment. The concept of
"effective" binder concentration as opposed to low binder
concentration is discussed.
Implications of these findings of binder presence are discussed
and considerations for preservation and conservation
treatments, which involve consolidation are outlined.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">traditional binders</field><field name="subject">painted objects</field><field name="subject">preservation</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20060711.130218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-picturing my life / 
Tissue</field><field name="creator">Berridge, Alice Margaret</field><field name="description">Autobiography is a slippery genre, if, indeed, it is a genre. To deal with its slipperiness I use action research and qualitative inquiry to create a bricolage, an artist?s book, Tissue. Within the patchwork, stitched-together form of Tissue, digitised text and images (autobiographical stories, poetry, photographs, drawings and paintings) sit in varying relationships to each other. Also, I use poetic language and images to display aspects of the discourse of memory in digitally manipulated text/images where language and image are not illustrative of each other but are interconnected and equal, synergetic, creating new meanings. To simultaneously enhance the handleability of the pages and distance their electronic nature, I use a number of different papers and fabrics as the skins of the images.
Using the ideas of Roland Barthes (principally) and others as reference points, in this exegesis Re-picturing my life, I address the ways in which the present is informed by the past; self, identity and the body; the function of memory, and its mediation and articulation in the narration of autobiography; the significance of autobiographical objects and landscapes, and the nature of an autobiographical author.
I also explore the effects on myself, as a migrant, of the fragility of identity in the face of major social disruptions such as mutiple migrations, and consider whether the narration of personal experience through autobiography aids in the construction of a new identity that is more grounded in the new surroundings.
In this exegesis I argue that, in this process of revisiting the past and reconstructing narrative, text and image in my artist?s book, I have both re-written and re-pictured my life. Yet, while this process of regaining and articulating my lost family information seems to have initiated some bodily changes, and, more importantly, appears to have strengthened and stabilised my sense of self, it has not alleviated my feelings of exile. Indeed, my feelings of exile and the absence of any single identifiable homeland have strengthened.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autobiography</field><field name="subject">self-idenity</field><field name="subject">family history</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20070510.151236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mrs Gallagher, Acts of disobedience: performance and installation in rural New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Findlay, Jules Julie Ann</field><field name="description">This art project examines aspects of New Zealand rural culture through the experience of a fictional performer, Mrs Gallagher. She questions the instrumental approach of agribusiness production, both as it enframes her domestic/farm helper role and the farming of animals. She uses the practices of everyday life, domestic crafts and appropriated materials of agribusiness to draw attention to the traditional ideological boundaries between the human/animal and assigned gender roles.Employing the tactics of 'making do', Mrs Gallagher uses inventive play to produce new forms that cross the domestic/agribusiness boundary. It is her aim that her acts of intervention and these hybrid forms will promote a more mindful use of technology and greater recognition of the continuity and difference that exists between humans and nature.All objects will be presented in site-orientated installation. Evidence of Mrs Gallagher's intervening acts is witnessed and documented using time-based media by a collaborative performer, the cultural theorist K.

My management support of the process led to adopting a networked model in our organisation, and also to my embracing the role of communications management.The organisation in which I work has a high rate of change and an entrepreneurial culture which is sometimes chaotic. This challenging environment was a good testing ground for the project, which sought to explore a number of propositions affirming the value of user-centred intranets.Developing and implementing the intranet encouraged collaboration amongst staff members. The intranet became a new channel of communication, which usefully enhanced the staff's ability to share and find out what was going on, who did what and how to contact them. My interventions as a manager, which occurred in parallel with the technological development of the intranet, led to spin-off organisational improvements such as an improved collaborative reporting system, the restructuring of the organisation manual files, and the establishment of a collaboratively-focussed full monthly staff meeting. Developing and implementing a user-centred intranet was a dynamic way to effect change in the organisation and orient it towards a networked organisational model, one which is communication rich, both collaborative and participative.The project was driven by my belief that a user-centred emphasis in intranet design is necessary in today's knowledge-based global economy, where there is a high rate of change. The networked organisational model should be embraced as a flexible model catering for change by promoting organic and dynamic networking within an organisation. This environment is communication-rich and collaborative, and a user-centred intranet is a communication channel well suited to support this model.A user-centred intranet should not be seen merely as an organisational artefact, but also as the a process of developing and implementing it will open up an organisation's culture, communication, and knowledge management in a participatory way. However, the degree that this will be achieved depends on a number of factors. For instance, the leaders of an organisation need to embrace a networked organisational model, encouraging and resourcing communication management for a culture of participation and collaboration.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intranets (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition knowledge of New Zealand premier club rugby coaches</field><field name="creator">Zinn, Caryn</field><field name="description">In a club rugby union environment, sports nutrition information is frequently delivered to players by the central team figure, the coach. Rugby coaches in New Zealand undertake negligible formal nutrition training to become a coach, and the development of their knowledge base remains their responsibility. There is currently no literature on the nutrition knowledge level of New Zealand coaches. Internationally, literature on coaches' nutrition knowledge and dissemination of that knowledge is scarce. Research to date has used questionnaire techniques to quantify coaches' knowledge. These questionnaires have not been assessed for their psychometric properties. As such, a true measure of knowledge cannot be guaranteed from any of these contemporary studies. Therefore, the aims of this thesis were: 1) To design a nutrition knowledge questionnaire satisfying adequate statistical measures of validity and reliability; 2) To utilise the validated questionnaire to investigate the nutrition knowledge level of these coaches 3) To investigate whether or not New Zealand premier club rugby coaches provide nutrition advice to their athletes and the factors affecting this; and 4) To investigate the factors that predict coaches' knowledge. 	Study 1 involved designing a questionnaire that satisfied acceptable psychometric criteria of validity (content and construct) and reliability (test-retest). It was designed by an expert panel of sports dietitians and distributed to five groups, dietitians, university business staff, and nutrition, business and fitness students, selected for their expected variation in sports nutrition knowledge. Construct validity was high as indicated by significant mean knowledge score differences between the groups (p = 0.0001). Dietitians and nutrition students achieved significantly greater mean scores than the remaining groups. The questionnaire was administered a second time to the business staff and the dietitians to assess test-retest reliability, for which two methods were used. The first method involved a Pearson's product-moment correlation, and demonstrated acceptable reliability (r = 0.74-0.93), aside from the fluid sub-category (r = 0.52). The second, and more robust, method involved a percentage calculation of questions answered in an identical manner on both test occasions. A good test-retest concordance was achieved, with 81.2% duplication of responses of all questions. The findings of this study indicated that the questionnaire was suitably valid and reliable to determine the sports nutrition knowledge of New Zealand premier club rugby coaches. In Study 2, coaches (n = 168) completed the validated questionnaire, received by Internet, linked via e-mail, or (in case of inaccessibility), standard mail. Coaches responded correctly to 55.6% of all knowledge questions. Those who provided nutrition advice to their players (83.8% of the group) obtained a significantly greater knowledge score, 56.8%, than those who did not provide advice, 48.4% (p = 0.008). The study also examined the factors determining nutrition knowledge level. Significant relationships were identified between total knowledge score of all coaches and their qualifications     (p = 0.0001), their own knowledge rating (p = 0.0001), whether or not they underwent nutrition training (p = 0.002) and whether or not they provided nutrition advice              (p = 0.004). It can be concluded that New Zealand premier club rugby coaches are inadequately prepared to impart nutrition advice to athletes and could benefit from further nutrition training.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Rugby football coaches</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Common success factors when bidding for sporting events in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dunphy, Anthony Paul</field><field name="description">The outcome of this research has been to gain insight into the processes of bidding for New Zealand hosted sports events with a particular focus on understanding the factors that make a successful bid. It investigated the perceptions of the two parties associated with an event bid: the event bidders and the event owners. The research has also compared and contrasted the international findings with the New Zealand findings and a model of the event bidding process (Targeted Model), from the perspective of the local government event bidder, has been developed.Of the international research that had been done on event bidding the majority had been focused towards identifying the success factors when bidding for high-profile mega-events such as the Olympic Games. At the local level, the literature review identified that no such research had been conducted on event bidding within New Zealand. This lack of research presented the opportunity to gain an insight into the event bidding process within New Zealand. Due to the competitive nature of event bidding, New Zealand event bidders tend to work in isolation and there is no collective understanding of those factors that secure a bid. This research has overcome this isolation and presented a collective understanding of the success factors.Using the grounded theory methodology, common success factors and a model of the event bidding process emerged from the data. Common success factors that were frequently mentioned by event owners and event bidders included the need for government support, providing adequate event infrastructure, previous event management experience and providing quality information. The event owners tended to focus on those factors that ensured the successful delivery of the event. In addition, the event bidders mentioned common success factors that enhanced the bid: previous bidding experience; partnerships and relationships; bid leadership; research; providing quality information; using figureheads; making an emotional connection with the decision makers.The Targeted Model identifies the critical stages in the bidding process from the perspective of the New Zealand local government event bidder. An important step in event bidding is the "Bid Development Stage" where the event bidders are attempting to fulfil, and in most cases, exceed the criteria presented by the event owners. Event bidders who achieve the state of "Best Fit" - the desired outcome of the bid process where the event owners' conscious needs and unconscious desires are best met by an event bid - will succeed in winning the bid.The significance of this research is that it is the first of its kind in New Zealand, from which further research on event bidding will be able to compare and evolve from. One of the outcomes of the grounded theory methodology is that the findings are useful for the participants. It is envisaged that the results from this research will have practical applications for the events industry as it provides useful insights to the factors that win a bid and clearly models the bidding process.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sporting events</field><field name="subject">Bidding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exegesis and screenplay for a film entitled Mangrove</field><field name="creator">Melville, Andrew</field><field name="description">The film script Mangrove is both an eco-warrior thriller with science fiction elements and a documentation of the quirky, multicultural milieu of 21st century Auckland. It deals with the issues surrounding experimentation with genetic engineering and human alienation and disability.The script references the tradition of New Zealand film and its development as a "cinema of unease" through the character of Nat, who lives as a "man alone" on a moored yacht, and through its setting in a desolate mangrove estuary adjacent to a suburban industrial estate. It features characters who are recent immigrants from varying cultures and offers insights to world views that contrast with the pessimistic colonial outlook on life that pits man against the environment in a struggle for domination.The title, Mangrove, is a metaphor for the rich human environment that can be found in outposts of society that are often maligned and overlooked for their perceived lack of value.Mangrove's main character, Talia, is a disabled woman whose desire is to be accepted for her difference, her insights and her humanity. She is confronted with her past and her origins that may be part of a late 20th century genetic experiment.She meets Nat, a former journalist hiding out from society who is searching for a way to express his idealism. Likewise, Shiva, an indo-Fijian living in a nearby car wreckers yard has a love of music and the environment and shares Nat's idealism and desire to work for a better world. The three uncover a potentially world-altering genetic experiment with sugar. The antagonist multinational has Russian mafia allies that have to be dealt with, while the protagonists have the assistance of some Thai monks and Pacific Island street kids as they strive to expose the experimentation, and work out their relationships with one another.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fringe</field><field name="subject">Mangrove</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Cross culture</field><field name="subject">Edge</field><field name="subject">Kiwi</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abstract reality: the alienating gaze</field><field name="creator">Matheson, Clare</field><field name="description">This is a visual arts project consisting of 20% exegesis and 80% practical work.

Due to the rapid growth of private-label market share, researchers have looked into different influential factors in attempting to find out the reasons behind the success of these store products. As consumers reflect the demand side of fast-moving goods, their perceptions critically affect decisions on brand selection, and therefore the performance of the brands.Although the topic of private labels has long been studied, the volume of private-label research is less than that of national-brand studies. Findings from the extant studies of private labels have provided valuable consumer insights for marketing scholars and practitioners to better develop branding theory and strategies. However, issues still exist in the literature, in particular, concerning category-level influences of consumer factors such as perceived risk and attitude. Risk perception and attitude are important explanatory constructs for consumer proneness towards buying private labels. Moreover, category-level differences are stated as the most critical source that can explain the variations in the performance of private labels (Batra and Sinha, 2000; Dhar and Hoch, 1997).This research replicates Batra and Sinha's (2000) study which examined the categorylevel effects of different determinants of perceived risk on consumer preferences for buying private labels. The purpose of this research is to re-examine their hypotheses and to investigate other attitude determinants which Batra and Sinha did not study. In addition, this study also investigates the impact of demographics on the purchase of private labels.A mall-intercept survey was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that perceived risk and attitude determinants such as quality variability, price consciousness, price-quality association and brand loyalty influence significantly consumers' propensities to buy private labels. Furthermore, these private-label propensities vary across product categories due to category-level variations in perceptions and attitudes. Consumers are more likely to buy private labels in categories where they perceive lower quality variability across brands, where they have higher price consciousness, where they believe weaker price-quality association, and where they have less brand loyalty. Moreover, education and income are also identified as significant indicators of private label buyers.Findings from this study suggest that category-level analysis of consumer factors could more effectively answer the question why private label success varies across different categories. A better way for national-brand manufacturers and retailers to compete against each other is the product quality improvement. Manufacturers should try to keep the quality level of national brands as far above that of private labels as possible, whereas retailers should attempt to reduce the quality gap for their private label brands.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">House brands</field><field name="subject">Brand name products</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Consumers</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How do teachers with different ESOL teaching backgrounds approach form-focused instruction?</field><field name="creator">Gerzic, Ana</field><field name="description">Form-focused instruction makes up an important part of the literature on second language acquisition research. Current approaches to second language instruction have called for an integration of message-focused and form-focused instruction in the L2 classroom. At the same time, a growing interest is the pedagogical applications of form-focused research, which proposes a means of addressing form in the classroom using various instructional options, some of which involve incidental and pre-planned focus on form.This study examined the nature and occurrence of pre-planned and incidental focus on form in two secondary school ESOL classrooms, and what thinking underlay the two teachers' practices in choosing a particular option. The study reports on the methods and approaches that two teachers employed in the context of their own ESOL classrooms, in which form-focused instruction occurred, and explored the extent to which different levels of experience influenced the instructional decisions of two ESOL teachers.The results showed that there was a considerable amount of attention to form in lessons that purported to be 'communicative' and certainly were so. It also became clear that in these classes, a focus-on-form was not just a reactive phenomenon, it was also proactive since the students played an important part in both initiating and responding focus on form episodes. Much of the focus on form that arose was triggered by a problem in using English accurately, not by a problem in communication. That means that, although the lessons were 'communicative', the students regularly paid attention to language for its own sake.It is suggested that both pedagogy and teacher education/development may benefit from a perspective in which both good and not-so-good practice is seen as cognitive and reflective activity.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language - Study and teaching - Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">English Language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of systematic strategies for representing three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface</field><field name="creator">Jowett, David</field><field name="description">This project explores systematic strategies for establishing a definitive mode of representation in drawing.

The aims of this study are two-fold. First, the study examines the current human resource management (HRM) practices of selected family businesses in the country in areas of recruitment and selection, training and development, performance appraisal, and rewards. Second, it investigates differences in HRM practices of CFBs between the eastern-coastal and inland regions of the country. From a questionnaire survey of 205 CFBs operating in seven cities in two regions, this study has found that CFBs combine their traditional informal, relationship-based HR practices with western-style HR practices. Furthermore, both univariate and multivariate analyses have demonstrated significant regional differences in HRM, thus supporting the argument that a firm??s HR practices are shaped by institutions in which the firm operates. The findings of this study make important contributions to both research and practice. First, the findings have provided further evidence to the applicability of institutional theory to the explanation of HRM practices. Second, the study has also provided some practical implications for HR managers of firms, both domestic and foreign, in China. However, results of this study need to be interpreted with caution because external validity is sacrificed to an extent given its focus on family businesses, a non-probability sampling method and relatively small sample size. In addition, the cross-sectional approach adopted in the study fails to identify changes in HRM over time.  Despite the limitations, however, this study has contributed to the body of knowledge by enhancing our understanding of CFBs in China and their HRM that have been under-researched empirically.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family-owned business enterprises -- China</field><field name="subject">Family-owned business enterprises -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">Personnel management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building a theory of action from the philosophies of Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault</field><field name="creator">Kingston, Mark, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a theory of action, drawing chiefly on the work of Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault. I begin with a discussion of some popular theories of action. As I argue, these theories tend to suffer from three problems: they do not distinguish action from everyday behaviour, they do not account for the way in which action transforms the identity of the actor, and they tend to neglect the innovative and initiatory character of action. In chapter two, I discuss Arendt&#146;s theory of political action, which goes a long way toward redressing these problems. However, the value of Arend's work is limited by her characterisation of the public sphere as subsumed by a 'social' rather than political form of community. Accordingly, I follow Dana Villa and Bonnie Honig's suggestions that a broader understanding of action is required in order to overcome the weaknesses of Arendt's work. In chapters four and five, I demonstrate that a reading of Foucault can yield just such a broader understanding. I begin with an analysis of The History of Sexuality and the argument that the transformation of ethical subjectivity can function as a means of resistance to the normalising effects of power, before moving on to discuss the essay 'What Is Enlightenment?' I argue that these works are part of a 'transformative project,' in which Foucault aims to facilitate the transformation of subjectivity as a means of resistance to social normalisation. This transformative project can be adapted into a theory of action that locates action within contemporary society but shares some of the best aspects of Arendt's theory. Finally, drawing on the work of Foucault and Adriana Cavarero, these theoretical reflections are applied to a discussion of action in the context of small communities. Small-community models of action are an important consideration because they allow us to avoid the traditional dichotomy between action as a task for the individual who transgresses social norms and action as a project of social reform.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cavarero</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Arendt</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterisation of membrane transporters associated with saxitoxin biosynthesis in cyanobacteria</field><field name="creator">Pengelly, Jasper John Lobl, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The release of the neurotoxic alkaloid saxitoxin by cyanobacterial cells was previously thought to occur primarily after cell lysis, yet recent evidence also suggests active toxin export by membrane transporters.  Transporter proteins associated with STX biosynthesis in Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3 (sxtF and sxtM) and Anabaena circinalis 131C (naDt) were predicted to be involved in the export of STX from cyanobacterial cells.  The main aim of this project was to characterise the transporters associated with STX biosynthesis, by investigation of their genetic prevalence, functional substrates and specific regulation.	An sxtM homologue was discovered in A. circinalis 131C, as part of an sxt cluster, and found to be uniquely associated with STX-producing strains. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis showed that the translated sxt transporters clustered with the NorM prokaryotic MATE sub-family and membrane topology analysis predicted 12 membrane-spanning regions.  To characterise the functional substrates of the putative STX-transporters, they were heterologously expressed in the antibiotic-sensitive E. coli strain KAM32.  Expression of the sxt MATES complemented host sensitivity to the cationic fluroquinolone antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.  Disruption of gene homologues of naDt and the sxt MATE genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 yielded mutant strains with increased sensitivity to the toxic organic cations, methyl viologen and acriflavine.	Transcription of the putative STX transporters, and the putative STX biosynthesis gene sxtA, was studied in C. raciborskii T3 and A. circinalis 131C under alkali and Na+ stress. Alkali stress (pH 9) decreased total STX levels in A. circinalis 131C and was correlated with a down-regulation of the putative transport and biosynthetic genes.  In C. raciborskii T3, alkali stress promoted higher extracellular but lower intracellular STX levels, which also correlated with large increases in transcription of the putative STX transport genes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">Saxitoxin</field><field name="subject">MATE transporter</field><field name="subject">Anabaena</field><field name="subject">Cylindrospermopsis</field><field name="subject">Biosynthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE SMELL OF DISLOCATION -  AMBERGRIS, a novel, and The smell of dislocation: Olfactory imagery in selected works of Janette Turner Hospital</field><field name="creator">Petter, Sylvia Astrid, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">My thesis comprises a creative and a critical component. The creative component is a novel entitled Ambergris. Ambergris in both its synthetic and natural states is a fixative to contain the evanescence of scent; it is also a metaphor for my novel which is set against the background of perfume making and deals with expatriates and migrants. Through the formal structure of the novel I hope to make a contribution to literature and to engage with critical and social concerns of the expatriate condition such as the place of home, the experience of longing, and whether or not one can really &#145;belong&#146;. My critical essay is entitled "The Smell of Dislocation: Olfactory Imagery in Selected Works of Janette Turner Hospital". The words 'olfactory imagery' may seem to be a contradiction in terms due to the difficulty of containing scent and the paucity of olfactory language. Scent, however, has strong links to memory and place, and through its non-visual and associative qualities may bypass language. I argue that engagement with the representation of scent in fiction can expand the current categories of formalist criticism found in narrative theory and Creative Writing pedagogy. My essay examines how Janette Turner Hospital employs olfactory imagery in her &#145;Australian&#146; stories and novels to represent the recurring themes of dislocation underscoring the lives of many of her characters. Despite the difficulty of representing smell in fiction, I explore possibilities for thematic considerations triggered by the percept of smell as experienced by Janette Turner Hospital's characters, narrators, and possibly readers. Such explorations deal with the links between scent and memory, the liminality of both scent and the expatriate condition, as well as a narrative methodology which considers psychological and cognitive reactions to scent and culminates in their 'mapping' and the 'slippage' of personal associations.  Both thesis components examine expatriate identity and approach its fictional representation through the filter of expatriate perceptions. Awareness by readers of such perceptions may serve to amplify their own appreciation of the dislocation of such identities in fiction, and in our current world of growing and even shifting diasporas.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Janette Turner Hospital</field><field name="subject">Olfaction</field><field name="subject">Dislocation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein engineering of DNA polymerase I: thioredoxin dependent processivity</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Joyce, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">DNA polymerases are found in a diverse range of organisms, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, viruses and bacteriophage. T7 DNA polymerase is a replicative enzyme from E. coli bacteriophage T7. It relies on the thioredoxin binding domain (TBD) of phage gene 5 protein (gp5) and E. coli thioredoxin (Trx) for processive replication of phage DNA. Although T7 DNA polymerase is processive, it is also thermolabile. In order to design a thermostable and processive DNA polymerase, the structural stabilities of the TBD and Trx were studied in respect to their binding affinity and affect on enzyme processivity. An artificial operon was designed for coexpression of subunits of T7 DNA polymerase. By means of a 9??His-tag at the amino terminus of gp5, T7 DNA polymerase complex was purified by one-step nickel-agarose chromatography, with subunits gp5 and Trx co-eluting in a one to one molar ratio. Purified T7 DNA polymerase was assayed for polymerase activity, processivity and residual activity and compared to the commercial T7 DNA polymerase. The two enzymes were not identical with commercial T7 DNA polymerase being less processive at 37??C. Mass spectrometry of the two enzymes identified a mutation of Phe102 to Ser in the Trx subunit (TrxS102) of commercial T7 DNA polymerase. The Ser102 mutation, was found near the carboxyl terminal helix of Trx. TrxS102 was less stable than wild type Trx. In the study of the TBD structural stability, a hybrid polymerase was constructed by inserting the TBD motif into the homologous position in the Stoffel fragment of Taq DNA polymerase. The hybrid enzyme was coexpressed with Trx from an artificial operon; however, the TBD inserted retained a mesophilic binding affinity to Trx. The chimeric polymerase required 100 molar excess of Trx for processive polymerase activity at 60??C. TBD structural deformation at elevated temperatures was hypothesized to be the cause of the change in the subunit stoichiometry. Mutagenesis of TBD would be required to increase its thermostability. An efficient, rapid high throughput mutagenesis method (SLIM) was invented and would be appropriate for further studies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA polymerases</field><field name="subject">protein engineering</field><field name="subject">thioredoxin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transglutaminase II: an integrator of fibroblast adhesion pathways in wound healing.</field><field name="creator">Mearns, Bryony Megan, BABS, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transglutaminase II (TG2) is a complex protein with five different reported activities.  Increases in TG2 expression and TGase activity have previously been observed during wound healing in rat studies; however, it has been unclear whether these phenomena were directly involved in the healing process or if they were simply a by-product of it.  The aims of this thesis were, thus, to determine if TG2 plays a role in wound healing in vivo and to elucidate the mechanism of any effects TG2 may have at the cellular level.  TG2 ablation resulted in delayed wound healing.  To gain mechanistic insight into this abnormality, primary fibroblast cultures from TG2-knockout and wildtype mouse embryos were analysed.  TG2-null fibroblasts displayed decreased adhesion and integrin signalling during initial stages of adhesion.  Intriguingly, TG2-null cells showed faster activation of Rac1 and RhoA in response to adhesion.  Long-term adhesion of TG2-null fibroblasts resulted in increased basal phosphorylation of FAK and number of paxillin-stained focal adhesions, enhanced PI3-kinase signalling, faster actin dynamics and altered activation of p44/42 MAPK.  These results are indicative of futile cycling of intracellular signalling pathways resulting from reduced focal adhesion turnover in the TG2-knockout fibroblasts.  Rescue experiments demonstrated that TG2-mediated effects on cell adhesion occurred in the extracellular environment and that neither GTP-binding nor TGase activity is required for these effects.  Results further showed that a ???compact??? conformation of TG2 was not required for this role of TG2.  Interestingly, addition of recombinant TG2 to the extracellular environment increased cell spreading of TG2-null cells to a level far greater than that seen in wildtype cells, which did not increase their spreading in response to exogenous TG2.  Demonstration of faster activation of the small GTPases in the TG2-null MEFs, and the apparent inhibition of exogenous TG2???s extracellular effects on cell spreading by endogenous protein in the wildtype cells, provide tantalising evidence for a role for intracellular TG2 in regulating activation of the small GTPases to promote efficient fibroblast migration.  This work identifies TG2 as a facilitator of efficient wound closure through extracellular effects on integrin-mediated signalling and intracellular effects on activation of the small GTPases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transglutaminase</field><field name="subject">adhesion</field><field name="subject">cell spreading</field><field name="subject">wound healing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NMR DIFFUSION MEASUREMENTS OF COMPARTMENTALIZED AND MULTICOMPONENT BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS: Studies of Tropoelastin, the Self Association of N Methylacetamide, and q-Space Analysis of Real and Model Cell Suspensions</field><field name="creator">Regan, David Gabriel</field><field name="description">Molecular diffusion is an inherent feature of all fluid systems. The processes and interactions that characterize these systems are in some way dependent upon the mobility of the component molecules. Pulsed field-gradient spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance (PGSE NMR) is a powerful tool for the study of molecular diffusion; for heterogeneous systems, such as those typically found in biology, this technique is unsurpassed in the diversity of systems that yield to its probing. The aim of the work presented in this thesis was to use an integrated NMR-based approach, in conjunction with computer modeling, for the study of molecular diffusion in compartmentalized and multicomponent biological systems.  Erythrocyte suspensions provided an ideal experimental system for the study of compartmentalized diffusion in cells. Water exchanges rapidly between the intra- and extracellular regions and, as the major constituent of the cell, provides a strong and predominant proton NMR signal. In addition, the cells are known to align in the strong static magnetic field of the spectrometer. As a consequence of these two properties, the signal intensity from a suitably designed series of PGSE NMR experiments exhibits a series of maxima and minima when graphed as a function of the magnitude of the spatial wave number vector q. The apparently periodic phenomenon is mathematically analogous to optical diffraction and interference and is referred to here as diffusion-coherence. It is the characterization of this phenomenon, with the aid of computer-based models, which was the focus of a major section of the work described herein.  Two quite distinct molecular systems formed the basis of the work in which I investigated diffusion in multicomponent systems. Both systems involved molecules that undergo self-association such that at equilibrium a population distribution of different oligomeric species is present. The first of these was tropoelastin, the monomeric subunit of elastin, which under certain conditions aggregates to form a coacervate. The second system was N-methylacetamide (NMA) which also undergoes extensive self-association. NMA oligomers have previously been studied as peptide analogues due to the presence in the monomer of a peptide linkage. In this work the aim was to use PGSE NMR diffusion measurements, in a manner that is in many ways analogous to analytical ultracentrifugation, to obtain estimates of hydrodynamic and thermodynamic parameters. Computer modeling was also used extensively in this section of work for the interpretation of the experimental data.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">q-space;diffusion;tropoelastin;N-methylacetamide;nuclear magnetic resonance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Irish Astronomical Tract: A Case Study of Scientific Terminology in 14th Century Irish</field><field name="creator">Williams, John Alfred</field><field name="description">SYNOPSIS Included in this work, is a general historical overview of the development of astronomical knowledge in the West from the realms of Greek scholarship in classical times through to the Renaissance and the threshold of modern physics. The subject matter of both the Irish Tract and this review extends beyond the strict confines of astronomy, encompassing the physical sciences in general. The extent of astronomical knowledge in medieval Ireland is given specific attention with a review of scholarly works in Latin since the seventh century. This includes a number of specialist studies on astronomical topics and related cosmographical fields. Also included are numerous incidental references to astronomical matters from both Irish and Latin literature during the Middle Ages. Attention is devoted to the surviving manuscript copies of the Tract and the question of its sources, origin and purpose. A possible Dominican context for the compilation and dissemination of the Tract is considered. A detailed commentary of the technical content of each chapter is presented, together with reference to contemporary developments in the West and to the occasional clues as to the institutional, geographical and chronological origins of the Tract. A study of the technical terminology used by the Irish compiler is presented in detail. Reference is made both to earlier Irish terminology where appropriate, as well as to the limitations imposed by the fact that many of the scientific concepts were yet to attain clarity that came with the advent of Newtonian physics, Copernican astronomy and post-Colombian geography. The data entries on ms Stowe B are evaluated and compared with computer generated data of astronomical movements in the 14th and 15th centuries with a view to ascertaining the time of compilation of the Tract and its working life. A A revised English translation of the Tract is included in the appendices together with Maxwell Close's unpublished commentary to relevant portions. An Irish edition, closely following the ITS edition of 1914 is also included. Corruptions to the text are footnoted together with the likely run of the original text.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irish Astronomical Tract;Irish Scientific Terminology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular aspects of biomolecule structure and function</field><field name="creator">Rodger, Alison</field><field name="description">All biological processes are fundamentally inter-molecular interactions.

This thesis examines the effects of delay and risk on personal investment decisions. The delay discounting literature is employed in developing a new parameter &#65533;ki&#65533; which integrates an investment&#65533;s term and interest rate with the hyperbolic delay discounting model. By indicating the extent to which compound interest growth compensates for hyperbolic delay discounting, ki should strongly predict the subjective appeal of prospective investment returns. Six binary-choice experiments test this hypothesis, especially via a subsidiary hypothesis that exponential growth from compound interest will eventually compensate for delay, given a sufficient term. Analyses include a novel application of signal detection principles, which found ki a superior predictor of investment appraisals compared to the normative exponential delay discounting model. Subject to boundary conditions of term and investment amount, results support the predictive capacity of ki for gross returns, implying a hitherto unrecognised degree of predictability for investment decisions. To investigate perceptions of risk with delay, three additional experiments compared preferences among hypothetical investments with varying risk and term. Risk seeking and risk aversion were detected, consistent with individual differences in hyperbolic probability discounting rates. Excessive risk aversion proved the greater problem, encouraging unnecessarily conservative investment decisions. Unexpectedly, no evidence of delay discounted risk was found. Responses consistent with higher probability discounting of larger amounts occurred, but only for a longer rather than a shorter investment term. A survey of postgraduate finance students examined how investment past performance is interpreted. Participants evaluated annual returns from hypothetical 10-year investments that varied in their mean return, volatility, and sequence of high and low returns. Evaluations generally reflected underlying investment properties. Maladaptive appraisal tendencies included unwarranted attention to the order in which high and low returns occurred within a series. Overall for this dissertation, results suggest that delay and probability discounting theory has practical relevance for understanding personal investment decisions. The principles and methodology in this dissertation are applicable to other varieties of financial and consumer behaviour.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personal finance;investment;delay discounting;probability discounting;decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mediating Modernity - Henry Black and Narrated Hybridity in Meiji Japan</field><field name="creator">McArthur, Ian Douglas</field><field name="description">Henry Black was born in Adelaide in 1858, but arrived in Japan in 1864 after his father became editor of the Japan Herald. In the late 1870s, Henry Black addressed meetings of members of the Freedom and People&#65533;s Rights Movement. His talks were inspired by nineteenth-century theories of natural rights. That experience led to his becoming a professional storyteller (rakugoka) affiliated with the San&#65533;y&#65533; school of storytelling (San&#65533;yuha).   Black&#65533;s storytelling (rakugo) in the 1880s and 1890s was an attempt by the San&#65533;y&#65533;ha to modernise rakugo. By adapting European sensation fiction, Black blended European and Japanese elements to create hybridised landscapes and characters as blueprints for audiences negotiating changes synonymous with modernity during the Meiji period. The narrations also portrayed the negative impacts of change wrought through emulation of nineteenth-century Britain&#65533;s Industrial Revolution. His 1894 adaptation of Oliver Twist or his 1885 adaptation of Mary Braddon&#65533;s Flower and Weed, for example, were early warnings about the evils of child labour and the exploitation of women in unregulated textile factories.   Black&#65533;s kabuki performances parallel politically and artistically inspired attempts to reform kabuki by elevating its status as an art suitable for imperial and foreign patronage. The printing of his narrations in stenographic books (sokkibon) ensured that his ideas reached a wide audience.    Because he was not an officially hired foreigner (yatoi), and his narrations have not entered the rakugo canon, Black has largely been forgotten. A study of his role as a mediator of modernity during the 1880s and 1890s shows that he was an agent in the transfer to a mass audience of European ideas associated with modernity, frequently ahead of intellectuals and mainstream literature. An examination of Black&#65533;s career helps broaden our knowledge of the role of foreigners and rakugo in shaping modern Japan.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rakugo;Japan;Meiji period;storytelling;modernity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary structural optimisation as a robust and reliable design tool</field><field name="creator">Proos, Kaarel Andres</field><field name="description">Evolutionary Structural Optimisation (ESO) is a relatively new design tool used to improve and optimise the design of structures.  It is a heuristic method where a few elements of an initial design domain of finite elements are iteratively removed.  Such a process is carried out repeatedly until an optimum design is achieved, or until a desired given area or volume is reached.    There have been many contributions to the ESO procedure since its conception back in 1992.  For example, a provision known as Bi-Directional ESO (BESO) has now been incorporated where elements may not only be removed, but added.  Also, rather than deal with elements where they are either present or not, the designer now has the option to change the element's properties in a progressive fashion.  This includes the modulus of elasticity, the density of the material and the thickness of plate elements, and is known as Morphing ESO.  In addition to the algorithmic aspects of ESO, a large preference exists to optimise a structure based on a selection of criteria for various physical processes.  Such examples include stress minimisation, buckling and electromagnetic problems.    In a changing world that demands the enhancement of design tools and methods that incorporate optimisation, the development of methods like ESO to accommodate this demand is called for.  It is this demand that this thesis seeks to satisfy.  This thesis develops and examines the concept of multicriteria optimisation in the ESO process.  Taking into account the optimisation of numerous criteria simultaneously, Multicriteria ESO allows a more realistic and accurate approach to optimising a model in any given environment.    Two traditional methods &#65533; the Weighting method and the Global Criterion (Min-max) method have been used, as has two unconventional methods &#65533; the Logical AND method and the Logical OR method.  These four methods have been examined for different combinations of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) solver types.  This has included linear static FEA solver, the natural frequency FEA solver and a recently developed inertia FE solver.  Mean compliance minimisation (stiffness maximisation), frequency maximisation and moment of inertia maximisation are an assortment of the specific objectives incorporated.  Such a study has provided a platform to use many other criteria and multiple combinations of criteria.    In extending the features of ESO, and hence its practical capabilities as a design tool, the creation of another optimisation method based on ESO has been ushered in.  This method concerns the betterment of the bending and rotational performance of cross-sectional areas and is known as Evolutionary Moment of Inertia Optimisation (EMIO).  Again founded upon a domain of finite elements, the EMIO method seeks to either minimise or maximise the rectangular, product and polar moments of inertia.  This dissertation then goes one step further to include the EMIO method as one of the objectives considered in Multicriteria ESO as mentioned above.    Most structures, (if not all) in reality are not homogenous as assumed by many structural optimisation methods.  In fact, many structures (particularly biological ones) are composed of different materials or the same material with continually varying properties.  In this thesis, a new feature called Constant Width Layer (CWL) ESO is developed, in which a distinct layer of material evolves with the developing boundary.  During the optimisation process, the width of the outer surrounding material remains constant and is defined by the user.    Finally, in verifying its usefulness to the practical aspect of design, the work presented herein applies the CWL ESO and the ESO methods to two dental case studies.  They concern the optimisation of an anterior (front of the mouth) ceramic dental bridge and the optimisation of a posterior (back of the mouth) ceramic dental bridge.  Comparisons of these optimised models are then made to those developed by other methods.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evolutionary structural optimisation;multiple criteria;optimisation;Pareto;inertia;dental bridge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and Molecular Biological Studies in Hirschsprung's Disease</field><field name="creator">Croaker, Geoffrey David Hain</field><field name="description">HSCR has been felt to be a polygeneic disease on the basis of an incompletely penetrant sex modified transmission, which may be either autosomal dominant or recessive in different kindred.

This thesis records how such issues are reflected in contemporary literature, focusing on the emergence of popular culture and the best seller, a term which conflates author and novel. The first English best seller was Marie Corelli and, by way of introduction, Part I offers a summary of her life and her novels and a critical overview of her work.  Part II of the thesis examines how the theory of evolution undermined traditional religious belief and prompted the search for a new creed able to defy materialism and reconcile science and religion. Contemporary literature mirrors the consequent interest in spiritualism during the 1890s and the period immediately following the Great War, and critical readings of Corelli&#65533;s A Romance of Two Worlds and The Life Everlasting demonstrate that these novels - which form the nucleus of her personal theology, the Electric Creed - are based on selections from the New Testament, occultism and, in particular, science and spiritualism.  Part III of the thesis looks at the emergence of &#65533;the woman question&#65533;, the corresponding backlash by conservatives and the ways in which these conflicting views are explored in the popular literature of the time. A critical examination of the novella, My Wonderful Wife, reveals how Corelli uses social Darwinism in an ambivalent critique of the New Woman. Several of Corelli&#65533;s essays are discussed, showing that her views about the role of women were complex. A critical analysis of The Secret Power engages with Corelli&#65533;s peculiar kind of feminism, which would deny women the vote but envisages female scientists inventing and operating airships in order to secure the future of the human race.   Interest in Marie Corelli has re-emerged recently, particularly in occult and feminist circles. Corelli&#65533;s immense popularity also makes her an important figure in cultural studies. This thesis adds to the body of knowledge about Corelli in that it consciously endeavours to avoid spiritualist or feminist ideological frameworks, instead using contemporary science as a context for examining her work.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victorian literature;Edwardian literature;science and religion;science and spiritualism;science and feminism;science and literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct simulation studies of suspended particles and fibre-filled suspensions</field><field name="creator">Joung, Clint Gwarngsoo</field><field name="description">A new Direct Simulation &#64257;bre model was developed which allowed &#64258;exibility  in the &#64257;bre during the simulation of &#64257;bre suspension &#64258;ow.This new model  was called the &#65533;Chain-of-Spheres &#65533;model.It was hypothesised that particle  shape and deformation could signi &#64257;cantly a &#64256;ect partic e dynamics,and also  suspension bulk properties such as viscosity.Data collected from the simulation showed that &#64258;exible &#64257;bres in shear &#64258;ow resulted in an order of 7 &#8722;10%  bulk relative viscosity increase over the &#65533;rigid &#65533;&#64257;bre result.Results also es-  tablished the existence of a relationship between bulk viscosity and particle  sti &#64256;ness.In comparison with experimental results,other more conventional  rigid &#64257;bre based methods appeared to underpredict relative viscosity.The  &#64258;exible &#64257;bre method thus markedly improved the ability to estimate relative  viscosity.The curved rigid &#64257;bre suspension also exhibited increased viscosity  of the order twice that of the equivalent straight rigid &#64257;bre suspension.With  such sensitivity to &#64257;bre shape,this result has some important implications  for the quality of &#64257;bre inclusions used.For consistent viscosity,the shape  quality of the &#64257;bres was shown to be important.  The &#65533;Chain of Spheres &#65533;simulation was substantially extended to create a  new simulation method with the ability to model the dynamics of arbitrarily  shaped particles in the Newtonian &#64258;ow &#64257;eld.This new &#65533;3D Particle &#65533;simulation method accounted for the inertial force on the particles,and also allowed  particles to be embedded in complex &#64258;ow &#64257;elds.This method was used to  reproduce known dynamics for common particle shapes,and then to predict  the unknown dynamics of various other particle shapes in shear &#64258;ow.

This decision to engage proactively with human rights was a radical expansion of the profession&#65533;s self-conception.     Applying an action research methodology, this study traces the development and implementation of the Free Access to Information and Freedom of Expression (FAIFE) initiative.  It traces the origins of the decision, and assesses the outcomes of its first five years as it developed from a project into a continuing and central program of the Federation.  Both the internal effects on IFLA and the consequences of the project for the profession of librarianship are explored.      The thesis locates the key decision in the history of librarianship, its growth as a profession paralleling the development of libraries as institutions.  In turn, the decision is also located in IFLA&#65533;s own history, and the way it survived and worked to advance the ideas and tools of librarianship amid difficult and changing international environments.     The politics of professionalism is at the core of the study.  The disturbing innovation which FAIFE represented took IFLA outside its traditional focus on the status and techniques of the profession, postulating a new role for the Federation.  By investing librarianship with a higher responsibility, it has gone further than the now widely accepted expectation that professionals will place community interests before organisational and personal interests at all times.  The responsibility to promote the fundamental human right to information has been embraced as the key principle underlying and informing library and information service, the touchstone for evaluating professional priorities.  This locates the primary purpose of the profession outside the profession&#65533;s institutional base in a supranational, absolute and almost universally recognised social goal.        Adopting these aspirations and this role carried many dangers for IFLA.  It would inevitably seem a deviation into politics by some.  It heightened the risks of both internal dissent and external criticism.  It challenged the habitus of disinterested professionalism by invoking a more interventionist social responsibility for IFLA, its constituent library associations and the broader profession. It drew on evolving and contested understandings of professional responsibilities in a complex global environment and has redrawn the accepted boundaries of professional discourse in librarianship.       At least so far, the consequences have been beneficial for IFLA, reinforcing its jurisdiction and strengthening the Federation.  As an international federation of professional associations, IFLA faces particular challenges in working across diverse national traditions, ideologies and cultures.  Its existence and effectiveness rest primarily on internal cohesiveness.  Its capacity to develop the FAIFE initiative into a program without schism, and indeed with growing support, has strengthened rather than weakened its organisational capacities.  Through that process IFLA has reinvented itself, to a considerable degree, as a form of transnational social movement organisation.  It has developed strong relationships with other civil society organisations while maintaining its position as a respected international professional body.  It has strengthened its position by becoming a vigorous advocate for the right to information, thereby becoming an actor in the growing international concern with human rights.     This study of a decisive period in IFLA&#65533;s history offers a rare example of an international professional association in transition.  In examining this project to promote unrestricted access to information as the reciprocal right of freedom of expression, the research is a case study of the politics of an expanding sense of professionalism.  IFLA&#65533;s experience is pertinent to a range of other organisations, and is itself part of the realignment of international political discourse in response to the growing influence of international organisations and the priority of human rights in international political agendas.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">freedom of expression;human rights;librarianship;freedom of information</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of an Analog VLSI Cochlea</field><field name="creator">Shiraishi, Hisako</field><field name="description">The cochlea is an organ which extracts frequency information from the input sound wave. It also produces nerve signals, which are further analysed by the brain and ultimately lead to perception of the sound.  An existing model of the cochlea by Fragni`ere is first analysed by simulation. This passive model is found to have the properties that the living cochlea does in terms of the frequency response.  An analog VLSI circuit implementation of this cochlear model in CMOS weak inversion is proposed, using log-domain filters in current domain. It is fabricated on a chip and a measurement of a basilar membrane section is performed. The measurement shows a reasonable agreement to the model. However, the circuit is found to have a problem related to transistor mismatch, causing different behaviour in identical circuit blocks.  An active cochlear model is proposed to overcome this problem. The model incorporates the effect of the outer hair cells in the living cochlea, which controls the quality factor of the basilar membrane filters. The outer hair cells are incorporated as an extra voltage source in series with the basilar membrane resonator. Its value saturates as the input signal becomes larger, making the behaviour rather closer to that of a passive model. The simulation results show this nonlinear phenomenon, which is also seen in the living cochlea.  The contribution of this thesis is summarised as follows: a) the first CMOS weak inversion current domain basilar membrane resonator is designed and fabricated, and b) the first active two-dimensional cochlear model for analog VLSI implementation is developed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analog VLSI;2-D;cochlea;CMOS weak inversion;log-domain filter;outer hair cells</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temperature-dependent sex determination in the viviparous lizard Eulamprus tympanum</field><field name="creator">Robert, Kylie Anne</field><field name="description">Abstract        There are a remarkable variety of sex determination systems among different animal taxa. In most animals, sex is determined chromosomally. Although in an increasing number of animals sex determination has been found to be influenced primarily by the environment. Species with genotypic sex determination (GSD) have their sex determined at the time of fertilization, by genetic factors alone and those with environmental sex determination (ESD) have their sex determined by environmental factors that act after fertilization. Temperature-dependent Sex Determination (TSD), whereby the sex of the developing embryos depends on the temperature at which they develop is widespread in oviparous reptiles and occurs in all crocodilians, marine turtles and tuatara examined to date and is common in many freshwater turtles and lizards.    SECTION ONE  Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) was never expected to occur in viviparous reptiles, as thermoregulation by pregnant females would result in relatively stable gestation temperatures. Temperature-dependent sex determination and viviparity goes against all the basic assumptions that TSD occurs in oviparous reptiles where temperatures within a nest vary widely. However, skewed sex ratios as a result of incubation temperature indicated the possibility of TSD in the viviparous lizard Eulamprus tympanum. In my first experiments I show the first recorded case of a viviparous reptile with TSD. The developing embryos of the viviparous skink E. tympanum are subject to TSD, with gestation temperature having a highly significant effect on sex and warmer temperatures giving rise to male offspring (Chapter 1).     Sex is fully determined at the time of birth and can be differentiated histologically into testes or ovaries (Chapter 2). The morphology and histological characteristics of the gonads of neonatal E. tympanum resulting from the treatment temperatures described in chapter 1 illustrate that sex in E. tympanum is easily distinguished at the time of birth and corresponds with the presence or absence of hemipenes. Males are histologically characterised by an elongated gonad consisting of seminiferous tubules with either no cortical epithelium or, if present at all, in a very thin band. If they are present, M&#65533;llerian ducts, showing signs of degeneration, are attached to the kidney by a shortened mesosalpinx. Females are histologically characterised by an irregularly shaped gonad consisting of a thick cortical epithelium that occasionally contains oocytes. The M&#65533;llerian ducts are obvious structures attached to the kidney by a fibrous mesosalpinx. The presence or absence of hemipenes is a reliable technique for determining sex in newborn E. tympanum. Sex determination is easiest to perform on neonates within the first few days of birth as hemipenes become increasingly difficult to evert as neonates age, however, with practice they are easily identified without full eversion.    SECTION TWO  The thermal biology of E. tympanum in the field is restricted by both the thermal properties of their habitat (Chapter 3) and behavioural modifications when faced with a predation threat (Chapter 4).     The available temperatures in the field suggest that TSD is biologically relevant in the species and not just a laboratory artefact; E. tympanum can attain mean selected temperatures achieved in the laboratory but the proportion of time at the temperature is restricted. Females actively thermoregulate in the field, although they are restricted in their efficiency of thermoregulation by environmental constraints, for example, microhabitat structure, weather conditions, predator avoidance and social ranking. The highly territorial nature and high densities of E. tympanum present in Kanangra Boyd National Park potentially force less dominant individuals into less favourable habitats that are significantly cooler. An important point is that gravid females in more favourable habitats in the period encompassing the middle third of development (the assumed sex determining period) are selecting higher temperatures, with lower variance and have greater thermoregulatory efficiency than during the rest of pregnancy, therefore, thermoregulating more precisely during this thermosensitive period (Chapter 3).     Chemosensory cues provide important information on the risk of predation. Hence, chemoreception is a common mechanism used by many species to detect the presence of, and subsequently respond to, a potential predator. The perceived risk of predation may force retreat to sub-optimal conditions, forcing a trade-off between the risk of predation and the ability to acquire resources. The basking regime maintained by gravid female E. tympanum, can directly alter sex ratios of offspring produced through temperature-dependent sex determination (Chapter 1). The avoidance of predator scents may restrict basking ability and in turn alter the sex of offspring produced. I measured responsiveness to chemical cues using tongue flicks as an indicator of chemical discrimination in females of different reproductive condition. I then measured activity and basking behaviour of gravid and non-gravid females in experimental enclosures in the presence of various chemical stimuli to determine if basking opportunity is compromised by the presence of a predator scent. Females respond differently depending upon reproductive condition, with gravid females responding most significantly to a predator scent. Activity, basking frequency, and time spent in the open (basking duration) are significantly reduced in gravid females in the presence of a predator stimulus. Under laboratory conditions, gravid females modify their behaviour and forego the opportunity to bask when there is a perceived predation risk (Chapter 4).    SECTION THREE  As female viviparous reptiles can regulate the temperature of the embryo by maternal temperature selection (Chapter 1), the occurrence of TSD in E. tympanum opens the possibility for females to select the sex of offspring. Reproducing females may benefit by facultatively adjusting their investment into sons over daughters or vice versa, in response to population wide shifts in adult sex ratios. Female E. tympanum, can manipulate the sex of their offspring in response to sex imbalances in the population using temperature-dependent sex determination (Chapter 5). When adult males are scarce, females produce male-biased litters and when adult males are common, females produce female-biased litters. The cues used by a female to assess the adult population are not known, but presumably depends upon the female&#65533;s experience throughout the breeding season and is the subject of further investigation (Chapter 6). The maternal manipulation of offspring sex ratio in E. tympanum suggests a selective advantage of temperature-dependent sex determination.    Any facultative sex ratio response needs to recognise the scarcity of one sex in order to overproduce that sex in the next generation; offspring sex ratio will vary inversely with adult sex ratio. Maternal sex allocation in E. tympanum is linked with population (or adult) sex ratio (Chapter 5), and one of the mechanisms by which females recognise an imbalance may be linked to visual recognition of males (Chapter 6). Females maintained throughout pregnancy without any male stimulus produce entirely male offspring (Chapter 5). In contrast females exposed to male stimulus produce both sexes (Chapter 5). Females respond differently to varying degrees of male stimulus and visual recognition of males in a population may be more important than chemoreception. In the absence of visual cues, females produce more male offspring, even when chemosensory cues are present (Chapter 6).    The study system presented here offers many advantages over oviparous species with TSD, due to E. tympanum being relatively short lived and fast maturing. Thus, the fitness consequences over multiple generations as a result of gestation can be investigated. Viviparity allows maternal control of embryonic temperature during gestation and a means of maternal sex allocation. Until now the maternal side of TSD and sex allocation has been where the mother deposits her eggs and the allocation of sex steroid hormones at oviposition, both of which have been difficult to study. The work presented and the study system itself should inspire great interest in TSD and viviparous reptiles.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Viviparous;Lizard;TSD;Temperature-dependent sex determination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colour Terms, Syntax and Bayes Modelling Acquisition and Evolution</field><field name="creator">Dowman, Mike</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates language acquisition and evolution, using the methodologies of Bayesian inference and expression-induction modelling, making specific reference to colour term typology, and syntactic acquisition. In order to test Berlin and Kay&#65533;s (1969) hypothesis that the typological patterns observed in basic colour term systems are produced by a process of cultural evolution under the influence of universal aspects of human neurophysiology, an expression-induction model was created. Ten artificial people were simulated, each of which was a computational agent. These people could learn colour term denotations by generalizing from examples using Bayesian inference, and the resulting denotations had the prototype properties characteristic of basic colour terms. Conversations between these people, in which they learned from one-another, were simulated over several generations, and the languages emerging at the end of each simulation were investigated. The proportion of colour terms of each type correlated closely with the equivalent frequencies found in the World Colour Survey, and most of the emergent languages could be placed on one of the evolutionary trajectories proposed by Kay and Maffi (1999). The simulation therefore demonstrates how typological patterns can emerge as a result of learning biases acting over a period of time. Further work applied the minimum description length form of Bayesian inference to modelling syntactic acquisition. The particular problem investigated was the acquisition of the dative alternation in English. This alternation presents a learnability paradox, because only some verbs alternate, but children typically do not receive reliable evidence indicating which verbs do not participate in the alternation (Pinker, 1989). The model presented in this thesis took note of the frequency with which each verb occurred in each subcategorization, and so was able to infer which subcategorizations were conspicuously absent, and so presumably ungrammatical. Crucially, it also incorporated a measure of grammar complexity, and a preference for simpler grammars, so that more general grammars would be learned unless there was sufficient evidence to support the incorporation of some restriction. The model was able to learn the correct subcategorizations for both alternating and non-alternating verbs, and could generalise to allow novel verbs to appear in both constructions. When less data was observed, it also overgeneralized the alternation, which is a behaviour characteristic of children when they are learning verb subcategorizations. These results demonstrate that the dative alternation is learnable, and therefore that universal grammar may not be necessary to account for syntactic acquisition. Overall, these results suggest that the forms of languages may be determined to a much greater extent by learning, and by cumulative historical changes, than would be expected if the universal grammar hypothesis were correct.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">colour terms;syntax;Bayes Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A CLINICAL STUDY OF INHALANT ANAESTHESIA IN DOGS</field><field name="creator">Pottie, Robert George</field><field name="description">A clinical trial was undertaken using three different inhalant anaesthetic agents and one intravenous anaesthetic agent in dogs undergoing routine desexing surgery.   Healthy adult dogs undergoing either ovariohysterectomy or castration were assessed as to their demeanour, with the more excitable dogs being placed in groups receiving premedication with acepromazine and morphine. All dogs were then randomly assigned an anaesthetic agent for induction of general anaesthesia. The agents were the inhalants halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane, and the intravenous agent propofol. Inhalant inductions were undertaken using a tight fitting mask attached to a standard anaesthetic machine with a rebreathing circuit, with the maximum dose of inhalant available from a standard vaporiser. Propofol inductions were undertaken via intravenous catheter. Dogs induced with propofol were randomly assigned one of the three inhalant agents for maintenance. Those induced by inhalant agent were maintained using the same agent. The surgical procedure was undertaken in standard fashion, as was recovery from anaesthesia. All dogs received the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent meloxicam.  Data collection was divided into three stages: induction, maintenance, and recovery from anaesthesia. Variables measured at induction of anaesthesia were time to intubation, number of intubation attempts, tolerance of mask, quality of induction and quality of transfer to the maintenance stage. Standard variables for monitoring of anaesthesia were recorded throughout the maintenance of anaesthesia. Variables measured at recovery were time to righting, time to standing and quality of recovery.  The mean time to intubation when using the newer inhalant sevoflurane (196.2 &#65533; 14.8sec, mean &#65533; SE) was not significantly different to that for halothane (221.4 &#65533; 14.0sec) or isoflurane (172.4 &#65533; 15.0sec). Time to intubation with isoflurane was significantly faster than with halothane. Mean time to intubation with propofol (85.4 &#65533; 7.7sec) was significantly faster than that for any of the three inhalants. Choice of inhalant had no effect on quality of induction. The use of premedication significantly improved the quality of induction.  The use of propofol for induction likewise significantly improved the quality of induction.   Standard cardiorespiratory variables measured during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia remained within normal clinical ranges for all three inhalants, and were therefore not further analysed.   Choice of inhalant agent had no significant effect on the time to righting or standing in recovery. The use of propofol for induction had no effect on these variables. Animals placed in groups receiving premedication had significantly longer times to righting and standing. The oesophageal temperature at the end of the procedure had a significant effect on times to righting and standing, with lower temperatures contributing to slower recoveries. Independent of procedure time, male dogs had shorter times to righting than female dogs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anaesthesia;dog;halothane;isoflurane;sevofurane;propofol;induction;recovery;temperature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compression Stability of High Strength Steel Sections with Low Strain-Hardening</field><field name="creator">YANG, Demao</field><field name="description">Thin-walled steel sections made from high strength thin cold-reduced G550 steel to Australian Standard AS 1397-1993 under compression are investigated experimentally and theoretically in this thesis.    This thesis describes three series of compression tests performed on box-section stub columns, box-section long columns and lipped channel section columns cold-formed from high strength steel plates in 0.42 mm or 0.60 mm thickness with nominal yield stress of 550 MPa. The tests presented in this thesis formed  part of an Australian Research Council research project entitled: Compression Stability of High Strength Steel Sections with Low Strain-Hardening.    For the fix-ended stub column tests, a total of 94 lipped-square and hexagonal section stub columns were tested to study the influence of low strain hardening of G550 steel on the compressive section capacities of the column members. For the pin-ended long column tests, a total of 28 box-section columns were tested to study the stability of members with sections which undergo local instability at loads significantly less than the ultimate loads. For the fix-ended lipped channel section columns, a total of 21 stub and long columns were tested to study the failure resulting from local and distortional buckling with interaction between the modes.    A numerical simulation on the three series of tests using the commercial finite element computer program ABAQUS is also presented as part of this thesis. The post-buckling behaviour of thin-walled compression members is investigated. The effect of changing variables, such as geometric imperfections and end boundary conditions is also investigated. The ABAQUS analysis gives accurate simulations of the tests and is in good agreement to the experimental results.     Theoretical studies using finite strip methods are presented in this thesis to investigate the buckling behaviour of cold-formed members in compression. The theoretical studies provide valuable information on the local and distortional buckling stresses for use in the interaction buckling studies. The finite strip models used are the semi-analytical and spline models.    As expected for the stub columns tests, the greatest effect of low strain hardening was for the stockier sections where material properties play an important role. For the more slender sections where elastic local buckling and post-local buckling are more important, the effect of low strain hardening does not appear to be as significant. The pin-ended and fix-ended long column tests show that interaction, which is between local and overall buckling in the box sections, and between local and distortional buckling in the open channel sections, has a significant effect on their member capacities.    The results of the successful column tests and ABAQUS simulation have been compared with the design procedures in the Australian &amp; New Zealand Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structures AS&amp;NZS 4600 and the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members prepared by the American Iron and Steel Institute. The stub column tests show that the current design rules give too conservative predictions on the compressive section capacities of the column members; whereas the long column tests show that the current column design rules are unconservative if used in their current form for G550 steel.     Three design proposals are presented in this thesis to account for the effects of high strength thin steels on the section and member capacities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High Strength Steel;Compression;Stub Column;Long Column;Local Buckling;Distortional Buckling;Interaction;Box and Lipped Channel Sections</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comparative Analysis of Socio-Legal and Psycho-Social Theories and the Construction of a Model to Explain How Law Operates and Evolves in the Dependency Court</field><field name="creator">Sinclair, Kate</field><field name="description">This thesis examines data and theory about how the system of law (SL) operates and evolves:  it contrasts data from social workers and attorneys working in the juvenile dependency court with theories about how individuals and social systems evolve.  The analysis is based on research conducted in San Diego and revolves around a theory about human development, or the "individual as a system" (HD), and a theory about social systems, such as the autopoietic theory of law and its self-reproducing system (LA).  It is suggested that together, the theories of HD+LA help to examine how professionals and law operate and evolve in the legal system.   Overall, the thesis rejects the autopoietic systems theory that law reproduces itself, by itself.  Instead, analysis in this study supports the finding that law is defined and operates through a dialectic of the individual and the social (or the organic and the mechanistic respectively) such that each gives rise to the other.  On the basis of this system connection, aspects from systems theory about legal autopoiesis are integrated into concepts from constructive-developmental theory (HDLA), thus providing a new framework through which to examine how law and its system functions.  The new framework is built around an equation that emerged some time after data analysis and theoretical development: SL&amp;equals;HDLA+DSA .  The equation states that:    The  evolution of the system of law involves processes of human development and to some but a much lesser degree, the autopoietic nature of law.  The extent of this evolution is best determined by analyzing data from a court setting.  The dialectical relationship between individual and social influences in the evolution of law is facilitated by the accumulation of social action &#65533; such as activity from media and advocacy groups &#65533; and the individual meaning that professionals make about this action, which in turn has an influence on the formal and informal operations that they perform when operating law.   The nature of these interacting dynamics will be shown through two interconnected tools of analysis:  one is a typology of individual, professional and system self-concepts; the typology helps to show how a cycle of system change (human development giving rise to legal change and vice versa) occurs in the court; the other is the operative structure (or culture) of systems for law and social work in child abuse cases &#65533; which unite in court operations.  These two  interconnected tools help to show how the court operates and how social action (SA) for change contributes to professional and system change in the evolution of law.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">socio-legal theory;Psychology developmental theory;psycho-social theory;Child protection systems;Social work;Children's Dependency Court</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovery following pneumonectomy: patients initial 2 year experience</field><field name="creator">McLean, Jocelyn Margaret</field><field name="description">Little is known about the recovery of patients after pneumonectomy and the impact of the surgery on the lifestyle of young, employed, ex-smokers and their families. This study was conducted to address this knowledge deficit, and gather information that would help    health professionals to be able to assist people facing pneumonectomy.   A qualitative study using van Manens methodological approach to interpretive phenomenology was chosen, in order to capture a full and rich understanding and meaning of the phenomenon that patients live.   The names, age, operation, histological cell type, stage of disease, and disease free status of potential participants were obtained from a Lung Cancer Surgical Database after obtaining ethical approval for the study. Nine participants (three females and six males) met the inclusion criteria and gave informed consent for the study. Data collection comprised of open-ended interviews that were audiotaped, then transcribed verbatim into hard data. Data interpretation was based on the selective reading approach of van Manen from which six thematic statements arose. These are living the discomforts of treatment and recovery, discovering new limitations on myself; functional and emotional, my reliance on support, my financial security is threatened, my survival is at threat, and I wish I had known more.     The study found that each participant had a unique experience of recovery and consequently the degree of recovery attained varied between participants. They all had a very strong desire to survive lung cancer and considered the risks of major surgery and loosing a lung to be insignificant compared to the certainty of loosing their life if they did not undergo surgery.   This study provided a glimpse of what it was like for a group of patients to live the experience of life after a pneumonectomy and it provides a basis from which nurses can explore further the experiences of patients who are subjected to lung cancer surgery.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pneumonectomy;lung cancer;thoracotamy;cancer;life after pneumonectomy;discomfort;lung</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein Design Based on a PHD Scaffold</field><field name="creator">Kwan, Ann Hau Yu</field><field name="description">The plant homeodomain (PHD) is a protein domain of ~45&#65533;100 residues characterised by a Cys4-His-Cys3 zinc-binding motif. When we commenced our study of the PHD in 2000, it was clear that the domain was commonly found in proteins involved in transcription. Sequence alignments indicate that while the cysteines, histidine and a few other key residues are strictly conserved, the rest of the domain varies greatly in terms of both amino acid composition and length. However, no structural information was available on the PHD and little was known about its function. We were therefore interested in determining the structure of a PHD in the hope that this might shed some light on its function and molecular mechanism of action.  Our work began with the structure determination of a representative PHD, Mi2b-P2, and this work is presented in Chapter 3. Through comparison of this structure with the two other PHD structures that were determined during the course of our work, it became clear that PHDs adopt a well-defined globular fold with a superimposable core region. In addition, PHDs contain two loop regions (termed L1 and L3) that display increased flexibility and overlay less well between the three PHD structures available. These L1 and L3 regions correspond to variable regions identified earlier in PHD sequence alignments, indicating that L1 and L3 are probably not crucial for the PHD fold, but are instead likely to be responsible for imparting function(s) to the PHD. Indeed, numerous recent functional studies of PHDs from different proteins have since demonstrated their ability in binding a range of other proteins.  In order to ascertain whether or not L1 and L3 were in fact dispensable for folding, we made extensive mutations (including both insertions and substitutions) in the loop regions of Mi2b-P2 and showed that the structure was maintained. We then went on to illustrate that a new function could be imparted to Mi2b-P2 by inserting a five-residue CtBP-binding motif into the L1 region and showed this chimera could fold and bind CtBP.  Having established that the PHD could adopt a new binding function, we next sought to use combinatorial methods to introduce other novel functions into the PHD scaffold. Phage display was selected for this purpose, because it is a well-established technique and has been used successfully to engineer zinc-binding domains by other researchers. However, in order to establish this technique in our laboratory, we first chose a control system in which two partner proteins were already known to interact in vitro.   We chose the protein complex formed between the transcriptional regulators LMO2 and ldb1 as a test case. We have examined this interaction in detail in our laboratory, and determined its three-dimensional structure. Furthermore, inappropriate formation of this complex is implicated in the onset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We therefore sought to use phage display to engineer ldb1 mimics that could potentially compete against wild-type ldb1 for LMO2, and this work is described in Chapter 4. Using a phage library containing ~3 x 10 7 variants of the LMO2-binding region of ldb1, we isolated mutants that were able to interact with LMO2 with higher affinity and specificity than wild-type ldb1. These ldb1 mutants represent a first step towards finding potential therapeutics for treating LMO-associated diseases.  Having established phage display in our laboratory, we went on to search for PHD mutants that could bind selected target proteins. This work is described in Chapter 5. We created three PHD libraries with eight randomized residues in each of L1, L3 or in both loops of the PHD. These PHD libraries were then screened against four target proteins. After four rounds of selection, we were able to isolate a PHD mutant (dubbed L13-FH6) that could bind our test protein Fli-ets. This result demonstrates that a novel function can be imparted to the PHD using combinatorial methods and opens the way for further work in applying the PHD scaffold to other protein design work.  In summary, the work detailed in Chapters 3 and 5 demonstrates that the PHD possesses many of the properties that are desirable for a protein scaffold for molecular recognition, including small size, stability, and a well-characterised structure. Moreover, the PHD motif possesses two loops (L1 and L3) of substantial size that can be remodeled for target binding. This may lead to an enhancement of binding affinities and specificities over other small scaffolds that have only one variable loop. In light of the fact that PHDs are mainly found in nuclear proteins, it is reasonable to expect that engineered PHDs could be expressed and function in an intracellular environment, unlike many other scaffolds that can only function in an oxidizing environment. Therefore, our results together with other currently available genomic and functional information indicate PHD is an excellent candidate for a scaffold that could be used to modify cellular processes.

Thus, the offspring derived from flow cytometrically sorted spermatozoa were produced with the use of artificial reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and culture (IVC), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and deep artificial insemination (AI) which facilitated low dose insemination of potentially compromised spermatozoa. More recently, the development of high-speed sorters (Johnson and Welch, 1999) has facilitated the production of offspring using conventional AI techniques with low dose inseminates (Seidel et al., 1999) and successful cryopreservation of sorted spermatozoa (Schenk et al., 1999; Johnson et al., 2000; Lindsey et al., 2002; Schenk and DeGrofft, 2003). Increased efficiency of sorting bull spermatozoa has evolved through significant instrumentation and biological developments which have enabled the commercialization of the sperm sexing technology in the dairy industry, although conception rates in cows after low dose AI with sexed frozen-thawed spermatozoa are still lower than after standard frozen semen AI (Seidel et al., 1999). Subsequently, over 20 000 calves of pre-determined sex have been produced from commercially available sex-sorted frozen-thawed bull spermatozoa (Seidel, 2003). However, similar developments have not been made in the sheep industry and were examined in this thesis.  In this study, successful cryopreservation of sex-sorted ram spermatozoa and production of offspring of the pre-determined sex (X: 94.4 %; Y: 100 %) was achieved after low dose (2-4 x 106 total) insemination using conventional laparoscopic intrauterine (IU) AI. However, the overall pregnancy rate for ewes inseminated with sex-sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa was low (25 %) compared to ewes inseminated with a commercial dose (140 x 106 total) of non-sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa (54 %).    Cryopreservation has been found to not only reduce the proportion of motile spermatozoa, but cause the remaining spermatozoa to undergo changes that advance membrane maturation thereby shortening their lifespan, especially after in vivo fertilisation (Gillan and Maxwell, 1999). It was found that sorting prior to cryopreservation accelerated the maturation of sperm membranes and after co-incubation with oviducal cells in vitro, sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa were released more rapidly than non-sorted (control) frozen-thawed spermatozoa. The potentially reduced lifespan of sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa, and practical constraints on the number of spermatozoa that can be sorted for an insemination dose, makes insemination close to the site of fertilisation and time of ovulation critical for successful fertilisation. After treatment of ewes with GnRH to increase the precision of insemination in respect to the time of ovulation, there was no difference in pregnancy rate between ewes inseminated before, during or after the assumed time of ovulation. Furthermore, there was no difference in pregnancy rate after IU AI with similar doses of sorted frozen-thawed and non-sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa in GnRH-treated ewes. The minimum dose of sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa required for commercially acceptable pregnancy rates determined after IU AI was high (20 x 106 motile).    Consequently, alternative methods for efficiently producing large numbers of offspring of a pre-determined sex using flow cytometrically sorted ram spermatozoa were investigated. Ram spermatozoa can be stored for short periods of time in a chilled state (liquid storage) or for an indefinite period of time in a frozen state (frozen storage; Salamon and Maxwell, 2000). The fixed location of the sperm sorter requires the need for transport of semen from the point of collection to the site of sorting and processing, but also from the sperm sorter site to the recipient females under artificial conditions. In this study, ram spermatozoa liquid stored for 24 h prior to sorting were efficiently sorted, frozen, thawed and after in vitro fertilisation and culture produced a high proportion of grade 1 blastocysts. Similarly, spermatozoa stored at reduced temperatures after sorting maintained high sperm quality for up to 6 days.     Furthermore, frozen-thawed spermatozoa from rams and some non-human primates were successfully prepared for sorting and efficiently sorted producing spermatozoa with high quality in vitro parameters. The quality of frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa after sorting was such that successful re-cryopreservation after sorting was possible. Low numbers of frozen-thawed sorted and re-frozen and thawed spermatozoa were optimal for IVF and a high proportion of grade 1 in vitro embryos of a pre-determined sex were produced. These embryos were either transferred immediately or vitrified prior to transfer, extending the application of the sperm sexing technology further. The birth of lambs of pre-determined sex after transfer of both fresh and vitrified embryos derived from frozen-thawed sorted spermatozoa was achieved.    The findings in this thesis suggest that sorted frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa may have more advanced membrane maturation state than non-sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa, resulting in a decreased fertilizing lifespan in the female reproductive tract. Despite this, the use of sexed ram spermatozoa in a number of physiological states (fresh, liquid, frozen) with several different ARTs is possible in producing significant numbers of offspring of a pre-determined sex. Improved efficiency in both sperm sexing and associated reproductive technologies is required for commercialization to be achieved in the sheep industry.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sperm sexing;ram spermatozoa;artificial insemination;in vitro culture;embryo transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Variable Stability Flight Simulation Facility    Re-engineering of Flight Control Loading and Motion Systems</field><field name="creator">Scamps, Alexander</field><field name="description">A Variable Stability Flight Simulator is being developed in the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia. The device is being developed both as  a teaching tool for use in flight mechanics courses in the department and as a research tool. It is reasonable to state that learning is enhanced through the experience of concepts outside of the classroom environment. It is intended that the device will be integrated into the department&#65533;s teaching program in aircraft flight mechanics.    Initial studies centred around a PC based flight simulation developed at the Cranfield College of Aeronautics in the United Kingdom.  This system utilises a distributed architecture with several computers connected via Ethernet. It also employs a Primary Image three channel visual system.  The system has been further enhanced by the addition of a Link flight simulator provided by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The RAAF had been using the simulator as a training tool for some years until it had become surplus to requirements.    Most of the work in the project has centred around re-engineering this simulator into a viable research/education tool. The Cranfield system has been incorporated into the Link simulator&#65533;s hardware to provide a fixed base simulation. The majority of the work described in this thesis revolved around the re-engineering of the flight control loading and motion systems. Previously these items were controlled by analogue circuitry with minimal digital interfaces to the main simulation software. The systems have been re-designed to replace much of the single model analogue circuitry with re-configurable digital control software. Doing so allows changes to be made to the systems in real time through a software interface. The software resides on a common computer that extensively interfaces with the rest of the simulation.    To support the hardware involved and to provide for system operation and safety, an extensive Supervisory system has also been implemented. This system along with the motion and control loading software has been implemented in the Matlab / Real-Time Workshop environment. This gives the capability of making real-time changes to any part of the overall simulation. A variable stability module (vsm) is under development. The addition of this module will allow changes to be made to the simulation itself in real-time.    The simulator is now functional with the motion and control loading systems operating as designed. Tuning of both systems has been done subjectively by the author. An initial objective analysis of the motion system has been undertaken in an attempt to verify the fidelity of the motion cues generated. A significant outcome of this project has been to create a safe, easily maintainable, re-configurable flight simulator from a large, complex, legacy system. The facility now forms a significant research and teaching tool in areas such as flight mechanics, propulsion, aircraft handling qualities and human factors.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flight simulator;variable stability simulator;re-configurable simulator</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SILENCE IN JAPANESE-AUSTRALIAN  CLASSROOM INTERACTION: PERCEPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE</field><field name="creator">Nakane, Ikuko</field><field name="description">This thesis examines silence as attributed to and performed by Japanese students in Australian university classrooms. It aims to elucidate processes in which silence can be used and created in intercultural communication in the classroom. The phenomenon of silence is approached from multiple perspectives. The data include interviews, a questionnaire and survey data, classroom observation and video-recorded classroom interactions. The data was collected in Australia and Japan. The Japanese data was included as part of sociocultural contexts where the Japanese students studying in Australia bring with them. The analysis draws on the frameworks of the ethnography of communication and conversation analysis. Micro- and macro- perspectives are combined to investigate how perceptions and performances interact to construct silence in the cross-cultural encounters in these classrooms. The thesis consists of four parts. The first part, Chapters 1-3, sets the theoretical background to the research. Chapter 1 describes how the research was conceived, and states the aims of the research. Chapter 2 reviews literature on silence, with specific attention to silence in Japanese communication and in classroom contexts. In Chapter 3 the methodological framework and design of this research is described. The second part, Chapter 4, examines how Japanese students&#65533; silence is perceived, both by themselves and their Australian teachers. The chapter is based on interviews with Japanese students in Australia, as well as findings from a questionnaire distributed to their lecturers. Japanese classroom practices as an aspect of the sociocultural background of Japanese students are also described.  Finally, the third part, Chapters 5, 6, 7, compares actual silence and performance in the classroom with perceived silence. There are three case studies which make up a substantial part of the thesis and provide detailed analyses of classroom interactions, based on video-recordings, observations, and follow-up interviews with key participants.  Chapter 8 synthesises the findings discussed in Chapters 4-7, and concludes with implications for teaching and learning in the multicultural university classroom.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education;japanese;classroom;behaviour;linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phase control and measurement in digital microscopy</field><field name="creator">Arnison, Matthew Raphael</field><field name="description">The ongoing merger of the digital and optical components of the modern microscope is creating opportunities for new measurement techniques, along with new challenges for optical modelling. This thesis investigates several such opportunities and challenges which are particularly relevant to biomedical imaging. Fourier optics is used throughout the thesis as the underlying conceptual model, with a particular emphasis on three--dimensional Fourier optics.    A new challenge for optical modelling provided by digital microscopy is the relaxation of traditional symmetry constraints on optical design. An extension of optical transfer function theory to deal with arbitrary lens pupil functions is presented in this thesis. This is used to chart the 3D vectorial structure of the spatial frequency spectrum of the intensity in the focal region of a high aperture lens when illuminated by linearly polarised beam.    Wavefront coding has been used successfully in paraxial imaging systems to extend the depth of field. This is achieved by controlling the pupil phase with a cubic phase mask, and thereby balancing optical behaviour with digital processing.     In this thesis I present a high aperture vectorial model for focusing with a cubic phase mask, and compare it with results calculated using the paraxial approximation. The effect of a refractive index change is also explored. High aperture measurements of the point spread function are reported, along with experimental confirmation of high aperture extended depth of field imaging of a biological specimen.    Differential interference contrast is a popular method for imaging phase changes in otherwise transparent biological specimens. In this thesis I report on a new isotropic algorithm for retrieving the phase from differential interference contrast images of the phase gradient, using phase shifting, two directions of shear, and non--iterative Fourier phase integration incorporating a modified spiral phase transform. This method does not assume that the specimen has a constant amplitude. A simulation is presented which demonstrates good agreement between the retrieved phase and the phase of the simulated object, with excellent immunity to imaging noise.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microscope;biomedical imaging;Fourier optics;high aperture lens;vectorial optics;wavefront coding;depth of field;differential interference constrast;Nomarski;phase;optical transfer function</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex on the hustings: Labor and the construction of the woman vote in two federal elections (1983, 1993)</field><field name="creator">Huntley, Rebecca Jane</field><field name="description">The basic aim of this thesis is to describe and analyse how &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; was constructed within Labor discourse during the Hawke/Keating years.  My domain of investigation is electoral politics, in particular the federal election campaigns of 1983 and 1993.  These elections flank the beginning and the end of the Labor decade, a period of great significance to both the development of Labor politics specifically and Australian politics in general.  The elections of 1983 and 1993 were campaigns in which the Party made a concerted effort to attract women&#65533;s votes.  Through a reading of the various texts associated with these two campaigns, I explore the construction of &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; as a &#65533;new&#65533; political subject position within Labor discourse.      The dominant influences on the construction of &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; as a new subject position were Labor discourse and feminism, or more precisely Labor discourse affected by the incursion of feminism from the 1970s onwards.  This thesis describes and analyses how this subject position has been produced and reproduced within Labor discourse.  The gender gap research developed for the 1983 federal election constitutes one of the more important technologies that work to construct &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; within Labor discourse.  A reading of the texts associated with the 1983 campaign reveals the character of &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; as a caring figure.  However, as the Labor decade progressed, &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; is articulated in Labor discourse as a more complex figure, focused on her responsibilities both in the home and at paid work.  A reading of various texts associated with the 1993 election campaign shows that &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; is constructed as a carer-worker; this subject position is broadly consonant with the objectives liberal, economic government.  Certain modifications within this basic subject position can be observed in Labor&#65533;s anti-GST campaign materials, which made an appeal to the woman voter as consumer.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ALP;feminism;voting;federal elections</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial Welfarism in Australia 1890-1965</field><field name="creator">Balnave, Nikola Robyn</field><field name="description">This thesis examines industrial welfarism in Australia from 1890 to 1965. This period witnessed the gradual spread of the welfarism movement throughout Australian industry as employers sought ways to increase productivity and control in the face of external challenges. Once reaching its peak in the immediate post-War period, the welfarism movement was gradually subsumed as part of the increasing formalisation of personnel management. Waves of interest in welfare provision coincided with periods of labour shortage and/or labour militancy in Australia, indicating its dual role in the management of labour. Firstly, by offering benefits and services beyond that made necessary by the law or industrial awards, welfarism was designed to create a pool of good quality workers for management to draw from. Secondly, managers sought to enhance their control over these workers and their productive effort, using welfarism as a technique to build worker consent to managerial authority. This could be achieved through subtle methods aimed at boosting loyalty and morale, or through more direct programs designed to increase worker dependency on the company. In both ways, individual and collective worker resistance could be minimised, thereby reinforcing managerial prerogative. Despite its adoption by a variety of companies, a number of economic, political and institutional factors limited the extent of industrial welfarism in Australia. These include the small-scale of most enterprises prior to the Second World War, state involvement in the area of industrial relations and welfare provision, and the strength of organised labour. While the welfarism movement did not reach the heights experienced overseas, it nonetheless provided an important contribution to the development of formal labour management in Australia.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial welfarism;welfarism;pension schemes;provident funds;company-sponsored recreation;company picnics;house journals;staff magazines;company libraries;health and accident schemes;safety first;in-house medical care;industrial nurses;company housing;company stores;superior amenities;canteens</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Five Years After Child Sexual Abuse</field><field name="creator">Swanston, Heather Yvette</field><field name="description">Introduction  Child sexual abuse is a common problem.  Psychological and behavioural problems in children and adults who have experienced child sexual abuse have been associated with the abuse.  Little research has been conducted which has been long-term, prospective, involved substantiated sexual abuse, included a control group, took into account mediating factors, utilised multiple data sources, relied on standardised measures and had a high follow-up rate.    Aim  The aims of this study were to compare a cohort of sexually abused young people with a group of nonabused peers and to establish predictors of psychological and behavioural outcome.    Method  This study was a follow-up which was long-term, prospective, involved a sample of children with substantiated sexual abuse, included a control group, took into account mediating factors, utilised multiple data sources, relied on standardised measures and had a high follow-up rate.    Eighty-four sexually abused young people were followed up five years after presenting to Children&#65533;s Hospitals&#65533; Child Protection Units for sexual abuse and were compared to a group of 84 nonabused young people of similar age and sex.  The two groups were compared on the basis of demographic variables, family functioning, mother&#65533;s mental health and life events; the outcome measures of depression, self-esteem, anxiety, behaviour, criminal activity, alcohol and other drug use, eating problems, running away, suicide attempts, self-injury, hopefulness, despair and attributional style; and potential mediating factors such as further notifications to the Department of Community Services, receipt of psychological treatment, legal action against offenders and victims compensation.  Potential predictors of outcome were (1) demographic variables, (2) sexual abuse characteristcs, (3) intake data and (4) five year follow-up variables.    Main findings  Follow-up rates were 81percent (n equals 68) for cases and 89percent (n equals 75) for controls.  Five years after presenting for the sexual abuse, the sexually abused young people were performing more poorly than their nonabused peers on various measures of psychological state and behaviour.  Although the abused children had experienced more negative life events (p&lt;.001), were from lower socio-economic groups (p&lt;.0001), had more changes in parent figures (p&lt;.001) and had mothers who were more psychologically distressed (p equals .03), multiple regression analysis showed that after allowing for these and other demographic and family factors, there were still significant differences between the groups after the 5 years. The abused children displayed more disturbed behavior (p equals .002), had lower self-esteem (p&lt;.001), were more depressed or unhappy (p&lt;.001) and were more anxious (p equals .03) than controls.  Sexually abused children had significantly higher levels of bingeing (p equals .02), self-injury (p equals.009) and suicide attempts (p equals .03).    Significant predictors of psychological and behavioural outcome were significantly related to family and parent functioning variables.  Abuse status was not a significant predictor when offered to each of the predictive models.  Significant predictors of outcome included the following intake variables: family functioning, mother&#65533;s mental health, whether parents were employed or not, behaviour scores, prior notifications for neglect, history of parental discord and whether there were caregiver changes or not prior to intake.  The classification of the index sexual abuse event as indecent assault and whether there were notifications for sexual abuse prior to the index event also significantly predicted outcome.  Five year follow-up variables which were significant predictors of outcome were the young person&#65533;s age, number of negative life events, attributional style, self-esteem, depression, number of parent changes, anxiety, despair, whether there were notifications for abuse/neglect after intake and having a parent with a history of drug/alcohol problems.    Conclusions  Difficulties associated with child sexual abuse continue for some years after the abuse event.  Child sexual abuse needs to be considered as a possible antecedent of behaviour and psychological difficulties in young people.  Treatment and monitoring should continue for some years after the abuse.  Treatment may need to be directed more towards young people&#65533;s psychological states rather than focusing specifically on the sexual abuse.  Family and parent functioning may need to be addressed early in order to prevent some of the behavioural and psychological difficulties associated with the long-term outcome of child sexual abuse.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child sexual abuse;depression;self esteem;anxiety;despair;helplessness;eating disorder;revictimisation;behaviour;crime;drug use;running away;suicide;self injury;attributional style;compensation;treatment;mental health;family functioning;life events</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional Labour Councils and Local Government Employment Generation: The South Coast Labour Council 1981-1996</field><field name="creator">Rittau, Yasmin</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the role of regional labour councils in local employment  generation. It specifically analyses the case of an Australian regional labour council, the  South Coast Labour Council (SCLC), between 1981 and 1996. The Illawarra region was  the centre of SCLC activity. It was an industrialised region that experienced high levels  of unemployment in the period. These were greater than the State and national  averages, which reflected a geographical concentration of unemployment in certain  regions in Australia. The SCLC attempted to address this issue, as it was part of the  union structure that was specifically focused on the regional level and on regional  concerns.  The study argues that the SCLC developed a local employment generation strategy and  it examines how and why this was adopted and pursued. It finds that the SCLC was  well placed at the regional level and was well resourced with a capacity to influence  the external environment through its utilisation of both political and industrial  methods in a period of agreeable internal relations. The research identifies the  development of its local employment generation strategy. Sometimes the SCLC pursued  its strategy in a manner of ad hoc decision-making and muddling through, while at  other times it involved characteristic and distinctive regular patterns. The thesis  concludes by evaluating the SCLC&#65533;s strategy of local employment generation and by  exploring the applicability of the general trade union literature on methods and strategy  to regional labour councils.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peak union council;trades council;union agency;political lobbying;industrial negotiation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex, subjectivity and agency: A life history study of women's sexual relations and practices with men</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Joanne</field><field name="description">This study explores women&#8217;s experiences of sex with men. It is based on qualitative data collected from eighteen life history interviews. Such an approach provides means for examining women&#8217;s sexual experiences over time. The study finds that women give meaning to their sexual experiences through two main discursive representations: the passive, &#8220;proper&#8221; and sexually obliging girlfriend or wife, and the active and &#8220;sexually equal&#8221; woman. However, these representations do not capture the entirety of women&#8217;s sexual experiences. The life history analysis demonstrates that women are not simply inscribed by discourse. Rather, they are embodied beings actively engaged in pursuing sexual identities. Central to the process is a relationship between the practice of sex and self-reflexivity over time. Finally, the study demonstrates how the process of gaining sexual subjectivity is shaped by the material conditions of women&#8217;s lives. For instance, the praxeological circumstances of women&#8217;s class or race are powerful in recasting discourses of feminine sexuality, the meanings women ascribe to them, their access to broader sexual experiences, and the kinds of relationships they have with their male partners.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subjectivity;sexuality;femininity;embodiment;life history</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Hearing with Simultaneous Sound Sources:  A Psychophysical Investigation</field><field name="creator">Best, Virginia Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an overview of work conducted to investigate human spatial hearing in situations involving multiple concurrent sound sources. Much is known about spatial hearing with single sound sources, including the acoustic cues to source location and the accuracy of localisation under different conditions. However, more recently interest has grown in the behaviour of listeners in more complex environments. Concurrent sound sources pose a particularly difficult problem for the auditory system, as their identities and locations must be extracted from a common set of sensory receptors and shared computational machinery. It is clear that humans have a rich perception of their auditory world, but just how concurrent sounds are processed, and how accurately, are issues that are poorly understood. This work attempts to fill a gap in our understanding by systematically examining spatial resolution with multiple sound sources.  A series of psychophysical experiments was conducted on listeners with normal hearing to measure performance in spatial localisation and discrimination tasks involving more than one source. The general approach was to present sources that overlapped in both frequency and time in order to observe performance in the most challenging of situations. Furthermore, the role of two primary sets of location cues in concurrent source listening was probed by examining performance in different spatial dimensions. The binaural cues arise due to the separation of the two ears, and provide information about the lateral position of sound sources. The spectral cues result from location-dependent filtering by the head and pinnae, and allow vertical and front-rear auditory discrimination. Two sets of experiments are described that employed relatively simple broadband noise stimuli. In the first of these, two-point discrimination thresholds were measured using simultaneous noise bursts. It was found that the pair could be resolved only if a binaural difference was present; spectral cues did not appear to be sufficient. In the second set of experiments, the two stimuli were made distinguishable on the basis of their temporal envelopes, and the localisation of a designated target source was directly examined. Remarkably robust localisation was observed, despite the simultaneous masker, and both binaural and spectral cues appeared to be of use in this case. Small but persistent errors were observed, which in the lateral dimension represented a systematic shift away from the location of the masker. The errors can be explained by interference in the processing of the different location cues. Overall these experiments demonstrated that the spatial perception of concurrent sound sources is highly dependent on stimulus characteristics and configurations. This suggests that the underlying spatial representations are limited by the accuracy with which acoustic spatial cues can be extracted from a mixed signal. Three sets of experiments are then described that examined spatial performance with speech, a complex natural sound. The first measured how well speech is localised in isolation. This work demonstrated that speech contains high-frequency energy that is essential for accurate three-dimensional localisation. In the second set of experiments, spatial resolution for concurrent monosyllabic words was examined using similar approaches to those used for the concurrent noise experiments. It was found that resolution for concurrent speech stimuli was similar to resolution for concurrent noise stimuli. Importantly, listeners were limited in their ability to concurrently process the location-dependent spectral cues associated with two brief speech sources. In the final set of experiments, the role of spatial hearing was examined in a more relevant setting containing concurrent streams of sentence speech. It has long been known that binaural differences can aid segregation and enhance selective attention in such situations. The results presented here confirmed this finding and extended it to show that the spectral cues associated with different locations can also contribute.  As a whole, this work provides an in-depth examination of spatial performance in concurrent source situations and delineates some of the limitations of this process. In general, spatial accuracy with concurrent sources is poorer than with single sound sources, as both binaural and spectral cues are subject to interference. Nonetheless, binaural cues are quite robust for representing concurrent source locations, and spectral cues can enhance spatial listening in many situations. The findings also highlight the intricate relationship that exists between spatial hearing, auditory object processing, and the allocation of attention in complex environments.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial Hearing;Simultaneous Sound Sources;Psychophysical Investigation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pension reform: an analysis of the economic foundations of private pensions</field><field name="creator">Vidler, Sacha</field><field name="description">The dissertation investigates support by economists for the global policy shift away from unfunded public pension schemes towards funded private pension schemes.  Influential economists and institutions, including the World Bank, present a suite of economic arguments that suggest that this shift will have positive effects on national economies, particularly in the context of aging.       The arguments may be categorised according to their relation to the operation of three sets of institutions: capital markets, labour markets and political systems.      In capital markets, the transition is purported to increase private and national saving, increase the quantity and quality of investment, and provide more efficient private administration.  In labour markets, it is claimed that the shift will reduce labour market distortions associated with public pensions, which inhibit competitiveness, produce unemployment and encourage early retirement.  According to the World Bank, public pensions systems cause these distortions without achieving their stated objective of reducing inequality.  In the political sphere, the shift is purported to insulate the pension system from political pressures, which otherwise inevitably lead to crisis.     The thesis provides evidence which refutes these claims.  The best research, including studies by orthodox economists, indicate that the shift does not increase savings or investment, or improve the quality of financial investment.  The main effect of tax concessions associated with private pension systems is to divert to private pension funds savings that would occur in any case via other mechanisms.  The tax concessions are also regressive, even in systems with compulsory elements.  Private administration of pensions, particularly in a plural consumer market setting, is highly inefficient, with customers at a disadvantage in dealing with providers due to the complexity and opacity of products and pricing.     A negative relationship is found between public pension spending and levels of elderly poverty, suggesting that reducing public pension spending increases levels of elderly inequality.  Public pensions are found not to explain differences in economic growth between regions.  Elements of system design which distort labour markets, such as by encouraging early retirement, can easily be adjusted.  However, such elements are explicit government policy in several countries.     A review of public and private pensions finds that examples of public system crisis are associated with instances of economic and political collapse, rather than system design.  Private funded systems are found to be more vulnerable, not less, to the same external influences.  Relatively generous universal public pension systems are found to be financially sustainable despite demographic change, assuming modest levels of economic growth.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pension reform; welfare; world bank</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban design and the better cities program: the influence of urban design on the outcomes of the program.</field><field name="creator">Gerner, Robert Pemberton</field><field name="description">The aims of the research were to assess the influence of urban design on the Better Cities Program (BCP) and to explore and document the achievements of the Program in terms of urban design.

The thesis is an overview of the Program&#65533;s genesis and procedures, including comment on economic, political and social concerns, and draws from this broad analysis the specific issues and outcomes related to urban design practice. It was perceived that whilst not centrally an urban design program the BCP fell short of known urban design principles that could reasonably be expected to be present, given that the achievement of better cities is dependent in large part on better urban design. To maintain a comprehensive overview and sense of continuity the research included urban design evaluations of two projects from the earlier Department of Urban and Regional Development (DURD) period. This was done in order to review the state of urban design at that time and to discover whether fresh insights and approaches may have occurred over the intervening 25 years. To structure the research, a number of interlinking methods were implemented. These included literature reviews, interviews, questionnaires and case studies of the Program&#65533;s projects - called Area Strategies - and their ranking through a matrix. Methods extended to a comparative analysis of the Program&#65533;s objectives with those of DURD. The Area Strategies were interrogated from three positions, namely: by evaluation of these initiatives based on an Empirical approach; by critical literature where available, but mostly from a more abundant source of descriptive literature and by expert opinion through many interviews, discussions and the Questionnaire responses. The methods were essential in order to collate, analyse and categorise the gathered information for the purpose of evaluation, summarising and framing of conclusions. Central to the thesis was the reliance on the &#65533;enduring strands&#65533;, being those essential and timehonoured fundamental elements of the urban fabric. These enduring strands became the evaluation tools of the case studies, and comprised the following: buildings and their groupings, the public domain, issues of safety and security, activities, conservation and heritage, the role of landscape, architectural responses to the environment, ecological responses, circulation, public art, social responses and management processes. The discipline of urban design as distinct from city planning and architecture, developed signifi- cantly during the second half of the twentieth century and it received Commonwealth recognition during the life of the Program through the publication of the findings of Prime Minister Keating&#65533;s Urban Design Task Force. The thesis compares the recommendations of the Task Force and those of the research and finds sufficient parallels to affirm that both endeavours share a common basis. It is not the role of the thesis to recommend an urban design policy for potential future programs, but it does point to the way urban design might be better integrated in such programs. This research provides support for the argument that if urban design concerns had occupied a more central position in the range of objectives of the Better Cities Program, then the outcomes would have been more satisfactory in many of the projects. With greater recognition of the critical contribution of urban design skills, outcomes of future programs of this nature could potentially be significantly enhanced.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban design;better cities program</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Recruitment of Children to Randomised Controlled Trials</field><field name="creator">Caldwell, Patrina Ha Yuen</field><field name="description">Abstract    Background  The randomised-controlled trial (RCT) provides the best evidence for evaluating treatment effects and is accepted as a gold standard for clinical and regulatory decision making (1;2). One of the major challenges to the conduct of RCTs is the recruitment of adequate numbers of participants. Inadequate numbers reduce the power of a study to detect statistically significant treatment effects, and may cause delays, increased costs and failure to complete trials.     The need for clinical trials in children has been increasingly recognised by the scientific community, resulting in increased demands for the inclusion of children in trials. For several reasons, recruiting children to trials is more challenging than recruiting adults, as consent issues are more difficult because parents make decisions about trial participation on behalf of their child. Despite general professional and community support for paediatric clinical trials, parents and paediatricians express reluctance when their own child or patient is asked to participate. Although researchers working with children commonly experience difficulty with recruiting children to RCTs, little is known about this very important subject.    The method by which potential participants are approached for trial participation, the influence of their health care provider and the attitude of potential participants (or their parents, in the case of children), are critical to the understanding of the decision making process for trial participation. This thesis is one of the first major attempts to explore the issues surrounding the recruitment of children to RCTs, and is divided into four studies which address these issues.    Methods  Recruitment strategies used to encourage participation in randomised controlled trials (systematic review)   Eligible experimental and observational studies comparing methods of recruiting participants for RCTs were identified after a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library and reference lists. Independent data extractions were completed by two reviewers who assessed the studies for eligibility and methodological quality. Outcome measures were consent rates, proportion enrolled by each method and cost of recruitment per participant. Summary estimators of effects were calculated using a random effects model and expressed as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was analysed using the Q statistic.    Paediatricians&#65533; attitudes to children&#65533;s participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research)   Qualitative analysis of focus group discussions involving 16 paediatricians and 5 trainees from a paediatric teaching hospital in Sydney was undertaken. Doctors varied in occupation, experience, research activity, age, gender, ethnicity and parenthood experience. A professional facilitator conducted the semi-structured group discussions. Recruitment ceased when informational redundancy was reached, after 4 focus groups involving 21 participants. The transcribed audiotapes were analysed by theme linkage using the constant comparative method.    Australian paediatricians&#65533; and adult physicians&#65533; attitudes to randomised controlled trials (survey)  A 44-item questionnaire was sent to 250 paediatricians and 250 adult physicians randomly selected from the membership list of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Questions assessing doctors&#65533; treatment philosophies and attitudes to trials were compared with demographic and practice variables.    Parents&#65533; attitudes to children&#65533;s participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research)  Qualitative analysis of focus group discussions involving 33 parents from 5 different settings (representing parents of children with a life threatening, chronic or acute illness, with experience in trials and of healthy children) was undertaken. Parents varied in age, gender, ethnicity, level of education, research experience and their child&#65533;s health status. The transcribed discussions were analysed by theme linkage using the constant comparative method.    Results  Recruitment strategies used to encourage participation in randomised controlled trials (systematic review)   Fifty papers were included (out of 8602 titles and abstracts searched) which described 8 RCTs, 2 quasi RCTs, 13 prospective cohort studies, 30 retrospective cohort studies and 2 before-after studies.  These studies assessed how over 4 million people were approached for RCT participation using 87 different recruitment strategies, with 103,406 people enrolling in RCTs. Health care provider (HCP) referrals had the highest participant consent rates at the time of exposure to trial information (HCP referral versus target mailing: relative risk (RR) 1.84 (95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.08, 3.13)). They also had the highest consent rates when potential participants respond to the recruitment material by further enquiry about the trial (HCP referral versus community presentation: RR 1.37 (1.06; 1.78); HCP referral versus worksite approach: RR 25.20 (20.19, 31.45); HCP referral versus general community approach: RR 2.53 (0.46, 14.05); HCP referral versus mailing: RR 3.29 (1.26, 8.60); HCP referral versus media: RR 2.66 (1.31, 5.41)). However, by the time potential participants attend eligibility assessment for trial participation, no difference in consent rates could be distinguished by method of recruitment. Higher proportions of study participants were recruited by methods that exposed larger numbers of potential candidates to trial information (despite their lower consent rates). The stated recruitment cost ranged from US$0 to $1108 per participant, with mailing being the most cost-effective method and community methods (such as community presentations, pamphlets and posters displayed at community sites) the least effective.     Paediatricians&#65533; attitudes to children&#65533;s participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research)   From the focus group discussions, paediatricians thought parents balanced perceived gains and risks when deciding about trial participation. They also believed the child&#65533;s condition and parents&#65533; health beliefs and personal attributes influenced parents&#65533; decisions. Other factors thought to be important by paediatricians were the doctors&#65533; beliefs and their relationship with the investigators. Paediatricians perceived gains for trial participation including professional benefits for themselves, improved patient care, convenience for the families and themselves and scientific advancement. Perceived risks included inconvenience, inadequate resources and potential harms to the patient and the doctor-patient relationship. Paediatricians with previous research experience were most knowledgeable about RCTs and perceived greatest gains from trial participation. Paediatricians&#65533; personal treatment preferences hindered trial support.     Australian paediatricians&#65533; and adult physicians&#65533; attitudes to randomised controlled trials (survey)  Response rate from the paediatricians&#65533; and adult physicians&#65533; survey was 60% (300/500). Australian paediatricians and adult physicians are very similar in their treatment philosophies, and are clinician-oriented rather than research-oriented in their attitudes, with primary allegiance to their patients and preference for selecting treatment rather than referring for trial participation in the face of treatment uncertainty.  Professional activities are clinically focused, with limited time assigned for research.  Australian doctors perceive little reward for trial participation and claim that the opinions of referring doctors regarding RCTs does not influence them.    Predictors of favourable attitudes to trial participation from the survey were time allocation for research, a history of referring patients to trials in the past and younger age (all p values less than 0.0001).   Parents&#65533; attitudes to children&#65533;s participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research)  When parents were interviewed, they acknowledged balancing risks and benefits when deciding about trial participation for their child. Perceived benefits include the offer of hope, better care of their child, the opportunity to access new treatments, healthcare professionals and health information, meeting others in similar circumstances and helping others. Perceived risks include potential side effects, being randomised to ineffective treatments and the inconvenience of participation. The decision for trial participation is also influenced by parental factors (parents&#65533; knowledge, beliefs and emotional response), child factors (the child&#65533;s health status and preference about participation), trial factors (the use of placebos and the uncertainties of research) and doctor factors (doctor&#65533;s recommendations and communication of trial information).    Conclusions  There are many challenges to the successful conduct of RCTs. Ways of addressing these include: using effective methods of recruiting potential study participants (such as mailing of recruitment material to potential participants) and abandoning ineffective strategies (such as community methods): fostering greater willingness for trial participation by addressing parents&#65533; and paediatricians&#65533; concerns including enhancing communication between researchers, paediatricians and parents, and improving the gains-hazard balance (by increasing incentives while decreasing inconveniences); and reforming in the health care system to raise the priority placed on clinical research by restructuring clinical research in a clinically predominant workplace and with a clinically predominant workforce.    The findings from this study have implications for researchers planning RCTs for children in the future. Careful consideration of the above will enhance RCTs participation for children improving efficiency, lowering costs and ultimately improving the future health care of children.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children;paediatric;recruitment;trial;randomised controlled trials;research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service Delivery Management: A Process for Proactively Ensuring Customer Satisfaction.</field><field name="creator">Schoen, Andre</field><field name="description">SDM is a process model, based on service marketing components, to position a service while concurrently being a service delivery management tool improving serviceen counter processes. Added to a service script, SDM can increase customer satisfaction, quality perception, voice levels and repurchase intentions in a general service encounter scenario as well as during episodes which include a failure. Addressing mishaps requires particular attention, since Consumer Complaint Behaviour research shows that most customers prefer to switch suppliers, rather than offer constructive feedback. This means that many service failures go unnoticed, with a large proportion of customers defecting. Since most services are performed in real time by service personnel, consistent quality output is a  challenge. Therefore, occasional service failures are inevitable. Present research recognises this by offering suggestions, but does not present an integrated framework like SDM, using the presence of a customer during a service encounter as an unique opportunity to resolve issues on the spot. An elicitation process is used as a first step, attempting to improve voice and minimising lost feedback. Step two is a specific service recovery process, adapted to the failure type. SDM processes can also lead to a general increase of satisfaction and quality perception, regardless of whether or not there was a service failure. With satisfaction generally being regarded as an actual repurchase behaviour indicator, this may lead to increased sales turnover, while a higher quality perception may lead to a larger price premium tolerance and therefore higher profits. Higher service quality perceptions can also be used as a marketing positioning tool to differentiate a service from competitors. Data collected supported all hypotheses put forward in this thesis, showing statistically significant improvements on all key variables, including a satisfaction rating increase of 24percent when SDM was applied. In academic terms, the process model tested did not only link separate literature streams, but offered an integrated, proactive tool which is capable of operating in real time. Traditionally, academic models and their processes analyse results after an episode concludes, while SDM allows a provider to positively influence or manage satisfaction levels during the service delivery.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">service delivery;management;marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MODELLING OF SOLAR KILNS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANOPTIMISED SCHEDULE FOR DRYING HARDWOOD TIMBER</field><field name="creator">Haque, M. Nawshadul</field><field name="description">This research examines the drying of hardwood timber with particular reference to seasoning blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) in a solar kiln. The aims of this research were to develop an optimised drying schedule for drying blackbutt and to develop and validate a mathematical model for a solar kiln.  In the first stage of this study, the cross-grain physical and mechanical properties were determined for blackbutt timber so that an optimised schedule (based on drying within a limiting strain envelope) can be developed using model predictive control techniques for drying 43 mm thick (green) blackbutt timber boards in solar kilns. This optimised schedule has been developed and tested in the laboratory. The drying time was 10% shorter for this schedule than the original schedule, compared with an expected reduction in drying time of 14% (relative to the original schedule). Overall the quality was slightly better and the drying time was shorter for the optimised schedule compared with the original schedule.  A complete solar kiln model has been developed and validated based on comparisons between the predicted and the measured internal air temperatures, relative humidities and timber moisture contents. The maximum difference between the actual and predicted moisture contents was 0.05 kg kg-1. The agreement between the predicted and measured temperatures of the internal air is reasonable, and both the predictions and measurements have a similar cyclical pattern. The generally good agreement between the model prediction of the final moisture content and its measurement may be due to the careful measurement of the boundary conditions such as the solar energy input.  The key uncertainties were identified as the heat exchanger output, the measurement of the initial moisture content, the amount of accumulation of condensate on the floor, and the estimation of sky temperature. The significant uncertainty (18%) in the estimation of the initial moisture content is a key reason for the mismatch between the model prediction and the measurements. In terms of operating variables, the energy release rate from the heat exchanger had the greatest effect on the simulated performance, followed by the water spray and venting rates. The simulation suggested that a material with a lower transmissivity to thermal radiation may effectively lower radiation losses, improving the kiln performance, so such materials for glazing is a high priority.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MODELLING;SOLAR KILNS;ANOPTIMISED SCHEDULE;DRYING HARDWOOD TIMBER</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Some Linear and Nonlinear Time Series Models</field><field name="creator">Ainkaran, Ponnuthurai</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis considers some linear and nonlinear time series models.

In Chapter 3, five important nonlinear models are considered and their time series properties are discussed. The estimating function approach for nonlinear models is developed in detail in Chapter 4 and examples are added to illustrate the theory.

The current literature indicates that KS is initiated by the  human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) as a reactive polyclonal process but with  deregulation of oncogene and tumour suppressor genes, it can progress to a  true malignancy with monoclonality. Clinically, classical KS often presents as  an indolent disease affecting mainly the lower extremities whereas AIDS-related  KS has no site predilection and can progress rapidly with systemic involvement.  Histologically, KS can be classified into patch, plaque and nodular stages.  Interestingly, classical and AIDS-related KS are indistinguishable histologically  and this suggests that AIDS-related KS and classical KS might be initiated by a  common aetiology but given their different clinical courses, they may progress  through different mechanisms. In view of the importance of the cell cycle  proteins in the development and progression of many human malignancies, this  thesis aims to examine the role of these proteins in the progression of the two  main clinical subtypes of KS.  The cell cycle protein expressions in a cohort of 47 patients with KS with welldocumented  clinical and histological features were studied. Using a monclonal  antibody against the latent nuclear antigen-1 molecule of HHV8, HHV8 was  detected in 78% of the cases. The more advanced nodular lesions were found  to have a higher level of proliferative activity as measured by the proliferation  x  marker, Ki-67. This suggests it is valid to use the histological specimens as a  tumour progression model of KS.  The role of the Rb/cyclin D1/p16 pathway was examined. The more advanced  nodular stage KS lesions were more likely to be positive for cyclin D1,  suggesting that cyclin D1 is important in the progression from patch stage to  nodular stage. p16 acts as a tumour suppressor and it has an inhibitory effect  on cyclin D1. The p16 expression rate was low in early stage KS but high in the  more advanced lesions. It seems that reduced p16 expression occurs early in  KS and may be important in its development. The rate of Rb expression, on the  other hand, did not differ significantly among the histological subtypes. The  results revealed the significant role of the Rb/cyclin D1/p16 pathway in the  progression of KS.  Of the mitotic cyclins examined, cyclin A expression was correlated with the  advanced tumor stage. The rate of p34cdc2 expression was high in the lesions  and there was no correlation with histological stage. This suggests that p34cdc2  is important in the early development of the tumour but not necessarily in its  progression.  Along the p53-apoptotic pathway, mutant p53 expression was significantly more  common in the nodular stage. The cyclin G1 (a protooncogene, one of the  target genes of p53) expression also paralleled that of mutant p53 with the  majority of the KS lesions showing cyclin G1 expression and significant  xi  correlation between advanced histological stage and increasing rate of cyclin  G1 expression. These findings suggest that progression along the p53 pathway  may be important in the advanced stage development of KS. On the other  hand, expression of the CDK inhibitor, p27, a protein that normally negatively  regulates cyclin G1, was reduced in nodular KS. These findings suggest that  some KS lesions may progress through a deregulated or abnormal p53  pathway.  There were correlations between cyclin D1, cyclin A, cyclin G1, mutant p53 and  negative HIV status. The findings suggest that components of both the  Rb/cyclin D1/p16 and p53-apoptotic pathways are important in the progression  of classical KS.  Rb protein was the only cell cycle protein whose rate of expression correlated  significantly with HHV8 status in KS. The majority of HHV8 positive lesions  were also positive for Rb protein, unlike HHV8 negative lesions. This suggests  that some of the HHV8 negative lesions can progress through a defective Rb  pathway whereas the role of Rb in the progression may not be as important in  the HHV8 positive lesions. This was an unexpected finding given that one of  the postulated mechanisms of tumour initiation by the HHV8 virus is via the viral  cyclin it produces. The viral cyclin produced by HHV8 acts through the Rb  pathway much the same as cyclin D1 and one would have expected that HHV8  positive cases are less likely to be positive for the Rb protein.  In summary, the majority of the KS lesions examined in this thesis show HHV8  infection. The Rb/cyclin D1/p16 pathway appears to be important in the  progression of the different stages of KS and expression of the proteins  involved in the p53 pathway were found to be important in the advanced stages  of the development of KS. There were differential expressions of cell cycle  proteins between AIDS-related and classical KS, and between HHV8 positive  and HHV8 negative lesions. The findings also provided some clues to the  possible mechanisms of development in KS lesions that were not initiated by  HHV8.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kaposi's sarcoma;cell cycle protein;AIDS;Herpes virus 8;p53</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/583</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive behavioural models of chronic pain and the role of selective attention</field><field name="creator">Dehghani, Mohsen</field><field name="description">Cognitive-behavioural based models of chronic pain contend that appraisals of harm affect the individual&#65533;s response to pain. It has been suggested that fear of pain and/or anxiety sensitivity predispose individuals to chronicity. However, other factors such as pain self-efficacy are believed to mediate between experience of pain and disability. According to this view, pain is maintained through hypervigilance towards painful sensations and subsequent avoidance. Four studies were conducted in order to evaluate the structure of fear-avoidance models of chronic pain, and also, to examine the role of hypervigilance as an underlying mechanism in maintenance of pain.   In study one, using a sample of 207 consecutive patients, two models were tested. First, fear of movement model as proposed by Vlaeyen et al. (1995a) was examined. It was found that negative affectivity has direct effects on the fear and avoidance of pain, which in turn, contributes to disability. In total, fear/avoidance accounted for a significant amount of the variance of disability. In addition, severity of pain was found to increase pain disability, while itself is influenced still by negative affectivity. These findings supported the model of fear of pain as described by Vlaeyen et al. (1995a). Further, we found that self-efficacy may mediate the impact of fear of pain on disability and reduces the perceived physical disability. At the same time, self-efficacy was shown to have direct reductive impact on disability. However, both studies indicated that people who are fearful in response to pain are more likely to develop disability, although self-efficacy may play a moderating role. In the studies one, two, and three, the role of hypervigilance in over attending to pain was investigated. In study one a large sample of 168 chronic pain patients were studied. Questionnaires measuring different aspects of pain and a computerised version of the Dot-Probe Task were administered. Four types of words related to different dimensions of pain and matched neutral words were used as stimuli. Reaction times in response to the stimuli were recorded. A factorial design 3x4x2x2 and ANOVAs were employed to analyse the data.   Chronic pain patients showed a cognitive bias to sensory pain words relative to affective, disability, and threat-related words. However, contrary to expectations, those high in fear of pain responded more slowly to stimuli than those less fearful of pain.  These results suggest that patients with chronic pain problems selectively attend to sensory aspects of pain. However, selective attention appears to depend upon the nature of pain stimuli. For those who are highly fearful of pain they may not only selectively attend to pain-related information but also have difficulty disengaging from those stimuli.  In study two, 35 chronic pain patients were compared with the same number matched healthy subjects. Both groups completed measures of fear of pain, anxiety sensitivity, depression and anxiety, in addition to dot probe task. Results indicated that both groups show similar attentional bias to sensory words in comparison with other word types. However, the level of this biasness was higher for chronic pain patients. Lack of significant differences between patients and controls is discussed in the context of possible evolutionary value of sensitivity to pain as an adaptive reaction in healthy controls, and contrary, as a maladaptive response to pain in chronic pain patients.   The results of the previous research suggest that chronic pain patients demonstrate cognitive biases towards pain-related information and that such biases predict patient functioning. The forth study examined the degree to which a successful cognitive-behavioural program was able to modify the observed attentional bias towards sensory pain words. Forty-two patients with chronic pain conditions for more than three months were recruited prior to commencing a cognitive-behavioural pain management program. Participants were assessed before the program, after the program and at one-month follow-up. Results confirmed that chronic pain patients exhibited biased attention towards sensory pain-related words at pre-treatment. These biases were still evident at post-treatment, but were no longer statistically significant at follow up. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the changes in attentional bias towards sensory words between post-treatment and follow-up were predicted by pre- to post- treatment changes in fear of movement (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia) but not other relevant variables, such as fear of pain or anxiety sensitivity. These results demonstrate that successful cognitive-behavioural treatments can reduce selective attention, thought to be indicative of hypervigilance towards pain. Moreover, these biases appear to be changed by reducing the fear associated with movement. Theoretically, these results provide support for the fear of (re)injury model of pain. Clinically, this study supports the contention that fear of (re)injury and movement is an appropriate target of pain management and that reducing these fears causes patients to attend less to pain-related stimuli.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronic pain;selective attention;fear of pain;structural models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteomic Investigation of the HIV Receptors CD4 and DC-Sign/CD209</field><field name="creator">Bernhard, Oliver Karl</field><field name="description">HIV infection and disease is a multistage process that involves a variety of cell types as the virus spreads through the body. Initially, dendritic cells (DCs) present at the mucosal site of infection bind and internalise HIV for degradation and presentation to T cells. As the DCs migrate to lymph nodes and mature, part of the internalised virions remains infective inside endosomal compartments. During formation of the immunological synapse between CD4 T cells and DCs, infective virions from dendritic cells are transferred to CD4 T cells leading to a strong infection of those cells allowing rapid virus dissemination throughout the body and establishment of the typical HIV infection. Various membrane receptors are involved in this process. Initial HIV binding to DCs is mediated by C-type lectin receptors such as the mannose receptor or DC-SIGN (DC specific intracellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non integrin) which is followed by virus internalisation and lysis albeit virus induced changes in endocytic routing prevents a proportion from degradation. Productive infection of DCs has also been observed allowing trans infection of CD4 T cells through a different mechanism. HIV infection of CD4 T cells, DCs and other cells is a multistep process initiated by binding of HIV envelope gp120 to the CD4 receptor, a 55 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein. Subsequent conformational changes in gp120 allow binding to a chemokine receptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4, followed by membrane fusion and infection. The aim of this thesis was to investigate protein associations with the HIV receptors DC-SIGN and CD4 in order to elucidate the mechanism of complex formation, virus entry and/or defining target sites for antiretroviral drugs. This thesis used a proteomic approach for studying the receptors with mass spectrometry-based protein identification as its core technology. A range of different approaches were developed and compared for identification of protein interactions and characterisation of the identified protein associations. An affinity purification of the CD4 receptor complex from lymphoid cells was used as the basis for detecting novel CD4-binding proteins. For this approach a strategy based on mass spectrometry identification of CD4 associating proteins using affinity chromatography and affinity-tag mediated purification of tryptic peptides was developed. This method proved successful for the identification of CD4 interacting proteins such as the strongly associated kinase p56lck, however a limited number of non-specifically bound proteins were also identified along the receptor complex. Using one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by in-gel digests and mass spectrometry analysis, a large number of non-specifically binding proteins were identified along the CD4/lck complex. Evaluation of different lysis buffers in several independent experiments demonstrated that there was a large and inconsistent array of proteins that were obviously non-specifically bound to the receptor. No further specific binding partners were detected. These data suggested that protein interactions of CD4 on this cell type are of weak and/or transient nature. It also demonstrated a need for careful interpretation of proteomic data in the light of the propensity of non-specific binding under these conditions.  To overcome dissociation of weak protein interactions, a method was developed using chemical cross-linking to preserve weak protein interactions on lymphoid cells. Affinity purification was used to purify CD4 along with cross-linked associated proteins and mass spectrometry analysis identified an interaction with the transferrin receptor CD71 and the tyrosine phosphatase CD45. The CD45-CD4 interaction is well known. The CD4-CD71 interaction was demonstrated to be a result from colocalization of the two molecules during formation of endocytic vesicles. Flow cytometry-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements were applied to confirm colocalization. A similar interaction was suspected for CD4 and DC-SIGN on the plasma membrane of DCs as cis infection of DCs has been demonstrated i.e. initial binding to DC-SIGN then to CD4/CCR5 on the same cell. Therefore, protein associations of DC-SIGN were investigated using the developed techniques. Using cross-linking, DC-SIGN was shown to assemble in large complexes on the surface of immature monocyte-derived DCs. Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified complexes identified them as homo-oligomers of DC-SIGN. The absence of CD4 suggested that the fraction interacting with CD4 at any one time must be small. The complexes of DC-SIGN were further characterised to be tetramers and successfully co-immunoprecipitated with HIV gp120 and mannan. DC-SIGN monomers were not evident demonstrating that the assembly of DC-SIGN into tetramers is required for high affinity binding of its natural and viral ligands. Thus potential antiviral agents aimed at blocking the early stage of HIV binding to DCs must simulate tetramers in order to neutralise the virus efficiently.

In this thesis we describe fully automatic solutions that can locate faces and then perform identification and verification. We present a solution for face localisation using eye locations. We derive an efficient representation for the decision hyperplane of linear and nonlinear Support Vector Machines (SVMs). For this we introduce the novel concept of $\rho$ and $\eta$ prototypes. The standard formulation for the decision hyperplane is reformulated and expressed in terms of the two prototypes. Different kernels are treated separately to achieve further classification efficiency and to facilitate its adaptation to operate with the fast Fourier transform to achieve fast eye detection. Using the eye locations, we extract and normalise the face for size and in-plane rotations. Our method produces a more efficient representation of the SVM decision hyperplane than the well-known reduced set methods. As a result, our eye detection subsystem is faster and more accurate.    The use of fractals and fractal image coding for object recognition has been proposed and used by others. Fractal codes have been used as features for recognition, but we need to take into account the distance between codes, and to ensure the continuity of the parameters of the code. We use a method based on fractal image coding for recognition, which we call the Fractal Neighbour Distance (FND). The FND relies on the Euclidean metric and the uniqueness of the attractor of a fractal code. An advantage of using the FND over fractal codes as features is that we do not have to worry about the uniqueness of, and distance between, codes. We only require the uniqueness of the attractor, which is already an implied property of a properly generated fractal code.    Similar methods to the FND have been proposed by others, but what distinguishes our work from the rest is that we investigate the FND in greater detail and use our findings to improve the recognition rate. Our investigations reveal that the FND has some inherent invariance to translation, scale, rotation and changes to illumination. These invariances are image dependent and are affected by fractal encoding parameters. The parameters that have the greatest effect on recognition accuracy are the contrast scaling factor, luminance shift factor and the type of range block partitioning. The contrast scaling factor affect the convergence and eventual convergence rate of a fractal decoding process. We propose a novel method of controlling the convergence rate by altering the contrast scaling factor in a controlled manner, which has not been possible before. This helped us improve the recognition rate because under certain conditions better results are achievable from using a slower rate of convergence. We also investigate the effects of varying the luminance shift factor, and examine three different types of range block partitioning schemes. They are Quad-tree, HV and uniform partitioning. We performed experiments using various face datasets, and the results show that our method indeed performs better than many accepted methods such as eigenfaces. The experiments also show that the FND based classifier increases the separation between classes.    The standard FND is further improved by incorporating the use of localised weights. A local search algorithm is introduced to find a best matching local feature using this locally weighted FND. The scores from a set of these locally weighted FND operations are then combined to obtain a global score, which is used as a measure of the similarity between two face images. Each local FND operation possesses the distortion invariant properties described above. Combined with the search procedure, the method has the potential to be invariant to a larger class of non-linear distortions. We also present a set of locally weighted FNDs that concentrate around the upper part of the face encompassing the eyes and nose. This design was motivated by the fact that the region around the eyes has more information for discrimination. Better performance is achieved by using different sets of weights for identification and verification. For facial verification, performance is further improved by using normalised scores and client specific thresholding. In this case, our results are competitive with current state-of-the-art methods, and in some cases outperform all those to which they were compared. For facial identification, under some conditions the weighted FND performs better than the standard FND. However, the weighted FND still has its short comings when some datasets are used, where its performance is not much better than the standard FND. To alleviate this problem we introduce a voting scheme that operates with normalised versions of the weighted FND. Although there are no improvements at lower matching ranks using this method, there are significant improvements for larger matching ranks.    Our methods offer advantages over some well-accepted approaches such as eigenfaces, neural networks and those that use statistical learning theory. Some of the advantages are: new faces can be enrolled without re-training involving the whole database; faces can be removed from the database without the need for re-training; there are inherent invariances to face distortions; it is relatively simple to implement; and it is not model-based so there are no model parameters that need to be tweaked.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human face recognition;fractal image coding;fractal neighbour distance;FND;face identification;face verification;face authentication;face detection;eye detection;support vector machine</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical considerations in solar concentrating systems</field><field name="creator">Buie, Damien Charles William</field><field name="description">To optimise the performance of concentrating solar power systems, a detailed knowledge of the resultant flux distribution in the imaging plane is required. To achieve this, an accurate model of the direct solar beam impinging on the concentrator is essential. This thesis presents an empirical model of the terrestrial solar distribution that has both a high-correlation to observed data and an invariance to a change in location. The model is based on the amount of circumsolar radiation in the direct beam and takes into account the small variations that are due to atmospheric scattering.        A modelling framework is developed  to simulate the flux distribution in the imaging plane of a generic solar concentrating system. Algorithms are developed to include the following:  the spatial solar energy distribution; the systemic effect of reflecting that distribution off a non-ideal mirrored surface;  the spectral energy distribution;  the transmission, absorption and reflection characteristics of optical thin films; and the coordinates of the solar vector.      The framework is then used to investigate the performance of anti-reflection coatings on silicon substrates and the performance of linear Fresnel systems.  Combined, these algorithms and simulation tools  can be applied to create comprehensive optical models of solar concentrating systems.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar power;concentrating systems;insolation;radial distribtution.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three Essays on the Impact of Electronic Screen Trading in Futures Markets</field><field name="creator">Hill, Amelia Mary</field><field name="description">This dissertation consists of 3 essays that examine the impact of electronic screen trading in futures markets.

Due to disruption to normal sleep patterns, many patients with OSA suffer from increased daytime sleepiness. Epidemiological studies have established a link between OSA and driver fatigue and accidents, generally showing a two to seven times increased risk of road traffic accidents in non-commercial drivers with OSA. There is emerging evidence that commercial drivers have a higher prevalence of OSA than the general population, being predominately male, middle-aged and overweight, three important risk factors for OSA. However, little is known about the relationship between OSA and driver sleepiness in commercial drivers, whether road accidents are increased in commercial drivers with OSA, and whether OSA interacts with other fatigue promoting factors, such as sleep deprivation, to further escalate road accident risk.     One thousand randomly selected commercial drivers were surveyed in the field. In addition, 61 randomly selected NSW commercial drivers had in hospital sleep studies and daytime performance testing, including a PC based driving simulator task. The prevalence of OSA, defined as Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) &lt; 10, was approximately 50% in NSW commercial drivers. Approximately one quarter of the drivers reported pathological daytime sleepiness, and 12-14% had both OSA and pathological daytime sleepiness. A diagnosis of OSA was the most important factor predicting excessive daytime sleepiness in these drivers: OSA was more important than 15 other work-related, lifestyle and medical factors that could be expected to promote, or be associated with, daytime sleepiness. Drivers with sleep apnoea syndrome (both OSA and pathological daytime sleepiness) had an increased driving accident risk, using driving simulator and daytime performance testing as proxy measures for accident risk. These results demonstrate the importance of OSA as a cause of driver fatigue in commercial drivers and suggest that all commercial drivers should be screened for the presence of sleep apnoea syndrome in order to potentially reduce road accident risk through treatment.     A separate, but related body of work examined the combined effects of mild OSA and other fatigue promoting factors (sleep deprivation and circadian influences) on driving performance. Twenty nine subjects, consisting of a group with mild OSA and a group of non-OSA controls, were tested on several occasions throughout the night and day using an intensive performance battery, under both baseline conditions and after a period of 36 hours of total sleep deprivation. The results suggest that drivers with mild OSA are not different to the control group in their response to sleep deprivation or time of day influences. However, the subjects with mild OSA were less aware of their impairment due to sleep deprivation, which is of concern if drivers with OSA are relying on their subjective awareness of fatigue to make decisions about when to stop driving.      A final perspective on OSA and driver fatigue is provided through a clinical case series of seven fall-asleep fatality associated MVA&#65533;s associated with unrecognised or under-treated sleep disorders. As well as demonstrating the day to day potential for devastating road accidents due, at least in part, to un-recognised or untreated sleep disorders, these cases also serve to highlight some of the current medico-legal controversies and difficulties in this area of driver fatigue.       In conclusion, this body of work has provided novel information about the epidemiology and implications of OSA in commercial drivers, and about how OSA interacts with other fatigue promoting factors. Finally, it has explored some of the medico-legal issues that relate to sleep disorders and driver fatigue. As well as providing much needed information in the area of driver fatigue, at the same time this work raises many more questions and suggests areas of future research. For instance, such research should examine the relationship between objective accident rates and OSA/sleep apnoea syndrome in commercial drivers, the interaction between mild sleep apnoea syndrome and other fatigue risk factors, and driver perception of sleepiness prior to sleep onset in drivers with sleep disorders.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obstructive sleep apnoea;driver performance;driving;driving simulator;sleep disorder</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To Hell in a Handcart Educational realities, teachers' work and neo-liberal restructuring in NSW TAFE</field><field name="creator">Clark, Judith</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of neo-liberal economic restructuring on teachers, specifically teachers in technical and further education. Historically, there has been limited research undertaken on teachers as workers, and even less on TAFE teachers. During the period covered by the study, TAFE was buffeted by the massive changes, social, political, cultural and economic, that were occurring on a global scale. As a result, TAFE has been a system in crisis. The consequences are addressed by an empirical study that examines NSW TAFE teachers' experience of the great changes that have occurred to their work since the late 1980s.  Forty-one teachers were interviewed in tape recorded sessions lasting around one hour each. The respondents were drawn from twenty-seven teaching sections across all the major industry areas represented in TAFE. Twenty of the teachers were from metropolitan locations, twenty-one were regional. Nine managers were also interviewed, from Head of Studies to senior management levels, covering those with local as well as state-wide responsibilities.  The changes to TAFE have been driven by a pervasive neo-liberal ideology adopted by both major parties in Australia. This study documents the experience of TAFE teachers as that ideology led to a corporatised vocational education and training system strongly oriented to the market. It also records their responses to the narrowing of curriculum that resulted from the "industry-driven" vocational education and training policies of governments. The study gives voice to their grief, frustration and anger as their working conditions deteriorated and their commitment to quality education was undermined.   The study documents the teachers' resistance to the processes of organisational fragmentation, the increasing incidence of cost-driven, rather than educational, decision-making, and the commodification of curriculum driven by a series of policy decisions taken at both national and state level.  The study compares these experiences with those of the TAFE managers, whose response to the crisis, while differing from that of the teachers, supports the teachers' commitment to public education as a social good.  The study concludes that the NSW TAFE teachers' resistance has continued to act as a brake on the excesses of neo-liberalism. Some possibilities for an alternative vision of technical and further education thus remain.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neo-liberalism;vocational education and training;technical and further education;TAFE;TAFE teachers;teachers' work;economic restructuring and vocational education;teachers' resistance;commodification of education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">User hints for optimisation processes</field><field name="creator">Do Nascimento, Hugo Alexandre Dantas</field><field name="description">Innovative improvements in the area of Human-Computer Interaction and User Interfaces have en-abled  intuitive and effective applications for a variety of problems. On the other hand, there has  also been the realization that several real-world optimization problems still cannot be totally auto-mated.  Very often, user interaction is necessary for refining the optimization problem, managing  the computational resources available, or validating or adjusting a computer-generated solution.  This thesis investigates how humans can help optimization methods to solve such difficult prob-lems.  It presents an interactive framework where users play a dynamic and important role by pro-viding  hints. Hints are actions that help to insert domain knowledge, to escape from local minima,  to reduce the space of solutions to be explored, or to avoid ambiguity when there is more than one  optimal solution. Examples of user hints are adjustments of constraints and of an objective function,  focusing automatic methods on a subproblem of higher importance, and manual changes of an ex-isting  solution. User hints are given in an intuitive way through a graphical interface. Visualization  tools are also included in order to inform about the state of the optimization process.  We apply the User Hints framework to three combinatorial optimization problems: Graph Clus-tering,  Graph Drawing and Map Labeling. Prototype systems are presented and evaluated for each  problem. The results of the study indicate that optimization processes can benefit from human  interaction.  The main goal of this thesis is to list cases where human interaction is helpful, and provide an ar-chitecture  for supporting interactive optimization. Our contributions include the general User Hints  framework and particular implementations of it for each optimization problem. We also present a  general process, with guidelines, for applying our framework to other optimization problems.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interactive optimisation;information visualisation;graph drawing;map labelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated study of group B streptococcus and human ureaplasmas &#65533; the paradigm shifts</field><field name="creator">Kong, Fanrong</field><field name="description">Group B streptococcus (GBS, S. agalactiae) and human ureaplasmas (U. parvumand U. urealyticum) are two clinically and phylogenetically related, potential perinatal pathogens. Their relationships between genotypes and pathogenesis of GBS and ureaplasma infection were still not well understood, one of the reason is that both of them are still short of a very practical genotyping system. In the study, to solve the above problem we developed genotyping systems for the organisms (the second section). For human ureaplasmas, based on four genes/gene clusters (rRNAgene clusters, the elongation factor Tu genes, urease gene complexes and multiplebanded antigen genes), we designed many primer pairs suitable for developing species identification assays for the two newly established human ureaplasma species (U. parvum and U. urealyticum). Further, based on the heterogeneity of ureaplasma multiple banded antigen gene (which contains species- and serovar-specific regions), we developed genotyping methods for each ureaplasma species.For GBS, based on three sets of molecular markers (capsular polysaccharidesynthesis gene clusters, surface protein antigen genes and mobile genetic elements),we developed a genotyping system. The primary evaluation of the genotyping systems showed that the genotyping systems were practical alternative assays for the conventional serotyping and they will be useful to further explore the relationships between genotypes and pathogenesis of GBS and ureaplasma infection. In the study, we introduced novel data and tools into GBS and ureaplasma studies especially from genomic- and bioinformatics-based molecular microbiology(the third section). For two newly established human ureaplasma species, based on the U. parvum serovar-3 genome, and using the above four important genes/geneclusters, we exposed some interesting problems in the understanding of newureaplasma taxonomy especially in the post genomic era. For GBS, we studied the two published full genomes and exposed some new problems or possible future new research fields. In particular we found the two finished and one ongoing GBS genomes were all non-typical and suggest that future genomic project had better have genetic population structure viewpoint. Finally, we suggested that integrated studies of the two potential or conditional perinatal pathogens, from the viewpoint of evolution, would provide a new understanding angle of the pathogenesis of the two organisms. Studies suggested that during coevolution, human ureaplasmas(especially U. parvum) became friendlier than their ancestors to their human host (by losing most of its virulence genes); however, GBS tried to increase its invasive abilities (by getting more virulence genes) to fight against the human host attack.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group B streptococcus;human ureaplasmas</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Other Lives</field><field name="creator">Verden, Patricia</field><field name="description">The areas of investigation are the portrait, the gaze, the American filmmaker Errol Morris, representation of reality and subcultures.

The baseline study was commissioned and funded by the Federal Airports Corporation  (FAC), with measurements conducted in 1994 and 1995. A follow-up longitudinal  component to the study was subsequently commissioned and funded by the FAC in 1997,  and measurements conducted in the same year. As the same individuals were measured  and re-measured over changing conditions of exposure to aircraft noise, the quasiexperimental  nature of the study allowed inferences to be made regarding exposure to  aircraft noise and child BP.    The main hypotheses for testing were that BP, and within-subject longitudinal changes  in BP, are positively related to domestic jet aircraft noise exposure and longitudinal  changes in domestic jet aircraft noise exposure respectively. Subsidiary hypotheses tested  for evidence of short- and long-term BP adaptation effects where BPs were related to  prior changes to aircraft noise exposures.    A sample of 75 primary schools within a 20 km radius of Sydney Airport under various  noise exposure conditions, both existing and those projected with the advent of the new  runway, participated in the study. The baseline cohort comprised 1,230 Year 3/4 children  attending the schools in 1994 and 1995, and the follow-up participants comprised 628  of the original baseline sample re-measured in 1997. Study participants were enrolled by  active parental consent. The baseline response rate was approximately 40% of children  in the participating schools.    Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure readings of the children were taken  using automated BP measuring equipment along with anthropometric measurements  (heights, weights, skinfold thicknesses and waist measurements). Parental surveys  captured items pertaining to the child&#65533;s ethnic background as measured by the country  of birth of the child and parent(s), residential address and housing structure, child eating  habits and activity levels, along with family and child history of high blood pressure.  Aircraft noise exposure data were collected by the National Acoustic Laboratories and  processed into the energy-averaged noise metric used in Australia for aircraft noise  exposure assessment called the Australian Noise Exposure Index (ANEI). Mean  exposures for a given calendar month were used in the analysis. ANEI values were  geocoded to exact geographic locations using digitised street maps from which values  for each house and school address, also geocoded, were interpolated. A child BP  measured in a given month was matched to a aircraft noise exposure value both at their  school and residential address for that month for analysis.    After adjusting for confounding and other factors, the cross-sectional relationship  between BP and aircraft noise exposure was found to be inconsistent. SBP was nonsignificantly  negatively associated with school aircraft noise exposure at baseline (0.05  mmHg/ANEI, cluster-sampling-adjusted p&amp;gt0.05), but positively and non-significantly  associated with school aircraft noise exposure at follow-up (0.05 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;gt0.05).  As for SBP, baseline DBP was significantly negatively related to school aircraft noise  exposure at (0.09 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;lt0.001) and non-significantly positively associated  with school aircraft noise exposure at follow-up (0.05 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;gt0.05).  Within-subject BP changes, occurring from baseline to follow-up, regressed on  corresponding longitudinal changes in aircraft noise exposures produced inconsistent  results. SBP change was positively and non-significantly (0.027 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;gt0.05)  associated with corresponding school aircraft noise exposure change, while SBP change  was negatively associated total aircraft noise exposure change (statistically nonsignificant,  0.06 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;gt0.05). DBP changes were similarly and nonsignificantly  related to corresponding aircraft noise exposure changes.    Some evidence for short-term BP adaptation to recent changes in aircraft noise exposure  was found. Consistent negative associations between systolic and diastolic BP and recent  changes in school aircraft noise exposure were found. This association was statistically  significant at study baseline (SBP: 0.19 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;lt0.001; DBP: 0.12 mmHg/ANEI,  p&amp;lt0.001), and of similar magnitude although not statistically significant at  follow-up (SBP: 0.14 mmHg/ANEI; DBP: 0.10 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;gt0.05). In the  presence of inconsistent cross-sectional BP-aircraft noise exposure associations, this  finding is consistent with evidence of a homoeostatic BP response to recent changes in  aircraft noise exposure, where resting BP returns to pre-existing levels unrelated to  aircraft noise exposure. The public health implication of this finding appears to be benign.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blood pressure;aircraft noise;child</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Tumour Active Compounds with Multiple Metal Centres</field><field name="creator">Daghriri, Hassan</field><field name="description">Four tumour active trinuclear complexes: DH4Cl: [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2m-{trans-Pd(  NH3)2(H2N(CH2)4NH2)2]Cl4, DH5Cl: [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2m-{trans-Pd(  NH3)2(H2N(CH2)5NH2)2]Cl4, DH6Cl: [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2m-{trans-Pd(  NH3)2(H2N(CH2)6NH2)2]Cl4, DH7Cl: [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2m-{trans-Pd(NH3)2-(  H2N(CH2)7NH2)2]Cl4 and one dinuclear complex DHD: [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}&#65533;-{  H2N(CH2)6NH2}{trans-PdCl(NH3)2]Cl(NO3), have been prepared and characterised based  on elemental analyses, IR, Raman, mass and 1 H NMR spectral measurements. For the  trinuclear complexes, the synthesis has been carried out using a step-up method branching  out from the central palladium unit. A purity of about 95% has been obtained by repeated  dissolution and precipitation. The activity against human cancer cell lines including ovary  cell lines: A2780, A2780 cisR , A2780 ZD0473R , non small lung cell line: NCI-H640 and  melanoma: Me-10538 have been determined based on MMT assay. Cell uptakes, DNA-binding  have been determined for ovary cell lines: A2780, A2780 cisR . The nature of  interaction with pBR322 plasmid DNA and ssDNA has been studied for trinuclear complexes  DH4Cl, DH5Cl, DH6Cl and DH7Cl and the dinuclear complex DHD. Interaction of DH6Cl  with adenine and guanine has also been studied by HPLC. The compounds are found to  exhibit significant anticancer activity against cancer cell lines especially ovarian cancer cell  lines: A2780, A2780 cisR and A2780 ZD0473R . DH6Cl in which the linking diamine has six  carbon atoms is found to be the most active compound. As the number of carbon atoms in thelinking diamine is changed from the optimum value of six, the activity is found to decrease,  illustrating the structure-activity relationship. The increase in uptake of the trinuclear  complexes in A2780 cell line with the increase in size of the linking diamine coupled with  the low molar conductivity values found for the solutions of the compounds suggest that the  compounds would remain in solution as undissociated &#65533;molecules&#65533; and hence could cross the  cell membrane by passive diffusion. Much lower resistance factors for the all the  multinuclear compounds including DHD as applied to A2780 cisR cell line, as compared to  that for cisplatin, suggest that the compounds are able to overcome multiple mechanisms of  resistance operating in the cell line. All of the multinuclear complexes are expected to form  long-range interstrand GG adducts with DNA, causing irreversible global changes in the  DNA conformation but unlike cisplatin do not cause sufficient DNA bending to be  recognized by HMG 1 protein. Increasing prevention of BamH1 digestion with the increase  in concentration of the multinuclear compounds also provide support to the idea that the  compounds because of the formation of a plethora of interstrand GG adducts are able to  cause irreversible changes in DNA conformation. The results of the study show that indeed  new trinuclear tumour active compounds can be found by replacing the central platinum unit  in BBR3464 with other suitable metal units.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">platinum;palladium;tumour active;multiple metal centres;gel electriphoresis;cell uptake</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Illness Self-Schema in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</field><field name="creator">Denton, Fiona</field><field name="description">Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a relatively rare autoimmune disease with no known aetiology or cure. In addition to numerous physical symptoms, those living with SLE have also been shown to experience significant emotional and psychosocial difficulties. There has been little psychological research into SLE despite the rapidly increasing interest in health psychology and quality of life issues over the last two decades. One such issue that has commanded particular attention is that of cognitive bias in individuals with chronic pain and/or chronic illness. Cognitive bias toward illness-related information is theorised to indicate the presence of an illness self-schema, and is a valuable tool of investigation as it permits access to a level of cognitive structure that is inaccessible via self-report instruments.     The primary focus of the present study is to investigate recall bias for pain- and illness-related words in SLE patients. This bias is explored relative to the recall of neutral words and depression-related words, and also relative to the responses of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy controls. Two hypotheses are proposed: firstly, that bias is related to disease activity; and secondly, that bias is related to the combination of illness and depression.    The findings provide support for the second hypothesis, with the additional caveat that the nature of the pain/illness stimuli used is important in determining the presence of cognitive bias. No recall bias for illness-related words as a whole was found in any of the groups, nor was there evidence of a recall bias in the SLE and RA patients when they were divided according to depression status. However, when the illness words were examined separately according to &#65533;sensory pain&#65533; and &#65533;disability-related&#65533; words, a clear bias for disability words was found in the depressed patient group. It is concluded that there is a relationship between depression in chronically ill individuals, and the way in which such individuals process disability-related words. In accordance with the schema-enmeshment model (Pincus &amp; Morley, 2001), it is suggested that both a pain-schema and an illness-schema exist, and it is when these two schemas become enmeshed with the self-schema that depression occurs in chronic pain/chronically ill patients.     The cognitive bias assessment paradigm adopted in this study-one that is typically used in similar investigations-is lengthy, requires sophisticated equipment and can be difficult to interpret on an individual level. The present study investigates the relationship between cognitive biases in SLE patients and a recently-developed task, PRISM, which appears to symbolise the enmeshment of illness-, pain- and self-schemas. Analyses confirmed that recall of negative illness words was the only independent predictor of PRISM scores.

Specialty fibres, however, typically have more complex dopant profiles. Designs with high dopant concentrations and multidoping are common, making control of the fabrication process particularly important. In photonic crystal fibres (PCF) the inclusion of air-structures imposes a new challenge for the drawing process.     The aim of this study is to gain profound insight into the behaviour of complex optical fibre structures during the final fabrication step, fibre drawing. Two types of optical fibre, namely conventional silica fibres and PCFs, were studied. Germanium and fluorine diffusion during drawing was studied experimentally and a numerical analysis was performed of the effects of drawing parameters on diffusion. An experimental study of geometry control of PCFs during drawing was conducted with emphasis given to the control of hole size. The effects of the various drawing parameters and their suitability for controlling the air-structure was studied. The effect of air-structures on heat transfer in PCFs was studied using computational fluid dynamics techniques.      Both germanium and fluorine were found to diffuse at high temperature and low draw speed. A diffusion coefficent for germanium was determined and simulations showed that most diffusion occurred in the neck-down region. Draw temperature and preform feed rate had a comparable effect on diffusion. The hole size in PCFs was shown to depend on the draw temperature, preform feed rate and the preform internal pressure. Pressure was shown to be the most promising parameter for on-line control of the hole size. Heat transfer simulations showed that the air-structure had a significant effect on the temperature profile of the structure. It was also shown that the preform heating time was either increased or reduced compared to a solid structure and depended on the air-fraction.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical fibre;fibre fabrication;fibre drawing;dopant diffusion;photonic crystal fibre;microstructured optical fibre;air-silica structured fibre;germanium diffusion;fluorine diffusion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concept formation through iconicity: basic shapes and their metaphorical extensions in English and Japanese</field><field name="creator">Teranishi, Takahiro</field><field name="description">Abstract     One of the ways for a speaker to make sense of an object or event in the real world is to make use of iconicity between two things. Through iconic metaphorical extensions, the speaker connects the object or event to something else. In this study, I consider how speakers form concepts through iconic metaphorical extensions, examining how they metaphorically extend one concept to another. I suggest that all speakers use the same ways of forming metaphorical extensions and control metaphorical extensions according to their intentions and contexts.   Using basic and simple shapes (e.g. 0) and their related metaphorical expressions (e.g. `a circular argument'), I discuss the role of iconicity in metaphorical understanding, the relationship between concept and language, and metaphorical extensions as tools of concept formation. I conduct descriptive investigations using dictionaries and compare related senses for particular basic shapes between English and Japanese, looking at their polysemous networks and historical changes. Using questionnaires, interviews and tasks with native speakers of English and Japanese, I conduct experimental investigations to examine the speakers' associations in relation to basic shapes and the degree of iconicity in metaphorical extensions.   This study suggests that concepts, although probably stored in the mental space, are recreated every time they occur. Concept formation through iconic metaphorical extensions must be dynamic because it is based on 'extensions' of existing concepts, and must be universal to all speakers because metaphorical extensions are among the most basic mental activities of human beings. I propose dynamic and universal models which represent the way in which a speaker forms concepts, connecting a linguistic form and a mental picture and controlling iconic metaphorical extensions. These models contribute to understanding both similarities and differences in use of metaphorical extensions between English and Japanese.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">linguistics;metaphor;Japanese;metaphorical extensions;concept formation;iconicity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A randomised controlled trial of oxygen therapy on growth and development of preterm infants</field><field name="creator">Askie, Lisa Maree</field><field name="description">Background:     Physiological studies have shown that many preterm infants and infants with chronic lung disease may suffer chronic hypoxaemia, which possibly leads to poor growth and development.  Anecdotal reports indicate that there is a drive to increase the oxygen saturation target range to a higher level in these infants due primarily to perceived benefits derived from clinical experience and from uncontrolled observational studies of babies discharged on home oxygen.  Objective   The BOOST (Benefits Of Oxygen Saturation Targeting) trial is the first randomised trial to assess the long-term benefits and harms of two different oxygen saturation target ranges.      Methods:  BOOST was a multicentre, double blinded, randomised controlled trial that enrolled 358 infants born at less than 30 weeks&#65533; gestation who remained oxygen-dependent at 32 weeks postmenstrual age. They were randomly assigned to target either a functional oxygen saturation range of 91-94% (standard or control group) or 95-98% (higher or treatment group). The primary outcomes were growth and neurodevelopmental measures at 12 months corrected age. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, retinopathy of prematurity, health service utilisation, parental stress, and infant temperament.       Results:   Prognostic baseline characteristics did not differ between the two groups. Mean birth weight and gestational age of enrolled infants was 917g and 26.5 weeks respectively.

The importance of the sample lies in   the fact  that it is the first BL Lac sample in   which initial selection has been made from optical  spectra, independent of the objects' flux levels   at X-ray and radio frequencies. These optically   selected candidate BL Lac objects thus provide an   unbiased sample (in terms of radio flux density)   with which to study the proportion of radio-  dominant and X-ray-dominant BL Lac objects in the   global population.      The observed number counts and redshift distribution   of the 2BL are consistent with theoretical predictions   based on the QSO evolutionary model. Given the   small number statistics we are not, however, able   to show that this distribution is significantly   different to that of the 2QZ/6QZ white dwarfs.   A median redshift of z=1.25 was computed for these   candidate BL Lacs, a value supported by redshift   information obtained for ~25% of the sample. This   median redshift is much higher than redshifts   found for  X-ray selected BL Lac objects and    suggests that in the past high redshift, low   luminosity, radio-weak BL Lacs may have been missed   in radio- and X-ray-selected samples.      From results of the above studies it appears that   this sample of optically selected candidate BL Lac   objects is different to that of hitherto known   radio-loud BL Lacs.  We explore mechanisms that   might produce such radio-weak/radio-quiet continuum   objects, and also demonstrate that such radio-quiet   BL Lac objects could exist at low redshift.    Failure to include these radio-quiet BL Lacs in   X-ray selected samples could explain the negative   evolution found for this class of object.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BL Lac objects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetics of the immune cell receptors TCRB and CCR5 in human disease</field><field name="creator">Buhler, Marc McWilliams</field><field name="description">Abstract Early in the evolution of the vertebrates it is thought that two genomic duplications occurred, providing a basis for the evolution in body plan and neural crest of very early vertebrates and substantive material for further evolution of various gene families such as those making up a number of components of the adaptive vertebrate immune system. While the bony fish possibly had another, genome duplications are not generally a feature of vertebrate evolution and indeed the appearance of an antigen-adaptive immune recognition system may have served to limit the size that various vertebrate genomes, including that of the human, can in fact achieve. This initial step in vertebrate immune evolution, the establishment of recognition of non-self against the unique set of 'self' epitopes for an individual, provided an immensely powerful weapon in immune function with the ability to tailor a defense against as-yet-unseen dangers at any time albeit with the pitfall of autoimmune disease. As the recognition sites of the antigen receptor molecules such as TcR are produced by clonal modification of the segments provided in the germline and are thus not in the genome itself, pathogens have not been able to hijack this one component of the immune system in the way so many other components have been put to use throughout evolution, nor do these components necessarily reveal themselves as associated with disease through genome screens. Importantly, overall immune function is determined not just by the potential repertoire of recognition receptors but also by the ability of immunocompetent cells to migrate in a tissue specific fashion through the use of various chemokines and their receptors. Typical of the hijacking of an immune system component by a pathogen is the use of a chemokine ligand gene in the viral ancestor to SIV and HIV, allowing for virus binding to immunocompetent cells as is seen in the use of the CCR5 chemokine receptor by macrophage-tropic HIV strains. This thesis describes the allele and genotype frequencies for several TcR beta-chain variable segment polymorphisms in a population of MS patients compared with controls before and after stratification for HLA-DR15, polymorphism in the Apo-1 / Fas promoter, the DRB1 Val86/Val86 genotype, CCR5-delta32 and the HLA-DRA promoter. The thesis continues with CCR5-delta32 genotyping in IDDM, MS and SLE cohorts and then examines the question of the population of origin of the delta-32 allele of the CCR5 receptor for chemokine. Here, a case / control comparison of 122 RR-MS patients with 96 normal individuals was made for allele and genotype frequencies and for haplotypes formed by pairs of TCRB markers. Further analysis was made after HLA-DR15 stratification. Linkage disequilibrium was found between pairs of alleles of bv8s1, bv10s1, bv15s1 and bv3s1 loci in both patients and controls. In the RR-MS cohort, an increase in the allele frequency of bv8s1*2 was seen (p = 0.03) and the haplotype bv8s1*2 / bv3s1*1 was increased (p = 0.006), and both were found to be statistically significant. In the DR15-positive group, association between MS and TCRB was seen with the bv8s1*2 allele (p = 0.05) and the bv8s1*2 / bv10s1 haplotypes (p = 0.048), while the haplotype associations seen among the DR15-negative patients included the bv3s1*1 allele (bv10s1*1 / bv3s1*1, p = 0.022; bv8s1*2 / bv3s1*1, p = 0.048). While no associations were found after stratification for SDF1-3'A, Apo-1 / Fas or DRB1 there were modest interactions between bv3s1, bv10s1 and bv15s1 and the HLA-DRA promoter. These results support the involvement of the TCRB region in MS susceptibility. The further study of autoimmune disease here includes genotype analysis of CCR5-delta32 in type 1 diabetes (IDDM) and SLE. CCR5 is the major co-receptor for viral entry used by macrophage-tropic HIV strains and protection from infection is seen in homozygotes for CCR5-delta32. In diabetes, infiltration of pancreatic tissue by autoreactive T-cells involves secretion of multiple cytokines and chemokine receptor expression. Variation in the chemokine receptor CCR5 may result in differences in inflammatory cell migration in response to relevant chemokines. Adolescents with type 1 diabetes were genotyped for CCR5-delta32 (n = 626). The allele frequency was compared with that of 253 non-diabetic adolescents and with that of 92 adults with SLE. A reduced allele frequency was seen in type 1 diabetes compared with controls (0.092 vs 0.123, p = 0.05). This difference was not seen for the cohort of patients with SLE (freq = 0.114). A reduction in the number of CCR5-delta32/delta32 homozygotes, who lack CCR5, in the type 1 diabetes cohort was also seen and while not statistically significant (2 observed compared to 5.25 expected; p = 0.12) is interesting. These results suggest a partial protection from type 1 diabetes for CCR5-delta32 homozygous individuals is possible and that CCR5 has a potential role in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Global surveys of the CCR5-delta32 allele have confirmed a single mutation event in a Northeastern European population as the source of this allele. Here, Australian Ashkenazi Jews (n = 807) were found to have a CCR5-delta32 allele frequency of 14.6% while Australian Sephardic Jews (n = 35) had a frequency of 5.7% and non-Jewish Australian controls (n = 311) had an allele frequency of 11.25%. Data on birthplace of grandparents showed a gradient with highest CCR5-delta32 frequencies from Eastern European Ashkenazim (~19.5% for those whose four grandparents come only from Russia, Poland, Hungary, Austria and Czechoslovakia; n = 197) which differs significantly from the frequency seen in Ashkenazi Jews from Western Europe (n = 101, p = 0.001). Homozygotes for CCR5-delta32 were genotyped with 3p21 region microsatellites. This has defined an ancestral haplotype on which the mutation first occurred and helped to date this event to between 40 and 50 generations ago or just over a thousand years ago. The population gradient, combined with the dating of the mutation by microsatellite allele frequencies, suggests an origin for the CCR5-delta32 allele in a population ancestral to the Ashkenazim. The distribution in non-Jewish populations in northern Europe has led others to postulate spread of the mutation by Vikings. It is hypothesised here that the link between the two populations could be the kingdom of Khazaria with subsequent admixture into both Swedish Vikings and Ashkenazi Jews. The basic driving force of evolution is through selection and the immune system has a role which, through the survival pressure exerted by viruses and other pathogens, has the potential to exert a great deal of selective force on the various components of this system. The effects of this pronounced selection on an immune system component can be seen for example in the increase of the CCR5-delta32 allele over the last thousand years to the current frequency. As mentioned, some immune system components are not affected by such straightforward selection. In the case of the TCRBV segments, effects on the immune repertoire can occur through MHC interaction at the point of thymic entry and in the effects of various superantigens, but the actual binding pockets that recognise antigen are themselves unable to be selected for (or against). The findings presented in this thesis provide support for the association of TCRBV gene segments with multiple sclerosis and also provide support for the further study of the role of the CCR5-delta32 allele in type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, data presented here suggests that the CCR5-delta32 allele had an origin in the Khazar Kingdom just over a thousand years ago, accounting for the allele frequencies in both the Ashkenazi Jews and in lands frequented by the Vikings. The definition of an extended ancestral haplotype for the CCR5-delta32 allele shows how the effect of selection of an allele of one gene can carry with it specific alleles of a large number of other genes as well.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T-cell receptor;TCRBV;chemokine receptor;CCR5;multiple sclerosis;diabetes;Ashkenazi Jew;Khazar Kingdom</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guilt, shame, and grief: an empirical study of perinatal bereavement</field><field name="creator">Barr, Peter</field><field name="description">Aim. The aim of the present research was to investigate the relationship of  personality guilt- and shame-proneness to grief and psychological dysphoria  following bereavement due to stillbirth or death in the newborn period.  Methods. Participating parents completed self-report questionnaire measures of  proneness to situational guilt and shame (Test of Self-Conscious Affect-2),  chronic guilt and shame (Personal Feelings Questionnaire-2) and interpersonal  guilt (Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire-67), grief (Perinatal Grief Scale-33) and  psychological dysphoria (General Health Questionnaire-28) one month (&#65533;early&#65533;,  N = 158) and 13 months (&#65533;late&#65533;, N = 149) after a perinatal death.  Results. Women compared with men self-reported more intense grief, anxiety  and depression one month after the death, but there were no significant sex  differences in grief or psychological dysphoria one year later.  Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that composite shame  (situational and chronic) explained a small but statistically significant  proportion of the variance in early total grief (adjusted R  2  = .09) and anxiety  (adjusted R  2  = .07) in women, and early total grief (adjusted R  2  = .19), anxiety  (adjusted R  2  = .13) and depression (adjusted R  2  = .10) in men. Composite guilt  (situational, chronic and interpersonal) controlled for shame did not make a  significant further contribution to the variance in early total grief, anxiety or  depression in either sex.  Composite shame explained not only significant but meaningful proportions of  the variance in late grief (adjusted R2=.27), anxiety (adjusted R2=.21) and depression (adjusted R2=.27) in women, and late grief (adjusted R2= .56),anxiety (adjusted R  2= .30) and depression (adjusted R2= .51) in men. Composite  guilt controlled for shame made significant further contributions to the variancein late grief (&#8710;R  2  = .21), anxiety (&#8710;R  2  = .16) and depression (&#8710;R  2  = .25) in  women, and late grief (&#8710;R  2  = .11) in men. Shame and guilt together explained a substantial proportion of the variance in late grief (adjusted R2= .45), anxiety (adjusted R2= .33) and depression (adjusted R2= .49) in women, and late grief (adjusted R2= .64), anxiety (adjusted R2= .35) and depression (adjusted R2= .56) in men.    Situational shame, chronic guilt and survivor guilt made positive unique  contributions to the variance in late grief in women. Chronic shame and  survivor guilt made unique contributions to the variance in late grief in men.  Situational guilt made a significant unique negatively valenced contribution to  the variance in late grief in women.  Early composite shame, but not guilt, predicted late grief, anxiety and  depression in men. Early composite shame and/or guilt did not predict late  grief, anxiety or depression in women.  Conclusion. Personality proneness to shame was more relevant to late grief,  anxiety and depression in men than in women, but survivor guilt was equally  important to late grief in both sexes. Chronic guilt and functional situational  guilt were pertinent to late grief, anxiety and depression in women, but not in  men. Personality shame- and guilt-proneness have important relationships with  parental grief after perinatal death that have not hitherto been recognised.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guilt;shame;grief;perinatal bereavement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Components for Wide Bandwidth Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Paul Philip</field><field name="description">In radio astronomy wider observing bandwidths are constantly desired for the reasons of improved sensitivity and velocity coverage. As observing frequencies move steadily higher these needs become even more pressing. In order to process wider bandwidths, components that can perform at higher frequencies are required.     The chief limiting component in the area of digital spectrometers and correlators is the digitiser. This is the component that samples and quantises the bandwidth of interest for further digital processing, and must function at a sample rate of at least twice the operating bandwidth. In this work a range of high speed digitiser integrated circuits (IC) are designed using an advanced InP HBT semiconductor process and their performance limits analysed. These digitiser ICs are shown to operate at up to 10 giga-samples/s, significantly faster than existing digitisers, and a complete digitiser system incorporating one of these is designed and tested that operates at up to 4 giga-samples/s, giving 2 GHz bandwidth coverage. The digitisers presented include a novel photonic I/O digitiser which contains an integrated photonic interface and is the first digitiser device reported with integrated photonic connectivity.     In the complementary area of analogue correlators the limiting component is the device which performs the multiplication operation inherent in the correlation process. A 15 GHz analogue multiplier suitable for such systems is designed and tested and a full noise analysis of multipliers in analogue correlators presented. A further multiplier design in SiGe HBT technology is also presented which offers benefits in the area of low frequency noise.     In the effort to process even wider bandwidths, applications of photonics to digitisers and multipliers are investigated. A new architecture for a wide bandwidth photonic multiplier is presented and its noise properties analysed, and the use of photonics to increase the sample rate of digitisers examined.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radio Astronomy;Indium Phosphide;Digitisers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postmortem Identification through matching dental traits with population data</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Paul Terence Girot</field><field name="description">In cases of forensic dental identification, a key factor in the comparison of  the dental status of deceased persons with antemortem dental records is  the matching of dental restorations in individual teeth.  Many studies have been performed showing the prevalence of dental  interventions. This has mostly been performed by counting the numbers  of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) in each mouth without  detailed data collection on a per-tooth basis.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the research question: to what  extent would data on the distribution and prevalence of restoration types in the  human dentition facilitate forensic identification?  A database program was developed to allow efficient collection and  collation of dental trait information. Provision was made for storing  information relating to a subject's individual teeth, such as restorative  materials used and surfaces filled. Other data, such as missing teeth, caries status on a per-individual tooth basis and presence and details of  types of prostheses may be stored.  iii  Data from patients attending a private group practice in Hobart was  collected and a system was devised to enable the likelihood of dental trait  occurrence to be calculated in cases of forensic dental identification.  The capabilities of the system are demonstrated in a series of mock cases of  dental identification. An opportunity to make use of the database for which it  was designed arose in relation to the analysis of person identification  evidence in a murder trial at the Tasmanian Supreme Court.  The use of this reference database in evidence invoked lengthy debate  involving the judge, crown prosecutor and defence barristers. The resulting  voire dire was resolved in favour of conclusions drawn from the use of the  database being admitted in evidence.

Based on the hypothesis that the NMDA system is linked to neuronal death, by way of excitotoxicity, correlations were also sought between cell death and changes in NMDA receptor (NR1) expression in brainstem nuclei controlling cardiorespiratory function.     The first aim of this study was to verify that increased neuronal cell death occurs in SIDS infants. To verify a piglet model of SIDS risk factors, brainstem changes were examined in piglets exposed to IHH, and comparisons were made to changes seen in SIDS infants. The NMDA receptor was characterised in controls for both the human infant and the piglet groups. Comparisons of neuronal changes were made with SIDS infants, and piglets exposed to IHH.     Non-radioactive in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry were performed on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded brainstem tissue to identify markers of cell death (caspase-3, active caspase-3, and TUNEL), and to examine NR1 mRNA and protein expressions. Staining was quantified using computerised image analysis software. Eight nuclei from the brainstem medulla (caudal in piglets, and mid in infants), and two nuclei from the rostral pons (infants) were studied.    The first dataset included human infants aged 1-6 months with a diagnosis of SIDS (n=15) or non-SIDS (n=10). The second dataset comprised developing piglets aged 13-14 days, with controls (n=6), against those exposed to IHH for 2 (n=6) or 4 (n=5) days. Increased neuronal cell death was not verified in the SIDS infants, but abnormalities in NR1 expression were present in selected nuclei of the medulla. Piglets exposed to IHH had increased neuronal cell death and changes in NR1 in selected nuclei of the medulla. There was also a positive correlation between increased cell death and high NR1 levels. Preliminary data showed that SIDS infants who usually slept prone had some differences in NR1 compared to those who did not usually sleep prone.     From these findings, it was concluded that IHH may underlie the abnormalities in NMDA receptor expression that are present in the brainstem of SIDS infants. Although IHH can induce an increase in neuronal cell death, its significance in the aetiology of SIDS is not known. In piglets, IHH induced cell death correlated with high NMDA expression in some brainstem nuclei, supporting the hypothesis that excitotoxicity may be involved in the mechanism for cell death. Moreover, this thesis presents for the first time, &#65533;preliminary pathological proof&#65533; of an association between prone sleeping and abnormal NMDA receptor expression in SIDS infants.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apoptosis;brainstem;caspase-3;development;NMDA;piglets;sudden infant death syndrome;TUNEL.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microdebitage and the Archaeology of Rock Art:  an experimental approach</field><field name="creator">Susino, George James</field><field name="description">The search for a reliable and non-invasive technique for the dating of rock art has  produced an array of different, localised, and limited techniques. This is one of  them. Still in its experimental stage, the recognition of quartz microdebitage  produced by the pecking of engravings is the aim of this project.  This investigation aims to establish whether microdebitage from rock engravings  can be distinguished from other sediments. Analysis of microdebitage from rock  engraving experiments was used to determine the difference between  experimental and naturally derived particles. This research discusses  methodology, and applications for the recognition of quartz grain features,  derived from experimental and natural material from Mutawintji National Park  (Broken Hill, NSW, Australia) and the Sydney region (NSW Australia).  A three-step process was devised for this research:   What features occur on non-cultural quartz grains?   What features occur on rock engraving quartz grains? Are they  different?   Can rock engraving quartz microdebitage be identified under natural  conditions?  Microdebitage from rock engravings was examined using optical and scanning  electron microscopy to identify diagnostic attributes, with the objective of  assessing the potential of microdebitage for spatial and temporal archaeological  investigation. Characteristics of the quartz grains in the microdebitage were  compared with quartz from differing environments. The observation of  diagnostic features on quartz grains made it possible to discriminate between  microdebitage from rock engravings and the natural soil background. This  knowledge may be applied to excavated material from archaeological sites, for  identifying episodes of rock engraving and other lithic activity in temporal  relation to other evidence of cultural activity.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1.

The total corpus accounted for in terms of text type or genre numbers 420 texts of varying length, 125 of which, produced in response to four narrative questions, are investigated in greater detail in respect both of the types of text they constitute as well as of some of their linguistic realisations. These largely narrative-type texts, which represent between two and three hours of spoken English and total approximately 53000 words, are presented in a second volume analysed in terms of their textual or generic structure as well as their realisation at the level of the clause complex.

Martin and others working within his model which foregrounds the notion that all aspects of the system(s) involved are related to one another probabilistically.   In order to investigate the concept of text in actual discourse under conditions which permit us to become sufficiently confident of our understanding of it to proceed to generalisations about text and its contextual conditioning in spoken discourse, we turn to Labovian methods of sociolinguistic inquiry, i.e. to quantitative methods or methods of quantifying linguistic choice. The study takes the sociolinguistic interview as pioneered by Labov in his study of phonological variation in New York City and develops it for the purpose of investigating textual variation. The question of methodology constitutes a substantial part of the study, contributing in the process to a much greater understanding of the very phenomenon of text in discourse, for example by addressing itself to the question of the feasibility of operationalising a concept of text in the context of spoken discourse.   The narrative-type texts investigated in further detail were found to range on a continuum from most experientially-oriented texts such as procedure and recount at one end to the classic narrative of personal experience and anecdote to the increasingly interpersonally-oriented exemplum and observation, both of which become interpretative of the real world in contrast to the straightforwardly representational slant taken on the same experience by the more experientially-oriented texts. The explanation for the generic variation along this continuum must be sought in a system of generic choice which is essentially cultural.   A quantitative analysis of clausal theme and clause complex-type relations was carried out, the latter by means of log-linear analysis, in order to investigate their correlation with generic structure. While it was possible to relate the choice of theme to the particular stages of generic structures, clause complex-type relations are chosen too infrequently to be related to stages and were thus related to genres as a whole. We find that while by and large the choice of theme correlates well with different generic stages, it only discriminates between different genres, i.e. generic structures in toto, for those genres which are maximally different. Similarly, investigating the two choices in the principal systems involved in the organisation of the clause complex, i.e. the choice of taxis (parataxis vs. hypotaxis) and the (grammatically independent) choice of logico-semantic relations (expansion vs. projection), we find that both those choices discriminate better between types more distant on a narrative continuum.   The log-linear analysis of clause complex-type relations also permitted the investigation of the social characteristics of speakers. We found that the choice of logico-semantic relations correlates with genre and question, while the choice of taxis correlates with a speaker's sex and his membership of some social group (in addition to genre). Parataxis is favoured by men and by members of the group lowest in the social hierarchy. Age on the other hand is not significant in the choice of taxis at all. In other words, since social factors are clearly shown to be significant in the making of abstract grammatical choices where they cannot be explained in terms of the functional organisation of text, we conclude that social factors must be made part of a model of text in order to fully account for its contextual conditioning.   The study demonstrates that an understanding of the linguistic properties of discourse requires empirical study and, conversely, that it is possible to study discourse empirically without relaxing the standards of scientific inquiry.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">text linguistics</field><field name="subject">discourse linguistics</field><field name="subject">sociolinguistics</field><field name="subject">probabilistic grammar</field><field name="subject">variation study</field><field name="subject">Labovian quantificational methods</field><field name="subject">Hallidayan text linguistics</field><field name="subject">systemic-functional grammar</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An argument on culture safety in health service delivery: towards better health outcomes for Aboriginal peoples</field><field name="creator">Jackson Pulver, Lisa Rae</field><field name="description">The bureaucratic measure of health service, health performance indicators, suggest that we are not effective in our legislative responsibility to deliver suitable health care to some of the populations we are meant to serve.

They are among the oldest porphyry Cu-Au deposits in the Pacific Rim region. They are similar to younger deposits in terms of tectonic setting and structure, but the largest are chemically distinct, being associated with shoshonite magmas (Cadia, Ridgeway and Northparkes). The Lachlan Fold Belt (LFB) porphyries are subdivided into four sub-groups based mainly on their age relative to development of the Lachlan Transverse Zone (LTZ) structure. Two subgroups pre-date the LTZ, one group is syn&#65533;LTZ and one group post-dates the LTZ. No mineralisation has been found or reported among pre-I.TZ porphyries. but it is common in post- . l Z_ porphyries.  Petrographic analysis and microprobe results establish a wide range of primary and secondary features within the Ordovician rocks examined in this study. Cale alkaline to shoshonitic affinities are supported by the variable abundance of primary K-feldspars. Primary mineral phases such as pyroxenes and igneous magnetite provide an indication of fractioning mineral assemblages responsible for igneous trends in magma chemistry. The hydrothermal mineral assemblages documented in these LFB study areas are characteristic of younger Cu-Au Porphyry style mineralisation. As expected, the most pervasive alteration is associated with highly mineralised shoshonitic Ordovician rocks at Ridgeway, and Cadia. the less strongly mineralised calc alkaline Ordovician rocks at Cargo. Copper Ilill and Fairholme. are correspondingly less strongly altered overall. although secondary mineral assemblages are locally abundant. Many varieties of oxides and carbonates are observed at the different study localities.  Most of the studied samples conform to igneous chemical trends because they are weakly altered, although post magmatic processes, such as veining, are detectable in certain trends. The K2O enrichment of the studied samples is consistent with subductionmoditied mantle wedge sources. A few effects, such as the high Fe203 contents of some Ridgeway samples, probably reflect porphyry-style hydrothermal alteration processes. Host rocks at the Cadia and Ridgeway are entirely alkalic on the K2O versus SiO2 plot and shoshonitic on the Total Alkalies versus SiO2 plot. Igneous rocks at the other deposits display a range of compositions between low K tholeiites to shoshonites that in some cases reflects multiple igneous suites.  The LREE and L1LE enrichments, and HFSE depletions (Nb, Ta and Ti) of the magmas associated with these deposits are characteristics of a subduction-related tectonic setting. They all fall in the volcanic-arc granite and syn-collisional granite field of the Nb-Y tectonic discrimination diagram. Several magma types are identified by differences in the HFSE and REE trends. Differences in the extent and style of magma fractionation are evident in the trace element data. The Ridgeway samples define a wider range of trace element concentrations than the Cadia samples that may indicate a greater extent of fractionation during emplacement of the Ridgeway magmas. Fairholme samples display a high Nh and /If trends that are distinct from the main fields on Zr variation diagrams.  Compositional differences between larger Cu-Au deposits, Cadia-Ridgeway and smaller deposits, Copper Ifill, Cargo and Fairholme are evident in terms of Nb-Ta depletion and variation. The smaller deposits show constant Nb/Ta or negative Nb/Ta trends that extend to high Nb. The larger deposits display positive Nb/Ta trends that do not extend to high Nb. This distinction reflects a difference of preferential incorporation of Nb in a mineral phase (magnetite). Comparisons between Cadia-Ridgeway and other shoshonite (altered samples of Bajo de la Alumbrera, Argentina), calc alkaline magmas  from New Zealand and rocks from other areas indicate that Nb/Ta is not directly correlated with the shoshonitic classification, K2O vs. SiO2, and that the Cadia-Ridgeway Nb and Ta variation is not the result of alteration. The fact that the weakly altered LFB Capertee shoshonites exhibit a narrow range of Nb and low Nb/Ta suggest the shoshonite trend for the LFB as a whole is a steep one on the Nb/Ta versus Nb plot. The results of this study could provide important information for exploration within the LFB. Only the Cadia and Ridgeway deposits display a wide range of Nb/Ta values and lack the near-horizontal trend seen for other localities associated with smaller deposits. The tectonic evolution of the LFB is a major factor contributing to occurrence of large porphyry Cu-Au deposits. The sequence of important events, however, commences with sub-crustal generation of oxidised magma and finishes with efficient Cu-Au accumulation by hydrothermal processes at favourable structural sites. The increase in Au-Cu deposit size from small (Copper Hill-Cargo) to world class (Cadia-Ridgeway) indicates the importance of magma composition during this process. The most obvious differences between the Cadia-Ridgeway and New Zealand rocks is that the latter are volcanic in origin and associated with an arc-back arc system. Therefore, they did not form in a tectonic regime suitable for the evolution of porphyries and the focussed movement of hydrothermal fluids during dilatant episodes. As a result, they are not linked to mineralisation despite having Nb-Ta and Nb/Ta variations that are typical of the high oxidation states in Au-prospective magmas of the LFB.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology;petrography;geochemistry;tectonic factors;porphyry;copper-gold;Lachlan</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution and impact of invasive species : cane toads and snakes in Australia</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Ben Lee</field><field name="description">Evolution can occur rapidly, along timescales that are traditionally regarded as 'ecological'.  Despite growing acceptance among biologists of rapid evolution, a strong paradigm of contemporary evolution is still absent in many sub-disciplines.  Here I apply a contemporary evolution viewpoint to conservation biology.  Specifically, I examine the impact of cane toads (Bufo marinus) on Australian snakes.  Toads were introduced into Australia in 1935, have spread rapidly and represent a novel, extremely toxic prey item to na&#65533;ve Australian predators (including snakes).  Based on dietary preferences and geographic distributions I find that 49 species of Australian snake are potentially at risk from the invasion of the toad.  Furthermore, examination of physiological resistance to toad toxin in 10 of these &#65533;at risk&#65533; species strongly suggests that most species of Australian snake are poorly equipped to deal with a likely dose of toad toxin.  Even species that are highly resistant to toad toxin (such as the keelback, Tropidonophis mairii) face indirect fitness costs associated with consuming toads.  Within a population of snakes however, the impact of toads is unlikely to be random.  For example, the examination of several component allometries describing the interaction between snakes and toads revealed that, within a species, smaller snakes are more likely to ingest a fatal dose of toad toxin than are larger snakes.   Further consideration of the interaction between snakes and toads suggests that toads will not only be exerting differential impact on snakes based upon morphology, but also exert non-random selection on prey preference and resistance to toad toxin in snake populations.  To examine the possibility of a morphological response by snakes to toads, I examined changes in the body size and relative head size of four species of snake as a consequence of time since exposure to toads.  Two of the species (green treesnakes and red-bellied blacksnakes) are predicted to face strong impacts from toads. These two species showed an increase in mean body size and a decrease in relative head size as a consequence of time since exposure to toads; both changes in an adaptive direction.  In contrast, the other two species (keelbacks and swampsnakes) are predicted to face much lower impact from toads, and these two species showed little or no evidence of morphological change associated with time since exposure to toads.  These results indicate an adaptive change in morphology at a rate that is proportional to the predicted level of impact for each species, strongly suggesting an evolved response.  Red-bellied blacksnakes (a toad-vulnerable species) were further assessed for evolved responses in prey preference and toxin resistance.  Comparisons between toad-exposed and toad-na&#65533;ve populations of blacksnakes revealed that snakes from toad-exposed populations exhibited slightly higher resistance to toad toxin and a much-reduced tendency to eat toads, when compared with toad-na&#65533;ve snakes.  Na&#65533;ve snakes exhibited no tendency to learn avoidance of toxic prey, nor were they able to acquire resistance to toxin as a result of several sub-lethal doses, suggesting that the observed differences between populations is evolved rather than acquired.  Together, these results strongly suggest that blacksnakes are exhibiting an evolved shift in prey preference and toxin resistance as a consequence of exposure to toads.  Thus, it appears that snakes are exhibiting adaptation at multiple traits in response to exposure to toads.  Given the high likelihood that these adaptive shifts have an evolved basis, it appears that the impact of toads will decrease with time in many snake populations.  But what about toads?  Because the outcome of the interaction between a toad and a snake is also mediated by the body size and relative toxicity of toads, it is important to understand how these traits vary in space and time.  Exploratory analysis revealed that toads exhibit a decrease in body size and a decrease in relative toxicity as a consequence of time since colonisation, indicating that their impact on native predators decreases with time.  Additionally, there appears to be meaningful spatial variation in toad relative toxicity, indicating that some populations of native predators are facing higher impact from toads than others.  Overall, these results clearly indicate the importance of assessing the potential for rapid evolutionary response in impacted systems.  Doing so may provide evidence that some species are in less trouble than originally thought.  Additionally, and as more data accumulate, it may be possible to characterise certain categories of environmental impact by their potential for eliciting adaptive response from &#65533;impacted&#65533; species.  This approach has strong implications for the way conservation priorities are set and the way in which conservation dependent populations are managed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alien Species;Bufo marinus;Predator-Prey;Pseudechis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A reformulation of Coombs' Theory of Unidimensional Unfolding by representing attitudes as intervals</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Timothy Kevin</field><field name="description">An examination of the logical relationships between attitude statements suggests that attitudes can be ordered according to favourability, and can also stand in relationships of implication to one another. The traditional representation of attitudes, as points on a single dimension, is inadequate for representing both these relations but representing attitudes as intervals on a single dimension can incorporate both favourability and implication.  An interval can be parameterised using its two endpoints or alternatively by its midpoint and latitude. Using this latter representation, the midpoint can be understood as the &#65533;favourability&#65533; of the attitude, while the latitude can be understood as its &#65533;generality&#65533;. It is argued that the generality of an attitude statement is akin to its latitude of acceptance, since a greater semantic range increases the likelihood of agreement.  When Coombs&#65533; Theory of Unidimensional Unfolding is reformulated using the interval representation, the key question is how to measure the distance between two intervals on the dimension. There are innumerable ways to answer this question, but the present study restricts attention to eighteen possible &#65533;distance&#65533; measures. These measures are based on nine basic distances between intervals on a dimension, as well as two families of models, the Minkowski r-metric and the Generalised Hyperbolic Cosine Model (GHCM). Not all of these measures are distances in the strict sense as some of them fail to satisfy all the metric axioms.  To distinguish between these eighteen &#65533;distance&#65533; measures two empirical tests, the triangle inequality test, and the aligned stimuli test, were developed and tested using two sets of attitude statements. The subject matter of the sets of statements differed but the underlying structure was the same. It is argued that this structure can be known a priori using the logical relationships between the statement&#65533;s predicates, and empirical tests confirm the underlying structure and the unidimensionality of the statements used in this study. Consequently, predictions of preference could be ascertained from each model and either confirmed or falsified by subjects&#65533; judgements.  The results indicated that the triangle inequality failed in both stimulus sets. This suggests that the judgement space is not metric, contradicting a common assumption of attitude measurement. This result also falsified eleven of the eighteen &#65533;distance&#65533; measures because they predicted the satisfaction of the triangle inequality.  The aligned stimuli test used stimuli that were aligned at the endpoint nearest to the ideal interval. The results indicated that subjects preferred the narrower of the two stimuli, contrary to the predictions of six of the measures. Since these six measures all passed the triangle inequality test, only one measure, the GHCM (item), satisfied both tests. However, the GHCM (item) only passes the aligned stimuli tests with additional constraints on its operational function. If it incorporates a strictly log-convex function, such as cosh, the GHCM (item) makes predictions that are satisfied in both tests. This is also evidence that the latitude of acceptance is an item rather than a subject or combined parameter.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attitudes;Measurement;Unfolding;Coombs;Hyperbolic Cosine Model;Rasch;Triangle Inequality;Metric;Minkowski;Scaling;Unidimensional;Multidimensional</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modes and propagation in microstructured optical fibres</field><field name="creator">Issa, Nader</field><field name="description">Microstructured optical fibres (MOFs), also commonly called photonic crystal fibres or holey fibres, describe a type of optical fibre in which continuous channels of (typically) air run their entire length. These `holes' serve to both confine electromagnetic waves within the core of the fibre and to tailor its transmission properties.  In order to understand and quantify both of these functions, a new computational algorithm was developed and implemented. It solves for the eigenvalues of Maxwell's wave equations in the two-dimensional waveguide cross-section, with radiating boundary conditions imposed outside the microstructure. This yields the leaky modes supported by the fibre.  The boundary conditions are achieved exactly using a novel refinement scheme called the Adjustable Boundary Condition (ABC) method.  Two implementations are programmed and their computational efficiencies are compared. Both use an azimuthal Fourier decomposition, but radially, a finite difference scheme is shown to be more efficient than a basis function expansion. The properties of the ABC method are then predicted theoretically using an original approach.  It shows that the method is highly efficient, robust, automated and generally applicable to any implementation or to other radiating problems. A theoretical framework for the properties of modes in MOFs is also presented. It includes the use of the Bloch-Floquet theorem to provide a simpler and more efficient way to exploit microstructure symmetry.  A new, but brief study of the modal birefringence properties in straight and spun fibres is also included.  The theoretical and numerical tools are then applied to the study of polymer MOFs.  Three types of fibres are numerically studied, fabricated and characterised.  Each is of contemporary interest. Firstly, fabrication of the first MOFs with uniformly oriented elliptical holes is presented.  A high degree of hole ellipticity is achieved using a simple technique relying on hole deformation during fibre draw. Both form and stress-optic birefringence are characterized over a broad scaled-wavelength range, which shows excellent agreement with numerical modelling. Secondly, an analysis of leaky modes in real air core MOFs, fabricated specifically for photonic band gap guidance, is then used to identify alternative guiding mechanisms. The supported leaky modes exhibit properties closely matching a simple hollow waveguide, weakly influenced by the surrounding microstructure. The analysis gives a quantitative determination of the wavelength dependent confinement loss of these modes and illustrates a mechanism not photonic band gap in origin by which colouration can be observed in such fibres. Finally, highly multimode MOFs (also called `air-clad' fibres) that have much wider light acceptance angles than conventional fibres are studied. An original and accurate method is presented for determining the numerical aperture of such fibres using leaky modes. The dependence on length, wavelength and various microstructure dimensions are evaluated for the first time for a class of fibres. These results show excellent agreement with published measurements on similar fibres and verify that bridge thicknesses much smaller than the wavelength are required for exceptionally high numerical apertures. The influence of multiple layers of holes on the numerical aperture and capture efficiency are then presented. It shows that a substantial increase in both these parameters can be achieved for some bridge thicknesses.  Simple heuristic expressions for these quantities are given, which are based on the physical insight provided by the full numerical models. The work is then supported by the first fabrication attempts of large-core polymer MOFs with thin supporting bridges. These fibres exhibit relatively high numerical apertures and show good agreement with theoretical expectations over a very wide scaled-wavelength range.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fibre;Fiber;Microstructure;Microstructured optical fibres;Microstructured optical fibers;Photonic crystal;Photonic crystal fibres;Photonic crystal fibers;Holey fibres;Holey fibers;Modes;Leaky modes;Numerical aperture;Capture efficiency;Birefringence;Confinement loss;Photonic band gap;Fourier decomposition;Adjustable boundary condition;Elliptical holes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational Explorations of Creativity and Innovation in Design</field><field name="creator">Sosa Medina, Ricardo</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses creativity in design as a property of systems rather than an attribute of isolated individuals. It focuses on the dynamics between generative and evaluative or ascriptive processes. This is in distinction to conventional approaches to the study of creativity which tend to concentrate on the isolated characteristics of person, process and product. Whilst previous research has advanced insights on potentially creative behaviour and on the general dynamics of innovation in groups, little is known about their interaction. A systems view of creativity in design is adopted in our work to broaden the focus of inquiry to incorporate the link between individual and collective change.     The work presented in this thesis investigates the relation between creativity and innovation in computational models of design as a social construct. The aim is to define and implement in computer simulations the different actors and components of a system and the rules that may determine their behaviour and interaction. This allows the systematic study of their likely characteristics and effects when the system is run over simulated time. By manipulating the experimental variables of the system at initial time the experimenter is able to extract patterns from the observed results over time and build an understanding of the different types of determinants of creative design. The experiments and findings presented in this thesis relate to artificial societies composed by software agents and the social structures that emerge from their interaction. Inasmuch as these systems aim to capture some aspects of design activity, understanding them is likely to contribute to the understanding of the target system.     The first part of this thesis formulates a series of initial computational explorations on cellular automata of social influence and change agency. This simple modelling framework illustrates a number of factors that facilitate change. The potential for a designer to trigger cycles of collective change is demonstrated to depend on the combination of individual and external or situational characteristics.     A more comprehensive simulation framework is then introduced to explore the link between designers and their societies based on a systems model of creativity that includes social and epistemological components. In this framework a number of independent variables are set for experimentation including characteristics of individuals, fields, and domains. The effects of these individual and situational parameters are observed in experimental settings. Aspects of relevance in the definition of creativity included in these studies comprise the role of opinion leaders as gatekeepers of the domain, the effects of social organisation, the consequences of public and private access to domain knowledge by designers, and the relation between imitative behaviour and innovation.     A number of factors in a social system are identified that contribute to the emergence of phenomena that are normally associated to creativity and innovation in design. At the individual level the role of differences of abilities, persistence, opportunities, imitative behaviour, peer influence, and design strategies are discussed. At the field level determinants under inspection include group structure, social mobility and organisation, emergence of opinion leaders, established rules and norms, and distribution of adoption and quality assessments. Lastly, domain aspects that influence the interaction between designers and their social groups include the generation and access to knowledge, activities of gatekeeping, domain size and distribution, and artefact structure and representation. These insights are discussed in view of current findings and relevant modelling approaches in the literature. Whilst a number of assumptions and results are validated, others contribute to ongoing debates and suggest specific mechanisms and parameters for future experimentation.     The thesis concludes by characterising this approach to the study of creativity in design as an alternative &#65533;in silico&#65533; method of inquiry that enables simulation with phenomena not amenable to direct manipulation. Lines of development for future work are advanced which promise to contribute to the experimental study of the social dimensions of design.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creativity;creative design;innovation;diffusion;social simulation;cellular automata;design agents;situational factors;situatedness;social influence;creative design situations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration as feminisation: Chinese women&#65533;s experiences of work and family in contemporary Australia</field><field name="creator">Ho, Christina</field><field name="description">Throughout the Western world, governments have increasingly viewed migration through the lens of economic efficiency. In the era of globalisation, they argue, migrants should be selected on the basis of their skills and qualifications. Australian governments have been strongly committed to this policy direction, and over the last two decades, have reoriented the country&#65533;s migration program from the recruitment of unskilled labour to targeting educated professionals. The current Liberal-National Coalition government claims that this policy redirection has paid off, with migrants more skilled than ever, and successfully contributing to the economy. The government bases these claims on research conducted by scholars of migrant employment, who equate high levels of human capital with successful employment outcomes. Using the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA), these researchers show that migrants with qualifications and English language ability have higher rates of labour force participation, lower unemployment, and higher occupational attainment and incomes, compared to their less skilled counterparts. This thesis critically analyses this &#65533;success story&#65533; narrative. It argues that the focus on human capital has overshadowed exploration of other important factors shaping migrants&#65533; employment experiences, including the gender and birthplace of new arrivals. This thesis shows that male and female migrants, and migrants from English versus non-English speaking backgrounds, can have very different experiences of working in Australia, regardless of their skills or occupational histories. I highlight the importance of these factors by investigating the experiences of Chinese women in Australia today. Using in-depth interviews with women from China and Hong Kong, and quantitative data from the Australian census and LSIA, I show that Chinese women&#65533;s employment experiences in Australia do not conform neatly to the prevailing &#65533;success story&#65533; promoted by the Government and migration researchers.  Migration to Australia causes a widespread reduction in Chinese women&#65533;s paid work. While it is normal for men to seek work immediately after arrival, women find that migration intensifies their domestic workloads, while depriving them of sources of domestic support, such as relatives and hired help. Consequently, for Chinese women, migration often means moving from full-time to part-time jobs, or withdrawing from the workforce entirely. In the process, they experience a &#65533;feminisation&#65533; of roles, as they shift from being &#65533;career women&#65533; to fulfilling the traditional &#65533;female&#65533; roles of wife and mother. Thus migration and settlement are highly gendered, and the household context is crucial for understanding migrants&#65533; employment experiences. Among those women who are in the labour force, employment outcomes vary substantially by birthplace, pointing to the cultural specificity of human capital. Although both mainland Chinese and Hong Kong migrant women tend to be highly educated, mainland women achieve far poorer outcomes than Hong Kong women. Hong Kong women, with their relatively good English language skills and officially-recognised qualifications, are generally able to secure comparable jobs to those they had in Hong Kong, although they often have problems advancing further in Australia. Meanwhile, mainland women tend to have poorer English skills and greater difficulty in having their qualifications recognised, and thus suffer often dramatic downward mobility, moving from highly skilled professions to unskilled, low-paid and low status jobs in Australia. Thus this thesis demonstrates that the value of human capital is context-dependent. It can only be valorised in a new labour market if it is sufficiently culturally compatible with local standards. Therefore, the experiences of Chinese migrant women complicate the &#65533;success story&#65533; that dominates discussions of migrant employment in Australia. Ultimately, the prevailing economistic approach fails to see the diversity and complexity of migrant experiences. We need to see migrants as social beings, whose settlement in a new country is crucially shaped by their gender and birthplace, and broader institutional factors, which determine how human capital is used and rewarded. This is the mission of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">migration;migrant women;work;family;identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality of life after a critical illness: a review of the literature 1998-2003</field><field name="creator">Adamson, Harriet Caroline</field><field name="description">Until recently, long-term effects of a critical illness (CI) have received little attention from intensive care staff, who have traditionally measured outcome from an intensive care unit (ICU) by morbidity and mortality. However, it is now acknowledged that CI is a continuum that begins before ICU and continues to impact on a patient&#65533;s quality of life after they have been discharged home. Measuring health related quality of life (HRQOL) is a complex matter due to its multifaceted, subjective and dynamic nature. There has been a lack of consensus in the literature regarding the most appropriate methodological approaches and measuring instruments to use. This disparity has impeded comparison between studies.   The aim of this thesis was to review the literature between January 1998 and December 2003 that focused on HRQOL for patients after a CI to identify and summarise themes and key outcomes. There were two main areas of focus - the methods used to measure the effects of the CI, and evaluation of the patient outcomes.  An electronic search for relevant articles was conducted using the common clinical research databases and key words such as health related quality of life, outcomes and critical illness. Reference lists from these articles and conference proceedings were reviewed to identify further studies. There were 74 primary papers identified that reflected a number of subcategories including general ICU, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and elderly patients.   There were four categories of instruments used in the literature including those that measured acuity of illness, physical functioning, psychological functioning and HRQOL. The majority of studies used more than one measuring instrument, most of which had been previously validated. Results from the studies were diverse, but it is apparent that physical and psychological recovery from a CI may be a slow and varied process. Most studies were observational; only one randomised control study examined the benefits of a physical exercise program for patients post-hospital discharge. In general, there was no evidence of how to translate the study findings into some form of structured program to assist the patient with any identified problems. To enhance continuum of care, integration of ICU, hospital and rehabilitation services could target identified physical and psychological problems to assist patient recovery.

All isolates of this pathogen were of the Group 2 type. Thus Group 2 contrasts with Group I which is normally isolated :Erora crown rot of wheat and grasses. Other fungi isolated in order of frequency were Diplodia maydis, F. rnoniliforme &#65533;Subglutinans&#65533;, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Nigrospora oryzac, F. roseum &#65533;Semitectum&#65533;, F. moniliforme, F. roseum &#65533;Equiseti&#65533;, F. roseum &#65533;Concolor&#65533;, Macrophomina phaseolina, Rhizoctonia sp., F. roseum &#65533;Acuminatum&#65533;, F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. tricinctum and F. roseum &#65533;Heterosporum&#65533;. The relative isolation frequencies of the fungi varied according to the seasonal conditions. Stalk rots were not of major importance in 1973, a relatively dry growing season. However, in 1974, a wet growing season, stalk rot diseases were common in all areas investigated. 2. Isolates of F. roseum &#65533;Graminearum&#65533;,derived mainly from wheat and maize but also from other sources and from various regions of eastern Australia, were examined for perithecia formation, colony characteristics, fertility, colony growth, conidia production and conidia size. The distribution of the fungus in field colonized maize and wheat plants was also studied. The Group 1 isolates did not produce perithecia, were heterothallic and very infertile, had a mean colony growth of 4.4 cm per 3 days (range, 3.9- 5.1) and produced relatively large numbers of conidia. In contrast, Group 2 isolates were homothallic and produced perithecia readily, had a mean colony growth of 5.4 cm per 3 days (range, 4.7&#65533;6.1) and produced relatively low numbers of conidia. Group 1 isolates were found to be commonly associated with crowns and roots of plants and Group 2 isolates were commonly associated with aerial plant parts. 3. The ability of a number of Group 1 and Group 2 isolates to produce the fungal hormone, zearalenone was assessed. Group I isolates produced three to four times more zearalenone than Group 2 isolates. In addition, a. culture which had previously produced perithecia but had lost that ability following numerous transfers, produced no detectable zearalenone. The results provided good evidence that the observed difference in perithecia formation was directly related to the ability to produce zearalenone. 4. The pathogenicity to wheat, maize and carnations of Group 1 isolates from crown rot affected wheat plants and Group 2 isolates from stalk rot affected maize plants was tested. Pathogenicity of 11 other isolates from teosinte, carnations, pearl millet, wheat and barley scab, banana, ginger and common wheat grass was also assessed. The results indicated that pathogenic specialization exists within F. roseum &#65533;Graminearum&#65533;. Wheat isolates were the most pathogenic to wheat, carnation isolates were the most pathogenic to carnations and all maize isolates were pathogenic to maize while those from wheat and common wheat grass were not as pathogenic to maize. Moreover, Group 2 isolates were more pathogenic when inoculated in aerial plant parts, and the Group I isolates were more pathogenic when inoculated in plant parts in soil. Inoculations on wheat seedlings in sterile field soil demonstrated that the inherent pathogenicity to wheat seedlings of isolates from wheat and maize were similar. 5. Some factors which could contribute to the observed pathogenic differences between isolates from wheat and maize to wheat seedlings in field soil were examined. Conidia volume, germination rate and inherent germinability in the soil were studied. The Group I isolates had the largest volume, the most rapid germination and the highest inherent germinability. Pathogenicity was positively correlated with conidium volume and inherent germinability. In addition, the inherent germinability and conidium volume were positively correlated. Thus, it was established that pathogenic behaviour of conidia of Group 1 and Group 2 reflected differences in conidia morphology.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fusarium roseum graminearum;fungus;stalk rot;maize</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deleuze and Kant's Critical Philosophy</field><field name="creator">McMahon, Melissa Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the status of Deleuze as a Kantian, and as such committed both to the critical destiny of philosophy, and the contestation of the sense of this destiny.   The focus of Deleuze&#65533;s reading of Kant is an active conception of thought: the fundamental elements of thought are will and value rather than being or the concept.   In the development of this idea we can note a progressive 'tapering' of the foundational instance of thought, in three stages: from the speculative field of being to the practical field of reason; from the intellectual category of the concept to the problematic category of the Idea; from the teleological notion of the organism to the aesthetic notion of the singular.   Within each stage we can perceive a polemic between the two terms: it is in each case a question of the 'sufficient reason' of thought, its conditions of the actuality beyond its possibility.   The highest expression of our reason, for Kant, is neither theoretical nor utilitarian, but moral: the realisation of our lawful freedom. For Deleuze, on the other hand, the ultimate secret of our freedom and thus all of our thought is to be found rather in the realm of the aesthetic.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">KANT;DELEUZE;CRITIQUE;AESTHETICS;PROBLEM;JUDGEMENT</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Parallel Solution Adaptive Implementation of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Method</field><field name="creator">Wishart, Stuart Jackson</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method of analysing  gas flows. The DSMC method was initially proposed as a method for predicting  rarefied flows where the Navier-Stokes equations are inaccurate. It has now been  extended to near continuum flows. The method models gas flows using simulation  molecules which represent a large number of real molecules in a probabilistic  simulation to solve the Boltzmann equation. Molecules are moved through a simulation  of physical space in a realistic manner that is directly coupled to physical time such that  unsteady flow characteristics are modelled. Intermolecular collisions and moleculesurface  collisions are calculated using probabilistic, phenomenological models. The  fundamental assumption of the DSMC method is that the molecular movement and  collision phases can be decoupled over time periods that are smaller than the mean  collision time.    Two obstacles to the wide spread use of the DSMC method as an engineering tool are in  the areas of simulation configuration, which is the configuration of the simulation  parameters to provide a valid solution, and the time required to obtain a solution. For  complex problems, the simulation will need to be run multiple times, with the  simulation configuration being modified between runs to provide an accurate solution  for the previous run&#65533;s results, until the solution converges. This task is time consuming  and requires the user to have a good understanding of the DSMC method. Furthermore,  the computational resources required by a DSMC simulation increase rapidly as the  simulation approaches the continuum regime. Similarly, the computational  requirements of three-dimensional problems are generally two orders of magnitude  more than two-dimensional problems. These large computational requirements  significantly limit the range of problems that can be practically solved on an  engineering workstation or desktop computer.    The first major contribution of this thesis is in the development of a DSMC  implementation that automatically adapts the simulation. Rather than modifying the  simulation configuration between solution runs, this thesis presents the formulation of  algorithms that allow the simulation configuration to be automatically adapted during a  single run. These adaption algorithms adjust the three main parameters that effect the  accuracy of a DSMC simulation, namely the solution grid, the time step and the  simulation molecule number density. The second major contribution extends the  parallelisation of the DSMC method. The implementation developed in this thesis  combines the capability to use a cluster of computers to increase the maximum size of  problem that can be solved while simultaneously allowing excess computational  resources to decrease the total solution time. Results are presented to verify the  accuracy of the underlying DSMC implementation, the utility of the solution adaption  algorithms and the efficiency of the parallelisation implementation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Direct Simulation Monte Carlo;DSMC;parallel;solution adaptive;rarefied gas dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transmembrane Electron Transport Systems in Erythrocyte Plasma Membranes</field><field name="creator">Kennett, Eleanor</field><field name="description">Electron transport systems exist in the plasma membranes of all cells. Although not well characterised they play roles in cell growth and proliferation, hormone responses and other cell signalling events, but perhaps their most important role, especially in erythrocytes, is enabling the cell to respond to changes in both intra- and extracellular redox environments. Human erythrocytes possess a transmembrane electron transport capability that mediates the transfer of reducing equivalents from reduced intracellular species to oxidised extracellular species and is concomitant with proton extrusion.  In the work for this thesis I showed that erythrocyte membranes contain a transmembrane WST-1 (water soluble tetrazolium-1) reductase activity that uses reducing equivalents from intracellular NADH to reduce extracellular WST-1. The rate of WST-1 reduction was increased by the presence of phenazine methosulfate and, although of low activity, it showed similar properties to a previously reported transmembrane NADH-oxidase activity. 1H NMR experiments showed that WST-1 was reversibly bound to the membrane and/or proteins in the membrane within the timeframe of the NMR experiment, confirming the location of the WST-1 reduction.  Preliminary attempts to purify NADH:WST-1 reductase and NADH:ferricyanide reductase activities from the erythrocyte plasma membrane were inconclusive. The protein(s) responsible for the reduction of these oxidants appear to be of low abundance in the plasma membrane and may be part of a larger protein complex. Further work on the isolation of these redox activities is required before the protein(s) involved can be identified with any confidence.  The ability of cells to export electrons suggests that an electron import mechanism might also exist to re-establish the cell&#65533;s redox-buffering equilibrium under conditions of oxidative stress. This hypothesis was tested in glucose-deprived erythrocytes using reduced glutathione and NADH as extracellular electron donors. It was shown that neither reduced glutathione nor NADH donated reducing equivalents through a transmembrane redox system. Extracellular NADH was, however, able to produce profound changes in starvation metabolism and methaemoglobin reduction rates. The addition of extracellular NADH caused a six-fold increase in the rate of lactate production above that observed in glucose-starved controls, together with a concomitant decrease in pyruvate production. In erythrocytes containing high levels of methaemoglobin, extracellular NADH increased the rate of methaemoglobin reduction in both the presence and absence of glucose. These results were explained by the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase from erythrocytes due to an admittedly low level of haemolysis. This caused the displacement of the intracellular pseudo-equilibrium of the lactate dehydrogenase reaction via transmembrane exchange of lactate, allowing the conversion of extracellular pyruvate to lactate and resulted in an increase in intracellular NADH concentrations. The latter increased the rate of methaemoglobin reduction.  In conclusion, the work described in this thesis showed that erythrocyte membranes do not contain mechanisms for importing electrons or reducing equivalents from extracellular reduced glutathione or NADH. Erythrocytes do, however, contain an electron export system which can reduce extracellular oxidants such as WST-1 and the activity of this system depends on an intricate balance between intracellular antioxidants and enzyme activities. There is much still to be learnt about plasma membrane redox systems, little is known, for example, about the protein composition, mechanism of action, and the in vivo conditions under which these systems are most active.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NMR;Erythrocytes;NADH;Glutathione;PMOR;Methaemoglobin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amalgamating tribunals: a recipe for optimal reform</field><field name="creator">Bacon, Rachel</field><field name="description">The last decade has seen numerous proposals to reform existing tribunal systems in jurisdictions throughout the common law world.  Across the board, there have been proposals to adopt generalist tribunal models in preference to smaller, specialist tribunal systems, and to achieve these changes through the process of amalgamation.   The most significant recent developments to occur in Australia have taken place in Victoria and NSW during the past five years.  Legislators in these States have chosen to amalgamate a number of smaller, specialist tribunals into larger, generalist bodies.  In 1997 the NSW Parliament passed legislation amalgamating a number of specialist tribunals to create the Administrative Decisions Tribunal (ADT); comparable legislation was passed in Victoria in 1998 to create the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT).     There were concurrent attempts to implement similar reforms at federal level.  In 1998 the Commonwealth government announced its intention to amalgamate four Commonwealth merits review tribunals to form one &#65533;super Tribunal&#65533; &#65533; the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART).  The Bills containing these proposals were ultimately defeated in the Senate, however the Australian Government remains convinced of the benefits of amalgamation at federal level.  Similar reforms have been proposed in Western Australia, Tasmania and the United Kingdom. This thesis argues that these reforms are taking place in the absence of data about their likely implications, and without a thorough understanding of the objectives that generalist versus specialist tribunal systems can realistically achieve.  This ill-considered or &#65533;over-hasty&#65533; trend towards amalgamation raises a number of questions which have not previously been addressed in academic or policy-making circles.  An obvious question is whether or not an amalgamated tribunal model is more effective than a series of smaller, specialised tribunals in delivering administrative justice, in other words, whether there is any net gain to be had from a government&#65533;s decision to amalgamate.   The less explored, but equally important, question addressed in this thesis is how the process of amalgamation should be approached in order to realise the maximum potential benefits that an amalgamated tribunal can bring.  That is, to ask what are the ingredients of an optimal amalgamation.  This is not a question about whether government decisions to pursue amalgamation are intrinsically worthwhile or beneficial for stakeholders.  Rather, it is about how government decisions to amalgamate should best be implemented.   This thesis proposes a way of differentiating between good and bad amalgamations, that is grounded in theory and informed by experience to date.  The proposed approach is to assess the effectiveness of amalgamation processes using relevant measures drawn from an analysis of organisational theory literature: &#65533; Legislation &#65533; the legislation establishing an amalgamated tribunal needs to ensure the tribunal will have appropriate independence, powers, processes, membership and structure. &#65533; Political commitment &#65533; those responsible for proposing and planning an amalgamation need to provide appropriate funding and support for the process and for the establishment of an autonomous, self-directed tribunal. &#65533; Organisational structure &#65533; the structures put in place need to be appropriate, integrated and flexible, and should promote cohesion and interaction. &#65533; Process and procedure &#65533; the processes and procedures adopted in an amalgamated tribunal need to capitalise upon the opportunities provided by amalgamation, as well as being appropriate, efficient and able to balance the needs of a range of stakeholders. &#65533; Organisational culture &#65533; an organisational culture which counters natural tendencies towards disjunction will assist members and staff to identify with a newly amalgamated tribunal and to implement initiatives that will improve its performance. &#65533; Leadership &#65533; effective leadership plays an important role in ensuring a smooth transition from specialist to amalgamated tribunal, and engendering commitment from members and staff. Broadly speaking, these factors fall into the four categories of law, context, organisation and people.  It is argued that attention must be paid to all four of these ingredients in order to achieve optimal tribunal reform.  The thesis tests this proposition by examining the three most advanced tribunal amalgamations so far, namely, the Commonwealth ART, the NSW ADT and VCAT in Victoria.   It is argued that the fate of the Commonwealth ART proposal proves the importance of a solid, generally endorsed legislative foundation in creating a viable amalgamated tribunal.   The importance of context, organisation and people is borne out by qualitative research into the amalgamation experiences in NSW and Victoria.  The fact that the NSW and Victorian governments decided to pursue policies of amalgamation at the same time provided a unique opportunity to compare the success or otherwise of two concurrent attempts at amalgamation in different jurisdictions.   This thesis finds that the unfavourable political context in NSW prevented the ADT from realising its potential.  In contrast, the VCAT experience highlights the benefits of paying careful attention to the wide range of factors that can contribute to a successful amalgamation.  Of most relevance are the initial scale of an amalgamation, the political &#65533;will&#65533; behind its implementation, the appointment of a core of full-time members, and the creation of an open institutional culture which facilitates the sharing of information.   In short, the thesis concludes that the successful construction and consolidation of a tribunal post-amalgamation requires that the necessary ingredients of optimal tribunal reform &#65533; legislation, context, organisation and people &#65533; are thoughtfully addressed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">administrative law;administrative tribunals;organisational change;tribunal reform;tribunal amalgamation;super tribunals</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alkane Oxidation Catalysis by Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalyst</field><field name="creator">Guo, Chris</field><field name="description">Abstract  Cobalt-based complexes are widely used in industry and organic synthesis as  catalysts for the oxidation of hydrocarbons. The Co/Mn/Br (known as "CAB system")  catalyst system is effective for the oxidation of toluene. The Co/Mn/Br/Zr catalyst system  is powerful for the oxidation of p-xylene, but not for the oxidation of toluene.  [Co3O(OAc)5(OH)(py)3][PF6] (Co 3+ trimer 5) is more effective than  [Co3O(OAc)6(py)3][PF6] (Co 3+ trimer 6) as a catalyst in the CAB catalyst system. Higher  temperatures favour the oxidation of toluene. Zr 4+ does not enhance the oxidation of  toluene. Zr 4+ could inhibit the oxidation of toluene in the combination of Co/Br/Zr,  Co/Mn/Zr or Co/Zr. NHPI enhances the formation of benzyl alcohol, but the formation of  other by-products is a problem for industrial processes. Complex(es) between cobalt,  manganese and zirconium might be formed during the catalytic reaction. However,  attempts at the preparation of complexes consisting of Co/Zr or Mn/Zr or Co3ZrP or  Co8Zr4 clusters failed.  The oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol is of great  industrial significance. For the homogeneous catalysis at 50 o C and 3 bar N2 pressure, the  activity order is: Mn(OAc)3 &#65533;2H2O &gt; Mn12O12 cluster &gt; Co 3+ trimer 6 &gt;  [Co3O(OAc)3(OH)2(py)5][PF6]2 (Co 3+ trimer 3) &gt; Co 3+ trimer 5 &gt; Co(OAc)2 &#65533;4H2O &gt;  [Co2(OAc)3(OH)2(py)4][PF6]-asym (Co dimerasym) &gt; [Co2(OAc)3(OH)2(py)4][PF6]-sym (Co  dimersym); whereas [Mn2CoO(OAc)6(py)3]&#65533;HOAc (Mn2Co complex) and zirconium(IV)  acetate hydroxide showed almost no activity under these conditions. But at 120 o C and 3  bar N2 pressure, the activity order is changed to: Co dimerasym &gt; Co(OAc)2 &#65533;4H2O &gt; Co  trimer 3 and Mn(OAc)3 &#65533;2H2O &gt; Co 3+ trimer 6 &gt; Mn2Co complex &gt; Co 3+ trimer 5 &gt; Co  dimersym &gt; Mn12O12 cluster. The molar ratio of the products was close to  cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone=2/1. Mn(II) acetate and zirconium(IV) acetate hydroxide  showed almost no activity under these conditions. Among those cobalt dimers and  trimers, only the cobalt dimerasym survived after the stability tests, this means that  [Co2(OAc)3(OH)2(py)4][PF6]-asym might be the active form for cobalt(II) acetate in the  CAB system.  Metal-substituted (silico)aluminophosphate-5 molecular sieves (MeAPO-5 and  MeSAPO-5) are important heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of cyclohexane. The  preparation of MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5 and their catalytic activities were studied. Pure  MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5 are obtained and characterised. Four new pairs of bimetal-substituted  MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5(CoZr, MnZr, CrZr and MnCo) were prepared  successfully. Two novel trimetal-subtituted MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5 (MnCoZr) are  reported here. Improved methods for the preparation of four monometal-substituted  MeAPO-5 (Cr, Co, Mn and Zr) and for CoCe(S)APO-5 and CrCe(S)APO-5 are reported.  Novel combinational mixing conditions for the formation of gel mixtures for Me(S)APO-5  syntheses have been developed.  For the oxidation of cyclohexane by TBHP catalysed by MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5  materials, CrZrSAPO-5 is the only active MeSAPO-5 catalyst among those materials  tested under conditions of refluxing in cyclohexane. Of the MeAPO-5 materials tested,  whereas CrCeSAPO-5 has very little activity, CrZrAPO-5 and CrCeAPO-5 are very  active catalysts under conditions of refluxing in cyclohexane. MnCoAPO-5, MnZrAPO-5  and CrAPO-5 are also active. When Cr is in the catalyst system, the product distribution  is always cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol equals 2-3)/1, compared with 1/2 for other catalysts.  For MeAPO-5, the activity at 150 o C and 10 bar N2 pressure is: CrZrAPO-5 &gt; CrCeAPO-5  &gt; CoZrAPO-5. For MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5, at 150 o C and 13 bar N2 pressure, the  selectivity towards cyclohexanone is: CrZrAPO-5 &gt; CrZrSAPO-5 &gt; CrCeAPO-5 &gt;  CrAPO-5 &gt; MnCoAPO-5 &gt; MnZrAPO-5; and the selectivity towards cyclohexanol is:  MnZrAPO-5 &gt; CrZrAPO-5 &gt; MnCoAPO-5 &gt; CrZrSAPO-5 &gt; CrCeAPO-5 &gt; CrAPO-5.  Overall the selectivity towards the oxidation of cyclohexane is: CrZrAPO-5 &gt;  CrZrSAPO-5 &gt; CrCeAPO-5 &gt; CrAPO-5 &gt; MnCoAPO-5 &gt; MnZrAPO-5. The amount of  water in the system can affect the performance of CrCeAPO-5, but has almost no effect  on CrZrAPO-5. Metal leaching is another concern in potential industrial applications of  MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5 catalysts. The heterogeneous catalysts prepared in the present  work showed very little metal leaching. This feature, coupled with the good selectivities  and effectivities, makes them potentially very useful.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alkane Oxidation;Catalysis;Homogeneous;Heterogeneous;Catalyst</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unenlightened efficiency: the administration of the juvenile correction system in New South Wales 1905-1988</field><field name="creator">Quinn, Peter Erwin</field><field name="description">This work traces the history of the juvenile correction system in twentieth century New South Wales, focusing on the evolution of major reforms aimed at curbing delinquency.   The study begins in 1905 with the Neglected Children and Juvenile Offenders Act.      It concludes in 1988, when another set of significant reforms, designed to deal with perceived inadequacies of the established system, commenced.    The main focus of the thesis is the government system of corrections.   Although there was an active non - government correction system, this sector was increasingly absorbed by the larger public sphere.  The principal argument is that, although there were sporadic periods during which changes to the system were made, its progress through most of the twentieth century was characterised by an underlying attitude which regarded the boys and girls it dealt with, particularly those committed to institutions, as belonging to an inferior, delinquent class.   As such, they were treated as the progeny of a criminal class destined for the most part to remain part of that class.    This idea of a delinquent class coloured all aspects of the way juveniles were treated, specifically lack of resources, the dominance of economic considerations over the welfare of children, excessive regimentation, harsh discipline and illegal punishments.    When management problems arose they were met with increased coercion.    Although lip-service was paid to the ideal of child saving, reality did not match the rhetoric.   Programs which ostensibly were meant to individualise treatment so that it was tailored to suit each child, were carried out perfunctorily. Periodic and well-meaning efforts at reform were stifled by bureaucratic inertia, political considerations, and the entrenched belief that incarceration was preferable to treatment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">juvenile correction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ELECTROCOAGULATION: UNRAVELLING AND SYNTHESISING THE MECHANISMS BEHIND A WATER TREATMENT PROCESS</field><field name="creator">Holt, Peter Kevin</field><field name="description">Electrocoagulation is an empirical (and largely heuristic) water treatment technology that has had many different applications over the last century. It has proven its viability by removing a wide range of pollutants. The approach to reactor design has been haphazard, however, with little or no reference to previous designs or underlying principles. This thesis reviewed these reactor designs, identifying key commonalities and synthesising a new design hierarchy, summarised by three main decisions:  1. Batch or continuous operation;  2. Coagulation only or coagulation plus flotation reactors, and;  3. Associated separation process if required.  This design decision hierarchy thereby provides a consistent basis for future electrocoagulation reactor designs.    Electrochemistry, coagulation, and flotation are identified as the key foundation sciences for electrocoagulation, and the relevant mechanisms (and their interactions) are extracted and applied in an electrocoagulation context.     This innovative approach was applied to a 7 L batch electrocoagulation reactor treating clay-polluted water. Structured macroscopic experiments identified current (density), time, and mixing as the key operating parameters for electrocoagulation. A dynamic mass balance was conducted over the batch reactor, for the first time, thereby enabling the extraction of a concentration profile. For this batch system, three operating stages were then identifiable: lag, reactive, and stable stages. Each stage was systematically investigated (in contrast to the previous ad hoc approach) with reference to each of the foundation sciences and the key parameters of current and time.     Electrochemical behaviour characterised both coagulant and bubble generation. Polarisation experiments were used to determine the rate-limiting step at each electrode&#65533;s surface. Consequently the appropriate Tafel parameters were extracted and hence the cell potential. At low currents both electrodes (anode and cathode) operated in the charge-transfer region. As the current increased, the mechanism shifted towards the diffusion-limited region, which increased the required potential. Polarisation experiments also define the operating potential at each electrode thereby enabling aluminium&#65533;s dissolution behaviour to be thermodynamically characterised on potential-pH (Pourbaix) diagrams. Active and passive regions were defined and hence the aluminium&#65533;s behaviour in an aqueous environment can now be predicted for electrocoagulation.     Novel and detailed solution chemistry modelling of the metastable and stable aluminium species revealed the importance of oligomer formation and their rates in electrocoagulation. In particular, formation of the positively trimeric aluminium species increased solution pH (to pH 10.6), beyond the experimentally observed operable pH of 9. Thereby signifying the importance of the formation kinetics to the trimer as the active coagulant specie in electrocoagulation.    Further leading insights to the changing coagulation mechanism in electrocoagulation were possible by comparison and contrast with the conventional coagulation method of alum dosing. Initially in the lag stage, little aggregation is observed until the coagulant concentration reaches a critical level. Simultaneously, the measured zeta potential increases with coagulant addition and the isoelectric point is attained in the reactive stage. Here a sorption coagulation mechanism is postulated; probably charge neutralisation, that quickly aggregates pollutant particles forming open structured aggregates as indicated by the low fractal dimension.       As time progresses, pollutant concentration decreases and aluminium addition continues hence aluminium hydroxide/oxide precipitates. The bubbles gently sweep the precipitate through the solution, resulting in coagulation by an enmeshment mechanism (sweep coagulation). Consequently compact aggregates are formed, indicating by the high fractal dimension.     Flotation is an inherent aspect of the batch electrocoagulation reactor via the production of electrolytic gases. In the reactor, pollutant separation occurs in situ, either by flotation or settling. From the concentration profiles extracted, original kinetic expressions were formulated to quantify these competing removal processes. As current increases, both settling and flotation rate constants increased due to the additional coagulant generation. This faster removal was offset by a decrease in the coagulant efficiency. Consequently a trade-off exists between removal time and coagulant efficiency that can be evaluated economically.     A conceptual framework of electrocoagulation is developed from the synthesis of the systematic study to enable a priori prediction. This framework creates predictability for electrocoagulation, which is innovative and original for the technology. Predictability provides insights to knowledge transfer (between batch and continuous), efficient coagulant and separation path, to name just a few examples. This predictability demystifies electrocoagulation by providing a powerful design tool for the future development of scaleable, industrial electrocoagulation water treatment design and operation process.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water;electrocoagulation. mechanisms;water treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic effect of Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae challenged pigs</field><field name="creator">Khan, Shamila</field><field name="description">Immunological stressors, in the form of clinical and sub-clinical disease are currently controlled using both prophylactic antibiotics in-feed, and therapeutic antibiotic treatment. Respiratory disease, primarily Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) infection, is recognised as a major factor causing reduced productivity in pigs. This thesis reports investigations into the use of novel immunomodulators in particular Interleukin 4 (IL-4) and Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) as alternatives to antibiotics to treat App infection. Immunological and molecular biological assays were used to investigate and accumulate data. An in vitro study undertaken to find potential anti-inflammatory substances, revealed that Interleukin 8 (IL-8) mRNA production stimulated by PMA or LPS in whole pigs' blood was suppressed by IL-4. IL-1ra also suppressed stimulated IL-8 mRNA production by heat killed App bacteria (KB) in vitro. An acute LPS challenge in pigs in vivo however, showed no variation in illness or weight loss between pigs treated prophylactically with anti-inflammatory substance (IL-4 and IL-1ra) and saline treated pigs. The use of plasmids as a delivery system for anti-inflammatory substance did not show promise since it did not enhance growth or prolong the expression of the substances in the pigs. However, in the chronic App challenge model IL-4 and IL-1ra administered prophylactically in vivo showed an ability to improve growth. The therapeutic administration of IL-4 and IL-1ra to App challenged pigs showed no difference in pigs' growth, regardless of the treatment or control administered. To conclude, IL-4 and IL-1ra showed promise when administered prophylactically and improved growth and abrogated disease under conditions of App challenge. However when IL-4 and IL-1ra where administered therapeutically they did not perform as well. Moreover these compounds have potential as a commercial application to reduce the growth reduction caused by disease such as App.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pig;Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae;Interleukin-4;Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist;IL-1ra;IL-4;porcine</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The SWHEL model for studying B cell responses in tolerance and immunity</field><field name="creator">Phan, Tri Giang</field><field name="description">Classical immunoglobulin transgenic (Ig-Tg) mouse models such as the MD4 anti-hen egg lysozyme (-HEL) Ig-Tg line have been used extensively to study B cell responses in tolerance and immunity. This thesis describes a new generation of gene-targeted mice (designated SWHEL mice) whereby the VH10 Ig variable gene encoding the HyHEL-10 specificity of the original anti-HEL Ig-Tg mouse was targeted to the Ig heavy chain locus. B cells in the SWHEL mouse are therefore capable of undergoing class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), representing a major advance on the original MD4 mouse model. SWHEL mice were found to not only contain a large population of HEL-specific (HEL+) B cells but also a significant population of non-HEL-binding (HEL-) B cells generated by VH gene replacement. HEL+ SWHEL B cells were found to belong to the B2 lineage and displayed high levels of surface IgM. Nevertheless, they matured normally and colonised the primary B cell follicle and marginal zone (MZ) of the spleen. The SWHEL model thus provided an opportunity to re-examine some of the original observations made in the MD4 system and also to extend these observations, particularly with regard to the regulation of CSR by self-reactive B cells. As expected, analysis of SWHEL B cells exposed to high avidity membrane-bound HEL revealed that they underwent clonal deletion in the bone marrow (BM). More interestingly, analysis of HEL+ B cells exposed to low avidity soluble HEL revealed that they were able to emigrate from the BM to the spleen as anergic B cells. However, unlike anergic MD4 B cells, anergic SWHEL B cells were reduced in frequency, displayed an immature B cell phenotype, were excluded from the follicle and had a reduced lifespan. Direct measurement of B cell antigen receptor (BCR) occupancy by HEL and the frequency of HEL- competitor B cells was combined with mixed BM irradiation chimeras to demonstrate unequivocally that the difference in phenotype and fate of HEL+ B cells in the two systems was due solely to competition from HEL- B cells. In addition, the SWHEL model of B cell self-tolerance was used to show that while self-reactive B cells were hypo-responsive to BCR stimulation, BCR-independent signals delivered via anti-CD40 plus IL-4 or lipopolysaccharide could trigger them to undergo CSR and secretion of potentially pathogenic isotype-switched autoantibodies. Finally, the SWHEL model was used to study the responses of adoptively transferred follicular (Fo) and MZ B cells to in vivo activation with HEL conjugated to sheep red blood cells (HEL-SRBC). These studies revealed that both HEL+ MZ and Fo B cells were capable of mounting a robust T cell-dependent IgG1 antibody response to HEL-SRBC. However, HEL+ MZ B cells did not efficiently localise to the T cell-B cell border following antigen engagement and preferentially migrated to the bridging channels and red pulp. In contrast, HEL+ Fo B cells rapidly localised to the T cell-B cell border and subsequently colonised numerous germinal centres. As a result, the rate and pattern of SHM by HEL+ Fo and MZ B cells was shown to be distinct, with preferential targeting of mutations to the second complementarity-determining region in the former and to the second framework region in the latter. Together these data indicate illustrate the value of the SWHEL model and its potential to greatly advance the current understanding of B cell responses in tolerance and immunity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">B cells;self-tolerance;T-dependent;antibodies;marginal zone</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Popular Mythology and Popular Culture in Post-war America, as represented by four novels - The Floating Opera and The End of the Road, by John Barth, White Noise, by Don DeLillo, and Vineland, by Thomas Pynchon.</field><field name="creator">Reed, Mark Dobson</field><field name="description">The four novels - The Floating Opera, The End of the Road, White Noise, and  Vineland - are representative of the cultural shift away from traditional moral  concepts after World War II. Popular culture has increasingly become the guiding  force for the continuation of American society, and in Don DeLillo&#65533;s White Noise,  popular culture and its creation of myth (according to the author&#65533;s representation of  America) has become embedded in the system and life of contemporary America.  John Barth&#65533;s novel The End of the Road and its predecessor The Floating  Opera are important in any discussion of the role of popular culture and popular  mythology in post-war America. They both appear to signal an end to sincere  intellectual thought or debate, and the notion of imposing a rational moral world upon  the social landscape surrounding the individual. The Floating Opera explores the  common tendency of society to avoid difficult intellectual struggles, and the central  character and first-person narrator ultimately realises that questions about the nature  of existence are of no objective value. In The End of the Road the character Jacob  Horner adopts a superficial reflection of pre-existing rules and social conventions.  Together these novels reflect much of what is at present understood as the postmodern  aesthetic, and are indicative of many of the changes in America that were  about to occur. The Floating Opera was published in 1956 and The End of the Road  was published in 1958, but they are still highly relevant beyond the period in which  they were written.    White Noise (1984) portrays a system founded on the Hollywood mythology,  and the superficial reflection of pre-existing rules and social conventions found in The  End of the Road. The novel revolves around the experiences of the narrator, Jack  Gladney, a university lecturer who teaches Hitler studies at Blacksmith College, and  his wife Babette. The course which he teaches on Hitler is influenced by Hollywood  myth, and the novel portrays a consumer-based society that has lost much of the firm  moral basis which traditional religious concepts formerly supplied. The role of  television, Hollywood, and the idea of simulation are all explored throughout the  novel and are important forces in any examination of post-war American society.  Finally, in Vineland (1990) the social upheavals which occurred during the  late &#65533;60s and early &#65533;70s are explored from the perspective of the 1980s. The novel  refers to a vast array of images and icons from popular culture, and the brief youth  rebellion, in the late &#65533;60s, which failed to inspire any final social revolution. The  result of this failed social revolution is a landscape of popular culture in modern  America, where Godzilla leaves footprints in Japan and popular mythology from  television or pulp novels coincides with everyday life. There are references in typical  Pynchonesque fashion to those who must necessarily be orchestrating these social and  cultural alterations, but they, as specific individuals, remain anonymous or hidden  from the scope of the author (although, as in White Noise, there are deliberate  references to the CIA and other agencies or departments within the U.S. Federal  Government). Vineland is important, therefore, both as an account of the social  changes which occurred in America between the late &#65533;60s and &#65533;80s, and the increasing  role of popular culture in America.    These four novels form the basis of an exploration of the role of popular  mythology and popular culture in post-war America. They form a clear progression,  and allow a detailed analysis of the social and cultural changes which contemporary  America has undergone since the end of World War II.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Popular culture;John Barth;The Floating Opera;The End of the Road;Don DeLillo;White Niose;Thomas Pychon;Vineland;American Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retrograde Cellular Transport of Herpes Simplex Virus: Interactions between Viral and Motor Proteins</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Mark William</field><field name="description">Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a common human pathogen that establishes life-long latent infection in sensory neurones. This makes it potentially useful as a gene therapy vector to target neuronal cells. HSV-1 enters cells by membrane fusion, the viral envelope and most tegument proteins dissociate, and the capsid is transported to the cell nucleus to establish infection. There is increasing evidence that the retrograde transport of HSV-1 along sensory axons is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, but the viral and cellular proteins involved are not known. Cytoplasmic dynein is the major molecular motor involved in minus-end-directed cellular transport along microtubules. It is a large complex molecule, with heavy chains providing motility, while intermediate and light chains are involved in specific cargo binding.  A library of HSV-1 capsid and tegument structural genes was constructed and tested for interaction with dynein subunits in a yeast two-hybrid system. A strong interaction was demonstrated between the HSV-1 outer capsid protein VP26 (UL35), as well as the tegument protein VP11/12 (UL46), with the homologous 14 kDa dynein light chains rp3 and Tctex1. In vitro pull-down assays confirmed binding of VP26 to rp3, Tctex1 and cytoplasmic dynein complexes. Recombinant HSV-1 capsids +/- VP26 were used in similar pull-down assays. Only VP26+ capsids bound to rp3. Recombinant HSV-1 capsids were microinjected into living cells and incubated at 37&#65533;C. After 1 h capsids were observed to co-localise with rp3, Tctex1 and microtubules. After 2 or 4 h VP26+ capsids had moved closer to the cell nucleus, while VP26- capsids remained in a random distribution.   Our results suggest that the HSV-1 outer capsid protein VP26 mediates binding of incoming capsids to the retrograde motor cytoplasmic dynein during cellular infection, through interactions with dynein light chains. It is hoped that these findings will help in the development of a synthetic viral vector, which may allow targeted gene therapy in patients with neurological diseases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herpes simplex virus;dynein;molecular motors;axonal transport;viral proteins;microinjection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising the Postharvest Management Of Lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) &#65533; A Study of Mechanical Injury and Desiccation</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Philippa</field><field name="description">The major objective of the research was to improve lychee postharvest management, through a greater understanding of mechanical injury and moisture loss.   Mechanical injury is a known cause of postharvest loss in lychee, but previously published information has been limited to broad observations. In this study, the symptoms of mechanical damage in lychee were defined, including quantitative measurement of colour changes. Impact injury caused protuberance tip darkening, cracking of the pericarp and significant changes in skin colour. Compression also typically caused tip darkening, and severe loads were capable of puncture, shape distortion and skin cracking. Abrasion and vibration injuries were characterised by strong yellowing of pericarp colour, possibly due to the leakage of cell contents onto the fruit surface. Vibration also caused significant darkening and loss of colour saturation. Vibration has not previously been mentioned as an issue in lychee postharvest management, but appeared to be as important a problem as desiccation browning at the wholesale level, both in incidence and severity.   Mechanically damaged fruit consistently showed increased ethylene and carbon dioxide synthesis, and moisture loss was increased by up to 30%. Some significant changes in skin biochemistry and cuticle properties were also detected. The study of damaged tissue by SEM revealed distinctive patterns of surface tissue disruption. Open pericarp cracking was a particularly detrimental injury, causing significantly increased electrolyte leakage and rapid pathogen development.  The effects of load characteristics, such as magnitude, method of application, site, repetition and cushioning, on the extent of damage were defined. Fruit  characteristics such as cultivar, gross morphology, temperature, hydration and surface wetness were shown to significantly affect damage levels. Small seed size was correlated with increased cracking susceptibility. Fruit surface wetness exacerbated vibration or abrasion damage. Turgid fruit were less susceptible to vibration and abrasion damage, but showed increased susceptibility to impact cracking.    Previously neglected aspects of desiccation browning research were studied, including cultivar and maturity effects, sites of moisture loss and the role of air currents. Cultivar effects on moisture loss were obscured by pre-harvest factors, but consistent cultivar differences were detected in desiccation browning, possibly related to skin thickness. In contrast, maturity levels over a marketable range had little effect on weight loss or browning. Moisture was lost fairly evenly over the fruit surface, but poor postharvest handling appeared to massively increase loss from the protuberance tips. Moisture loss was shown to substantially increase ethylene synthesis. The crucial role of air currents in exacerbating lychee moisture loss was emphasised, and the relationship between air speed and weight loss was defined.  The research contributed to a greater understanding of the processes of mechanical damage and moisture loss in lychee, leading to improved protocols for the postharvest management of the fruit. Improved management of mechanical damage and moisture loss will ultimately improve fruit quality and reduce postharvest losses, hence increasing returns to industry.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lychee;Litchi;Mechanical;Injury;Damage;Desiccation;Moisture Loss;Water Relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remobilisation of Heavy Metals from Sediments Using Aminopolycarboxylic Acids</field><field name="creator">Fang, Bin</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a study of the remobilisation of heavy metals from sediments by three aminopolycarboxylic acids (APCAs). They are nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. The investigation is introduced by examining the sources, uses and chemistry of these acids. The introduction also includes a discussion of what is known about the inclusion of heavy metals into sediments and their remobilisation from sediments. Typical concentrations of APCAs in natural waters and sediments have been catalogued from the literature. The advantages and disadvantages of various laboratory techniques employed for the remobilisation of heavy metals by APCAs from sediments are assessed, as is the use of such experiments in quantifying the role of APCAs in the remobilisation of heavy metals from sediments. Sediments from three areas were sampled for this study; they were the Alexandra Canal, Captains Flat and Jenolan Caves in New South Wales, Australia. In each area several sites were sampled. For each site there is a brief description of the catchment geology and hydrology. Selected sediment-associated waters in the areas were analysed for their metal concentrations as well as for ultratrace levels of APCAs employing a method developed in the present study. The waters were analysed for the major ions Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-. The sediments from selected sites in each of the areas were dried and fractionated. The dry total and fine sediments were analysed for their metal content and the latter was found to adequately represent the former in this respect. Water samples from the three areas showed different chemistries and exhibited more subtle differences between sites. In general, the Alexandra Canal waters are saline and alkaline and are a mixture of urban runoff and seawater; the Captains Flat waters are acidic and contain high sulfate from acid mine and tailings drainage; the Jenolan Caves waters are neutral and have the features characteristic of waters draining through limestone. The APCA contamination in all water samples when ranked against other global sites is very low. Although the current APCA levels in the waters appear low, it was concluded that they should be closely monitored so that efforts can be made to minimise the risk of APCAs being hazardous environmental contaminants and also that any remobilisation of heavy metals from sediments by APCAs can be controlled. Agitation and column laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in order to obtain an understanding of the remobilisation of metals by contamination levels of APCAs in water, both as the individual APCAs and as a mixture of APCAs. Complimentary experiments were carried out using a molar excess of APCAs calculated from the metal concentrations obtained by acid digestion (assuming 1:1 metal complex formation). Both types of remobilisation experiments were designed to investigate the role that redox potential (Eh) and concentration of APCAs in natural waters have on the remobilisation of heavy metals from the sediments. The agitation experiments were employed to assess metal remobilisation for the situation where the sediments are disturbed while the column experiments explored metal remobilisation for the case where the sediments are left undisturbed in situ. The major conclusions from the agitation experiments that used fine sediment from the Alexandra Canal were that 100 ppm APCA solutions will remobilise metals from the sediments under oxic conditions but only remobilise infinitesimally small amounts of metal under anoxic conditions. The use of fine sediments for the duplicate agitation experiments was found to give adequate duplication of results. A mixture of APCAs in solution acts similarly to the average of the three individual APCA solutions, showing that there are no antagonistic or synergistic effects likely to occur when they are found together in the environment. It was found that the mmoles of the metals remobilised exceeded the mmoles of the APCAs added when 500.0 mL of 100 ppm APCA solution was used on 50.00 g of sediment. This might be due to APCAs remobilising metals from the sediments in ways other than by complexation. Even though an excess of APCAs was available, metal remobilisation was not complete when the experiments were forced to terminate. During the 14 days of the experiment, only one quarter of the metals liberated from the sediment by HNO3 and 30 % H2O2 digestion were remobilised by the APCAs. Therefore an excess of free APCAs remains in solution. Fine sediments from Alexandra Canal, Captains Flat and Jenolan Caves were employed in the oxic agitation experiments using excess APCAs in solution. These experiments resulted in the following major conclusion: when producing an APCA remobilisation signature for trace and ultratrace metals, the geochemistry of the site is of secondary importance to the source of the contaminating metals. This is a feature of the trace and ultratrace metal speciation in the source rather than their concentration in it. From the different levels of calcium present in the three areas it was found that calcium is unlikely to form stable 1:1 APCA complexes at the pH values employed and is unlikely to compete with the heavy metal remobilisation by APCAs. Total sediments from Alexandra Canal and 100 ppm APCA solutions were employed for the column leaching experiments. From mass, pore water volumes and flow measurements it was shown that the ten mini cores taken from the same site were not true replicates. Despite this, when the sediments have settled and the pore waters removed from the cores, the levels of metal being leached stabilise and may represent a clearer picture of the in situ metal leaching from sediment with time. The levels of metal leached from the cores in 14 days suggest that during this period the cores are essentially anoxic, with the oxygen supplied from the oxic leaching solutions used for inorganic and microbial processes in the sediments. Agitation experiments appeared to yield an adequate picture of what would happen if free APCA solution came in contact with fine sediments suspended in the water column. Column leaching experiments employing total sediment were found to be only of limited value in assessing heavy metal remobilisation from undisturbed sediment. These experiments do not give a reliable assessment of the bioavailability of heavy metals and further testing of the acute and chronic toxicity of the sediments is recommended. APCA solutions that have been used in sediment and soil washing under conditions related to those used in the present study may contain an excess of the free APCAs as well as APCA heavy metal complexes and hence may be toxic to biota.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aminopolycarboxylic acids (APCA);nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA);ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA);diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leo Strauss's Recovery of the Political: The City and Man as a reply to Carl Schmitt's The Concept of the Political</field><field name="creator">Dutton, Brett</field><field name="description">This dissertation demonstrates that Leo Strauss, in The City and Man, continues his response to Carl Schmitt&#65533;s arguments concerning the affirmation of the political, as outlined by Strauss in his 1932 article on Schmitt&#65533;s The Concept of the Political.  In affirming the political, Strauss spoke of the 'theologico-political problem', or the question regarding who, or what, should rule society.  Strauss outlines six criteria in his 1932 'Comments', which he argues can be found in Schmitt&#65533;s The Concept of the Political, as essential for the recovery of the political.  In raising the question of the political, both Schmitt and Strauss return to the fundamental question regarding how one should live.  In so doing, Strauss rejects Schmitt&#65533;s reliance on conflicting faiths and returns to the Socratic description of the best regime (politeia), understood as the best way of life, that is devoted to contemplation, peace and justice.  In his argument in The City and Man, Strauss satisfies the six criteria outlined in his 'Comments': (1) the acceptance of moral evil within human nature; (2) the problem of opposition among groups; (3) the possibility of a non-neutral, transprivate obligation; (4) the need for a content that determines the distinction between friend and enemy; (5) a content that leads to a quarrel over the question of 'what is Right?' and (6) that the political must address 'the order of human things from a pure and whole knowledge'.  This thesis demonstrates that Strauss&#65533;s 1964 book, The City and Man, indirectly addresses Schmitt&#65533;s general criteria, using an interpretation of Thucydides&#65533;s, Aristotle&#65533;s and Plato&#65533;s best regime &#65533; which is linked to the pursuit of wisdom, or the philosophic life &#65533; to provide a transpolitical standard that opposes Schmitt&#65533;s insistence on 'concrete' experience, that relies on historical destiny, and faith, as the guide to political life.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">political theory;schmitt;strauss;politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Banking on the Customer': customer relations, employment relations and worker identity in the Australian retail banking industry</field><field name="creator">Cutcher, Leanne Rose</field><field name="description">Previously consigned to the anonymity of &#65533;the product market&#65533; by  researchers in traditional fields such as labour economics and industrial relations, the customer has recently attracted the attention of scholars from a diverse range of disciplines, including organisational behaviour, work psychology, labour process studies, gender studies, and critical management studies. In large part, this emerging interest in the customer is a result of the increasing dominance of service industries in developed economies and the recognition that service work entails a complex, three-way interaction between customers, management and workers.  The literature identifies a range of competing and, at times, contradictory images of the customer.  Rather than seeking to reconcile these competing representations, this thesis explores the multi-faceted nature of the customer presence and the implications for managers and workers in the retail banking industry in Australia.  The thesis highlights how structural change and shifting discourses of the &#65533;customer&#65533; have influenced customer relations, employment relations, and worker identity in three areas of the retail banking industry: traditional retail banks, the credit union movement, and community banks. Drawing on detailed qualitative case study evidence, the thesis highlights the range of customers, both &#65533;real&#65533; and &#65533;constructed&#65533;, that can be found in the case study organisations.  The thesis identifies the ways in which customers influence employment relations and how workers can be active in either accommodating or resisting the impact of these &#65533;customers&#65533; on workplace practice and worker identity.  The central argument of the thesis is that, in addition to customers having a physical presence in and influence on organisational life, management and workers also construct &#65533;discursive customers&#65533; as a means of influencing the employment relationship and the meanings attached to service work. The study examines how these competing concepts of the customer and customer service influence both the customer-service provider relationship and service workers&#65533; relationships with one another and with management. Despite the increasing recognition that service work entails a three-way relationship between customers, management and workers, our understanding of how workers either welcome or resist the presence of this third actor in the employment relationship has, until recently remained very  limited.  This thesis makes a significant contribution to our understanding that for workers the customer is ever-present physically, emotionally and discursively.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">customer service;identity;discourse;change resistance;human resource manaagement;industrial relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vietnamese Aesthetics From 1925 Onwards</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Boi Tran</field><field name="description">Twentieth century art in Vi&#234;t-Nam underwent immense changes due to the nation&#65533;s  encounters with the West, through colonialism and two great wars. This thesis  examines the significant impact of architecture, clothing painting and sculpture on the  development of Vietnamese aesthetics. The very public nature of architecture and  clothing will be used as a cultural backdrop for the changing aesthetic ideals in  painting and sculpture.  The thesis examines the aesthetic merits of Socialist Realism, introduced after  reunification in 1975, in particular, its relationship to the art of the Republic of Vie&#65533;t-  Nam (South Vi&#234;t-Nam) from 1954 to 1975. Vietnamese post-war art historians have  consistently omitted the significant cultural developments of this period in their  writings. A study of this distinctive era will clarify aesthetic changes in the last decades  of the twentieth century.  After a long period of isolation and ideological constraint, remarkable cultural changes  occurred when Vi&#234;t-Nam re-established contact with the outside world. This thesis will  present the subsequent changes in aesthetics, as an attempt to balance tradition and  modernity, within the context of market reforms and the internationalisation of  Vietnamese art. These events had a significant impact on the contemporary art market  in Vi&#234;t-Nam.

Waste management was originally driven by managing the health consequences of wrong time/place materials.  This has changed and the significant driver is now the sustainable utilisation of resources, that is, trying to optimally recover as resources (right time/place) those materials that present as wastes requiring management. However, it is not acceptable to justify a resource recovery option purely on the basis that it is diverting material away from landfill.  Preferences are emerging for recovery activities that maximise the resource value of a material according to techno-economic, environmental and socio-political criteria; collectively known as the criteria of sustainability.  The people and organisations articulating these preferences include owners/operators of resource recovery centres, proponents of alternative waste management technologies, waste planners and managers at both a state and local government level and environmental NGOs representing community interests, in addition to the generators of waste at a domestic, commercial and industrial, and construction and demolition level.  It is therefore important to be able to answer the question of 'what is the optimal or most sustainable resource recovery option for materials presenting as waste to landfill in the Greater Sydney Region?' The point of departure for this thesis is twofold.  Firstly, that optimal resource recovery options (also known as alternative waste management technologies) can be identified by understanding the context and system drivers and constraints within the system of waste generation and utilisation, by modelling the system using industrial ecology (specifically Materials Flux Analysis) and by using the technology assessment framework developed by the NSW Alternative Waste Management Technologies and Practices Inquiry to evaluate the available options. Secondly, that should the assessment framework from the NSW Inquiry prove to be unsuitable as a framework for evaluation, then an improved and refined assessment framework can be constructed in order to identify optimal resource recovery options and that this process can be successfully demonstrated using wood waste as a case study. The context of waste as an issue has shifted from local government control (pre-1970s) to state government control through the Department of Environment and Conservation.  This transition followed experiments with organisations such as the NSW Waste Boards and Resource NSW, in addition to state targets such as a 60% reduction of waste to landfill by the year 2000. In addition to this backdrop of change from a government administrative perspective, there are also a suite of often conflicting drivers and constraints influencing the process of resource recovery.  For example, sustainable development is a public policy driver for the integration of environmental and societal concerns, but can also constrain new innovation if competing 'status quo' utilisation options are not subject to the same scrutiny.   Similarly, legislation acts as a constraint to resource recovery options by establishing license conditions, prohibiting some energy recovery options and setting recovery criteria; however legislation also acts as a driver for resource recovery options that generate renewable electricity or act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Other drivers and constraints include social, technical and economic issues and concerns in addition to environmental impacts such as emissions to air, land and water.  Industrial ecology is a model for viewing system components as part of a dependent and interrelated greater whole.  Within the context of Industrial Ecology, waste is a by-product of manufacture available as a beneficial input into other processes.  Using Materials Flux Analysis as a tool to build a model of waste generation and utilisation, elements within the system are presented as a series of stocks (sources), technology interventions (transformation flows) and sinks (markets). The stocks or sources of materials for resource recovery are categorised as Municipal Solid (MSW), Commercial and Industrial (C&amp;I) or Construction and Demolition (C&amp;D) wastes.  Approximately seven million tonnes of waste is generated in the Greater Sydney Region (nearly two and a half million tonnes of materials recovered for recycling and four and a half million tonnes of materials disposed of  to landfill).   The purpose of technology intervention is to transform the material into a product that is suited to the end market (sink).  Markets are grouped according to reuse (same function and form), direct recycling (same supply chain), indirect recycling (different supply chain) and energy recovery (either as process heat, electricity or co-generation, a combination of the two).  Landfill is also a potential sink for materials and in this sense can be thought of as a negative value market.   The Alternative Waste Management Technologies and Practices Inquiry provided an assessment framework for resource recovery technologies.  Each technology was measured and compared against 16 evaluation criteria, resulting in a score out of one hundred.  Material sorting scored the highest (81.5), incineration the lowest (50.8) with most of the biological technologies performing &#65533;well&#65533; (64.6 &#65533; 71.7) and with the landfill technologies performing 'moderately well' (60.4 - 61.4). The positive features of the Inquiry included the overview of alternative resource recovery technologies, waste generation and other issues pertinent to decision making and resource recovery.  The negatives of the Inquiry arise from the inadequacies of the assessment framework, which lacked technology options, system boundary definition and requisite evaluation criteria in addition to inconsistencies in scoring approaches.  By undertaking a sensitivity analysis on the Inquiry&#65533;s results, it is shown that rank order reversal results from the allocation of weightings. The improved and refined assessment framework, constructed to overcome identified inadequacies of the Inquiry&#65533;s approach, focussed on clearly identifying the problem to be addressed and the primary decision maker involved in the process; ensuring that appropriate options for evaluation were included; defining the system boundary for the assessment; selecting necessary evaluation criteria; adopting a more sophisticated system for scoring; and using a sensitivity analysis to validate the results of the resource recovery option evaluation. Wood waste was used as a case study for this second assessment methodology.  Wood waste refers to the end-of-life products, failed products, offcuts, shavings and sawdust from all timber products.  Approximately 350,000 tonnes of wood waste are disposed of to landfill each year.  This comprises untreated timber (hard wood and soft wood), engineered timber products (particleboard, medium density fibreboard and plywood) and treated timber (predominately copper chrome arsenic). Eight wood resource recovery options are selected for evaluation within the Greater Sydney Region with a different approach to scoring that has the advantage of 'scaling up' the best performers within each attribute (highest score) while 'scaling down' the worst performers (no score).  Under this evaluation, an on-site purpose built energy facility is the most preferred option with particleboard manufacture the least preferred option. A sensitivity analysis of the results reveals that the scores of each technology option are sensitive to the weightings of the decision maker. When the change in rankings is examined, it is identified that two eight wood recovery options undergo a large rank reversal. A critique of the results of the wood evaluation reveals five major flaws.  Firstly the evaluation produces non-highest resource value results that are non-intuitive (and arguably misleading), for example the poor performance of reuse and particleboard against energy generation options.  Secondly, the recording of a single summary score for each recovery option hides unacceptable performance levels in some criteria.  For example, the top scorer of Primary Energy On-site hides the fact that such an option is likely to have no political desirability (likely public opposition to 'incineration' within the Sydney air-shed), calling into question its ability to be implemented as a solution.  Thirdly there is a reliance on judgement for the scoring of options and weighting of preferences, calling into doubt the accuracy of scores.   Fourthly, the rankings of recovery options by the assessment framework are sensitive to the allocation of weightings.   Finally and most importantly, the refined evaluation approach suffers from the 'discrete option syndrome', the scoring of each recovery option in isolation with no ability to look at integrated systems with joint recovery options.  This is pinpointed as a fundamental flaw in the process of both the Inquiry and the wood evaluation.   This leads to the conclusion that the founding assertions of this thesis were false.  That is to say that the assessment framework developed by the NSW Alternative Waste Management Technologies and Practices Inquiry is not suitable for use in evaluating resource recovery options.  Furthermore a refined assessment framework based on this approach is also unable to identify optimal resource recovery options as demonstrated using wood waste as a case study. The results of this research points to the overall conclusion that any discrete option evaluation and assessment for resource recovery technologies that results in a single summary score for each option will be fundamentally flawed, providing no value in determining optimal resource recovery solutions for the Greater Sydney Region. A systems approach is suggested as an alternative method for the evaluation of optimal resource recovery, the starting point of which is to ask 'what is the highest resource value of the components in the material stream under consideration and how could a network of infrastructure be designed in order to allow materials to flow to their highest resource value use?'  A feature of such an integrated approach is a focus on the materials composition of recovered resources, as opposed to recovery technologies, resulting in a 'fit for purpose' as opposed to a 'forced fit' style of resource recovery. It is recommended that further research and public policy efforts be made in logistics planning across the Greater Sydney Region (as opposed to a regional or local government area) in order to create network opportunities for integrated flows of materials to move toward their highest resource value.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waste;resource recovery;alternative waste technologies;wood waste;assessment framework</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Packaging curiosities : towards a grammar of three-dimensional space</field><field name="creator">Stenglin, Maree Kristen</field><field name="description">Western museums are public institutions, open and accessible to all sectors of the population  they serve. Increasingly, they are becoming more accountable to the governments that fund  them, and criteria such as visitation figures are being used to assess their viability. In order to  ensure their survival in the current climate of economic rationalism, museums need to  maintain their audiences and attract an even broader demographic. To do this, they need to  ensure that visitors feel comfortable, welcome and secure inside their spaces. They also need  to give visitors clear entry points for engaging with and valuing the objects and knowledge on  display in exhibitions.  This thesis maps a grammar of three-dimensional space with a strong focus on the  interpersonal metafunction. Building on the social semiotic tools developed by Halliday  (1978, 1985a), Halliday and Hasan (1976), Martin (1992) and Matthiessen (1995), it identifies  two interpersonal resources for organising space: Binding and Bonding. Binding is the main  focus of the thesis. It theorises the way people&#65533;s emotions can be affected by the organisation  of three-dimensional space. Essentially, it explores the affectual disposition that exists  between a person and the space that person occupies by focussing on how a space can be  organised to make an occupant feel secure or insecure. Binding is complemented by Bonding.  Bonding is concerned with the way the occupants of a space are positioned interpersonally to  create solidarity. In cultural institutions like museums and galleries, Bonding is concerned  with making visitors feel welcome and as though they belong, not just to the building and the  physical environment, but to a community of like-minded people. Such feelings of belonging  are also crucial to the long-term survival of the museum.  Finally, in order to present a metafunctionally diversified grammar of space, the thesis moves  beyond interpersonal meanings. It concludes by exploring the ways textual and ideational  meanings can be organised in three-dimensional space.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Museums;Semiotics;Social Semiotics;Space;Architecture;Emotion;Interpersonal meaning;Metafuctions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Violation to Reconstruction:  The Process of Self-Renewal Associated with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</field><field name="creator">Travers, Michele Kerry</field><field name="description">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a contested condition that generates scepticism and occupies a marginalised position within medical and social contexts.  The thesis examines the illness experiences, and specifically the experiences of self, for people affected with CFS.  Using qualitative inquiry, a substantive theory related to the process of self-renewal and adaptation associated with CFS is explicated.  The theory encompasses the trajectory of CFS from onset to chronicity, and in exceptional instances, recovery.  Illness narratives were derived from in-depth, semi-structured interviews of 19 adults, including 16 people affected with, and 3 people recovered from, CFS.  Data was coded and analysed using a grounded theory approach.  Analysis generated two parallel narratives that defined the illness experience of CFS: the narrative of the illness biographies and the narrative of self, specifically the struggling and diminished self seeking renewal.  The illness biographies encompassed the stories of symptoms and their explanations, the encounters that ensued and their contentious milieu.  The narrative of self was the primary narrative.  It articulated the negative consequences to self and personhood associated with CFS, named the Violation of Self, and the consequent efforts of participants to decrease the struggle and violation by use of the Guardian Response and the Reconstructing Response.  The Guardian Response provided protection and self-reclamation.  The Reconstructing Response fostered self-renewal and meaning.  The two narratives were bridged by the threats of CFS.  That is, the illness biographies were accompanied by threats of disruption related to chronic illness, and by threats of invalidation that arose from CFS as a contested condition.  In turn, these threats provided the catalyst to the violation and responses as described in the narrative of self.  Under different conditions the relative strengths of violation, guardianship or reconstruction fluctuated, and it was these fluctuations that presented the participants with the ongoing struggle of CFS.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronic fatigue syndrome;myalgic encephalomyelitis;illness experience;illness narrative;self</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Epidemiology of Osteoporosis in the Frail Institutionalized Elderly</field><field name="creator">Zochling, Jane Margaret</field><field name="description">As our population ages, the proportion of frail elderly people requiring assisted accommodation in aged care facilities is increasing.  This population is at high risk of falls and fractures, which bring significant morbidity and mortality.  The prevalence of osteoporosis also increases with age, but there have been few studies of bone density in residents of hostels and nursing homes.  This thesis looked at the prevalence of osteoporosis and falls in elderly people in residential care, to define the size of the problem and identify risk factors for low bone density and falling, with particular reference to vitamin D levels.    Two thousand and five men and women aged between 65 and 104 years were enrolled in the Falls and Fracture Risk in the Elderly Epidemiology (FREE) study between 1999 and 2003.  The key findings from analysis of this population were firstly, that quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measures were higher in men than women independent of age, and that in men there was no significant decline in either BUA or VOS, but in women BUA declined by over 3% per decade and VOS by 1% per decade.  Both ultrasound machines used in the study were shown to be reliable, with precision unaffected by advanced age. QUS was found to be sensitive to longitudinal change even in this frail elderly cohort.    Vitamin D deficiency was found in the majority of elderly aged care facility residents but supplementation conferred higher serum 25-OH-vitamin D levels.  Vitamin D levels were not shown to be related to BUA, VOS or the risk of falling in this population.  Serum parathyroid hormone might be important in determining future falls risk.      In summary, the results of this thesis give an important insight into the prevalence of osteoporosis and falls in the frail elderly, and how these might be predicted.  Future study of prospective fracture rates in this group will then be able to assess relative risk factors for osteoporotic fracture, and identify those individuals who might benefit from directed fracture prevention strategies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteoporsis;Epidemiology;Elderly</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Origins of Bagan: The archaeological landscape of Upper Burma to AD 1300.</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Bob</field><field name="description">The archaeological landscape of Upper Burma from the middle of the first millennium BC to the Bagan period in the 13th-14th century AD is a landscape of continuity. Finds of polished stone and bronze artifacts suggest the existence of early metal-using cultures in the Chindwin and Samon River Valleys, and along parts of the Ayeyarwady plain. Increasing technological and settlement complexity in the Samon Valley suggests that a distinctive culture whose agricultural and trade success can be read in the archaeological record of the Late Prehistoric period developed there. The appearance of the early urban &#65533;Pyu&#65533; system of walled central places during the early first millennium AD seems to have involved a spread of agricultural and management skills and population from the Samon. The leaders of the urban centres adopted Indic symbols and Sanskrit modes of kingship to enhance and extend their authority. The early urban system was subject over time to a range of stresses including siltation of water systems, external disruption and social changes as Buddhist notions of leadership eclipsed Brahmanical ones. The archaeological evidence indicates that a settlement was forming at Bagan during the last centuries of the first millennium AD. By the mid 11th century Bagan began to dominate Upper Burma, and the region began a transition from a system of largely autonomous city states to a centralised kingdom. Inscriptions of the 11th to 13th centuries indicate that as the Bagan Empire expanded it subsumed the agricultural lands that had been developed by the Pyu.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">archaeology;myanmar;burma;urbanism;bronze age;GIS;Pyu</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of temperature and photoperiod on broccoli development, yield and quality in south-east Queensland</field><field name="creator">Tan, Daniel Kean Yuen</field><field name="description">Broccoli is a vegetable crop of increasing importance in Australia, particularly in south-east Queensland and farmers need to maintain a regular supply of good quality broccoli to meet the expanding market. However, harvest maturity date, head yield and quality are all affected by climatic variations during the production cycle, particularly low temperature episodes. There are also interactions between genotype and climatic variability. A predictive model of ontogeny, incorporating climatic data including frost risk, would enable farmers to predict harvest maturity date and select appropriate cultivar - sowing date combinations. The first stage of this research was to define floral initiation, which is fundamental to predicting ontogeny. Scanning electron micrographs of the apical meristem were made for the transition from the vegetative to advanced reproductive stage. During the early vegetative stage (stage 1), the apical meristem was a small, pointed shoot tip surrounded by leaf primordia. The transitional stage (stage 2) was marked by a widening and flattening to form a dome-shaped apical meristem. In the floral initiation stage (stage 3), the first-order floral primordia were observed in the axils of the developing bracts. Under field conditions, the shoot apex has an average diameter of 500 micro m at floral initiation and floral primordia can be observed under a light microscope. Sub-zero temperatures can result in freezing injury and thereby reduce head yield and quality. In order to predict the effects of frosts, it is desirable to know the stages of development at which plants are most susceptible. Therefore, the effects of sub-zero temperatures on leaf and shoot mortality, head yield and quality were determined after exposure of plants to a range of temperatures for short periods, at different stages of development (vegetative, floral initiation and buttoning). Plants in pots and in the field were subjected to sub-zero temperature regimes from -1 C to -19 C. Extracellular ice formation was achieved by reducing temperatures slowly, at a rate of -2 C per hour. The floral initiation stage was most sensitive to freezing injury, as yields were significantly reduced at -1 C and -3 C, and shoot apices were killed at -5 C. There was no significant yield reduction when the inflorescence buttoning stage was subjected to -1 C and -3 C. Although shoot apices at buttoning survived the -5 C treatment, very poor quality heads of uneven bud size were produced as a result of arrested development. The lethal temperature for pot-grown broccoli was between -3 C and -5 C, whereas the lethal temperature for field-grown broccoli was between -7 C and -9 C. The difference was presumably due to variation in cold acclimation. Freezing injury can reduce broccoli head yield and quality, and retard plant growth. Crop development models based only on simple thermal time without restrictions will not predict yield or maturity if broccoli crops are frost-damaged. Field studies were conducted to develop procedures for predicting ontogeny, yield and quality. Three cultivars, (Fiesta, Greenbelt and Marathon) were sown on eight dates from 11 March to 22 May 1997, and grown under natural and extended (16 h) photoperiods in a sub-tropical environment at Gatton College, south-east Queensland, under non-limiting conditions of water and nutrient supply. Daily climatic data, and dates of emergence, floral initiation, harvest maturity, together with yield and quality were obtained. Yield and quality responses to temperature and photoperiod were quantified. As growing season mean minimum temperatures decreased, fresh weight of tops decreased while fresh weight harvest index increased linearly. There was no definite relationship between fresh weight of tops or fresh weight harvest index and growing season minimum temperatures greater than 10 C. Genotype, rather than the environment, mainly determined head quality attributes. Fiesta had the best head quality, with higher head shape and branching angle ratings than Greenbelt or Marathon. Bud colour and cluster separation of Marathon were only acceptable for export when growing season mean minimum temperatures were less than 8 C. Photoperiod did not influence yield or quality in any of the three cultivars. A better understanding of genotype and environmental interactions will help farmers optimise yield and quality, by matching cultivars with time of sowing. Crop developmental responses to temperature and photoperiod were quantified from emergence to harvest maturity (Model 1), from emergence to floral initiation (Model 2), from floral initiation to harvest maturity (Model 3), and in a combination of Models 2 and 3 (Model 4). These thermal time models were based on optimised base and optimum temperatures of 0 and 20 C, respectively. These optimised temperatures were determined using an iterative optimisation routine (simplex). Cardinal temperatures were consistent across cultivars but thermal time of phenological intervals were cultivar specific. Sensitivity to photoperiod and solar radiation was low in the three cultivars used. Thermal time models tested on independent data for five cultivars (Fiesta, Greenbelt, Marathon, CMS Liberty and Triathlon) grown as commercial crops on the Darling Downs over two years, adequately predicted floral initiation and harvest maturity. Model 4 provided the best prediction for the chronological duration from emergence to harvest maturity. Model 1 was useful when floral initiation data were not available, and it predicted harvest maturity almost as well as Model 4 since the same base and optimum temperatures of 0 C and 20 C, respectively, were used for both phenological intervals. Model 1 was also generated using data from 1979-80 sowings of three cultivars (Premium Crop, Selection 160 and Selection 165A). When Model 1 was tested with independent data from 1983-84, it predicted harvest maturity well. Where floral initiation data were available, predictions of harvest maturity were most precise using Model 3, since the variation, which occurred from emergence to floral initiation, was removed. Prediction of floral initiation using Model 2 can be useful for timing cultural practices, and for avoiding frost and high temperature periods. This research has produced models to assist broccoli farmers in crop scheduling and cultivar selection in south-east Queensland. Using the models as a guide, farmers can optimise yield and quality, by matching cultivars with sowing date. By accurately predicting floral initiation, the risk of frost damage during floral initiation can be reduced by adjusting sowing dates or crop management options. The simple and robust thermal time models will improve production and marketing arrangements, which have to be made in advance. The thermal time models in this study, incorporating frost risk using conditional statements, provide a foundation for a decision support system to manage the sequence of sowings on commercial broccoli farms.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">broccoli;Brassica oleracea;Brassicaceae;models;thermal time;yield;quality;development;freezing injury</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">VERSUS THE VOX POPULI  Reflections on the practice of art as a quest for liberation</field><field name="creator">Heine, Martin</field><field name="description">This dissertation is an attempt to define the constellation of circumstances and ideas,  which has determined my strategy in the paintings and performances submitted for  examination. Unlike many artists I do not accept the fact of postmodernity. On the  contrary, art and life remain suspended between the future and the past, the essential  modernist condition.  I argue for this in the introduction and the first two chapters, through a description of  the performance work of Joseph Beuys and on my reaction to it in a performance in  which I attempted to examine the practical paradoxes of art making in late modernity.  I take my position largely from the Frankfurt school and succeeding debates about  their work up to Zizek. For, while we remain in modernity we cannot regard it simply  as an unfinished project. It is no longer possible to adopt an avant-garde position in  one&#65533;s practice.  The central section of the thesis contains a series of studies of the careers of major  artists who have faced up to the paradoxes of modernity from Picasso to Richter and  Parr. Through their successes, failures and sometimes duplicity, a practical profile  emerges &#65533; a guide to the limits of contemporary practice.

Globalisation, it has been argued, creates pressures for convergence that will increasingly undermine national diversity in industrial relations institutions and outcomes. At its most extreme, the globalisation thesis predicts &#65533;a universal race to the bottom&#65533; of labour standards.  This globalisation thesis has been broadly criticised in the comparative industrial relations literature. Rather, a growing body of comparative industrial relations literature has pointed to evidence of continued diversity, despite the common pressures associated with changes in the international economy. This literature has focussed on the importance national level institutional variables play in explaining diversity and suggested that differences in national level institutional variables are likely to produce cross-national divergence rather than convergence.  While the institutionalist approach represents an important corrective to the globalisation thesis, it has difficulty explaining similarities in patterns of industrial relations changes, despite institutional differences across countries, and is largely unable to explain changes in the institutions themselves. This thesis argues that these limitations of the institutionalist approach reflect its intellectual origins in comparative politics.  The major contribution of this thesis is the development of an interaction approach the relationship between international economic change and the domestic institutions of industrial relations. This alternative theoretical approach, which is drawn from concepts in the political economy tradition in industrial relations and the international political economy literature, identifies four key variables the shape the relationship between international economic change and the domestic institutions of industrial relations: namely, the international economic regime; the national production profile; the accumulation strategy of the state; and the role of institutional effects.  The thesis tests the explanatory power of the interaction approach by focussing on the comparison between two closely matched countries- Australia and New Zealand- during three periods of significant economic change in the international economy: the end of the nineteenth century; the immediate post world war two period; and, in the late 1960s. It shows that each of these periods a focus on changes in the international economy and how they impact the interests of employers, workers and the state helps explain both similarities and differences in industrial relations developments in the two countries. In doing so it demonstrates the importance of what appear to be small differences between the cases.  The ability of the interaction approach to account for similarities and differences across three time periods in two most similar countries suggests that it may have broader application in cross-national comparison and that may provide the basis for a more general reassessment of the relationship between the contemporary wave of globalisation and industrial relations institutions and outcomes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Globalisation;Industrial Relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buildings and Hecke Algebras</field><field name="creator">Parkinson, James William</field><field name="description">We establish a strong connection between buildings and Hecke algebras through the study of two algebras of averaging operators on buildings.

In the affine case, it is shown how the building gives rise to a combinatorial and geometric description of the Macdonald spherical functions, and of the centers of affine Hecke algebras.      The algebra homomorphisms from A into the complex numbers are studied, and some associated spherical harmonic analysis is conducted.

Moral reasoning and liberalism-conservatism are consistently found to be related but the resultant interpretation that liberals are more moral-cognitively advanced than conservatives has been challenged by Emler and his colleagues who argue that the DIT is liberally biased.  Subsequent research on this issue has produced a methodological quagmire that this thesis aims to proceed beyond.      The specific aim of this thesis is to test several different (or competing) hypotheses purporting to explain the relationship between Kohlbergian moral reasoning and liberalism-conservatism.  These are (1) that liberals are more morally advanced than conservatives; (2) that "advanced moral reasoning" is merely social presentation; (3) that moral reasoning is separately constrained by moral development and conservatism; (4) that moral development and liberalism represent distinct paths to postconventional reasoning preference; (5) that moral reasoning differences between liberals and conservatives are broader than usually thought; (6) that the political content of moral issues affects moral reasoning differences between liberals and conservatives; and (7) that moral reasoning instruments have exaggerated moral reasoning differences between liberals and conservatives.    Study 1 found that a non-ipsative, indirect moral reasoning measure was correlated with liberalism-conservatism thus disconfirming hypotheses 2 and 7.  Additionally, hypothesis 5 was not supported by several DIT findings.  Opposing hypotheses 2 and 6, Study 2 found that a conservative version of the DIT was correlated with liberalism-conservatism although a potential methodological issue arose.  Study 3 developed an objective measure of moral comprehension, broader in scope than previous moral comprehension measures, which demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity.  Employing this measure, Study 4 found that moral comprehension and liberalism were weakly correlated and that they independently predicted moral reasoning, although their interaction did not.  Together, these findings provide some support to hypotheses 1 and 4 but not hypotheses 3 and 6.    Overall these findings reveal that liberals appear more moral-cognitively advanced than conservatives but, compared to conservatives, liberals appear to indicate preference for advanced moral reasoning earlier in their moral-cognitive development.  This latter mechanism appears stronger and suggests that, although DIT scores are still somewhat reflective of moral-cognitive development, the DIT&#65533;s estimate of liberals&#65533; moral-cognitive development is elevated.  Future research can continue to explore these hypotheses (e.g., via longitudinal and/or "faking" studies) and, in so doing, further clarify the relationship between Kohlbergian moral reasoning and liberalism-conservatism.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moral Reasoning;Defining Issues Test;Liberal;Conservative;Political Orientation;Moral Comprehension</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dietary energy density and the performance characteristics of growing pigs</field><field name="creator">Henman, David James</field><field name="description">Optimal nutritional management of growing pigs is constrained by lack of quantitative information on the response of animals between 30 and 110 kg live weight to dietary energy content. Under 'ideal' conditions modern genotypes appear to adjust feed intake to maintain a constant DE intake over a much wider range of dietary energy concentrations than previously thought (Mullan et al, 1998). However, under commercial pen conditions, voluntary feed intake is lower, pigs respond in terms of both growth rate and feed conversion to dietary DE density considerably above the levels currently thought to maximise biological and economic responses. The present study was designed to provide information on the response of growing pigs to dietary energy content under ideal and commercial housing conditions for two growth periods 30-60kg liveweight and 60-100kg liveweight.  The results of the pigs kept under individual (ideal) housed conditions were consistent with the literature in that they adjusted their voluntary feed intake with digestible energy density to maintain a constant energy intake. The results of the pigs kept in groups (commercial) housing conditions tended to increase their daily energy intake as the energy density of the feed increased. This increase in energy intake improved the growth rate of the pigs and increased the fat deposition of those pigs. Economic analysis of the experiments involving pigs in groups indicates that formulating diets to a least cost per megajoule of digestible energy is not the most profitable point to set the digestible energy density. Modelling programs need to be used to determine where the least cost per unit of growth of the pig occurs. This is the most economical digestible energy density to formulate too. This will have major impact on the cost of production of piggery operations as the cost of energy is the single most important parameter in the cost of producing a pig.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">growing pigs;dietary energy density;housing;economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the use of a web-based virtual patient to support learning through reflection</field><field name="creator">Chesher, Douglas</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the support of learning through reflection, in the context of medical students and practitioners, working through a series of simulated consultations involving the diagnosis and management of chronic illness.    A model of the medical consultative process was defined, on which a web-based patient simulation was developed. This simulation can be accessed over the Internet using commonly available web-browsers. It enables users to interact with a virtual patient by taking a history, examining the patient, requesting and reviewing investigations, and choosing appropriate management strategies. The virtual patient can be reviewed over a number of consultations, and the patient outcome is dependant on the management strategy selected by the user.    A second model was also developed, that adds a layer of reflection over the consultative process. While interacting with the virtual patient users are asked to formulate and test their hypotheses. Simple tools are included to encourage users to record their observations and thoughts for further learning, as well as providing links to web-based library resources. At the end of each consultation, users are asked to review their actions and indicate whether they think their actions were critical, relevant, or not relevant to the diagnosis and management of the patient in light of their current knowledge. Users also have the opportunity to compare their activity to their peers or an expert in the case under study.     Three formal cycles of evaluation were undertaken during the design and development of the software. A number of clinicians were involved in the initial design to ensure there was an appropriate structure that matched clinical practice. Formative evaluation was conducted to review the usability of the application, and based on user feedback a number of changes were made to the user interface and structure of the application. A third, end user, evaluation was undertaken using a single case concerning the diagnosis and management of hypertriglyceridaemia in the context of Type 1B Glycogen Storage Disease. This evaluation involved ten medical students, five general practitioners and two specialists. The evaluation involved observation using a simplified think-aloud, as well as administration of a questionnaire.     Users were engaged by the simulation, and were able to use the application with only a short period of training. Usability issues still exist with respect to the processing of natural language input, especially when asking questions of the virtual patient. Until such time that natural language recognition is able to provide satisfactory performance, alternative, list-based, methods of interaction will be required.    Evaluation involving medical students, general practitioners, and specialist medical practitioners demonstrated that reflection can be supported and encouraged by providing appropriate tools, as well as by judiciously interrupting the consultative process and providing time for reflection to take place. Reflection could have been further enhanced if users had been educated on reflection as a learning modality prior to using SIMPRAC. Further work is also required to improve the simulation environment, improve the interfaces for supporting reflection, and further define the benefits of using this approach for medical education and professional development with respect to learning outcomes and behavioural change.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical education;virtual patient simulation;reflection;continuing medical education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical Studies of Crystallisation in Hard Sphere Systems</field><field name="creator">Wild, Robert John</field><field name="description">The primary focus of this work is to develop an understanding of crystallisation in hard sphere systems. The thesis is presented in two parts.   The first section is an investigation of the liquid/crystal interface at equilibrium using molecular dynamical simulations. The objective is to understand how the interface might bridge between the disordered and ordered states in liquid/crystal environments. Topological measures of structure are used to investigate whether any precursor structures are present in the liquid phase, close to the interface, that would allow transition from disorder to order. This differs from other work where simpler measures of structure, classifying phases into either liquid or crystal, are used. The results indicate that the liquid/crystal interface of a hard sphere system is very narrow and no readily observable structures were found that extended past the width of the equilibrium interface.  The second section of the thesis is a theoretical study of growth kinetics in hard sphere systems using density functional theory. The kinetics in a fixed volume are examined with a single conserved order parameter. The work is extended incorporating both conserved particle and non-conserved structure dynamics. The kinetics of growth are examined and it is shown that the small initial crystals are quickly isolated from the higher pressure of the surrounding system through the development of a depletion zone.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crystallisation;Hard Sphere Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ocean Colour Remote Sensing of Flood Plumes in the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Ametistova, Lioudmila</field><field name="description">The objective of the research reported in this thesis was to develop a technique to monitor the  dynamics of sediments and nutrients entering the coastal ocean with river plumes associated  with high intensity low frequency events (e.g. floods), using ocean colour remote sensing. To  achieve this objective, an inverse bio-optical model was developed, based on analytical and  empirical relationships between concentrations of optically significant substances and remote  sensing of water-leaving radiance. The model determines concentrations of water-colouring  substances such as chlorophyll, suspended sediments, and coloured dissolved organic matter,  as well as the values of optical parameters using water-leaving radiances derived from the  Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). To solve atmospheric correction in  coastal waters, the aerosol type over clear waters is transferred to adjacent turbid water pixels.  The vicinity of the Herbert River, central Great Barrier Reef zone, Australia, was used as a  case study for the application of the algorithm developed. The satellite ocean colour technique  was successfully validated using sea-truth measurements of water-colouring constituents  acquired in the area during various seasons throughout 2002-2004. A high correlation  between chlorophyll and dissolved organic matter was found in the coastal waters of the  region, and when the bio-optical model was constrained to make chlorophyll a function of  dissolved organic matter, the relationship between in situ and satellite-derived data was  substantially improved. With reliable retrieval of the major water-colouring constituents, the  technique was subsequently applied to study fluxes of particulate and dissolved organic and  inorganic matter following a flood event in the Herbert River during the austral summer of  1999.  Extensive field observations covering a seasonal flood in the Herbert River in February 2004  revealed high sediment and nutrient exports from the river to the adjacent coastal waters  during the flood event. Due to rapid settling, the bulk of the sediment-rich influx was  deposited close inshore, while the majority of nutrients exported from the river were  consumed by phytoplankton in a relatively small area of the coastal ocean. With the help of  ocean colour remote sensing, it was demonstrated that river-borne sediments and nutrients  discharged by a typical flood in the Herbert River are mostly precipitated or consumed within  the first 20 km from the coast and therefore are unlikely to reach and possibly affect the midshelf  coral reefs of this section of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Remote sensing;Herbert River;Great Barrier Reef;Bio-optical model;Monitoring</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independent Expert Reports and Takeovers</field><field name="creator">Bugeja, Martin</field><field name="description">Target firms in Australian takeovers are required to obtain an independent assessment of the offer price in situations where the Corporations Law considers the bidder has a superior bargaining position.  The intention of this requirement is to protect target shareholders from being offered a lower takeover premium.  The only empirical study of expert reports, Eddey (1993), is consistent with expert reports achieving their purpose, as the results indicate no difference in target firm premiums in offers with and without an expert report.  Eddey also reports that a revision in offer price is more likely where an expert indicates the bid is &#65533;not fair and reasonable.&#65533;    Using all takeovers from 1990 to 2000, this thesis aims to re-examine and substantially extend the findings in Eddey.  As the sample includes all bids, irrespective of the form of payment consideration, the thesis will assess whether the results in Eddey can be extrapolated from cash-based bids to all takeover bids.  In addition, the analysis will extend Eddey&#65533;s results by investigating whether expert reports result in a higher probability of a revision in offer price relative to takeovers without an expert report.    This study also investigates the impact of the expert report on bidder announcement abnormal returns and examines the returns to both bidders and targets when the expert report is released.  This will add to the limited current knowledge on the impact of expert reports on the capital market.    This thesis also tests the validity of public criticisms of expert independence.  Firstly, experts have been publicly criticised on the basis that they are not independent from the target firm.  It has been suggested that such experts will be more likely to provide an opinion that agrees with the recommendation of target directors.  Secondly, it has been alleged that experts who are also the target auditor provide their reports at a lower fee by cross-subsidising the reports&#65533; preparation from other fees received from the client.  The concern with this practice is that these reports may be of lower quality.  This criticism is tested by developing an expert fee model.  This fee model is then used to assess whether, similar to evidence in the auditing field, &#65533;quality&#65533; experts earn a fee premium.    The results indicate that the need for an expert report does not affect bidder abnormal returns at either the announcement of the takeover or release of the expert report.  On the other hand, target shareholders earn significantly lower abnormal returns at the announcement of a bid where an expert report is required.  This result is inconsistent with Eddey (1993) and raises doubt over whether experts prevent bidders from using their superior bargaining position to offer target shareholders a lower premium.  Consistent with Eddey, the probability of an alteration in offer price is greater where an adverse expert opinion is given.  The results also show that the presence of an expert increases the likelihood of a bid revision relative to takeovers in general.    Target abnormal returns on the release of an expert report are positive and significant, irrespective of the type of expert opinion.  This result however, is sensitive to any association between the author of the report and the target.  In the case that an expert discloses any prior or current business dealings with the target, abnormal returns are insignificant.  The conclusion from this finding is that the market perceives expert reports prepared by an associate of the target as lacking credibility.  In light of this lack of information content it is recommended corporate regulators review those experts permitted to prepare reports.    Contrary to the published criticisms, experts who have business dealings with the target are just as likely as other experts to provide an opinion that agrees with the recommendation of directors.  The tests of a fee reduction by experts associated to the target indicate significant lower fees where the expert is the target auditor.  Further analysis shows this result is only significant where the auditor is also a non-Big 6/5 firm.  These auditors are also found to provide reports that are significantly shorter than other experts, suggesting the cut in fee is achieved by reducing the amount of effort.    The results also find that the top two experts, Grant Samuels and Associates and Price Waterhouse Coopers, earn a fee premium over other experts.  The finding of a fee premium for a large accounting firm indicates that such firms may receive a premium for both auditing and non-audit services.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Takeovers;independent experts;mergers;audit independence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and physical properties of  surfactant and mixed surfactant films at the  solid-liquid interface.</field><field name="creator">Blom, Annabelle</field><field name="description">The adsorbed layer morphology of a series of surfactants under different  conditions has been examined primarily using atomic force microscopy (AFM).

The present two-stage study, using quantitative and qualitative data collection methods, undertook to investigate the extent to which selected personality characteristics influenced nonresident fathers&#65533; continued engagement with children.  The study initially collected demographic and personal data from two hundred and sixty nonresident fathers throughout Australia.  This first stage of data collection focussed on fathers&#65533; experience of the separation and their subsequent frequency and level of contact and their level of involvement with children.  It included several multi-item variables, which measured nonresident fathers&#65533; relationships with former partners and children, their adjustment to their new parental role, their role satisfaction and role strain.  It also included measures of fatherhood salience, nonresident fathers&#65533; parental authority within the separated family, their satisfaction with that authority, their attitude to child support and their perception of resident mothers&#65533; attitude to contact.  It also administered abridged Sensitivity and Impulsivity scales devised by Eysenck (1969).  At the second stage of the study, one hundred and thirty-five of these fathers participated in an interview.  One hundred and twenty of them completed a personality questionnaire, which measured scores on the four folk scales of Responsibility, Socialization, Self-control and Good Impression, taken from the California Psychological Inventory.  The study found Socialization was the only selected personality characteristic to be significantly associated with nonresident fathers&#65533; engagement with children.  All four folk scales were positively correlated with nonresident fathers&#65533; role adjustment, which was significantly associated with nonresident fathers&#65533; contact and was part of the model best predicting their involvement with children.  Results showed that nonresident fathers&#65533; scores on the Sensitivity measure were negatively associated with role adjustment.    Most nonresident fathers in the study had frequent contact with children but limited involvement with them.  They reported having little scope to share in parental decision making or to be involved in children&#65533;s schooling.  The study found fatherhood salience, role adjustment, parental authority and attitude to child support to be positively associated with  engagement.  It showed interparental hostility, interparental conflict and nonresident fathers&#65533; role strain to be negatively correlated with engagement.  The study also found that dissatisfaction with parental authority within the separated family, role strain and a negative attitude to child support were associated with ongoing interparental hostility.   Qualitative data confirmed nonresident fathers&#65533; common experience of being marginalised within the family.  They also revealed that many participants went to great lengths to maintain some parental relevancy for their children, despite social and legal systems tending to impede them from meeting parental responsibilities and caring for their children.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nonresident fathers;access;contact;engagement;personality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of herbal medicines on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Warfarin in healthy subjects</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Xuemin</field><field name="description">Herbal medicines are widely used in our community. A survey of Australian consumers indicated that 60% had used complementary and/or alternative medicines in the past year with the majority not informing their doctor that they were using herbal medicines. Little is known about the potentially serious consequences of interactions between herbal and conventional medicines. Warfarin has an important role in treating people with heart disease, yet it has a narrow therapeutic range, is highly bound to plasma proteins, and is metabolised by cytochrome P450. This creates the potential for life-threatening interactions with other drugs and foods leading to excessive bleeding. Hence, warfarin is one of the most frequently investigated drugs for interaction studies. Early clinical reports suggest that there exists the potential for an interaction between warfarin and four herbal medicines: St John&#65533;s wort, ginseng, ginkgo and ginger. However, these herb-drug combinations have never been conclusively studied.   The two clinical studies conducted as part of this research had an identical study design. Twenty-four healthy male subjects were recruited into the two separate studies. This was an open label, three-way crossover randomised study in twelve healthy male subjects, who received a single 25 mg dose of warfarin alone or after 14 days pre-treatment with St John&#65533;s wort, or 7 days pre-treatment with ginseng. Dosing with St John&#65533;s wort or ginseng was continued for 7 days after administration of the warfarin dose in study I or who received a single 25 mg dose of warfarin alone or after 7 days pre-treatment with recommended doses of ginkgo or ginger from single ingredient products of known quality. Dosing with ginkgo or ginger was continued for 7 days after administration of the warfarin dose in study II. Platelet aggregation, international normalised ratio (INR) of prothrombin time, warfarin enantiomer protein binding, warfarin enantiomer concentrations in plasma and S-7-hydroxywarfarin concentration in urine were measured in both studies. Statistical comparisons were made using ANOVA and 95% confidence interval (CI) for mean value and 90% CI for geometric mean ratio value are reported. n study I, the mean (95% CI) apparent clearance of S-warfarin after warfarin alone or with St John&#65533;s wort or ginseng were, respectively, 198 (174 &#65533; 223) ml/h, 269 (241 &#65533; 297) ml/h and 220 (201 &#65533; 238) ml/h. The respective apparent clearances of R-warfarin were 110 (94 &#65533; 126) ml/h, 142 (123 &#65533; 161) ml/h and 119 (106 &#65533; 131) ml/h. The mean ratio of apparent clearance for S-warfarin was 1.29 (1.16-1.46) and for R-warfarin was 1.23 (1.11-1.37) when St John&#65533;s wort was co-administered. The mean ratio of AUC0-168 of INR was 0.79 (0.70 - 0.95) when St John&#65533;s wort was co-administered. The urinary excretion ratio of S-7-hydroxywarfarin after administration of warfarin alone was 0.04 (0.03 &#65533; 0.06) mg/h and there was no significant difference following treatment with either St John&#65533;s wort 0.03 (0.02 &#65533; 0.04) mg/h or ginseng 0.03 (0.02 &#65533; 0.04) mg/h. The ratio of geometric means for S-7-hydroxywarfarin UER was 0.82 (0.61-1.12) for St John&#65533;s wort, and 0.68 (0.50-0.91) for ginseng. St John&#65533;s wort and ginseng did not affect the apparent volumes of distribution or protein binding of warfarin enantiomers. In study II, the mean (95% CI) apparent clearance of S-warfarin after warfarin alone, with ginkgo or ginger were 189 (167 &#65533; 210) ml/h, 200 (173 &#65533; 227) ml/h and 201 (171 &#65533; 231) ml/h, respectively. The respective apparent clearances of R-warfarin were 127 (106 &#65533; 149) ml/h, 126 (111 &#65533; 141) ml/h and 131 (106 &#65533; 156) ml/h. The mean ratio of apparent clearance for S-warfarin was 1.05 (0.98 -1.12) and for R-warfarin was 1.00 (0.93 -1.08) when co-administered with ginkgo. The mean ratio of AUC0-168 of INR was 0.93 (0.81 -1.05) when co-administered with ginkgo. The mean ratio of apparent clearance for S-warfarin was 1.05 (0.97 -1.13) and for R-warfarin was 1.02 (0.95 -1.10) when co-administered with ginger. The mean ratio of AUC0-168 of INR was 1.01 (0.93 -1.15) when co-administered with ginger. The urinary excretion ratio (UER) of S-7-hydroxywarfarin after administration of warfarin alone was 0.04 (0.03 &#65533; 0.05) mg/h and there was no significant difference following treatment with either ginkgo 0.04 (0.03 &#65533; 0.04) mg/h or ginger 0.03 (0.02 &#65533; 0.04) mg/h. The ratio of geometric means for S-7-hydroxywarfarin UER was 1.07 (0.69-1.67) for ginkgo, and 1.00 (0.64-1.56) for ginger. Ginkgo and ginger did not affect the apparent volumes of distribution or protein binding of either S-warfarin or R-warfarin.   In conclusion, St John&#65533;s wort significantly induced the apparent clearance of both S-warfarin and R-warfarin, which in turn resulted in a significant reduction in the pharmacological effect of rac-warfarin.  Ginseng, ginkgo and ginger at recommended doses affect neither clotting status, nor the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of either S-warfarin or R-warfarin in healthy subjects.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Warfarin;St John's Wort;Ginseng;ginger;herb-drug interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PIEZOELECTRIC ACTUATOR DESIGN OPTIMISATION FOR SHAPE CONTROL OF SMART COMPOSITE PLATE STRUCTURES</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Van Ky Quan</field><field name="description">Shape control of a structure with distributed piezoelectric actuators can be achieved through optimally selecting the loci, shapes and sizes of the piezoelectric actuators and choosing the electric fields applied to the actuators. Shape control can be categorised as either static or dynamic shape control. Whether it is a transient or gradual change, static or dynamic shape control, both aim to determine the loci, sizes, and shapes of piezoelectric actuators, and the applied voltages such that a desired structural shape is achieved effectively.   This thesis is primarily concerned with establishing a finite element formulation for the general smart laminated composite plate structure, which is capable to analyse static and dynamic deformation using non-rectangular elements. The mechanical deformation of the smart composite plate is modelled using a third order plate theory, while the electric field is simulated based on a layer-wise theory. The finite element formulation for static and dynamics analysis is verified by comparing with available numerical results. Selected experiments have also been conducted to measure structural deformation and the experimental results are used to correlate with those of the finite element formulation for static analysis. In addition, the Linear Least Square (LLS) method is employed to study the effect of different piezoelectric actuator patch pattern on the results of error function, which is the least square error between the calculated and desired structural shapes in static structural shape control.    The second issue of this thesis deals with piezoelectric actuator design optimisation (PADO) for quasi-static shape control by finding the applied voltage and the configuration of piezoelectric actuator patch to minimise error function, whereas the piezoelectric actuator configuration is defined based on the optimisation technique of altering nodal coordinates (size/shape optimisation) or eliminating inefficient elements in a structural mesh (topology optimisation). Several shape control algorithms are developed to improve the structural shape control by reducing the error function. Further development of the GA-based voltage and piezoelectric actuator design optimisation method includes the constraint handling, where the error function can be optimised subjected to energy consumption or other way around. The numerical examples are presented in order to verify that the proposed algorithms are applicable to quasi-static shape control based on voltage and piezoelectric actuator design optimisation (PADO) in terms of minimising the error function.   The third issue is to use the present finite element formulation for a modal shape control and for controlling resonant vibration of smart composite plate structures. The controlled resonant vibration formulation is developed. Modal analysis and LLS methods are also employed to optimise the applied voltage to piezoelectric actuators for achieving the modal shapes. The Newmark direct time integration method is used to study harmonic excitation of smart structures. Numerical results are presented to induce harmonic vibration of structure with controlled magnitude via adjusting the damping and to verify the controlled resonant vibration formulation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shape Control; Piezoelectric Actuators/Sensors; Composite Plates; Finite Element Analysis; Structural Optimisation; Sensitivity Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transition from foraging to farming in northeast China</field><field name="creator">Jia, Wei Ming</field><field name="description">This thesis is using a framework to analyse the process of transition from foraging to farming in northeast China.

Disease afflicts humans. It afflicts animals. It afflicts plants. People refer to disease in their everyday conversation. Newspapers comment upon it. Parliaments enact legislation regarding it. Novelists write about it. Artists depict it. Physicians, veterinary surgeons and agriculturalists seek to combat it. Insurance companies offer reimbursement against it. Anthropologists study it. Philosophers debate its nature, and dictionaries define it. Disease looms large in human consciousness.    One might presume that, since disease is so important in daily life, human beings would know exactly what they mean by it. Most people seem to believe instinctively that they understand the nature of disease, and that their ideas about it coincide with other people&#65533;s ideas. The definition of disease therefore arouses little controversy in everyday conversation. People use the word disease as readily as they use the words spade, or table or nose. They suggest, when they joke that somebody calls a spade a spade, that the nature of the implement used to dig the garden is so obvious that it requires no further definition. Similarly with a table or a nose. They might debate how many legs a table must have, but&#65533;regardless of the answer&#65533;rarely deny that it is a table; whilst every human must surely know what a nose is. This high level of agreement about so many commonly used terms perhaps creates an assumption that the meaning of disease is equally obvious and requires no further analysis.  Is this, however, really the case?    Disease is a somewhat less concrete phenomenon than is a spade or a table or a nose. Its existence, most would agree, is incontrovertible, but its nature is less clear. It is something that seems to befall people and animals and plants. It rarely serves any useful purpose. It often carries dire implications. It is something that most of us would prefer not to have, but rarely succeed in avoiding. It commonly comes unannounced and at inconvenient times. It usually causes distress, but not always. It can have a fatal outcome. Some people appear more prone to it that others. It sometimes sweeps through whole populations producing social devastation, but its manifestations vary. Some diseases affect a person&#65533;s whole body, others merely a part of the body; some affect some parts of the body, others other parts. Some diseases only affect humans, whereas others affect both humans and animals. Some spread from animals to humans, others from humans to humans, and others still do not appear to spread at all. Some diseases affect plants, and few that affect plants seem to affect humans, but some humans can acquire diseases when they come into contact with plants that appear to have no diseases. Any reasonable analysis of the nature of disease must account for all these aspects and many others also.    The nature of disease is a topic that has attracted the attention of physicians, scientists and philosophers over millennia. The close association that existed between medicine and philosophy in the classical Egyptian, Palestinian and Greek eras ensured that scholars who flourished in those societies examined the nature of disease. Comparable developments occurred in classical Indian and Chinese civilizations. The natural philosophers of Renaissance and post-Renaissance Europe divided into competing schools of thought over the nature of disease. More recent years have witnessed an enormous flourishing of physicians, pathologists, and agriculturalists who study aspects of disease that relate to their individual disciplines. Most of these researchers have, however, examined ever-narrower aspects of specific diseases&#65533;such as manifestations, mechanisms and causes&#65533;rather than the generic nature of the phenomenon.    Some contemporary philosophers, on the other hand, have become interested in general aspects of the topic. They have proposed a number of novel ideas and reached some stimulating conclusions, although they can hardly yet claim to have reached a consensus. This lack of unanimity presumably implies that the issues involved require closer analysis if a formulation is to emerge that most of them can accept.    The object of the present thesis is to undertake such an analysis. It will start by outlining in this introduction the general background to the topic. It will then detail the more noteworthy of previously proposed theories about the nature of this phenomenon, classifying them according to their most prominent components, and assessing their several strengths and weaknesses. It will next discuss the specific philosophical issues of definition, causation, and explication in the biomedical context, before suggesting a comprehensive, but succinct, definition that acknowledges many older views about disease, encompasses current usage, and provides a theoretical base from which to work into the future. It will finally test the strengths and weaknesses of that definition to account for observed phenomena and to accommodate some former definitions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disease;Definition of disease;Explication of Disease</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The multiple roles of zinc finger domains</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Raina Jui Yu</field><field name="description">Zinc finger (ZnF) domains are prevalent in eukaryotes and play crucial roles in mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. This Thesis focuses on the molecular details underlying interactions mediated by two ZnF domains.  The GATA-1 protein is vital for the development of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. Pertinent to the protein function is the N-terminal ZnF. In particular, this domain mediates interaction with DNA containing GATC motifs and the coactivator protein FOG. The importance of these interactions was illustrated by the findings in Chapter 3 that naturally occurring mutations identified in patients suffering from blood disorders affect the interaction of the N-terminal ZnF with either DNA (R216Q mutation) or FOG (V205M and G208S mutations).  In addition to the interaction FOG makes with GATA-1, it also interacts with the centrosomal protein TACC3. In Chapter 4, this interaction is characterised in detail. The solution structure of the region of FOG responsible for the interaction is determined using NMR spectroscopy, revealing that it is a true classical zinc finger, and characterisation of the interaction domain of TACC3 showed that the region is a dimeric coiled-coil. The FOG:TACC3 interaction appears to be mediated by a-helices from the two proteins. The data presented here represent some of the first described molecular details of how a classical ZnF can contact a protein partner. Interestingly, the a-helix used by the FOG finger to bind TACC3 is the same region utilised by DNA-binding classical zinc fingers to contact DNA.   In addition to the multiple roles played by ZnFs, this domain is also known for its robustness and versatility. In Chapter 5, incomplete ZnF sequences were assessed for its ability to form functional zinc-binding domains. Remarkably, CCHX sequences (in the context of BKLF finger 3) were able to form discrete zinc-binding domains and also, mediate both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. This result not only illustrates the robust nature of ZnFs, it highlights the need for expanding ZnF sequence criteria when searching for functional zinc-binding modules.  Together, the data presented here help further our understanding of zinc finger domains. Similar to the use of DNA-binding ZnFs in designer proteins, these data may start us on the path of designing novel protein-binding ZnFs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zinc fingers;protein-protein;protein-DNA;interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Meaningless Laugh:   Laughter in Japanese Communication</field><field name="creator">Hayakawa, Haruko</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the functions of laughter in Japanese communication. In orientation it contrasts markedly with previous studies and is the first study to have been based on such a large volume of data. In this paper I have focused on laughter as it serves to maintain a co-operative relationship between the participants in a conversation. I find that in the process of communication, people necessarily have to lay themselves open to others, and in doing so they become conscious of the barrier surrounding and protecting their field, i.e. their &#65533;inner world&#65533;. I hypothesise that in Japanese at least it is consciousness of this barrier that causes the occurrence of laughter in discourse. In other words, people laugh as part of the process of opening up to others, and also to show their intention to be co-operative. By laughing, people are either confirming that they belong to the same in-group, or they are pretending to belong to the same in-group in order to show co-operation.  In my model, laughter is classified:  A: Joyful laughter for identifying with the in-group B: Balancing laughter for easing tension C: Laughter as a cover-up.  A is also divided into 3 subcategories, B into 3, and C into 2 according to the subject of the utterance and the direction of movement into the protective barrier.

Previous studies of respiration in operatic singing have not taken into account the professional performer&#65533;s ability to differentiate at will between rehearsal and performance modes of singing. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the differences between singing &#65533;with intention to communicate&#65533; (as if performing) and singing &#65533;technically&#65533; (as if in rehearsal). The hypothesis is that this specified change of condition would change the respiratory patterns employed by the singers. Estimation of respiratory patterns was obtained using magnetometers. Performance singing was labelled &#65533;IC&#65533; (intention to communicate). Rehearsal singing was labelled &#65533;T&#65533; (technical) and also included &#65533;TL&#65533; (technical loud) and &#65533;TS&#65533; (technical soft). Each of the five singers performed two tasks (a free choice aria in Italian, and a set song). Only intra-subject analysis was used. One thousand and one breaths were analysed. These were then matched, so that only complete musical phrases (sung six times by the same singer) were compared with each other. Seven hundred and sixty-two matched phrases were analysed in this way. Measured variables were initiation lung volume (ILV), termination lung volume (TLV), the amount of lung volume expired (LVE), %VC released per second (Flow), the expiratory time (Te), and inspiratory time (Ti). Sound pressure level (SPL) was measured. This study also examined the ability of experienced listeners to distinguish between the T and IC performances from DAT recordings. Findings show that in comparison with T singing, IC singing used more air, with a greater percentage of vital capacity expired per second, but without a simple association with sound pressure level or expiratory time. Listeners were able to distinguish IC from T performances, demonstrating a perceived difference in the quality of the vocal output. These results demonstrate that performance intention to communicate, compared to rehearsal, results in a measurable difference in respiratory parameters, and therefore needs to be specified in future research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operatic Singing;Respiration;Emotional Expression;Intention to Communicate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long-Range Imaging Radar for Autonomous Navigation</field><field name="creator">Brooker, Graham Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the theoretical and practical implementation of a long-range  high-resolution millimetre wave imaging radar system to aid with the navigation and  guidance of both airborne and ground-based autonomous vehicles. To achieve true  autonomy, a vehicle must be able to sense its environment, comprehensively, over a  broad range of scales. Objects in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle must be  classified at high resolution to ensure that the vehicle can traverse the terrain. At  slightly longer ranges, individual features such as trees and low branches must be  resolved to allow for short-range path planning. At long range, general terrain  characteristics must be known so that the vehicle can plan around difficult or  impassable obstructions. Finally, at the largest scale, the vehicle must be aware of the  direction to its objective.  In the past, short-range sensors based on radar and laser technology have been capable  of producing high-resolution maps in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle extending  out to a few hundred metres at most. For path planning, and navigation applications  where a vehicle must traverse many kilometres of unstructured terrain, a sensor  capable of imaging out to at least 3km is required to permit mid and long-range  motion planning. This thesis addresses this need by describing the development a  high-resolution interrupted frequency modulated continuous wave (FMICW) radar  operating at 94GHz.  The contributions of this thesis include a comprehensive analysis of both FMCW and  FMICW processes leading to an effective implementation of a radar prototype which  is capable of producing high-resolution reflectivity images of the ground at low  grazing angles. A number of techniques are described that use these images and some  a priori knowledge of the area, for both feature and image based navigation. It is  shown that sub-pixel registration accuracies can be achieved to achieve navigation  accuracies from a single image that are superior to those available from GPS.  For a ground vehicle to traverse unknown terrain effectively, it must select an  appropriate path from as long a range as possible. This thesis describes a technique to  use the reflectivity maps generated by the radar to plan a path up to 3km long over  rough terrain. It makes the assumption that any change in the reflectivity  characteristics of the terrain being traversed should be avoided if possible, and so,  uses a modified form of the gradient-descent algorithm to plan a path to achieve this.  The millimetre wave radar described here will improve the performance of  autonomous vehicles by extending the range of their high-resolution sensing  capability by an order of magnitude to 3km. This will in turn enable significantly  enhanced capability and wider future application for these systems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">millimetre wave radar;imaging;navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embedding research as core practice for teachers: a model for whole school teacher learning</field><field name="creator">Merritt, Llian</field><field name="description">This is a study of teacher professional development at the school level using teacher research as a strategy for both teacher professional learning and school change. A qualitative study was conducted to determine the conditions that would develop and sustain teachers researching their own practice in a culture of inquiry. Participant observation in one school over a two year period was used to investigate the issue of how to embed teacher research as a central feature of teachers&#65533; work.   As a result of working with teachers as they researched their practice I have developed a model to explain and understand the complexities of schools and their cultures. Teachers researching their practice provided the driving force in the interplay of the elements of the model and had the potential to change school culture.  Relationships, structures and processes are central to this model. Social and professional relationships between the teachers and the university partner developed and were supported by structures and processes. As the research continued these relationships changed and evolved. These relationships help develop a culture of inquiry in schools.   The school/university partnership in this study evolved from an initial symbiotic&#65533;cooperative partnership (in which I shared my expertise and supported the work of teachers) into a later organic&#65533;collaborative partnership (one based on mutual and shared goals and benefits). The existing team of four teachers and the allocation of time for them to meet provided the essential structures for the teachers to research their practice. The collective leadership style instigated by the school Principal provided important human and financial support for the development of inquiry cultures.   Collaboration and collegiality as forms of association enabled teachers to conduct research which challenged their individual and collective beliefs and assumptions about students&#65533; learning and their classroom practice. The content and form of teacher culture mediated the effects of teachers researching their practice. There are critical and transformational effects when teachers research their practice as part of their core work.  Introducing these teachers to research was not without its difficulties. There were events and factors in the school relating to relationships, structures and processes which hindered the development of teacher research in a culture of inquiry.   Because of the time frame of this study there is no evidence that school culture change is permanent. This could be the subject of future research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher research;professional development;school change;school and teacher;culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rethinking the Law of Letters of Credit</field><field name="creator">Corne, Charmian Wang</field><field name="description">The documentary letters of credit transaction is the most common method of  payment for goods in international trade. Its use has been considered so  important that it is referred to as the &#65533;lifeblood&#65533; of international commerce.  The purpose of this thesis is, through analysing the present regime of  documentary credit established under the The Uniform Customs and Practice for  Documentary Credits, 1993 Revision (&#65533;UCP&#65533;), to identify the rights and duties of  all parties in such transactions and the reasons for the frequent occurrence of  fraudulent activities associated with the documents required under the credits. It  identifies that the present system fails to either encourage or implement  substantial realisation of &#65533;reasonable care&#65533; or &#65533;good faith&#65533; on the part of the  banks, or realisation of the requirement of &#65533;good faith&#65533; from beneficiaries. As a  result, the independence principle has been left without substance, with resulting  huge opportunities for fraudsters to cheat on the documents and obtain payment  without the need to actually perform their duties to banks and buyers.  Such issues have become more acute against the background of an underlying  shift in the allocation of risk between the respective parties to letters of credit.  There has been a depreciation in the value of the primary document of title and  security held by the issue, the bill of lading, with the advent of container shipping.  As the letter of credit system is wholly dependent on the integrity of the  documents, it is being undermined by these developments. This has represented  a shift in the traditional scheme of risk allocation from the seller to the bank. In  practice, banks have taken countermeasures by insisting that applicants provide  other types of collateral, and by subjecting applicants to rigorous credit checks.  Thus, applicants ultimately have had to bear the brunt of costs associated with  this reallocation of risk. It will be demonstrated that the UCP does not  incorporate adequate or clear enough duties to be exercised on the part of  issuers toward applicants, and severely restricts the applicant&#65533;s right to sue if the  issuer has wrongfully honoured. Ultimately, a balance must be struck between  the desirability of protecting the applicant from the beneficiary&#65533;s fraud against the  benefits gained by maintaining the letter of credit as a commercial instrument and  business device. Obviously, there is public interest in protecting both of these  commercial values. This thesis advocates that a mechanism in addition to the  fraud exception must be introduced to safeguard the system against the  ramifications of these changes &#65533; increased fraud.  The thesis is structured into five chapters. Chapter 1 sets out to demonstrate the  circumstances under which the respective risks are borne by each participant in  the letter of credit transaction, and how developments in trade practice have  caused the burden of certain of these risks among the parties to a letter of credit  transaction to shift. Chapter 2, after briefly visiting the historical origins of the  letter of credit and the birth of the UCP, explores the implications of the  dominance of banking interests over the drafting and interpretation of the UCP,  how the UCP has in practice excluded the intrusion of other sources of law and  the general reluctance of courts to intervene by applying non-letter of credit  principles, the implication of the UCP&#65533;s assumption of the law in practice, the  resulting marginalisation of local laws, and the inequality in bargaining power  between banks and applicants that precludes a choice of law other than the  UCP. Chapter 3 explores the independence principle and question of  documentary compliance, why the system is ridden with non-compliant  documents and the lack of incentive and meaningful duty for the banks to check  for &#65533;red flags&#65533; that may indicate fraud on the documents or in the transaction. It  will be emphasised that documentary validity, rather than mere documentary  compliance, should be the focus under the letter of credit. Chapter 4 examines  the fraud exception to the independence principle, the typical high thresholds of  proof that applicants had to overcome to estopp payment, and explores recent  trends towards the gradual lowering of such thresholds. Finally, Chapter 5  considers practical measures and proposals for reform that would help to redress  the imbalance in the allocation of risk identified in the thesis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Letter of Credit</field><field name="subject">UCP</field><field name="subject">Fraud Exception</field><field name="subject">Independence Principle</field><field name="subject">International Trade</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Signs and symbols represented in Germanic, particularly Scandinavian, iconography between the Migration Period and the end of the Viking Age.</field><field name="creator">Hupfauf, Peter Rudolf Martin</field><field name="description">This research focuses on the analysis of pictorial images from objects of Germanic/early Scandinavian cultures in order to discriminate elements which are only applied for decorative reasons from those which also express symbolic values.    At the outset I introduced an interpretation of the terms &#65533;signs&#65533; and &#65533;symbols&#65533; in order to inform the reader to which extent these terms were applied.    It appeared that techniques, such as the geographical and chronological classi&#64257;cation, traditionally used by archaeologists and historians to analyse objects/artefacts, were not always suf&#64257;cient enough to gain all information which images may offer. Sometimes it seems to be dif&#64257;cult to determine if certain images shown on objects from early mediaeval, central and northern European origin, were created  as a space-&#64257;lling decoration only or if they held additional, probably symbolic, information as well.    I have investigated aspects from visual perception, as applied within the domains of psychology, visual art and design. The methods, as they are introduced in this thesis, can be used as a identi&#64257;cation scheme, applied on objects of great diversity. I have applied them on guldgubber (little embossed gold foils), bracteates and Gotland picture-stones.  Objects of great historical and geographic difference, as well as physical diversity, such as size and material were chosen purposely to create an overview of the symbolic expressions in Germanic/early Scandinavian artefacts and to test the extent of the identification method derived from the domain of visual perception.    A detailed analysis of sixty four guldgubber, found in Lundeborg, near Gudme, on the island of Fyn (Denmark), is placed in an appendix. An analysis of these objects appeared to be particularly interesting because it is not known what the purpose of guldgubber were to the present day.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signs;symbols;visual perception;guldgubber;bracteates;runes;Gotland picture stones</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic Narrative Illness Writing and the Quest for Healing</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Roslyn</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how narratives of illness become therapeutic narratives. The method is to engage closely with (mainly Australian) texts &#65533; literary accounts of illness &#65533; in order to identify key elements that effect a healing function (healing is distinguished from cure). Textual analysis is placed in the frame of medical information about the relevant conditions, and theoretical perspectives that provide a cultural and historical setting for illness writing.     Bio-medical discourse foregrounds the clinical process of diagnosis, investigation and treatment and relegates the personal meanings of illness to secondary place. The thesis explores ways in which the patient&#65533;s account provides an alternative discourse that supplements &#65533; and at times challenges &#65533; the medical discourse. Illness foregrounds the body, and illness narratives confront the reality of embodied experience. Illness that is chronic or incurable, ageing, physical and mental decline, and the inescapable prospect of death confront the patient with the need to find meaning in experience.    Narratives of illness may serve as ventilation, diversion or escape for the patient. They may provide practical help, information and consolation to family and carers, and others who suffer with the condition. These are valuable functions, but I argue that illness writing may embody more powerful therapeutic elements that transform and give meaning to the illness as part of the individual&#65533;s life story.   Key therapeutic functions identified are perversity, empowerment and transformation. Healing can begin with the empowerment of telling one&#65533;s story. Illness stories may challenge the stigma and the subordination associated with disease. They can affirm a sense of belonging and community where illness intersects with other forms of marginalization. Powerful illness narratives are often characterised by perversity, overturning the assumptions of dominant cultural discourses &#65533; including those that place authority with the medical practitioner and demand acquiescence from the patient. The most powerful therapeutic narratives transform the story of illness into a new story.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative;Theraputic;Illness;Writing;Healing;Medicine and Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journeys in Teacher Professional Development: Narratives of Four Drama Educators</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Michael</field><field name="description">Ongoing teacher professional development is an essential part of the wellbeing of the schooling system and successful outcomes for students. In the past, teacher professional development has been used to describe an often &#65533;top-down&#65533; method of training to meet systemic needs while taking little account of teacher's individual needs. This approach often conceptualises the teacher's life as a dichotomy with the personal and the private separated and unrelated.     In contrast, teacher professional development in this study is conceptualised as a journey that includes encouraging and discouraging turns. The journey is explored through the experiences of two primary and two secondary drama educators using Hargreaves and Fullan's (1992) organisers: teacher development as knowledge and skill development; teacher development as self understanding and teacher development as ecological change. The study focussed specifically on teachers of drama. Of the four educators two were beginning teachers, one primary and one secondary and two were experienced teachers, one primary and one secondary. The teachers were interviewed over twelve months. Narrative vignettes were developed from the interviews.    As the context for these teacher journeys was pivotal, the influences on the teaching of drama in New South Wales were investigated. This included an exploration of the major issues that have influenced the development of drama education both internationally and in Australia.     The concluding reflections from this study suggest that there is strong interaction between teachers' personal and professional lives. Teachers' personal circumstances, family histories and schooling backgrounds all have an important influence on their work as teachers. Significantly, issues related to drama education's history and current context reflected these teachers' classroom realities.    The teachers argue that they understand their professional development needs best and should have influence and ownership of their own professional development experiences. They found aspects of their tertiary training and teacher induction unsatisfactory. The two beginning teachers in this study struggled to survive the difficulties of their first year and both seriously considered leaving teaching.    The teachers describe self understanding through distinct phases of development that are made unique by each teacher's personality and context. The teachers saw subject identity and pedagogy as important to their professional identity. They report that times of crisis often lead to positive changes in their professional development journeys.    The ecology for these teachers was made up of several complex issues that are resistant to change and there were a number of impediments reported by the teachers that arise from their teaching ecologies. Two of the teachers have used a change of context to improve their satisfaction and confidence levels. Two teachers described beneficial experiences with supervisors in the school setting. If beneficial ecological change is to occur, education systems must attend to the needs of teachers and provide opportunities to teach unimpeded by systemic obstacles.    The study calls for changes in professional development and for the recognition of the multilayered nature of the teachers' journey. The study calls for a reconceptualisation of teacher professional development that recognises each teacher's ecology and self understanding. The renewed impetus for arts education will only be successful if the complexity of the teachers' journey is recognised and systemic obstacles are removed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drama education;teaching;professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Male Convict Sexuality in the Penal Colonies of Australia, 1820-1850</field><field name="creator">Gilchrist, Catie</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the moral and sexual anxieties produced by the transportation of male convicts to the penal colonies of Australia. My aims are twofold. First, this study argues that male sexuality lay at the heart of penal and colonial political discourse. The moral anxieties this both reflected and produced directly informed the penal administration of the convict population. This was implicit in the ways that convict bodies were ordered, surveilled, disciplined and accommodated. In this analysis the sexual and behavioural management of male prisoners is considered to be a fundamental dynamic within contemporary perceptions of criminal reformation. Second, this thesis examines the ways that these moral concerns permeated the wider colonial society. Free British settlers took their cultural cargo with them to the colonies. In the context of the penal colonies, they also had to negotiate the specific cultural and social implications of transportation. The moral concerns of colonial society were often played out around the politics of imperial transportation. This is examined through a consideration of the cultural meanings of colonial discourse and the many tensions that lay beneath it. During the slow transition from penal colony to respectable free society, colonists utilised and manipulated their moral and cultural anxieties in a number of political ways. This thesis argues that the moral and sexual anxieties of colonial society were both real and imagined. They informed a variety of discourses that linked the colonial periphery with the metropolitan centre in a relationship that was reciprocal but also antagonistic.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">convict sexuality;penal colonies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agnostic democracy : the decentred "I" of the 1990s</field><field name="creator">Kang, Kathryn Muriel</field><field name="description">The thesis concerns the dynamics during the 1990s of  political action by many groups of people, in what came to be  called the movement of movements. The activists, who held that  corporations were overstepping some mark, worked on alternative  arrangements for self-rule.  The thesis views the movement as micropolitics, using  concepts devised by Deleuze and Guattari. It sets out particulars of  the rhizomic make -up of the movement. A key point is that the  movement trains participants in decentred organisation, which  entails the forming of subject-groups as opposed to subjugated  groups. The thesis records how the movement was shaped by  earlier events in political action and thinking, especially from the  1960s on.  The movement had previously been read as a push for  absolute democracy (Hardt and Negri). The thesis shows that  reading to have been incomplete: the movement is, in part, a push  for agonistic democracy. More a practice than a form of rule,  agonistic democracy is found where state power is bent on not  moulding peoples into any unified polity. It is found where state  power fosters conflicted-self-rule, so that every citizen may engage  in the polity as a decentred "I".  The thesis throws light on relations between the movement  and the constitutionalist state. Part of the movement, while cynical about the existing form of state rule, wears a mask of obedience to  constituted authority. When one upholds the fiction of legitimate rule, one can use the fiction as a restraint on the cynics-in-power. The play creates a shadow social contract, producing detente within the polity and within the &#65533;I.&#65533; The thesis also reports on a search in mainstream cinema for some expression of the movement's dynamics. The search leads to a cycle of thrillers, set in a nonfiction frame story about a coverup  of gross abuse of state power.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">absolute democracy;agonistic democracy;cinema and politics;deleuzoguattarian concepts;political cynicism;social movements</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Participation in Ecotourism Development in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Leksakundilok, Anucha</field><field name="description">Ecotourism emerged as an alternative form of tourism in the 1990s to mitigate the faults of conventional (mass) tourism in meeting the needs of sustainable development. It has since become widespread in Thailand and is adopted not only in natural areas but also in rural communities. Key elements of ecotourism include a focus on ecological resources, sustainable management, environmental education, and community participation. Community participation receives a high degree of consideration among developers in Thailand. Ecotourism (ET) is seen to support this concept and is increasingly geared in the direction of social development. These trends form the backdrop to this study on community participation in ecotourism development.  The study applies a triangulation methodology to collect data by combining both qualitative and quantitative methods, combining theory and empirical study to analyse the context of how local people have participated in ecotourism development. The study pays particular attention to the practices and opinions of local people in recognition of communities' rights and responsibilities in controlling their own development. The empirical study was carried out at two levels, including a general survey by postal questionnaire (thirty-one respondents) and in-depth study in four areas (Umphang, Khiriwong, Sasom and Tha Madua). The research merges theory and practice into an analysis and empirical presentation throughout the study. Theoretically, the thesis is informed by political economy and political ecology approaches, together with the concept of participation in community development and tourism development models.  The research found that many communities achieve a degree of self-management in offering tourism services such as homestays, guided tours, cultural performances and cultural products. Community ecotourism organisations have been established in most communities in order to serve these new activities and to create a collective management process. Similarities in pattern and differentiation in practices among many communities were supported by different outside initiatives, developed according to similar aims and involving similar processes, but there is no uniformity or single model that is effectively applied to all communities. One significant barrier for local communities to take a major role in ecotourism is the access to ecotourism resources, which are mostly located in protected areas and are controlled by state agencies. This has led them to promote primarily their own cultural resources. Consequently, these practical changes have led to a transformation of the dominant development concept from Ecotourism (ET) to Community-based Ecotourism (CBET).  Results also show that most practices involve a level of cooperation in decision-making and action with other stakeholders who are in a better position to run tourism businesses. It is difficult for local communities to be empowered to control the whole situation, which is sometimes claimed to be the ultimate goal level of local participation. The demands of marketing and conflict in management among local people, together with the limitations in accessing natural resources, are the weakest points of and constraints on the communities. To deal with these limitations, communities try to create relationships with outsiders. To develop better management of community tourism, many communities rely on help and support from outside, especially from government agencies. This, however, impels the community to become dependent on outsiders. It is also hard for communities to generate a high level of income offering basic services, since there are many levels of demand from different types of ecotourists.  In summary, the main contributions of this study are: an understanding of community tourism in Thailand; the experiences of ecotourism development in the community from the leading case studies; directions, roles and responsibilities of actors and community organisations in particular; a range of options for community action in support of a more participatory process in ecotourism development. Last but not least is a set of recommendations for community-based ecotourism development from the level of policy application to practical improvement at the community level.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Participation;Ecotourism;Thailand;Community-based Ecotourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forensic Dentistry and its Application in Age Estimation from the Teeth using a Modified Demirjian System</field><field name="creator">Blenkin, Matthew Robert Barclay</field><field name="description">The estimation of age at time of death is often an important step in the identification of human remains.  If this age can be accurately estimated, it will significantly narrow the field of possible identities that will have to be compared to the remains in order to establish a positive identification.  Some of the more accurate methods of age estimation, in the juvenile and younger adult, have been based on the assessment of the degree of dental development as it relates to chronological age. The purpose of this current study was to test the applicability of one such system, the Demirjian system, to a Sydney sample population, and to develop and test age prediction models using a large sample of Sydney children (1624 girls, 1637 boys). The use of the Demirjian standards resulted in consistent overestimates of chronological age in children under the age of 14 years by as much as a mean of 0.97 years, and underestimates of chronological age in children over 14 years by as much as a mean of 2.18 years in 16 year-old females.  Of the alternative predictive models derived from the Sydney sample, those that provided the most accurate age estimates are applicable for the age ranges 2-14 years, with a coefficient of determination value of R-square=0.94 and a 95% confidence interval of &#65533;1.8 years. The Sydney based standards provided significantly different and more accurate estimates of age for that sample when compared to the published standards of Demirjian.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic odontology;age estimation;tooth development;Demirjian</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fate management: the real target of modern criminal law</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, William Brian</field><field name="description">There are a number of criminal law doctrines that evade the &#65533;doctrine of conjunction&#65533;1 &#65533; the precondition for culpability that the commission of a prohibited act be proven as accompanied by the intention to achieve the unlawful consequence.2  In general, they do so by ignoring, presuming, imputing or fictionally creating either actus reus or mens rea.  This thesis contends that these are techniques which are deliberately constructed to manage incidental harm3 and which, together with the inchoate or anticipatory offences, form a patchwork of methods to supervise the citizen&#65533;s choices to inflict risks.  It further argues that, by artificially converting secondary or incidental intention into malice, the doctrines disguise that modern criminal law has fate-management as its primary focus.   The thesis illustrates that there are significant gaps in this regime.  For instance, the inchoate offences can generally only address direct intention,4 and the outcome-based prohibitions cannot intercept fate.  The thesis also maintains that fictions such as objective and constructive liability offend the rule of law, in that they modify fact rather than place values on it.5   The work suggests that current criminal law is an interim step towards a fully subjective fate-managing law.  It proposes a radical revision to the existing approach: that the core criminal offence be &#65533;conscious disproportionate endangerment of the legal rights of others&#65533;.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">criminal law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incarnations: exploring the human condition through Patrick White&#65533;s Voss and Nikos Kazantzakis&#65533; Captain Michales.</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Jen</field><field name="description">Nikos Kazantzakis&#65533; Captain Michales is a freedom fighter in nineteenth century Crete.

These novels are each essentially explorations of the human experience. Read together, they highlight the commonest of human elements, most poignantly the need for communion; facilitating analysis of the individual and all our communities. Comparing the two novels also continues the process of each: examining the self both within and outside of the narratives, producing a new textual self, arising from both primary sources and the contextual breadth of such rewriting.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Patrick White;Nikos Kazantzakis;incarnation;human condition;nostos;comparative literature;food;hunger;body;soul;gender;nature;landscape;home;home-coming;god;religious experience;eucharist;myth;human being;hero;return;Crete;Australia;Voss</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bad Conscience: Nietzsche and Responsibility in Modernity</field><field name="creator">McGill, Justine</field><field name="description">Nietzsche is a name not often invoked in relation to the topic of responsibility. This study reveals, however, that his work engages vigorously with the problem of responsibility in modernity on both the conceptual and methodological levels. In the concept of &amp;quote;  bad conscience,&amp;quote;   Nietzsche presents a "  dangerous and multi-coloured "   alternative to the more monochrome varieties of self-consciousness which ground theories of individual responsibility in the work of other modern philosophers, such as Locke and Kant. The complexity of Nietzsche's approach to self-consciousness allows him to shed light on the range of interconnected practices of responsibility and irresponsibility that characterize modern life. It also raises pressing questions about the possibility and conditions of philosophy in modernity.    In grappling with "  bad conscience"   within the performative structures of his own thought, Nietzsche makes experimental use of methodological resources drawn from both the ancient and modern traditions of Western philosophy. In particular, this study examines Nietzsche's appropriation and "  reinterpretation"   of meditational methods which form part of the ancient philosophical "  art of living,"   and which re-emerge in altered form, in the work of Descartes. In Nietzsche's writings, such methods are used to provoke and reflect upon the passions of "  bad conscience,"   a dangerous practice which involves the risk of exacerbating this "  illness,"   but which also promises to give birth to new insight and skill in confronting the problem of responsibility in modernity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nietzsche;responsibility;Locke;Kant;self-consciousness;Descartes;meditation;bad conscience;passion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the 'Legal Rule' in Indonesian Law: environmental law and the reformasi of water management</field><field name="creator">Waddell, Sarah Kathleen</field><field name="description">In examining the role of the &#65533;legal rule&#65533; in Indonesian law, and in particular environmental law related to water quality management, this thesis questions the often expressed view that laws in Indonesia are sound, they merely fail to be implemented.  It proposes that this appraisal of the situation does not take a sufficiently deep assessment and that a cause for non-implementation lies within the drafting of the laws themselves.  It is argued that the ineffective system for environmental protection in Indonesia can be related to a failure to recognise the role of the &#65533;legal rule&#65533; in environmental law.      A proposition presented in this thesis is that the arrangements for environmental law making in Indonesia lacks a strong rule foundation and, for this reason, it is not capable of producing shared understandings by lawmakers about producing and reproducing environmental law as legal sub-system.  Another central proposition is that Indonesian environmental law has a form and style, which negates the role of the legal rule in environmental management and control.   Despite the changes brought by reformasi, the central position of the legal rule in environmental law and, indeed, the necessary rule foundation to the development of the legal system, has yet to achieve full recognition.  If this situation is related to the system of water quality management and pollution control in Indonesia, it can be seen that environmental improvement will not be achieved until underlying issues concerning the structure, form and style of environmental law making are addressed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reformasi;rule of law;legal rule;environment;water;HLA Hart;norm;obligation;sanction;enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Armageddon to Babylon: A sociological religious studies analysis of the decline of the Protestant prison chaplain as an institution with particular reference to the British and New South Wales prisons from the penitentiary to the present time.</field><field name="creator">Macarthur, Melvyn John</field><field name="description">Prisons have been a both a curiosity and an interest of mine at various times in my life. On occasions in my childhood I drove with my parents past the prison at Long Bay, in Sydney, New South Wales. It was a frightening, but fascinating place. My gaze was fixed on the grounds of the prison, both hoping and fearing to sight an escapee.   Later, as a tertiary social work student with an interest in the concept of social control, my thoughts were sometimes focused on the prison. However, it was not until the early part of 1993 that I actually entered a prison. I was then in the final year of my ordinand studies. I had elected, in one of the Field Education components of my studies, to spend time in the Chaplaincy Department of the Long Bay prison in Sydney.  The experience was a very significant one in that it was to raise difficult, but fascinating questions for me about the role of religion and the clergy in the prison.  During my placement at Long Bay I observed much which strongly suggested that religion and the clergy (chaplains) occupy a peripheral place in the prison system. I was also puzzled by the role of the chaplains, and here I refer to the Protestant chaplains, the only chaplains with whom I had contact. From the perspective of one trained in both social work and theology, it seemed to me that the chaplains were performing many of the same tasks, which one would expect to be performed by the prison welfare staff. In fact it was with difficulty that I could identify anything distinctively 'religious' in the role of the chaplain who, it seemed to me, functioned as something of a quasi welfare professional. It was also very apparent to me that the chaplains had a low profile in the prison; at Long Bay even the chaplaincy offices were outside the prison walls. The chaplains were like exiles, an image which stayed with me long after my placement in the prison had ended. These observations presented a stark contrast to the centrality of religion and the chaplain in the penitentiary, the fledgling prison of the nineteenth century.   The chapels in the contemporary prisons, some of which I had seen photographs of, were curiosities. The very prominence and size of the chapel in many of the prisons, both in New South Wales and Britain, many of which were built in the nineteenth century, symbolised the decline of religion from its position of centrality. Religion's function in the contemporary operations and theoretical underpinnings of the prison is marginal by comparison with the penitentiary. The prison chapel is now curiously anachronistic, being used extensively for secular purposes, such as the screening of movies, the holding of various meetings, and sometimes for sports. The liturgical and sacramental functions to which the chapels were dedicated are all but absent, at least for the Protestant chaplains.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chaplain;prisons</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictors of Auxillary Lymph Node Involvement in Screen Detected Breast Cancer</field><field name="creator">Chen, Wan Qing</field><field name="description">Background: Axillary lymph node dissection as routine part of breast cancer treatment has been questioned in relation to the balance between benefits and morbidity. The purpose of this study is to determine the association of tumor size, age and histological grade with axillary lymph node metastasis, to determine if some patients could be exempted from axillary dissection.   Methods: The data are derived from BreastScreen NSW, the government sponsored population-based breast screening program. In New South Wales (NSW) Australia between 1995 and 2002, 7,221 patients with invasive breast carcinoma were diagnosed and 5,290 patients were eligible for this study. The relationship between incidence of positive axillary lymph nodes and three study factors (tumor size, age and histological grade) was investigated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Logistic regression models were used to predict probability of axillary metastases.   Results: The incidence of axillary lymph node metastases was 28.6% (95% CI: 27.4%- 29.8%). Univariate analysis showed that age, tumor size and histological grade were significant predictors of axillary lymph node metastases (p&lt;0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified age, tumor size and histological grade remained as independent predictors (p&lt;0.0001). From multivariate analysis, patients with T1a (Less than or equal to 5mm) and grade I tumors regardless of age had 5.2% (95% CI: 1.2%- 9.3%) frequency of node metastases. Patients 70 years or older with grade I, T1a and T1b (6-10mm) tumors had 4.9% (95% CI: 3.2%- 7.5%) and 6.6% (95% CI: 5.3%-8.3%) predicted frequency of node metastases.   Conclusions: Tumor size, age and histological grade are predictors of axillary lymph node metastases. Routine axillary lymph node dissection could be avoided in some patient groups with a low frequency of involved lymph nodes if the benefits are considered to exceed the risks.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lymph node;breast cancer;detection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being Affected: The meanings and functions of Japanese passive constructions</field><field name="creator">Iwashita, Mami</field><field name="description">Amongst the multiple and diverse meanings and functions passive constructions hold, this study considers that the primary function of passives in Japanese is to portray an event from the point of view of an affected entity. The thesis identifies three types of affectedness in Japanese passive constructions: emotive affectedness, direct / physical affectedness, and objective affectedness. Emotive affectedness, often referred to as &#65533;adversative&#65533; meaning, has drawn attention from many researchers. It has been strongly associated in the past with the syntactic category called the &#65533;indirect passive&#65533;, but is actually also observed in many instances of the &#65533;direct passive&#65533;. Direct / physical affectedness is detected mainly in the construction here referred to as the &#65533;direct sentient passive&#65533;. This meaning is common in passives in many other languages, including English. The last type &#65533; objective affectedness &#65533; is primarily associated with &#65533;non-sentient passives&#65533;, more specifically with what is here called the &#65533;plain passive&#65533;.     Many previous researchers have claimed a complete and apparently transparent correlation between syntactic and semantic distinctions of the Japanese passive. The present study rejects these direct correlations. In analysing authentic data, it becomes evident that the correlation is much more subtle than has generally been recognised, and that is a matter of degree or continuum, rather than a discrete, black and white issue. To reflect this view, this study proposes separate sets of categories for syntactic and semantic distinctions.      The ultimate aim of this study is to reveal how Japanese passives are actually used in real contexts. In order to achieve this aim, detailed examination of authentic written and spoken data is conducted. Some findings of the data analysis in the present study contradict previous claims, such as the finding of a large proportion of passives with a non-sentient subject and very low frequency of occurrence of indirect passives.     This research also finds that, although more than half of the propositional meanings in the passive data examined are &#65533;negative&#65533;, a considerable number of passives still appear in a proposition with a neutral or positive meaning. Another prominent finding regarding propositional meaning is that it seems to be related to the degree of centrality of the passive subject to the event. With regard to the syntactic classification of passive, in particular, it is observed that the lower the degree of the centrality of the subject of the passive to the event, the greater the likelihood that the passive clause involves a negative proposition.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese;passive;syntax;semantics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of mental causation: An examination of the theories of Anomalous Monism and Direct Realism with regard to their proposals concerning the causal role of human mentality in the natural world.</field><field name="creator">Medlow, Sharon Denise</field><field name="description">One of the most interesting developments in recent psychological theorising has been a growing appreciation of the need for a viable theory of mental causation. Hitherto, the prospects for reconciling what seems to be the uniquely rational character of human thought and action with the non-rational mechanistic workings of the natural world have appeared to be limited or even illusory, and the pursuit of reconciliation of this sort has therefore formerly been dismissed as being either impossible of completion or inappropriate for contemplation. Much of the scepticism concerning the role of causal processes in human thought and action was dispelled, however, by the philosopher Donald Davidson, who argues that not only is human action capable of being caused by the actor&#65533;s thoughts and desires, but that only when such action is so caused, can it be rational.  Davidson&#65533;s proposal for the reconciliation of human rationality with causal necessitation is articulated in his theory of Anomalous Monism. According to this theory, there exists what may be termed an ontological-conceptual distinction between events themselves and the characters or properties that are attributed to events by human observers, and it is through recognition of this distinction that one discovers how mental events, that is, events that are amenable to description in the psychological vocabulary, are causally efficacious yet free from the constraints typically associated with the necessity and sufficiency of causal laws. Anomalous Monism, if it were workable, would therefore resolve the paradox according to which human mentality is at once integrated in, and yet unconstrained by, the mechanistic natural world, by demonstrating the compatibility of the facts of causation with the intuitions of folk psychology.  However, close examination of Anomalous Monism reveals it to rely on logically flawed anti-realist principles concerning the characters of events, properties and causation. It follows from this that the theory itself must be rejected, but the task that it was devised to undertake, the formulation of a viable theory of mental causation, need not be similarly discarded. Rather, what remains is the challenge of delineating an alternative theory, one that withstands logical scrutiny whilst addressing what is characteristic of human mental processes, and thereby what is characteristic of mental causation. The theory of Direct Realism that is derived from the broader philosophical realism of John Anderson provides the materials for meeting this challenge. According to Direct Realism, mental phenomena are relational situations obtaining between certain organisms (including humans) and their environments. As such, mental phenomena are included in the range of phenomena occurring in the natural world and they are therefore subject to all of its ways of working, including its deterministic mechanisms. The particular challenge that a Direct Realist theory of mental causation faces, that of demonstrating that relational situations can be causal, is revealed upon examination of the character of causation to be unproblematic. Furthermore, the seeming incompatibility between human rationality and natural necessitation is resolved when it is acknowledged that, rather than be an inherent feature of thought and action, logical structure is a characteristic of the natural environment that organisms are at times sensitive to, as revealed by its effects on the characters of their thoughts and actions.  Far from being remote or illusory, the prospects for reconciling human mentality with the causal mechanisms of the natural world are discovered in the present thesis to be favourable when a realist approach to the characters of both mental events and causation is adopted.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental causation;philosophy of mind;direct realism;Donald Davidson;causation;supervenience</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated study of group B streptococcus and human ureaplasmas : the paradigm shifts</field><field name="creator">Kong, Fanrong</field><field name="description">Group B streptococcus (GBS, S. agalactiae) and human ureaplasmas (U. parvumand U. urealyticum) are two clinically and phylogenetically related, potentialperinatal pathogens. Their relationships between genotypes and pathogenesis ofGBS and ureaplasma infection were still not well understood, one of the reason isthat both of them are still short of a very practical genotyping system. In the study,to solve the above problem we developed genotyping systems for the organisms (thesecond section). For human ureaplasmas, based on four genes/gene clusters (rRNAgene clusters, the elongation factor Tu genes, urease gene complexes and multiplebanded antigen genes), we designed many primer pairs suitable for developing species identification assays for the two newly established human ureaplasmaspecies (U. parvum and U. urealyticum). Further, based on the heterogeneity ofureaplasma multiple banded antigen gene (which contains species- and serovar-specific regions), we developed genotyping methods for each ureaplasma species.For GBS, based on three sets of molecular markers (capsular polysaccharidesynthesis gene clusters, surface protein antigen genes and mobile genetic elements),we developed a genotyping system. The primary evaluation of the genotypingsystems showed that the genotyping systems were practical alternative assays forthe conventional serotyping and they will be useful to further explore therelationships between genotypes and pathogenesis of GBS and ureaplasmainfection. In the study, we introduced novel data and tools into GBS and ureaplasmastudies especially from genomic- and bioinformatics-based molecular microbiology(the third section). For two newly established human ureaplasma species, based onthe U. parvum serovar-3 genome, and using the above four important genes/geneclusters, we exposed some interesting problems in the understanding of newureaplasma taxonomy especially in the post genomic era. For GBS, we studied thetwo published full genomes and exposed some new problems or possible future newresearch fields. In particular we found the two finished and one ongoing GBSgenomes were all non-typical and suggest that future genomic project had better have genetic population structure viewpoint. Finally, we suggested that integratedstudies of the two potential or conditional perinatal pathogens, from the viewpointof evolution, would provide a new understanding angle of the pathogenesis of thetwo organisms. Studies suggested that during coevolution, human ureaplasmas(especially U. parvum) became friendlier than their ancestors to their human host(by losing most of its virulence genes); however, GBS tried to increase its invasiveabilities (by getting more virulence genes) to fight against the human host attack.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group B streptococcus;ureaplasmas;integrated study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis Of Buried Flexible Pipes In Granular Backfill Subjected To Construction Traffic</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Donald Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the design of flexible pipes, buried in shallow trenches with dry sand backfill. The thesis reports the comprehensive analysis of twenty-two full-scale load tests conducted between 1989 and 1991 on pipe installations, mainly within a laboratory facility, at the University of South Australia. The pipes were highly flexible, spirally-wound, uPVC pipes, ranging in diameter from 300 to 450 mm. Guidelines were required by industry for safe cover heights for these pipes when subjected to construction traffic. The tests were designed by, and conducted under the supervision of, the author, prior to the author undertaking this thesis.  As current design approaches for pipes could not anticipate the large loading settlements and hence, soil plasticity, experienced in these tests, finite element analyses were attempted. Extensive investigations of the materials in the installations were undertaken to permit finite element modelling of the buried pipe installations. In particular, a series of large strain triaxial tests were conducted on the sand backfill in the buried pipe installations, to provide an understanding of the sand behaviour in terms of critical state theory. Subsequently a constitutive model for the soil was developed.  The soil model was validated before implementation in an element of finite element program, AFENA (Carter and Balaam, 1995). Single element modelling of the triaxial tests proved invaluable in obtaining material constants for the soil model. The new element was applied successfully to the analysis of a side-constrained, plate loading test on the sand. The simulation of the buried pipe tests was shown to require three-dimensional finite element analysis to approach the observed pipe-soil behaviour. Non-compliant side boundary conditions were ultimately adjudged chiefly responsible for the difficulty in matching the experimental data. The value of numerical analyses performed in tandem with physical testing was apparent, albeit in hindsight.  The research has identified the prediction of vertical soil pressure above the pipe due to external loading as being the major difficulty for designers. Based on the finite element analyses of the field tests, a preliminary simple expression was developed for estimation of these pressures, which could be used with currently available design approaches to reasonably predict pipe deflections.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flexible Pipes;Sand;Constitutive Model;Finite Element Analysis;Traffic Load</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Planning in Community Building</field><field name="creator">Ziller, Alison Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the contribution of practising planners,  working in town or urban planning departments, to social wellbeing. It is  concerned with what planners do, how they conceptualise the application  of town or urban planning practice to social issues, and what they think  about their role in achieving social outcomes in a place.  The general question is initially addressed through an introductory story  and then via a content analysis of recent regional strategic plans. This is  followed by a review of town planning literature on social issues,  particularly literature concerned with small areas such as villages and  neighbourhoods and which treat urban areas as a series of villages or  neighbourhoods. The work is further advanced by a discourse analysis of  the use of the word community, as a noun and as an adjective, in a series  of planning reports. Recent literature on community development,  community consultation and sustainability principles is also reviewed for  its contribution to the way in which planners address social issues.  On the basis of findings from this work, five research propositions are  developed. These are explored through a survey of practising planners.  The research propositions are explored in a number of questions so as to  search for consistency and establish the reliability of the results. The  same questionnaire is also administered to a class of fourth year student  planners as a control. Four of the five research propositions are  demonstrated by the survey results.  The results suggest that practising planners have a knowledge and skill  shortfall in the area of applying planning practice to achieving social  outcomes. However, the results also demonstrate that most planners  think that community building is part of their role, they have a realistic  appreciation of their skills and are open to new ideas and learning  opportunities. The concluding section of the thesis makes a series of  suggestions for responding to the shortfall and developing planners&#65533;  knowledge and skills relevant to community building.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social sustainability;social planning;social issues in town planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of glycation and glycoxidation of low-density lipoproteins in foam cell formation.</field><field name="creator">Brown, Bronnwyn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">People with diabetes suffer from an increased incidence of atherosclerosis, possibly due to the hyperglycaemia associated with this disease. Glucose may covalently modify proteins via glycation and glycoxidation reactions. Reactive aldehydes (e.g. methylglyoxal and glycolaldehyde) generated from these glycation and glycoxidation reactions, lipid peroxidation and other metabolic pathways may also modify proteins in glycation and glycoxidation reactions. These reactions can result in the formation of advanced glycation end-products, which are increased in diabetes and associated complications such as atherosclerosis. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are the main source of lipid in atherosclerotic plaques, and the lipid-laden foam cells contained within. Modification of the single protein in LDL, apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B) by glucose and aldehydes may result in recognition of these altered LDL particles by macrophage scavenger receptors and cellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters; such accumulation is characteristic of atherosclerotic foam cells.     The extent and nature of the modifications of LDLs that give rise to this behaviour have been poorly characterised, especially in regards to modification/oxidation of protein versus lipid components induced by glucose and low-molecular-mass aldehydes. Therefore the aims of this project were to: 1) characterise LDL modification by glucose, methylglyoxal and glycolaldehyde; 2) examine the effect of these modified LDLs on arterial cells by monitoring cellular viability, proliferation and cholesterol and cholesteryl ester levels; and 3) examine macrophage handling of apo B from these modified LDLs.    Glycolaldehyde induced more rapid and more extensive changes to LDL than methylglyoxal, which was significantly more modified than LDL exposed to glucose, in the presence or absence of Cu2+. LDL was modified by glycolaldehyde and methylglyoxal in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. These aldehyde-modified LDLs were significantly more negatively charged relative (determined by changes in relative electrophoretic mobility), more aggregated (by SDS-PAGE) and lost more Arg, Lys and Trp residues (assessed by fluorescence-based assays) than glucose-modified and control LDLs. Glucose-modified LDL had more modest increases in net negative charge, aggregation and only significantly lost Arg residues. Under the conditions examined none of the modified LDLs contained significant levels of the protein oxidation products DOPA and o-tyrosine, the lipid oxidation products 7-ketocholesterol and cholesteryl ester hydro(pero)oxides, nor marked depletion of the major antioxidant &amp;alpha;-tocopherol or significant radical formation (EPR spectroscopy). Therefore these LDLs were glycated, but not (glyc)oxidised, and so allowed the cellular uptake of glycated LDL, rather than glycoxidised LDL, to be examined.    These glycated LDLs had no effect on the cellular viability (assessed by LDH release), cell protein (BCA assay), and cholesterol and cholesteryl ester levels (quantified by reverse-phase HPLC) of endothelial and smooth muscle cells. The glycated LDLs also had no effects on human and mouse macrophage viability, protein and free cholesterol levels. However, exposure of macrophages to some of the glycated LDLs resulted in significant accumulation of cholesteryl esters and apo B. The greatest cellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters was in cells exposed to glycolaldehyde-modified LDL, which occurred in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Less cholesteryl ester accumulation was observed in cells exposed to methylglyoxal-modified LDL, but some conditions resulted in significantly more cellular cholesteryl esters as compared to control LDLs, unlike glucose-modified LDL. Macrophages endocytosed significantly more apo B from glycolaldehyde-modified LDL labelled with 125I on the apo B, than methylglyoxal-modified 125I-LDL. Apo B from methylglyoxal-modified 125I-LDL was also endocytosed and degraded in greater amounts than control 125I-LDLs, unlike glucose-modified 125I-LDLs.    The glycation of LDL by some low-molecular-mass aldehydes have been shown to result in model foam cell formation as characterised by cholesteryl ester and apo B accumulation. This accumulation correlated with increases in net negative charge, aggregation and loss of Lys and Trp residues of the apo B in glycated LDL particles. However, the differences in cellular uptake of glycolaldehyde- versus methylglyoxal-modified LDL were not completely resolved and it is postulated that this may arise from the extent or type of products formed on key amino acid residues, resulting in differential uptake by macrophage scavenger receptors, rather than loss of particular amino acids per se. Therefore these studies provide a potential mechanism to explain the increased atherosclerosis in people with diabetes, and a suitable model to examine the potential inhibition of the effects of glycated LDLs. This could provide potential therapeutic interventions to reduce diabetes-induced atherosclerosis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foam cells;LDL;Macrophag;Glycation;Diabetes;Atherosclerosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconfiguring tissue banking consent through enrichment of a restricted debate</field><field name="creator">Lipworth, Wendy Louise</field><field name="description">Tissue banks are thought to be an essential resource for medical research in the post-genomic age. Collections of tissue, usually removed in the course of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, enable laboratory-based epidemiological studies to be carried out, linking abnormalities in the tissue to disease aetiology, prognosis and treatment responsiveness. There are, however, a number of technical, regulatory and ethical concerns that challenge those wishing to engage in tissue banking research.     It is becoming increasingly apparent that tissue banking research is not without risk of harms, even though there is no direct physical risk to donors. This is because, in order to be most useful,  banked specimens need to be linked to personal information about tissue donors and this poses the risk of inadvertent disclosure of personal&#9472; particularly  genetic&#9472; information to those who might exploit such information (eg. insurance companies and employers). Furthermore, the long-term storage of specimens, and the impossibility of predicting all potential types of research programs for which they might be useful, raises the possibility that future projects will be carried out that are unacceptable to some (past) tissue donors.     The ethical principles of autonomy and respect for persons demand that research subjects be informed of such risks and of the nature of the research, and that they participate willingly. On the other hand, there is a desire for science to progress unhindered by stringent consent requirements. For these reasons, a debate has emerged in the academic (bioethical and biomedical) literature and in the legal (law reform) sphere over what  would constitute adequate consent. Despite an extensive discourse, it is still unclear whether it is permissible to carry out research on archival tissue that was originally taken for diagnostic purposes and whether project-specific (as opposed to open-ended) consent is required for research on tissue collected today. This lack of clarity is of concern to researchers, ethics committees and research subjects, all of whom recognise the importance of tissue banking research, yet fear that current consent procedures may be ethically or legally inadequate. Thus it is important that the consent dilemma be resolved as quickly and definitively as possible.    Ongoing controversy and regulatory ambiguity are appropriate when morally contentious issues are at stake, and their existence does not, on its own, signal any flaws in the discourse process. There are, however, two reasons to suspect that the current &#65533;consent to tissue banking&#65533; debate, as portrayed in the academic literature and law reform documentation, is problematic. Firstly, the debate appears to be mired in an intractable  conflict between those who want to maximise personal autonomy through stringent consent requirements, and those who want the scientific endeavour to progress in a manner that is unconstrained by what are viewed as arduous consent procedures. Secondly, the possible practical options (consent models) being generated by the debate are all limited because they are underpinned by a restricted notion of consent as an individualistic, legalistic and static activity, without consideration of any alternative conceptualisations of consent.    Through a thematic analysis of the current &#65533;consent to tissue banking&#65533; debate in the academic and law reform literature (Section 3), this thesis shows that debate is essentially occurring between those who see individual autonomy (and stringent consent) as being of primary importance, and those who see unimpeded, market-driven scientific progress as the more important social good, which should not be impeded by unnecessarily stringent consent. Thematic analysis also confirms the existence of the two problems described above, and a failure of those engaged in the debate to reflect on, and challenge, the value-level assumptions underpinning their arguments and those of their opponents. It is argued that this lack of reflection accounts for the two problems:    &#65533; Firstly, it precludes recognition of the cause of&#9472; and, therefore, ways of resolving&#9472; the intractable conflict at the centre of the debate. Value-level reflection shows that this is a result of the logical and moral conflict within western liberalism, between two modernist goods: individual freedom and scientific progress.     &#65533; Secondly, it precludes the generation of varied conceptions of consent. Value-level reflection shows that the current range of consent models is restricted to procedures which are individualistic, abstract, static and legalistic, since they are underpinned by western liberal notions of autonomy and scientific progress. This recognition paves the way to consideration of alternative notions of  autonomy, scientific progress and, therefore, consent, such as those derived from communitarian and feminist systems of values.     A conceptually enriched model of tissue banking consent is then developed (Section 4). This model incorporates dominant (liberal) conceptions of autonomy and scientific progress as well as alternative notions of autonomy and scientific progress espoused by communitarian and feminist systems of values. It is argued that this conceptually-enriched model provides a practical solution to the two problems associated with the standard &#65533;consent to tissue banking&#65533; debate. In relation to the philosophically intractable conflict&#9472; or what is termed the &#65533;modernist dilemma&#65533;&#9472; between those privileging autonomy and those privileging scientific progress, it shows how the two apparently conflicting &#65533;modernist&#65533; goods can both be accommodated at a practical level, thus making the &#65533;consent to tissue banking&#65533; debate more tractable and fruitful. In relation to the restricted range of consent models being generated by the current debate, it provides new insights into the ways in which consent might be obtained such that a broader range of community values can be accommodated. More specifically, it stimulates the construction of a model that 1) involves communities, as opposed to merely individuals, in all stages of the scientific process; 2) is flexible and able to adapt consent procedures to specific contexts, rather than predefining procedures in abstract terms; and 3) is transactional and relational rather than static and legalistic.    This outcome has interesting philosophical as well as practical implications. It shows that despite apparently unresolved, and possibly irresolvable, normative-level conflicts between the two modernist elements of western liberalism (autonomy and scientific progress), and between liberal, feminist and communitarian systems of values, a multi-perspectival, inclusive, model-building approach provides a practical solution that circumvents these normative-level conflicts.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tissue Bank;Consent;Research;Bioethics;Epidemiology;Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconsidering Late Roman Cyprus: Using new material from Nea Paphos to review current artefact typologies</field><field name="creator">Rowe, Andrea Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis is based around detailed analysis of an assemblage of newly excavated material from the Paphos Theatre site in SW Cyprus.  Before presenting the new work, the academic context into which it must fit is investigated.  This process of re-evaluating past work sets up a framework within which the new material would be expected to fit.  In fact, research on Late Roman Cyprus is not as advanced as might be expected after over seventy years of excavation.  This is most particularly the case for fundamental principles like typology and chronology for the local ceramics and glass.  A review of past and current excavations shows that the typology of Cypriot Red Slip ware is widely used around the Eastern Mediterranean as a dating tool for deposits containing this distinctive Fine ware.  This makes it essential that it be confirmed to be a reliable and substantially correct construct.  Unfortunately, a re-analysis of the foundations of the Cypriot red Slip ware typology and chronology reveals many uncertainties and establishes the necessity for new material from secure deposits to help refine current typologies.  The artefact assemblage from Area Three at the Paphos Theatre provides just such an opportunity.  A combination of a series of sealed deposits, a high density of artifacts and identifiable coins has enabled a comprehensive study to be achieved.  A major collapse, probably an earthquake, sealed a paved street and drainage system in the trenches and this episode can be pinpointed to around the mid to late fifth century by the coin evidence.  Most interesting is the fact that the dating suggested by the coins does not match the dating usually assigned to the associated pottery and glass.  After establishing the reliability of the coin evidence, the study of the other artefacts offers new ideas about the dating and typology of the local Cypriot Red Slip ware, Cooking ware, Lamps and Glass.  In fact an analysis of all the pottery from the site suggests that the chronology of Cypriot Red Slip ware and Cooking ware in particular needs to be pushed back to focus on a floruit in the fourth and fifth centuries.  This is at least one hundred years earlier than current typologies that focus on the mid sixth to seventh centuries.  This analysis provides some reliable fixed points, for both local pottery and glass, earlier in the Late Roman sequence upon which future work can be built.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Late Roman;Ceramics;Pottery;Cyprus;Egypt;Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/684</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathophysiology of normal pressure hydrocephalus</field><field name="creator">Owler, Brian Kenneth</field><field name="description">Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a CSF circulation disorder, is important as a reversible cause of gait and cognitive disturbance in an aging population. The inconsistent response to CSF shunting is usually attributed to difficulties in differential diagnosis or co-morbidity. Improving outcome depends on an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of NPH. Specifically, this thesis examines the contribution of, and inter-relationship between, the brain parenchyma and CSF circulation in the pathophysiology of NPH.   Of the four core studies of the thesis, the first quantifies the characteristics of the CSF circulation and parenchyma in NPH using CSF infusion studies to measure the resistance to CSF absorption and brain compliance. The second study assesses cerebral blood flow (CBF) was using O15-labelled positron emission tomography (PET) with MR co-registration. By performing CSF infusion studies in the PET scanner, CBF at baseline CSF pressure and at a higher equilibrium pressure is measured. Regional changes and autoregulatory capacity are assessed. The final study examines the microstructural integrity of the parenchyma using MR diffusion tensor imaging.  These studies confirm the importance of the inter-relationship of the brain parenchyma and CSF circulation. NPH symptomatology and its relationship to the observed regional CBF reductions in the basal ganglia and thalamus are discussed. Regional CBF reductions with increased CSF pressure and the implications for autoregulatory capacity in NPH are considered. The reduction in CBF when CSF was increased was most striking in the periventricular regions. In addition, periventricular structures demonstrated increased diffusivity and decreased anisotropy. The relationship between these changes and mechanisms such as transependymal CSF passage are reviewed.  The findings of this thesis support a role of both the CSF circulation and the brain parenchyma in the pathophysiology of NPH. The results have implications for the approach to the management of patients with NPH.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">normal pressure hydrocephalus;cerebral blood flow;diffusion MR Imaging;Cerebrospiral fluid</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping the proteome of Streptococcus gordonii</field><field name="creator">Macarthur, Deborah Jane</field><field name="description">Streptococcus gordonii is a primary coloniser of the tooth surface where it efficiently  ferments carbohydrates at pH levels above 6.0. By not being able to maintain the pH  of dental plaque to a level required for enamel dissolution, the dominance of S.  gordonii in dental plaque is considered a sign of a healthy oral cavity. However,  upon entering the bloodstream and encountering a rise in pH, S. gordonii may  become pathogenic, being one of the major causative organisms associated with  infective endocarditis. Proteome analyses of S. gordonii grown at steady state in a  chemostat allowed the phenotypic changes associated with alterations in pH levels  characteristic of these two environments to be determined.  As an initial starting point to this study, a two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-  DE) reference map of S. gordonii grown at pH 7.0 was produced. Although only  50% of the S gordonii genome was available in an annotated form during the course  of this study, the closely related Streptococcus pneumoniae genome (with which S.  gordonii shares 97.24% DNA sequence homology) had been completed in 2001.  The use of both of these databases allowed many of the S. gordonii proteins to be  identified by mass spectrometry. Four hundred and seventy six protein spots,  corresponding to 250 different proteins, or 12.5% of the S. gordonii proteome, were  identified, giving rise to the first comprehensive proteome reference map of this oral  bacterium. Of the 250 different proteins, 196 were of cellular origin while 68 were  identified from the extracellular milieu. Only 14 proteins were common to both  compartments. Of particular interest among the 54 uniquely identified extracellular  proteins was a homologue of a peptidoglycan hydrolase that has been associated with  virulence in S. pneumoniae.  Among the other proteins identified were ones involved in transport and binding,  energy metabolism, translation, transformation, stress response and virulence.  Twelve cell envelope proteins were identified as well as 25 others that were  predicted to have a membrane association based on the presence of at least one  transmembrane domain. The study also confirmed the existence of 38 proteins  previously designated as &#65533;hypothetical&#65533; or with no known function. Mass spectral    data for over 1000 protein spots were accumulated and archived for future analysis  when sequencing of the S. gordonii genome is finally completed.  Following the mapping of the proteome of S. gordonii, alterations in protein  spots associated with growth of the bacterium at pH intervals of 0.5 units in the pH  range 5.5 - 7.5 were determined. Only 16 protein spots were shown to be  significantly altered in their level of expression despite the range of pH studied.  Among the differentially expressed proteins was a manganese-dependent inorganic  pyrophosphatase (PpaC), which regulates expression of adhesins required for  coaggregation. The expression of PpaC was highest at pH 6.5 - 7.0, the pH of a  healthy oral cavity, indicating that PpaC may play an important part in dental plaque  formation.  Another differentially expressed protein was the heat-inducible transcription  repressor (HrcA). Alterations in HrcA were consistent with its role as a negative  repressor in regulating heat-shock proteins at low pH, even though no changes in the  level of heat-shock proteins were observed as the pH declined. This result gave rise  to the hypothesis that the possible reason cariogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus  mutans, can out compete S. gordonii at low pH might simply be due to their ability to  manipulate their proteome in a complex manner for survival and persistence at low  pH, unlike S. gordonii. This may imply some prevailing level of genetic regulation  that is missing in S. gordonii.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemostat;dental plaque;environmental pH;infective endocarditis;mass spectometry;oral ecology;proteome proteomics;Streptococcus gordonii</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Modelling, Measurement and Control of Co-rotating Twin-Screw Extruders</field><field name="creator">Elsey, Justin Rae</field><field name="description">Co-rotating twin-screw extruders are unique and versatile machines that are used widely in the plastics and food processing industries. Due to the large number of operating variables and design parameters available for manipulation and the complex interactions between them, it cannot be claimed that these extruders are currently being optimally utilised. The most significant improvement to the field of twin-screw extrusion would be through the provision of a generally applicable dynamic process model that is both computationally inexpensive and accurate. This would enable product design, process optimisation and process controller design to be performed cheaply and more thoroughly on a computer than can currently be achieved through experimental trials. This thesis is divided into three parts: dynamic modelling, measurement and control. The first part outlines the development of a dynamic model of the extrusion process which satisfies the above mentioned criteria. The dynamic model predicts quasi-3D spatial profiles of the degree of fill, pressure, temperature, specific mechanical energy input and concentrations of inert and reacting species in the extruder. The individual material transport models which constitute the dynamic model are examined closely for their accuracy and computational efficiency by comparing candidate models amongst themselves and against full 3D finite volume flow models. Several new modelling approaches are proposed in the course of this investigation. The dynamic model achieves a high degree of simplicity and flexibility by assuming a slight compressibility in the process material, allowing the pressure to be calculated directly from the degree of over-fill in each model element using an equation of state. Comparison of the model predictions with dynamic temperature, pressure and residence time distribution data from an extrusion cooking process indicates a good predictive capability. The model can perform dynamic step-change calculations for typical screw configurations in approximately 30 seconds on a 600 MHz Pentium 3 personal computer. The second part of this thesis relates to the measurement of product quality attributes of extruded materials. A digital image processing technique for measuring the bubble size distribution in extruded foams from cross sectional images is presented. It is recognised that this is an important product quality attribute, though difficult to measure accurately with existing techniques. The present technique is demonstrated on several different products. A simulation study of the formation mechanism of polymer foams is also performed. The measurement of product quality attributes such as bulk density and hardness in a manner suitable for automatic control is also addressed. This is achieved through the development of an acoustic sensor for inferring product attributes using the sounds emanating from the product as it leaves the extruder. This method is found to have good prediction ability on unseen data. The third and final part of this thesis relates to the automatic control of product quality attributes using multivariable model predictive controllers based on both direct and indirect control strategies. In the given case study, indirect control strategies, which seek to regulate the product quality attributes through the control of secondary process indicators such as temperature and pressure, are found to cause greater deviations in product quality than taking no corrective control action at all. Conversely, direct control strategies are shown to give tight control over the product quality attributes, provided that appropriate product quality sensors or inferential estimation techniques are available.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">twin-screw extrusion;extruder geometry;dynamic modelling;process control;acoustic sensors;image analysis;bubble growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perioperative Sleep and Breathing</field><field name="creator">Loadsman, John Anthony</field><field name="description">Sleep disruption has been implicated in morbidity after major surgery since 1974. Sleep-related upper airway obstruction has been associated with death after upper airway surgery and profound episodic hypoxaemia in the early postoperative period. There is also evidence for a rebound in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep that might be contributing to an increase in episodic sleep-related hypoxaemic events later in the first postoperative week. Speculation regarding the role of REM sleep rebound in the generation of late postoperative morbidity and mortality has evolved into dogma without any direct evidence to support it. The research presented in this thesis involved two main areas: a search for evidence of a clinically important contribution of REM sleep rebound to postoperative morbidity, and a re-examination of the role of sleep in the causation of postoperative episodic hypoxaemic events. To assess the latter, a relationship between airway obstruction under anaesthesia and the severity of sleep-disordered breathing was sought.    In 148 consecutive sleep clinic patients, 49% of those with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) had a number of events in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) that was greater than or equal to that in REM and 51% had saturation nadirs in NREM that were equal to or worse than their nadirs in REM. This suggests SDB is not a REM-predominant phenomenon for most patients. Of 1338 postoperative deaths occurring over 6.5 years in one hospital only 37 were unexpected, most of which were one or two days after surgery with no circadian variation in the time of death, casting further doubt on the potential role of REM rebound.    Five of nine subjects studied preoperatively had moderately severe SDB. Unrecognised and significant SDB is common in middle-aged and elderly patients presenting for surgery suggesting overall perioperative risk of important adverse events from SDB is probably small.     In 17 postoperative patients, sleep macro-architecture was variably altered with decreases in REM and slow wave sleep while stage 1 sleep and a state of pre-sleep onset drowsiness, both associated with marked ventilatory instability, were increased. Sleep micro-architecture was also changed with an increase in power in the alpha-beta electroencephalogram range. These micro-architectural changes result in ambiguity in the staging of postoperative sleep that may have affected the findings of this and other studies.    Twenty-four subjects with airway management difficulty under anaesthesia were all found to have some degree of SDB. Those with the most obstruction-prone airways while anaesthetised had a very high incidence of severe SDB. Such patients warrant referral to a sleep clinic.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Surgery;Anesthesiology;Anesthesia and Analgesia;Anesthesia Recovery Period;Postoperative Period</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat manipulation to enhance biological control of light brown apple moth (Epiphyas Postvittana)</field><field name="creator">Begum, Mahmuda</field><field name="description">Trichogramma carverae Oatman and Pinto is mass-released for biological control of the leafroller pest, light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) in Australian vineyards. Parasitoid performance can, however, be constrained by a lack of suitable adult food and no information is available on the effect of nectar on the parasitism and longevity of T. carverae. To address this, the effect of alyssum, Lobularia maritima (L.) flowers on E. postvittana parasitism was studied in a vineyard experiment with and without releases of T. carverae. Egg parasitoid activity was assessed with E. postvittana egg &#65533;sentinel cards&#65533; and no parasitism was recorded in plots without T. carverae releases.  Where T. carverae were released, there was no significant enhancement of parasitism by the presence of L. maritima flowers.   Three hypotheses were subsequently tested to account for the lack of an effect:                  (i) T. carverae does not benefit from L. maritima nectar, (ii) T. carverae was feeding on nectar from other flowering plants (weeds) present in the vineyard, (iii) T. carverae was feeding on sugars from ripe grapes. A growth-cabinet experiment using potted L. maritima plants with and without flowers did not support hypothesis one. No parasitism was recorded after day two for T. carverae caged without flowers whilst parasitism occured until day eight in the presence of flowers. A laboratory experiment with common vineyard weeds (Trifolium repens, Hypochoeris radicata, Echium plantagineum) as well as      L. maritima did not support hypothesis one but gave partial support to hypothesis two. Survival of T. carverae was enhanced to a small but statistically significant extent in vials with intact flowers of L. maritima, white clover (T. repens) and catsear  (H. radicata) but not in vials with flowering shoots of these species from which flowers and flowering buds had been removed. Paterson&#65533;s curse (E. plantagineum) flowers had no effect on T. carverae survival. In a laboratory study, punctured grapes significantly enhanced T. carverae survival compared with a treatment without grapes, supporting hypothesis three.  Trichogramma carverae performance in the field experiment was probably also constrained by relatively cool and wet weather. Further work on the enhancement of T. carverae efficacy by L. maritima and other carbohydrate sources is warranted.  Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to investigate whether T. carverae benefit from different groundcover plant species. Ten T. carverae adults (&lt;24h after eclosion) were caged with different groundcover species and a control with no plant materials. Epiphyas postvittana egg sentinel cards were used to measure parasitism and longevity was recorded visually.  Survival and realised parasitism of T. carverae was significantly higher in L. maritima than in Brassica juncea, Coriandrum sativum, shoots of these species from which flowers had been removed and nil control treatments. A similar experiment with Fagopyrum esculentum (with- and without-flowers) and a control treatment showed that survival was significantly higher in intact F. esculentum than in without-flower and control treatments. There was no significant treatment effect on parasitism in the early stages of that experiment, though parasitism was recorded in the presence of F. esculentum flowers for 12 days, compared with 6 days in other treatments. Higher parasitism was observed in intact Borago officinalis than in the flowerless shoot, water only and no plant material control treatments in a third experiment. There was no significant treatment effect on parasitism. Fitted exponential curves for survival data differed significantly in curvature in the first, second and third experiments but the slope was a non-significant parameter in the second and third experiments.   In a second series of laboratory experiments, one male and one female T. carverae were caged with groundcover species to investigate male and female longevity and daily fecundity. Both male and female longevity in F. esculentum and L. maritima treatments were significantly higher than on shoots of these species from which flowers had been removed, and than in the control treatments. Daily fecundity was significantly greater in the intact L. maritima treatment than in all other treatments. Fitted exponential curves for daily fecundity differed significantly in position and slope but not in curvature. There was no significant treatment effect on longevity or parasitism when a male and female were caged with intact B. juncea, B. officinalis or without-flower of these species, nor in the treatment with no plant materials.   No parasitism was observed in a survey of naturally occurring egg parasitoids on two sites close to Orange and Canowindra in New South Wales, illustrating the importance of mass releases of T. carverae in biological control of E. postvittana. In an experiment on the Canowindra site, parasitism was significantly higher on day one and day two after             T. carverae release when with-flower treatments were compared with without-flower treatments. Parasitism was significantly higher in the F. esculentum treatment than in C. sativum, L. maritima, vegetation without-flowers and control treatments on these dates. On day five, parasitism was higher in C. sativum than in all other treatments. There was no significant increase in parasitism in a second experiment conducted on the Orange site.  Coriandrum sativum, F. esculentum and L. maritima appear to be suitable adult food sources for T. carverae and offer some scope for habitat manipulation in vineyards  The adults of many parasitoid species require nectar for optimal fitness but very little is known about flower recognition. Flight cage experiments showed that the adults of            T. carverae benefited from L. maritima bearing white flowers to a greater extent than was the case for light pink, dark pink or purple flowered cultivars, despite all cultivars producing nectar. Survival and realised parasitism on non-white flowers were no greater than when the parasitoids were caged on L. maritima shoots from which flowers had been removed. The possibility that differences between L. maritima cultivars were due to factors other than flower colour, such as nectar quality, was excluded by dyeing white L. maritima flowers by placing the roots of the plants in 5% food dye (blue or pink) solution. Survival of T. carverae was lower on dyed L. maritima flowers than on undyed white flowers. Mixing the same dyes with honey in a third experiment conducted in the dark showed that the low level of feeding on dyed flowers was unlikely to be the result of olfactory or gustatory cues. Flower colour appears, therefore, to be a critical factor in the choice of plants used to enhance biological control, and is likely to also be a factor in the role parasitoids play in structuring invertebrate communities.    Provision of nectar producing plants to increase the effectiveness of biological control is one aspect of habitat manipulation, but care needs to be taken to avoid the use of plant species that may benefit pest species. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to investigate whether the adult E. postvittana and larvae benefit from nectar producing groundcover species. Newly emerged E. postvittana adults were caged with different groundcover species and a honey-based artificial adult diet. The longevity of male and female E. postvittana when caged with shoots of borage (B. officinalis) and buckwheat     (F. esculentum) bearing flowers was as long as when fed a honey-based artificial diet. This effect was not evident when caged with shoots of these plants from which flowers had been removed. Longevity was significantly lower than in the artificial diet treatment when caged with coriander (C. sativum) or alyssum (L. maritima) irrespective of whether flowers were present or not.    There was no significant treatment effect on the lifetime fecundity of E. postvittana.          A second experiment with mustard (B. juncea) (with- and without-flowers), water only and honey-based artificial adult diet showed no significant treatment effects on the longevity of male and female E. postvittana or on the lifetime fecundity of E. postvittana. The anomalous lack of a difference between the water and honey-based diet treatments precludes making conclusions on the value of B. juncea for E. postvittana.   Two greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of groundcover species on the larval development of E. postvittana. In the first experiment, larval mortality was significantly higher in C. sativum, and L. maritima than in B. juncea, B. officinalis and white clover (T. repens) a known host of E. postvittana. Coriandrum sativum and              L. maritima extended the larval period. In B. juncea and B. officinalis, mortality did not differ from that in T. repens. In F. esculentum, larval mortality was significantly higher than in T. repens.  A short larval period was observed on B. juncea, B. officinalis and        F. esculentum. Fitted exponential curves for larval mortality differed significantly in curvature between plant treatments. Similarly, successful pupation was significantly lower in C. sativum, F. esculentum and L. maritima than in T. repens. The percentage of successful pupation in B. juncea and B. officinalis did not differ from F. esculentum and    T. repens. Fitted exponential curves for pupation differed significantly in curvature.           A similar trend was observed in a second experiment with potted plants. The overall results suggest that C. sativum and L. maritima denied benefit to E. postvittana adults and larvae, so could be planted as vineyard groundcover with minimal risk of exacerbating this pest.  Overall results suggest that T. carverae require nutrients to reach their full reproductive potential and flowers provide such nutrients. Lobularia maritima and C. sativum may be considered  &#65533;selective food plants&#65533; for T. carverae whereas F. esculentum appears to be a &#65533;non-selective food plant&#65533;; both T. carverae and E. postvittana benefited from it. Fruits such as grapes can be used as food resources in habitat manipulation and this merits further research. This result also suggests that within species flower colour is an important factor for flower selection in habitat manipulation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epiphyas postvittana;trichogramma carverae;habitat manipulation;nectar;parasitoid;conservation biological control;survival;fecundity;longevity;vineyard;alyssum;buckwheat;coriander;borage;mustard;flower colour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Marist Brothers' teaching tradition in Australia, 1872-2000</field><field name="creator">Braniff, John Michael</field><field name="description">Recent Australian academic attempts to define the 'charism,' or distinguishing spirit, of the Marist Brothers' style of education, have been conducted using sociological methodologies and have resulted in findings which are more religious than educational or pedagogical, in content. The present enquiry is more educational in focus and historical in approach.     This enquiry poses a series of questions e.g: Did the Marists who arrived in Australia in 1872 come as the conscious bearers of a distinctive style of teaching?  Did they adapt this distinctive style to meet the needs of the Australian society?  How faithfully did they cling to their founding inspiration? Have they been successful  in preserving this distinctiveness in the face of modern developments in Australian education and in the Catholic Church? Or, is all that remains the name &#65533;Marist&#65533;?     The historical methodology employed uses both recent academic analyses of the Marist Brothers&#65533; Founder&#65533;s work and also of the archival documentation of the Order&#65533;s foundation and development in Australia. It also tracks, though not in isolation, the development of the first Marist school in Sydney, St Patrick&#65533;s, Church Hill; founded in 1872 and still operating, at a new location &#65533; Dundas &#65533; in the more recently-formed diocese of Parramatta. This individual school&#65533;s role in Marist teacher education in early, and more recent times, makes it an appropriate focus.     In summary, the thesis concludes that the Marists did come as conscious disciples of St Marcellin Champagnat, their founder; but that the pristine inspiration had already begun to evolve. In Australia the brothers continued to follow his example in adapting  to the newer demands of Church and State. After Vatican II and the return of State Aid, however, the pace and scope of development precipitated changes  which arguably constitute a break from all but the names &#65533;Marist&#65533; and &#65533;Champagnat&#65533;.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marist Brothers;Pedagogy;Marcellin Champagnat;Marist Education;Marist Pedagogy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The first reintroduction of the western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville) to mainland Australia.</field><field name="creator">Richards, Jacqueline Denise</field><field name="description">Almost half of the world&#65533;s mammal extinctions in the last two hundred years have occurred in Australia (Short and Smith 1994).  The western barred bandicoot Perameles bougainville is one of a suite of species that is currently threatened with extinction, surviving only on two islands in Shark Bay, Western Australia.  Reintroduction has been used as a tool in conservation biology to assist in the recovery of threatened species, such as the western barred bandicoot.  The aims of this project were to 1) successfully reintroduce and establish a free-ranging mainland population of the western barred bandicoot at Heirisson Prong, Shark Bay, 2) contribute information on the biology of the species, its interactions with introduced species, and its likelihood of persistence as a reintroduced population in the longer-term, and 3) to provide recommendations to assist future reintroductions of the species.  The first reintroduction of the western barred bandicoot from surviving remnant island populations to the mainland, some 60 years after its apparent mainland extinction, was from Dorre Island to Heirisson Prong in 1995.  Animals were translocated initially to a predator-free refuge on Heirisson Prong, and then subsequently released to the 12 km2 peninsula where introduced predators (foxes Vulpes vulpes and feral cats Felis catus) had been controlled, but European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus had not.  Despite a small founder number and high mortality of free-range bandicoots in the presence of a low-density feral cat population, the bandicoot population successfully established.  The reintroduced population of western barred bandicoots provided an opportunity to study the biology of the species, and to compare it with the remnant island populations and other species of Australian bandicoot.  Many population parameters were similar between the island and mainland western barred bandicoot populations, as well as between the western barred bandicoot and other bandicoot species, suggesting that the habitat at the reintroduction site is suitable for long-term persistence of the population.  However, there were some notable differences.  The western barred bandicoot is the smallest extant species of bandicoot, with fewer young per litter than recorded for other bandicoot species, adult sex ratios were closer to parity, animals reached sexual maturity later, and it is the only species of bandicoot where females are larger than males.  Home range size is larger also than recorded for other species.  Some of these differences may be explained in part by trade-offs between island dwarfism, lactational pressures, and nest defence.  The nesting biology of the western barred bandicoot was studied at Heirisson Prong, including during periods of high and low densities of rabbits.  Individuals of the species constructed and utilised nests in a similar fashion to other species of Australian bandicoot, nesting amongst litter underneath shrubs.  The western barred bandicoot appeared to favour particular shrub species, especially when vegetation condition was poor due to rabbit damage, but displayed flexibility in being able to construct nests under a variety of shrub species where at least some surface litter was present.  Grasses were used in nest construction only when rabbit density was low.  Nests appear important for protection against temperature extremes and diurnal predators.  Vegetation exclosures around three of the shrub species most commonly used by the western barred bandicoot for nest sites (Acacia ligulata, A. tetragonophylla and Melaleuca cardiophylla) were used to examine the impact of rabbits on vegetation on Heirisson Prong.  A high-density rabbit population over the summer of 1997/98 caused in a decrease in canopy cover and the death of mature A. ligulata.  Subsequent rainfall and low-density rabbit populations allowed A. tetragonophylla shrubs to recover their former structure, and M. cardiophylla to recover, but not to the same degree.  The flexibility of western barred bandicoots in use of nest materials and their omnivorous diet may enable the species to survive in the face of habitat modification by rabbits.  Population viability analysis was used to examine future options for the recovery of the endangered western barred bandicoot.  Biological data from the Dorre Island and Heirisson Prong populations were input to the computer simulation program VORTEX.  The western barred bandicoot populations were modelled under a variety of scenarios to examine the possible effects of changes in carrying capacity, founder population size, inbreeding depression, and the occurrence of drought and cat predation as catastrophes, on the probability of population extinction.  This analysis highlighted the need for eradication of feral cats, above all other management actions.  Cat predation was particularly potent when it acted through high loss of juveniles, as well as adult bandicoots.  Predator control is considered critical for the long-term persistence of reintroduced populations of the western barred bandicoot.  This study documents the first reintroduction of the endangered western barred bandicoot to mainland Australia.  The population had been extant for four years at the completion of data collection for this thesis, in late 1999 and for over eight years at the finalisation of this thesis in July 2004.  The knowledge gained from the reintroduction was used to discuss management recommendations and future options for the recovery of the species.  The primary concern for reintroductions of this, and other species of bandicoots, remains the control of introduced predators.  For long-term persistence of small, isolated populations, such as those of the western barred bandicoot at Heirisson Prong and the Arid Recovery Project at Roxby Downs in South Australia, and the eastern barred bandicoot Perameles gunnii at a range of sites in Victoria, the complete eradication of introduced predators is essential.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bandicoot;reintroduction;endangered;mammal;conservation;Perameles</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interference Mitigation in Radio Astronomy</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Daniel Allan</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates techniques and algorithms for mitigating radio frequency interference (RFI) affecting radio astronomy observations. In the past radio astronomy has generally been performed in radio-quiet geographical locations and unused parts of the radio spectrum, including small protected frequency bands. The increasing use of the entire spectrum and global transmitters such as satellites are forcing the astronomy community to begin implementing active interference cancelling. The amount of harmful interference affecting observations will also increase as future instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are required to use larger bandwidths to reach up to 100 times the current sensitivity levels, and as spectral line observations require observing in bands licensed to other spectrum users.    Particular attention is paid to interference cancellation algorithms which make use of reference beams. This has proven to be successful in removing interference from the contaminated astronomical data. Reference antenna cancellers are closely analysed, leading to filters and techniques that can offer improved RFI excision for some important applications. It is shown that pre- and post-correlation reference antenna cancellers give similar results, and an important aspect of the cancellers is the use of a second reference signal when the reference interference-to-noise ratio is low. These modified filters can theoretically offer infinite interference suppression in the voltage domain, equivalent to that of post-correlation interference cancellers, and their internal structure can offer an understanding of the residual RFI and added receiver noise components of a variety of reference antenna techniques. The effect of variable geometric delays is also considered and various filters are compared as a function of the geometric fringe rate.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interference Mitigation;Radio Astronomy;RFI;Adaptive Filters;Adaptive Cancelers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Emergent Properties of the Visual Cortex</field><field name="creator">Woodbury, Greg</field><field name="description">N/A</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual Cortex;Topographic map refinement;Artificial Scotoma</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CMC Modelling of Enclosure Fires</field><field name="creator">Cleary, Matthew John</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the implementation of the conditional moment closure (CMC)  combustion model in a numerical scheme and its application to the modelling of  enclosure fires. Prediction of carbon monoxide (CO) in the upper smoke layer of  enclosure fires is of primary interest because it is a common cause of death. The CO  concentration cannot be easily predicted by empirical means, so a method is needed  which models the chemistry of a quenched, turbulent fire plume and subsequent  mixing within an enclosed space.  CMC is a turbulent combustion model which has been researched for over a  decade. It has provided predictions of major and minor species in jet diffusion  flames. The extension to enclosure fires is a new application for which the flow is  complex and temperatures are well below adiabatic conditions.  Advances are made in the numerical implementation of CMC. The governing  combustion equations are cast in a conserved, finite volume formulation for which  boundary conditions are uniquely defined. Computational efficiency is improved  through two criteria which allow the reduction in the size of the computational  domain without any loss of accuracy.  Modelling results are compared to experimental data for natural gas fires burning  under a hood. Comparison is made in the recirculating, post-flame region of the  flow where temperatures are low and reactions are quenched. Due to the spatial  flux terms contained in the governing equations, CMC is able to model the situation  where chemical species are produced in the high temperature fire-plume and then  transported to non-reacting regions. Predictions of CO and other species are in  reasonable agreement with the experimental data over a range of lean and rich  hood-fire conditions.  Sensitivity of results to chemistry, temperature and modelling closures is inves-  tigated. Species predictions are shown to be quite different for the two detailed  chemical mechanisms used. Temperature conditions within the hood effect the for-  mation of species in the plume prior to quenching and subsequently species predic-  tions in the post-flame region are also effected. Clipped Gaussian and &#223;-function  probability density functions (PDFs) are used for the stochastic mixture fraction.  Species predictions in the plume are sensitive to the form of the PDF but in the  post-flame region, where the &#223;-function approaches a Gaussian form, predictions are  relatively insensitive. Two models are used for the conditional scalar dissipation:  a uniform model, where the conditional quantity is set equal to the unconditional  scalar dissipation across all mixture fraction space; and a model which is consistent  with the PDF transport equation. In the plume, predictions of minor species are  sensitive to the modelling used, but in the recirculating, post-flame region species  are not significantly effected.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbon monoxide;fires;turbulent combustion;conditional moment closure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensing Sound And Space:Auditory And Visual Spatial ImpressionIn Three Auditoria</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Andy</field><field name="description">In some contexts, the experience of sound and space are often considered as two  unrelated experiences. In an auditorium, the senses of hearing and seeing are not necessary  unrelated. This thesis proposes that there is a sensorial relationship between sound and space  in the context of symphonic concert halls. Through a study of three auditoria, this thesis  explores the relationship, and the degree of correspondence and interaction between auditory  and visual spatial impression.  It begins by exploring the concepts of auditory and visual spatial impression in relation  with auditorium acoustics and architectural design. In auditorium acoustics, a number of  terms are used to describe auditory spatial impression, such as &#65533;spaciousness,&#65533;  &#65533;envelopment,&#65533; and &#65533;intimacy.&#65533; These terms have connotations beyond the auditory. The  thesis suggests that they may also be used to describe visual spatial impression in auditoria.  Through textual analyses, the thesis finds that the auditory and visual terms do not  always relate to the same physical characteristics of auditoria and can conflict with one  another. Hence, it is apparent that further subjective analyses of auditory and spatial  impression are needed.  Three chapters in this thesis are devoted to auditory and visual subjective experiments.  Their purpose is to explore the degree of correspondence or contrast, and interaction between  auditory and visual spatial impression. The degree of correspondence and contrast between  auditory and visual spatial impression appear to vary between auditoria and within auditoria.  The relationship between auditory and visual spatial impression appear to be both necessary  and arbitrary, and the degree of interaction between them appear to be strong in some cases  and weak in other.  From the findings, this thesis suggests that the degree of correspondence or contrast,  and interaction between auditory and visual spatial impression could be used to create an  audiovisual experience that suit specific musical events. Concert auditoria are culturally and  artistically unique spaces. Hence, consideration must be taken to understand the relationships  between, and intentions of the acoustical and architectural designs, music and architecture, for  a successful and creative collaboration between designers - since the ultimate goal is to create  an extraordinary audiovisual experience in a concert hall.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auditory Spacial Impression;Visual Spacial Impression;Audiovisual Interaction;Sensorial Experience;Auditorium Acoustics;Architectural Des</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Slippages .... exploring the aesthetic encounter from the perspective of Merleau-Ponty's ontology</field><field name="creator">Turrin, Daniela Anna</field><field name="description">This paper addresses the aesthetic encounter from the perspective of the writings of  Maurice Merleau-Ponty on the visible and the invisible. It begins with the premise that  from time to time we encounter situations which precipitate a sense of slippage in our  experience of the world.  The paper proceeds to argue that the arts can provide a point of access to this experience,  and that aesthetic theory has, for example, responded to it through the development of  the notion of 'the sublime'. The writings of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and, in particular,  aspects of his text The Visible and the invisible, are presented with a view to augmenting  this aspect of aesthetic theory. Proceeding from a 'Merleau-Pontian' perspective, the  paper explores how the arts can serve to disrupt our conventional sense of space and  time - creating ripples in the substance Merleau-Ponty names as 'flesh' - so as to expose  the chiasm or blind spot in our experience of the world.  The methodology adopted is an experiential one, which draws on the writer's interaction  with the selected works of various artists as well as her own practice in glass.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glass;Sublime;Maurice Merleau-Ponty;Space;Time;Aesthetics;Visible;Invisible;Material;Immaterial</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image Thresholding Technique Based On Fuzzy Partition And Entropy Maximization</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Mansuo</field><field name="description">Thresholding is a commonly used technique in image segmentation because of its fast and easy application. For this reason threshold selection is an important issue. There are two general approaches to threshold selection. One approach is based on the histogram of the image while the other is based on the gray scale information located in the local small areas. The histogram of an image contains some statistical data of the grayscale or color ingredients. In this thesis, an adaptive logical thresholding method is proposed for the binarization of blueprint images first. The new method exploits the geometric features of blueprint images. This is implemented by utilizing a robust windows operation, which is based on the assumption that the objects have &amp;quote;C&amp;quote; shape in a small area. We make use of multiple window sizes in the windows operation. This not only reduces computation time but also separates effectively thin lines from wide lines. Our method can automatically determine the threshold of images. Experiments show that our method is effective for blueprint images and achieves good results over a wide range of images.      Second, the fuzzy set theory, along with probability partition and maximum entropy theory, is explored to compute the threshold based on the histogram of the image. Fuzzy set theory has been widely used in many fields where the ambiguous phenomena exist since it was proposed by Zadeh in 1965. And many thresholding methods have also been developed by using this theory. The concept we are using here is called fuzzy partition. Fuzzy partition means that a histogram is parted into several groups by some fuzzy sets which represent the fuzzy membership of each group because our method is based on histogram of the image . Probability partition is associated with fuzzy partition. The probability distribution of each group is derived from the fuzzy partition. Entropy which originates from thermodynamic theory is introduced into communications theory as a commonly used criteria to measure the information transmitted through a channel. It is adopted by image processing as a measurement of the information contained in the processed images. Thus it is applied in our method as a criterion for selecting the optimal fuzzy sets which partition the histogram.      To find the threshold, the histogram of the image is partitioned by fuzzy sets which satisfy a certain entropy restriction. The search for the best possible fuzzy sets becomes an important issue. There is no efficient method for the searching procedure. Therefore, expansion to multiple level thresholding with fuzzy partition becomes extremely time consuming or even impossible.      In this thesis, the relationship between a probability partition (PP) and a fuzzy C-partition (FP) is studied. This relationship and the entropy approach are used to derive a thresholding technique to select the optimal fuzzy C-partition. The measure of the selection quality is the entropy function defined by the PP and FP. A necessary condition of the entropy function arriving at a maximum is derived. Based on this condition, an efficient search procedure for two-level thresholding is derived, which makes the search so efficient that extension to multilevel thresholding becomes possible. A novel fuzzy membership function is proposed in three-level thresholding which produces a better result because a new relationship among the fuzzy membership functions is presented. This new relationship gives more flexibility in the search for the optimal fuzzy sets, although it also increases the complication in the search for the fuzzy sets in multi-level thresholding. This complication is solved by a new method called the &amp;quote;Onion-Peeling&amp;quote; method. Because the relationship between the fuzzy membership functions is so complicated it is impossible to obtain the membership functions all at once. The search procedure is decomposed into several layers of three-level partitions except for the last layer which may be a two-level one. So the big problem is simplified to three-level partitions such that we can obtain the two outmost membership functions without worrying too much about the complicated intersections among the membership functions.      The method is further revised for images with a dominant area of background or  an object which affects the appearance of the histogram of the image. The histogram is the basis of our method as well as of many other methods. A &amp;quote;bad&amp;quote; shape of the histogram will result in a bad thresholded image. A quadtree scheme is adopted to decompose the image into homogeneous areas and heterogeneous areas.  And a multi-resolution thresholding method based on quadtree and fuzzy partition is then devised to deal with these images.      Extension of fuzzy partition methods to color images is also examined. An adaptive thresholding method for color images based on fuzzy partition is proposed which can determine the number of thresholding levels automatically.      This thesis concludes that the &amp;quote;C&amp;quote; shape assumption and varying sizes of windows for windows operation contribute to a better segmentation of the blueprint images. The efficient search procedure for the optimal fuzzy sets in the fuzzy-2 partition of the histogram of the image accelerates the process so much that it enables the extension of it to multilevel thresholding. In three-level fuzzy partition the new relationship presentation among the three fuzzy membership functions makes more sense than the conventional assumption and, as a result, performs better. A novel method, the &amp;quote;Onion-Peeling&amp;quote; method, is devised for dealing with the complexity at the intersection among the multiple membership functions in the multilevel fuzzy partition. It decomposes the multilevel partition into the fuzzy-3 partitions and the fuzzy-2 partitions by transposing the partition space in the histogram. Thus it is efficient in multilevel thresholding. A multi-resolution method which applies the quadtree scheme to distinguish the heterogeneous areas from the homogeneous areas is designed for the images with large homogeneous areas which usually distorts the histogram of the image. The new histogram based on only the heterogeneous area is adopted for partition and outperforms the old one. While validity checks filter out the fragmented points which are only a small portion of the whole image. Thus it gives good thresholded images for human face images.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image thresholding;fuzzy partition;entropy maximization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispersal and mating behaviour of Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni(Froggatt) (Diptera:  Tephritidae): Implicationsfor population establishment and control.</field><field name="creator">Weldon, Christopher William</field><field name="description">The Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae), a major pest of horticulture in eastern Australia, is a relatively poor coloniser of new habitat. This thesis examines behavioural properties that might limit the ability of B. tryoni to establish new populations. As the potential for B. tryoni to establish an outbreak population may be most directly limited by mechanisms associated with dispersal and mating behaviour, these two factors were the focus of this research project. The relevance of dispersal and mating behaviour for control of outbreak populations was assessed.    Dispersal  (i) Dispersal patterns of males and females are not different.  Dispersal of post-teneral male B. tryoni from a point within an orchard near Richmond, New South Wales, was monitored following temporally replicated releases. Application of sterile insect technique (SIT) requires knowledge of dispersal from a release point so that effective release rates can be determined. In addition, dispersal following introduction to new habitat can lead to low or negative population growth and an Allee effect. In Spring and Autumn, 2001 &#65533; 2003, three different strains of B. tryoni were released: (1) wild flies reared from infested fruit collected in the Sydney Basin; (2) a laboratory-reared strain with a colour mutation (white marks); and (3) sterile flies obtained by gamma-irradiation of a mass-reared strain. Dispersal was monitored using a grid of traps baited with the male attractant, cuelure. During the majority of releases, flies were massmarked using a self-marking technique and fluorescent pigment powder to enable identification of recaptured flies. A preliminary study found that fluorescent pigment marks had no effect on adult survival and marks did not fade significantly in the laboratory over a period of five weeks after eclosion.  As cuelure repels inseminated sexually mature female B. tryoni, unbaited, coloured flat sticky traps, and black and yellow sticky sphere traps baited with a  food lure (protein autolysate solution) were used to supplement traps baited with cuelure. The effectiveness of these two sticky trap types was assessed, and recaptures used to compare patterns of dispersal from a release point by male and female B. tryoni. Fluorescent yellow (chartreuse), green, and clear unbaited flat sticky traps were relatively ineffective for monitoring dispersal of sterile male and female B. tryoni, recapturing only 0.1% of released sterile flies. Monitoring dispersal with sticky ball traps baited with protein autolysate solution was more successful, with yellow spheres and black spheres recapturing 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively. Trap colour had no effect on recaptures on flat sticky traps or sticky spheres. Equal recapture rates on yellow and black sticky sphere traps suggests that the odour of yeast autolysate solution was more important than colour for attraction of post-teneral flies to traps. Using the results of recaptures on odoriferous black and yellow sticky sphere traps within one week of release, regression equations of male and female recaptures per trap were found to be similar (Figure 4-3). This is the first study to clearly indicate that post-teneral dispersal patterns of male and female B. tryoni  released from a point do not differ, enabling the use of existing models to predict density of both sexes of B. tryoni following post-teneral dispersal.    (ii) Males disperse further in Spring than in Autumn, but this is not  temperature-related.  Analysis of replicated recaptures in traps baited with cuelure revealed that dispersal of male B. tryoni in an orchard near Richmond, New South Wales, was higher in Spring than in Autumn (Figure 5-6). As the maximum daily temperature was significantly higher in Spring than in Autumn this result was unexpected, since earlier studies have found that B. tryoni disperse at the onset of cool weather in search of sheltered over-wintering sites. Dispersal of post-teneral B. tryoni may have been affected by habitat suitability; it was found that seasonal trends in dispersal could have been influenced by local habitat variables. Low mean dispersal distances in Autumn may be explained by the presence of fruiting hosts in the orchard, or the availability of resources required by over-wintering flies.   There was no significant correlation between temperature and mean dispersal distance, suggesting that higher rates of dispersal cannot be explained by temperature-related increases in activity. Recapture rate per trap was significantly negatively correlated with increasing daily maximum and average temperature. This may have consequences for detection of B. tryoni outbreaks in quarantine areas due to reduced cuelure trap efficiency.  (iii) Maturity and source variation affect dispersal and response to cuelure.  This research indicated that most male and female B. tryoni do not disperse far from a release point, suggesting that an invading propagule would not spread far in the first generation. However, there is considerable variation in flight capability among individuals. Comparison of wild, laboratory-reared white marks, and gamma-irradiated sterile male B. tryoni indicated that mean dispersal distance and redistribution patterns were not significantly affected by fly origin. Despite no difference in dispersal distance from the release point, recaptures of wild and sterile males per Lynfield trap baited with cuelure were highest within one week after release, whereas recaptures of white marks males per trap increased in the second week. This result may offer evidence to support the hypothesis that sterile male B. tryoni respond to cuelure at an earlier age. Rearing conditions used to produce large quantities of males for sterilisation by gamma-irradiation may select for earlier sexual maturity.  Mating Behaviour  (i) Density and sex ratio do not affect mating, except at low densities.  Demographic stochasticity in the form of sex ratio fluctuations at low population  density can lead to an observed Allee effect. The effect of local group density and  sex ratio on mating behaviour and male mating success of a laboratory-adapted  strain of B. tryoni was examined in laboratory cages. In the laboratory-adapted  strain of B. tryoni used in this study, a group of one female and one male was  sufficient for a good chance of mating success. The proportion of females mated  and male mating success was not significantly affected by density or sex ratio,  although variability in male mating success was higher at low density. This could  indicate that mating success of B. tryoni can be reduced when local group density  is low owing to decreased frequency in encounters between males and females.  (ii) Mass-reared males exhibit aberrant mating behaviour, but this does not  reduce mating success.  Strong artificial selection in mass-rearing facilities may lead to decreased  competitiveness of sterile males released in SIT programs as a result of alteration  or loss of ecological and behavioural traits required in the field. The effects of  domestication and irradiation on the mating behaviour of males of B. tryoni were  investigated by caging wild, mass-reared and sterile (mass-reared and gammairradiated)  males with wild females. Mating behaviour of mass-reared males was  different from that of wild males, but behaviour of wild and sterile males was  similar. Mass-reared males were found to engage in mounting of other males  much more frequently than wild and sterile males, and began calling significantly  earlier before darkness. Male calling did not appear to be associated with female  choice of mating partners, although this does not exclude the possibility that  calling is a cue used by females to discriminate between mating partners.  Conditions used to domesticate and rear large quantities of B. tryoni for SIT may  select for an alternative male mating strategy, with mass-reared males calling  earlier and exercising less discrimination between potential mating partners.  Despite differences in behaviour of wild, mass-reared and sterile males, frequency  of successful copulations and mating success were similar.  (iii) Pheromone-calling by males was increased in larger aggregations but  this did not result in significantly more female visits.  Finally, large laboratory cages with artificial leks were used to investigate the  importance in B. tryoni of male group size for female visitation at lek sites and  initiation of male pheromone-calling. Calling propensity of male B. tryoni was  increased by the presence of conspecific males. Females visited the largest lek  more frequently than single males, but there was no correlation between lek size  and female visitation. Female B. tryoni had a limited capacity to perceive a  difference between the number of calling males; female visitation at leks was only  weakly associated with male calling, suggesting that lek size and the number of  pheromone-calling males may not be the only factor important in locating mates  in B. tryoni. The weak, but positive correlation between male calling and female  visitation may indicate that passive attraction maintains lek-mating in B. tryoni.  Further studies are essential on mating behaviour of B. tryoni, including  identification of male mating aggregations in the field, measurement of habitat  variables associated with male aggregations, the influence of density on wild B.  tryoni mating success, and the role of pheromone-calling, in order to optimise use  of SIT for control of this pest.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bactrocera tryoni;density;dipersal;laboratory domestication;lek mass-rearing;mating behaviour;pest monitoring;Queensland fruit fly;sterile insect technique</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Triage Nursing Practice in Australian Emergency Departments 2002-2004: An Ethnography</field><field name="creator">Fry, Margaret</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study provides insight and understanding, which is needed to educate and support the Triage Nursing role in Australian Emergency Departments (EDs). The triage role has emerged to address issues in providing efficient emergency care. However, Triage Nurses and educators have found the role challenging and not well understood.  Method: Sampling was done first by developing a profile of 900 nurses who undertake the triage role in 50 NSW EDs through survey techniques. Purposive sampling was then done with data collected from participant observation in four metropolitan EDs (Level 4 and 6), observations and interviews with 10 Triage Nurses and the maintenance of a record of secondary data sources. Analysis used standard content and thematic analysis techniques.  Findings: An ED culture is reflected in a standard geography of care and embedded beliefs and rituals that sustain a cadence of care. Triage Nurses to accomplish their role and maintain this rhythm of care used three processes: gatekeeping, timekeeping and decision-making. When patient overcrowding occurred the three processes enabled Triage Nurses to implement a range of practices to restore the cadence of care to which they were culturally oriented.

Scott gives a survey of results connected with these classical Seifert spaces, in particular he shows they correspond to 3-manifolds having one of six of the eight 3-dimensional geometries (in the sense of Thurston). Essentially, a classical Seifert manifold is a S1-bundle over a 2-orbifold. More generally, a Seifert manifold is the total space of a bundle over a 2-orbifold with flat fibres. It is natural to ask if these generalised Seifert manifolds describe geometries of higher dimension. Ue has considered the geometries of orientable Seifert 4-manifolds (which have general fibre a torus). He proves that (with a finite number of exceptions orientable manifolds of eight of the 4-dimensional geometries are Seifert fibred. However, Seifert manifolds with a hyperbolic base are not necessarily geometric. In this paper, we seek to extend Ue's work to the non-orientable case.      Firstly, we will show that Seifert spaces over an aspherical base are determined (up to fibre preserving homeomorphism) by their fundamental group sequence. Furthermore when the base is hyperbolic, a Seifert space is determined (up to fibre preserving homeomorphism) by its fundamental group. This generalises the work of Zieschang, who assumed the base has no reflector curves, the fibre was a torus and that a monodromy of a loop surrounding a cone point is trivial. Then we restrict to the 4 dimensional case and find necessary and sufficient conditions for Seifert 4 manifolds over hyperbolic or Euclidean orbifolds to be geometric in the sense of Thurston. Ue proved that orientable Seifert 4-manifolds with hyperbolic base are geometric if and only if the monodromies are periodic, and we will prove that we can drop the orientable condition. Ue also proved that orientable Seifert 4-manifolds with a Euclidean base are always geometric, and we will again show the orientable assumption is unnecessary.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seifert manifold</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hopeful Politics: The Interregnum Utopias</field><field name="creator">Hayduk, Ulf Christoph</field><field name="description">The period of English history between the second Civil War and the Restoration opened up seemingly unlimited possibilities for shaping the country&#65533;s future. The period likewise witnessed an unprecedented surge of political imagination, a development which is particularly visible in Interregnum utopianism. More than ever before, utopianism orientates itself to a hopeful and expectant reality. It is no longer fictional or contemplative. Its ambitions and fulfilment are political; there is a drive towards active political participation. Utopianism reshapes its former boundaries and reinvents itself as reality utopianism. Considering this new reality-orientated identity, the utopias of the 1650s are especially useful in providing an insight into the political imagination of this period. This thesis studies three reality utopias of the 1650s: Winstanley&#65533;s The Law of Freedom, Harrington&#65533;s Oceana and Hobbes&#65533;s Leviathan. Each work represents a uniquely different utopian vision: Winstanley imagines an agrarian communism, Harrington revives classical republicanism, and Hobbes stresses absolute sovereignty. These three different utopian visions not only illustrate the range of the political imagination; they provide an opportunity to examine different ways to deal with the existing political and social concerns of the Interregnum and different perspectives for ideal solutions. Interregnum utopianism is shaped by the expectations and violence of the English Revolution and accordingly it is characterised by the heightened hopes and fears of its time. Despite substantial differences in the three utopias, the elemental hopes and fears expressed in these works remain similar. The hope for change and a better future is negotiated textually with a fear of anarchy and violence. In the end a compromise between opportunity and security has to be found. It is this compromise that shapes the face of Interregnum utopianism and reflects a major aspect of the post-revolutionary political imagination in England.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Utopia;Hobbes;Winstanley;Harrington;Leviathan;Oceana;English Interregnum;English Civil War;English Republic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular typing and evolution of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</field><field name="creator">Hu, Honghua</field><field name="description">Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a common cause of salmonellosis among humans and animals worldwide.

However, there exist quite a number of strains of Typhimurium that cannot be defined by the phage-typing scheme. Furthermore, the knowledge of evolutionary relationships among isolates of different phage types is still very limited and the genetic basis of phage type variation remains largely unknown. To address these issues, this study focused on molecular typing and evolution of Typhimurium.  Fluorescent amplified-fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was applied to 46 Typhimurium isolates comprising nine phage types in Australia using the restriction enzymes MseI and EcoRI and MseI +1 / EcoRI +1 primer pair combinations. The selected phage types, DT9, DT135, DT64, DT44, DT126, DT12a, DT1, DT141 and DT108, have been dominant or frequent phage types in animal and human infections in Australia in recent years. AFLP in the present study showed a very good discrimination power with Simpson index of diversity of 0.98, 35 different AFLP patterns were observed in the 46 isolates studied. The tree based on AFLP patterns showed good correlation with phage type, grouped most Typhimurium isolates by phage type, and differentiated all nine phage types. Furthermore, 84 phage-type specific polymorphic AFLP fragments, for which presence or absence correlated with phage type (including 25 with one exception to phage-type specificity) were observed in the 46 strains studied.   Eighteen phage-type specific AFLP fragments were cloned and sequenced. Sixteen are of known genes or have a homologue in the databases. It was found a predominance of phage and plasmid genes rather than mutational changes in the AFLP fragments studied. Of the 18 cloned and sequenced AFLP fragments, only four relate to mutational changes in the S. enterica chromosome, the other 14 comprise DNA of mobile elements: nine are phage related, three are plasmid related and two are gain of DNA from unknown origin.   Twelve of the 18 sequenced phage-type specific AFLP markers are polymorphic because the DNA is present or absent as indicated by Southern hybridization. Two of these markers were successfully used in preliminary PCR-based typing of 30 DT9 and 29 DT135 isolates from worldwide collections. 27 of the 30 DT9 isolates and all DT135 isolates tested were correctly categorized. The results implied a good potential to use the sequence of these fragments as the basis for a multiplex PCR or a microarray based molecular &#65533;phage&#65533; typing method for Typhimurium.  This thesis also studied the molecular evolutionary relationships among the same set of 46 Typhimurium isolates using mutational changes detected by AFLP, or analysis of intergenic regions and their flanking genes in genome sequences. The complete genome sequence of Typhimurium LT2 was analysed by computer modelled AFLP. The polymorphic AFLP fragments, which matched with the modelled LT2 AFLP fragments, were amplified and sequenced by LT2 genome based primers to determine the changes. Forty-nine intergenic regions with higher pairwise differences between LT2 and Typhi CT18 were amplified and sequenced using LT2 genome based primers for one isolate of each phage type. 51 polymorphic sites were detected consisting of 18 in AFLP fragments and 33 in intergenic regions or their flanking genes. PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and SNaPshot were used to further investigate the distribution of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected in intergenic regions in all isolates studied.  Of the 18 mutational changes detected in AFLP fragments, eight were indels (insertions / deletions) and ten single base substitutions. Of the eight indels, four were in genes, three in intergenic regions, and one covered adjacent intergenic and coding regions. The four indels in genes all caused frameshift mutations, including three single base indels and one 19 bp deletion. Of the ten substitutions, one was in an intergenic region and nine in genes comprising three synonymous and six non-synonymous substitutions.   Of the 33 polymorphic sites detected from sequences of 23 intergenic regions and their flanking genes, one was IS200 insertion and 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 30 were single base substitutions and two were single base indels. Nine of the 33 variations were found in the flanking genes, which were all single base substitutions comprising four synonymous, four non-synonymous substitutions and one non-sense mutation.   More non-synonymous than synonymous substitutions were found for those in coding regions within Typhimurium, indicating that slightly deleterious intraspecies mutations can be fixed within clones, such as various lineages of Typhimurium.  The 51 polymorphic sites, which were inferred from sequences of both mutation related AFLP fragments, and intergenic regions and their flanking genes, gave a single phylogenetic tree of the 46 Typhimurium isolates studied. All sequences involved were compared with the homologous sequences in the available S. enterica genome sequences for serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Gallinarum, Enteritidis and Pullorum and this enabled the determination of the direction of the mutational changes in the isolates studied and the root of the phylogenetic tree. There were only two events inferred to have occurred twice, the remaining 49 polymorphisms can be explained by a single event. The data indicated that Typhimurium has a very strong clonal structure with a very low level of recombination over the time for diversification of Typhimurium as majority of clonal variations are from point mutations rather than recombination.  The phylogenetic tree based on mutational changes showed that most Typhimurium isolates of a given phage type are in the same evolutionary group, but that some phage types appear to have arisen more than once. Comparison of the phylogenetic tree with AFLP data gave examples of unrelated isolates of a given phage type having common AFLP fragments comprising plasmid or phage genes, supporting the view that phage type can be determined by presence of specific phages or plasmids. The mutation-based tree showed that six of the nine phage types studied appeared to have a single origin, at least for the isolates studied. It also found that DT1 and DT44 had two independent origins even for the limited set of strains used. The distribution of DT12a isolates into two groups could be explained that the group of three DT12a isolates were derived from the other group of four DT12a isolates, where the root of the tree might be. The data also confirmed that DT64 arose from DT9.  The phylogenetic tree that was generated based on essentially mutational changes provides clear relationships of the closely related Typhimurium isolates with high level of consistency and reasonable confidence. This study provided one of the few analyses of relationships of isolates within a clone. Matching actual AFLP with computer modeled AFLP and sequencing intergenic regions provide very good new strategies to identify mutational polymorphisms and to study the molecular evolutionary relationships in the closely related isolates.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecular typing;Molecular evolution;AFLP;Phage typing;Salmonella;Typhimurium</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double Accounting for Goodwill- A Problem Redefined</field><field name="creator">Bloom, Martin Harlod</field><field name="description">The function of accounting is to provide users with useful information in making economic decisions. Information regarding goodwill, a major constituent of the value of many listed companies, is likely to be useful in making decisions relating to those companies.   A historical review of accounting literature, including professional standards, relating to methods of accounting for purchased goodwill showed that none of them has stood the test of time. The current trend towards an impairment paradigm will not resolve the issue satisfactorily because it produces, at best, a partial solution. The difficulty in accounting meaningfully for goodwill is compounded because, given its foundation in historical cost principles, accounting has been unable to present any information at all with regard to internally generated goodwill within the confines of the traditional Balance Sheet. This, in turn, has led to the evasion of the reality that the two forms of goodwill are inextricably merged.   Trying to account satisfactorily for goodwill has been a prime example of R.R. Sterling&#65533;s &#65533;issues conceived in a way that they are in principle unresolvable&#65533;. The problem was accordingly redefined as being to find a method by which the current level of information relating to goodwill in the financial statements contained in a company&#65533;s Annual Report could be improved. This thesis seeks to identify a logically defensible method of accounting for goodwill which addresses the redefined problem. It builds upon the historical research undertaken, combined with a priori reasoning, to propose an additional financial statement which is a modification of nineteenth century &#65533;double accounting&#65533; in a modern context. This statement, which goes far to solve the redefined problem, also furnishes information regarding the company&#65533;s market capitalization at balance date and is termed the Market Capitalization Statement (&#65533;MCS&#65533;). While the idea of furnishing market capitalization data to readers of the Annual Report is not new, it is believed that this is the first time such data has been systematically linked with the Balance Sheet to provide an objective, integrated and meaningful view of goodwill in the financial statements.   The practical application and simplicity of the MCS are illustrated by a range of examples drawn from Australian &#65533;dot-com&#65533; companies over a period of time which saw considerable fluctuation in both goodwill and market capitalization, supplemented by examining data relating to some of Australia&#65533;s largest listed companies over the same period. These examples demonstrate that the MCS has the potential to provide significant information not available in conventional financial statements, while freeing the traditional Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account to present information in a more meaningful and less distorted way.   Finally, the MCS is noted as still being subject to certain problems and distortions in the context of the historical cost basis of the remaining financial statements. It is shown that, if used in the context of an exit price based system, Chambers&#65533; CoCoA, many of these distortions are removed. The MCS also complements the information provided by CoCoA as originally formulated.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accounting for goodwill;double account;market capitalization;amortization;impairment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of International Courts and Tribunals in International Environmental Law</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Tim</field><field name="description">International environmental law is one of the most dynamic fields of public international law, and has rapidly acquired great breadth and sophistication. Yet the rate of global environmental decline has also increased and is accelerating. Halting and reversing this process is a challenge of effective governance, requiring institutions that can ensure that the now impressive body of environmental norms is faithfully implemented. This thesis explores whether and to what extent international courts and tribunals can play a useful role in international environmental regimes. Consideration is given to the threefold function of adjudication in resolving environmental disputes, in promoting compliance with environmental standards, and in developing environmental rules.  The thesis is divided into three Parts. The first Part examines the spectrum of adjudicative bodies that have been involved in the resolution of environmental disputes, situates these within the evolution of institutions for compliance control, and offers a reassessment of their relevance in contemporary environmental governance. The second Part critically assesses the contribution that arbitral awards and judicial decisions have made to the development of norms and principles of environmental law, examining case law relating to transboundary pollution, shared freshwater resources and marine  environmental protection. In the third Part of the thesis consideration is given to three looming challenges for international environmental litigation: accommodating greater  levels of public participation in adjudicative processes, resolving practical problems  stemming from the interaction among multiple jurisdictions, and ensuring that specialised courts and tribunals do not apply environmental norms in a parochial manner that privileges the policy objectives of issue-specific regimes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international law;international environment law;dispute settlement;international courts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational case-based redesign for people with  ability impairment: Rethinking, reuse and  redesign learning for home modification practice</field><field name="creator">Bridge, Catherine Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Home modification practice for people with impairments of ability involves redesigning  existing residential environments as distinct from the creation of a new dwelling. A  redesigner alters existing structures, fittings and fixtures to better meet the occupant&#65533;s  ability requirements. While research on case-based design reasoning and healthcare  informatics are well documented, the reasoning and process of redesign and its  integration with individual human functional abilities remains poorly understood.  Developing a means of capturing redesign knowledge in the form of case documentation  online provides a means for integrating and learning from individual case-based  redesign episodes where assessment and interventions are naturally linked.  A key aim of the research outlined in this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the  redesign of spaces for individual human ability with the view to computational  modelling. Consequently, the foundational knowledge underpinning the model  development includes design, redesign, case-based building design and human  functional ability. Case-based redesign as proposed within the thesis, is a method for  capturing the redesign context, the residential environment, the modification and the  transformational knowledge involved in the redesign.  Computational simulation methods are traditionally field dependent. Consequently, part  of the research undertaken within this thesis involved the development of a framework  for analysing cases within an online case-studies library to validate redesign for  individuals and a method of acquiring reuse information so as to be able to estimate the  redesign needs of a given population based on either their environment or ability profile.  As home modification for people with functional impairments was a novel application  field, an explorative action-based methodological approach using computational  modelling was needed to underpin a case-based reasoning method. The action-based  method involved a process of articulating and examining existing knowledge, suggesting  new case-based computational practices, and evaluating the results. This cyclic process  led to an improvement cycle that included theory, computational tool development and  practical application.  The rapid explosion of protocols and online redesign communities that utilise Web  technologies meant that a web-based prototype capable of acquiring cases directly from  home modification practitioners online and in context was both desirable and  achievable.  The first online version in 1998-99, encoded home modification redesigns using static  WebPages and hyperlinks. This motivated the full-scale more dynamic and robust  HMMinfo casestudies prototype whose action-based development is detailed within this  thesis. The home modification casestudies library results from the development and  integration of a novel case-based redesign model in combination with a Human-  Activity-Space computational ontology. These two models are then integrated into a  relational database design to enable online case acquisition, browsing, case reuse and  redesign learning.  The application of the redesign ontology illustrates case reuse and learning, and presents  some of the implementation issues and their resolution. Original contributions resulting  from this work include: extending case-based design theory to encompass redesign and  redesign models, distinguishing the importance of human ability in redesign and the  development of the Human-Activity-Space ontology. Additionally all data models were  combined and their associated inter-relationships evaluated within a prototype made  available to redesign practitioners.  v  Reflective and practitioner based evaluation contributed enhanced understanding of  redesign case contribution dynamics in an online environment. Feedback from redesign  practitioners indicated that gaining informed consent to share cases from consumers of  home modification and maintenance services, in combination with the additional time  required to document a case online, and reticence to go public for fear of critical  feedback, all contributed to a less than expected case library growth. This is despite  considerable interest in the HMMinfo casestudies website as evidenced by web usage  statistics. Additionally the redesign model described in this thesis has practical  implications for all design practitioners and educators who seek to create new work by  reinterpreting, reconstructing and redesigning spaces.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing;disability;home modification;functionality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ECOLOGY OF THE IMAGE</field><field name="creator">Lopes, Abby Mellick</field><field name="description">We know very little about the ecology of our designed world. Contrary to all appearances, design is not about making objects. It is rather about structuring the conditions for life. Design is our second nature, naturalising changes in our ways of living. Yet it also conceals dangers and diminishes our sensitivity to respond to them. The security offered by the televisual image &#65533; and the solace of design&#65533;s promise to remove all environmental risks &#65533; are fictions.  Ecology of the Image is a critical exploration of idealism in design. Drawing on hermeneutic phenomenology, socio-cultural and design theory, it argues that design is not a value-free practice but structures epistemological attitudes into the world. Ideas are material elements of our environments. This thesis offers an explanation of how idealism circulates within the designed world, fashioning our minds, bodies and environments.  The televisual is analysed as a normative phenomenon that inducts us into a way of seeing and understanding the world. Its vision of the affluent good life inspires and gives purpose to desire, and sustains what Manzini has called &#65533;product based well being&#65533;. The thesis argues that the televisual puts us out of touch with the consequences of its vision; it diminishes our capacity for forethought. This results in the generation of unacknowledged, yet self-endangering environmental feedback.  Environmental problems force us to take account of design&#65533;s hidden rationales. Only at five minutes to midnight, for example, do we realise that the stock and supply of potable water is endangered. The problem is not so much this late recognition, but that design led us to believe in water&#65533;s abundance. This situation demands the development of an ecological understanding of our designed worlds that can inform future actions.  The sign, particularly as it has been mobilised in cultural theory, plays a leading role in this design situation and the perceptions it supports. The sign is utilised for its ability to denaturalise appearances &#65533; to &#65533;read&#65533; design&#65533;s claims on the world.  Finally, the thesis turns to the designer-in-training in the process of acquiring instrumental skills and worldviews. It proposes a research strategy that inscribes  environmental consciousness into the design process &#65533; situating the designer in the midst of semiotic and material worlds. Through its observational methodology it outlines ways of first understanding, then of intervening and generating changes in our &#65533;ideal&#65533; world.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design theory;phenomenology;image;design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STATIC SHAPE CONTROL OF LAMINATED COMPOSITE PLATE SMART STRUCTURE USING PIEZOELECTRIC ACTUATORS &#65533;</field><field name="creator">Chee, Clinton Yat Kuan</field><field name="description">The application of static shape control was investigated in this thesis particularly for a composite plate configuration using piezoelectric actuators. A new electro-mechanically coupled mathematical model was developed for the analysis and is based on a third order displacement field coupled with a layerwise electric potential concept. This formulation, TODL, is then implemented into a finite element program. The mathematical model represents an improvement over existing formulations used to model intelligent structures using piezoelectric materials as actuators and sensors. The reason is TODL does not only account for the electro-mechanical coupling within the adaptive material, it also accounts for the full structural coupling in the entire structure due to the piezoelectric material being attached to the host structure. The other significant improvement of TODL is that it is applicable to structures which are relatively thick whereas existing models are based on thin beam / plate theories. Consequently, transverse shearing effects are automatically accounted for in TODL and unlike first order shear deformation theories, shear correction factors are not required.              The second major section of this thesis uses the TODL formulation in static shape control. Shape control is defined here as the determination of shape control parameters, including actuation voltage and actuator orientation configuration, such that the structure that is activated using these parameters will conform as close as possible to the desired shape. Several shape control strategies and consequently algorithms were developed here. Initial investigations in shape control has revealed many interesting issues which have been used in later investigations to improve shape controllability and also led to the development of improved algorithms. For instance, the use of discrete actuator patches has led to greater shape controllability and the use of slopes and curvatures as additional control criteria have resulted in significant reduction in internal stresses. The significance of optimizing actuator orientation and its relation to piezoelectric anisotropy in improving shape controllability has also been presented. Thus the major facets of shape control has been brought together and the algorithms developed here represent a comprehensive strategy to perform static shape control.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Smart Structures;Piezoelectric Actuators;Shape Control;Finite Element;Intelligent Composite Structures;Actuator Orientation;Voltage Optimization;High Order Displacement Field;Thick Composites;Electro-mechanical Coupling;Adaptive Material</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining vocal quality in female classical singers: pedagogical, acoustical and perceptual studies</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Helen Frances</field><field name="description">The technique of &#65533;open throat&#65533; is a pedagogical concept transmitted through the oral tradition of singing. This thesis explored the pedagogical perceptions and practices of &#65533;open throat&#65533; using empirical methodologies to assess technical skill and associated vocal quality. In the first study (Mitchell, Kenny, Ryan, &amp; Davis, 2003), we assessed the degree of consensus amongst singing pedagogues regarding the definition of, and use in the singing studio of the technique called &#65533;open throat.&#65533; Results indicated that all fifteen pedagogues described &#65533;open throat&#65533; technique as fundamental to singing training and were positive about the sound quality it achieved, especially in classical singing. It was described as a way of maximising pharyngeal space or abducting the false vocal folds. Hypotheses generated from pedagogical beliefs expressed in this first study were then tested acoustically (Mitchell &amp; Kenny, 2004a, 2004b). Six advanced singing students sang in two conditions: &#65533;optimal&#65533; (O), using maximal open throat, &#65533;sub-optimal&#65533; (SO), using reduced open throat and loud sub-optimal (LSO) to control for the effect of loudness. From these recordings, acoustic characteristics of vibrato (Mitchell &amp; Kenny, 2004b) and energy distribution (Mitchell &amp; Kenny, 2004a) were examined. Subsequent investigations of the vibrato parameters of rate, extent and onset, revealed that extent was significantly reduced and onset increased when singers did not use the technique. As inconsistent vibrato is considered indicative of poor singing, it was hypothesized that testing the energy distribution in these singers&#65533; voices in each condition would identify the timbral changes associated with open throat. Visual inspection of long term average spectra (LTAS) confirmed differences between O and SO, but conventional measures applied to long term average spectra (LTAS), comparing energy peak height [singing power ratio (SPR)] and peak area [energy ratio (ER)] were not sensitive to the changes identified through visual inspection of the LTAS. These results were not consistent with the vibrato findings and suggest that conventional measures of SPR and ER are not sufficiently sensitive to evaluate LTAS. In the fourth study, fifteen expert listeners consistently and reliably identified the presence of open throat technique with 87% accuracy (Mitchell &amp; Kenny, in press). In the fifth study, LTAS measurements were examined with respect to the perceptual ratings of singers. There was no relationship between perceptual rankings of vocal beauty and acoustic rankings of vocal quality (Kenny &amp; Mitchell, 2004, in press). There is a vast literature of spectral energy definitions of good voice but the studies in this thesis have indicated that current acoustic methods are limited in defining vocal quality. They also suggest that current work in singing has not sufficiently incorporated perceptual ratings and descriptions of sound quality or the relationship between acoustic and perceptual factors with pedagogical practices.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">open throat;singing technique;vocal quality;vocal training;vibrato;long term average spectra;perceptual ratings</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drug and Therapeutics Committees: Studies in Australian hospitals</field><field name="creator">Tan, Ee Lyn</field><field name="description">Australia&#65533;s policy on Quality Use of Medicines (QUM) aims to achieve appropriate use of medicines and improved health outcomes. Drug and Therapeutics Committees (DTCs) are educators, policy makers as well as financial gatekeepers in matters relating to medicine use. Increasingly, DTCs are also involved in risk management and clinical governance. As such, DTCs could be considered to be QUM advocates in the institutions in which they function. In a health care arena where there are escalating demands on high standards of clinical practice, quality assessment and improvement is essential in ensuring safe and effective patient care. Given the role DTCs play in safeguarding the interests of the stakeholders of the health care system, research into ways in which DTC performance could be enhanced is required.    Although indicators specific to DTCs exist, the literature does not seem to provide straightforward answers to the question of what is currently being done in terms of quality assessment and quality improvement of DTCs. In the absence of such data, an opportunity for research is clearly identified. The first aim of this research project was to gain insight into the current activities undertaken by, and challenges facing Australian DTCs. Following this, the second aim was to explore ways in which DTC performance could be augmented.    In addressing the first aim of this project, a national survey of Australian DTCs was conducted. These findings reinforce the evidence in the literature about the roles, structure and stakeholder expectations of DTCs. Our research also documents DTCs&#65533; quality improvement initiatives and barriers to DTC activities. It appears that there is little support available to Australian DTCs. Further, a case study was undertaken in order to gain an understanding of the depth and detail of DTC operations. An audit of a DTC in an Australian hospital was conducted. This study revealed that DTC decisions are being implemented in an ad hoc manner. In fact, there were no strategies (or action) planned to implement the majority of their decisions. This could have an impact on DTC performance.    In view of this finding, qualitative methods were used to explore stakeholder opinions regarding the implementation of DTC decisions and policies. Stakeholders believed that strategies used to implement DTC policies should be targeted (to the audience as well as the type of decision/policy being implemented), timely, and delivered at the point of care. Face-to-face strategies were perceived to be more effective than printed materials, particularly when an influence on clinical practice was desired. Stakeholders also felt that the lack of resources was a significant barrier to DTC performance augmentation. This probably contributed to a lack of follow-up (or review) of implemented policies. According to stakeholders, other barriers to policy implementation include a lack of ownership of policies, low DTC profile, and an over-reliance on pharmacy to implement DTC decisions. Stakeholders felt one of the ways in which DTC performance could be improved was to prioritise DTC decisions for implementation.    In pursuit of a method to prioritise DTC decisions, a survey was conducted. Stakeholders identified patient safety, cost, and the practice of evidence-based medicine as domains of important DTC decisions. The results also suggest that stakeholders recognise the need for the prioritisation of DTC decisions for implementation. Stakeholders implied that higher priority would be assigned to DTC decisions considered to be important. In a follow-up survey, stakeholders (including doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and DTC members) seemed to have agreement of the primary domains of DTC decisions. Higher levels of importance and higher priority were assigned to decisions involving the primary domains of patient safety and cost. However, level of importance and priority assignment were not consistently correlated.     The work presented in this thesis suggests that there are ways to improve DTC performance. Although conducted primarily on hospital-based DTCs, it is anticipated that the lessons learnt could be applied to state-based, or even, Area Health-based DTCs. In conclusion, this research found that there was a range of views regarding &#65533;importance&#65533; and prioritisation for implementation. Social, organisational, as well as environmental factors may contribute to this. Future research should examine other possible factors contributing to the importance and priority of DTC decisions, so that DTC policy could be appropriately implemented into practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug and Therapeutics Committees (DTCs);qualitative methods;Australian hospitals;quantitative methods;decision implementation;prioritisation for implementation;decision importance;quality use of medicines</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resisting the Welfare State:  An examination of the response of the Australian Catholic Church to the national health schemes of the 1940s and 1970s</field><field name="creator">Belcher, Helen Maria</field><field name="description">This thesis extends and refines a growing body of literature that has highlighted the impact of Catholic social principles on the development of welfare state provision.  It suggests that Catholic social teaching is intent on preserving the role of the traditional family, and keeping power out of the hands of the state.  Much of this literature, however, is concerned with European experience (Esping-Andersen, 1990; Castles, 1993; van Kersbergen, 1995).  More recently Smyth (2003) has augmented this research through an examination of the influence of Catholic social thought on Australian welfare policy.  He concludes that the Australian Church, at least up to the 1970s, preferred a &#65533;welfare society&#65533; over a &#65533;welfare state&#65533;, an outlook shared by the wider Australian community.    Following the lead of Smyth, this thesis extends the insights of the European research through an examination of Catholic Church resistance to ALP proposals to introduce national health schemes in the 1940s and the 1970s.  These appeared to satisfy the Church&#65533;s commitment to the poorest and most marginalised groups in the community.   Why, then, did the Australian Church resist the proposals?  The thesis concludes that there are at least two possible ways of interpreting Catholic social teaching &#65533; a preconciliar interpretation that minimises the role of the state, and a postconciliar interpretation that allows for an active, albeit limited, state.  The adoption of either is informed by socio-political factors.  The thesis, then, concludes that the response of the Church in the 1940s and the 1970s was conditioned by socio-political and historical factors that inclined the Australian Catholic Church towards a conservative view of welfare.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Church;health policy;religion;Catholic social teaching;Australia;welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading O.J. Simpson: Everyday Rhetoric as Gift and Commodity in I Want to Tell You.</field><field name="creator">Williams, Marise</field><field name="description">The Bronco Chase and arrest of O.J. Simpson for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman, and his subsequent criminal trial became one of the most captivating, mass-mediated events of the last decade of the twentieth century. Simpson's iconic celebrity status and his race as an African-American inflamed the notoriety of the crime. An insatiable spectatorial desire for Simpson and narratives concerning his alleged involvement in the Brentwood murders engulfed the American public and American culture for thirty-two months.  An excessive scrutiny of his identity by the media, law and order professionals and the populace generated a racially charged discursive cacophony. The memoir Simpson published during his remand to raise funds for his defense expenses, I Want to Tell You: My Response to Your Letters, Your Messages, Your Questions, allows for a productive critical study of everyday rhetoric and the commodity fetishism of celebrity. Released in late January 1995, during the first week of the prosecution&#65533;s opening statements in the criminal trial, I Want to Tell You was Simpson's first public comment following the nationally televised reading of his suicide note and his spectacular arrest on June 17, 1994. The intercalation of Simpson&#65533;s narrative utterance with 108 of the more than three hundred thousand letters he received from June to December 1994 as Los Angeles County Jail inmate 4013970 is a practical manifestation of the use value and exchange value of fame. The reciprocity of the epistolic, the phatic demands of address, the etiquette of fan mail and hate mail, the gift of the written text, vulnerable and resonant, reveal an adherence to the symbiotic dynamic of the celebrity-fan, writer-reader, dyadic relation and its currency.

The profiles are used for data prefetching, selection of most suitable wireless network and cache management on the mobile device in order to optimally utilize the device&#65533;s storage capacity and available bandwidth. Some of the inherent characteristics of mobile devices due to user movements are &#65533;non-persistent connection, limited bandwidth and storage capacity, changes in mobile device&#65533;s geographical location and connection (eg. connection can be from GPRS to WLAN to Bluetooth). New research is being carried out in making mobile devices work more efficiently by reducing and/or eliminating their limitations. The focus of this research is to propose, evaluate and test a new user profiling technique which specifically caters to the needs of the mobile device users who are required to access large amounts of data, possibly more than the device storage capability during the course of the day or week. This work involves the development of an intelligent user profiling system along with mobile device caching system which will first allocate weight (priority) to the different sets and subsets of the total given data based on user&#65533;s location, user&#65533;s appointment information, user&#65533;s preferences, device capabilities and available networks. Then the profile will automatically change the data weights with user movements, history of cached data access and characteristics of available networks. The Adaptive User and Device Profiles were designed to handle broad range of the issues associated with: &#65533;Changing network types and conditions &#65533;Limited storage capacity and document type support of mobile devices &#65533;Changes in user data needs due to their movements at different times of the day Many research areas have been addressed through this research but the primary focus has remained on the following four core areas.

Pseudo-modular Hopf algebras are a class of Z_2-graded ribbon Hopf algebras that generalise the concept of a modular Hopf algebra.     The quantum superalgebra Uq(osp(1|2n)) over C is considered with q a primitive Nth root of unity for all integers N &amp;gt = 3. For such a q, a certain left ideal I of U_q(osp(1|2n)) is also a two-sided Hopf ideal, and the quotient algebra U^(N)_q(osp(1|2n)) = U_q(osp(1|2n))/I is a Z_2-graded ribbon Hopf algebra.     For all n and all N &amp;gt = 3, a finite collection of finite dimensional representations of U^(N)_q(osp(1|2n)) is defined. Each such representation of U^(N)_q(osp(1|2n)) is labelled by an integral dominant weight belonging to the truncated dominant Weyl chamber. Properties of these representations are considered: the quantum superdimension of each representation is calculated, each representation is shown to be self-dual, and more importantly, the decomposition of the tensor product of an arbitrary number of such representations is obtained for even N.     It is proved that the quotient algebra U(N)^q_(osp(1|2n)), together with the set of finite dimensional representations discussed above, form a pseudo-modular Hopf algebra when N   &amp;gt = 6 is twice an odd number.     Using this pseudo-modular Hopf algebra, we construct a topological invariant of 3-manifolds. This invariant is shown to be different to the topological invariants of 3-manifolds arising from quantum so(2n+1) at roots of unity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum superalgebras;topological invariants;three-manifolds</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AENEAS IN THE ANTIPODES  The teaching of Virgil in New South Wales schools from 1900 to the start of the 21st century</field><field name="creator">Matters, Emily Helene</field><field name="description">Aeneas in the Antipodes offers an Australian perspective on the teaching of Virgil&#65533;s poetry in the secondary school. The study examines practices in the State of New South Wales from 1900 to the early years of the twenty-first century.    The changing role of Latin in the curriculum is traced through a historical account showing the factors which caused a decline in the status and popularity of the subject from the beginning of the century to the 1970s. This decline, not confined to Australia, stimulated the introduction of new teaching methods with different emphases which were, to some extent, successful in preserving Latin from extinction in schools.    Against this background of change, Virgil remained the Latin author most frequently studied in the final year of school. Because this poetry was so consistently prescribed for public examinations, a detailed investigation is made of the questions set and of the examiners&#65533; comments on candidates&#65533; performance, as evidence of changes in expectations and hence, in teaching methods. The influence of trends in Virgilian scholarship is assessed by means of a review of all the officially recommended commentaries and secondary works. The growth of literary criticism from the 1960s is shown to have had a marked effect on syllabuses and examinations, and consequently on the approach taken in the classroom. The role of local professional organizations in supporting the teaching of Virgil has been documented, showing how the disappearance of official support for Latin teaching was to some extent counterbalanced by an increase in voluntary effort.    The resources and methods used to introduce Virgil to comparative beginners are classified and reviewed. An assessment is also offered of approaches made to teaching Virgil in English at both junior and senior secondary levels.    The final chapter reviews the changes brought about since 2000. Current teaching practices are documented through classroom observations and teacher surveys, substantiating the impression that while most students at the beginning of the twenty-first century are less prepared than their predecessors to translate Virgil independently, they are expected to attempt a far more sophisticated analysis of the literary features     Note: For appendix 3-10 please see hardcopy edition.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">latin teaching;Virgil reception in the 20th Century;Australian Eduction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourse and Configurations of Gender</field><field name="creator">Larsen, Pia</field><field name="description">My research paper is an investigation of the discourse of gender in relation to the work of  Michel Foucault, Susan Bordo, Judith Butler and the artists Louise Bourgeois, Fiona  Hall, Jo Spence and Neil Emmerson. I have applied Foucault's notion of the formation,  necessity and operations of discourses as the basis from which ideas can be articulated,  and the context within which notions of gender are formulated and challenged. I examine  the processes in discourses, such as the imposition of disciplines to control the subject,  which in turn are inscribed in the body of the subject by the subject, as they begin to  perceive and define themselves in terms of the disciplines. I use this theory on the  relationship between discourse-power-knowledge to analyse my work and that of the  artists mentioned. The work of each artist is discussed in terms of the discourse of gender  and the basis from which they critique its power, its effects on bodies and forms of  representation through a marginal discourse.  For the purposes of my work, the conclusion reached is that to disrupt the discourse of  gender entails a continual questioning and awareness of its 'truths,' processes and effects.    Description of Studio Work:  The three major works examine the power and operations of the discourse of gender on  bodies and how marginal discourses subvert these constructions. My works in paper,  printmedia and metal, in two dimensions and three, reflect the effects through forms that  seek to question limitations and extend our conception of male and female bodies. The  wall piece, Out of Order, re-configures symbols and signs from the discourse of gender  as a means of disrupting notions that gender is immutable. A swirling red line is woven  through a densely layered mass of horizontal broken lines. The addition of symbols, X  and Y chromosomes, numbers and other tokens of gender, appear at various points in this  marginal discourse on conception of 'bodies.' Mammaphone, which accompanies Out of  Order and Bullrushes, consists of an enlarged breast LP playing on a turntable. The  'tracks' are a litany of terms for the breast from slang and maternal discourses. The  turntable that 'hosts' the LP sits on top of a stylised 'flight recorder's black box,' which  suggests the hidden discourse on gender. Bullrushes, is an arrangement of 20 phallic-like  forms each on a flexible metal rod that sways with the passage of air around the work.  The work presents male bodies as durable, delicate and vulnerable despite the norms of  the masculine discourse. The intention is to put into process an interrogation of the  effects of gender on bodies and the possibilities for re-thinking the discourse of gender.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender;operations of discourses;formation;necessity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Comfort of Men: A Critical History of Managerial and Professional Men in Post-war Modernisation, Australia 1945-1965.</field><field name="creator">Trudinger, Dave</field><field name="description">This thesis is a critical history of managerial and professional men in post-Second World War Australia. The attention that I have given managerial and professional men has been determined by my own political desire to problematise the continued accomplishment of hegemony. As subjects, these men and their discursive practices enable scrutiny of the regenerative labour necessary to sustain power and necessary to realise the material results that accrue to those performing such work.      My thesis examines the practices of particular groups of managerial and professional men within four discrete social settings or terrain during the post-war period. I interrogate the operations of managerial and professional men in personnel management (the terrain of work), in market research (the terrain of the market), in parenting and marriage guidance (the terrain of the family) and in the service club Rotary (the terrain of the civic). In each of these terrains I find managerial and professional men framing problems and enacting solutions. A process or intervention that makes natural the connections of interest (of advantage or disadvantage) being constantly recreated; an intervention that expresses a comfort with the mechanics and entailments of hegemony.      To enable my critical history I apply, in each terrain, a framework comprising three core elements. I historicize the accomplishment of hegemony; testing the emergence of government and positive expressions of power during post-war modernisation in the local contexts of managerial and professional men&#65533;s interventions. I people hegemony; identifying the practices of managerial and professional men as resources for doing social relations (in particular the relations of gender and class) and crucial to the operation of hegemony. And, thirdly, I demonstrate the interventions of these men to be interested; unravelling the possessive investments managerial and professional men make through their interventions.    My scrutiny of managerial and profession men and their practices, my choice of terrains in which to study them, my analysis of the process enacted in these terrain and the sources that I have utilised are not intended to assemble a biography of men&#65533;s experiences or ideal masculinities. Rather, my thesis provides a biography of interventions in order to disassemble that which appears not to be anything in particular: the ordinary regeneration of hegemony by ordinary men doing ordinary things.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian History;Men;Masculinity;Gender;Personnel Management;Market Research;Parenting;Marriage;Fatherhood;Rotary;Service clubs;modernisation;government</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International Union Activity: Politics of Scale in the Australian Labour Movement</field><field name="creator">Schmutte, Ian Michael</field><field name="description">In recent years, industrial relations scholars have begun to discuss the &#65533;revitalisation strategies&#65533; unions are using to rebuild lost density, power, and political leverage. This thesis studies the role international activities play in the revitalisation of Australian unions. Rather than assert the importance of international activity, or emphasise the value of certain forms of international activity, the thesis seeks to  understand why unions choose to engage in particular forms of international activity.  International activity in Australian unions takes on a remarkable diversity of forms. The analysis of international activity therefore requires a theory that is capable of describing these different forms of international activity and then explaining why they exist. However most scholars have not examined the role of union agency in  choosing international activity. Within industrial relations, there is very little existing  theory or research on which to base the kind of analysis proposed for the thesis.  Most theories are ideologically driven, prescriptive accounts that either promote or challenge particular institutions or ideas about international activity. The problem is that they deal with international activity as an abstract kind of response to universal pressures of globalisation. These kinds of arguments serve well to articulate  the need for unions to &#65533;think globally&#65533;, but are ill suited to the task of the thesis, which is to explain particular forms of international activity in particular unions.  The questions about international activity that the thesis intends to answer form a point of connection between industrial relations and the related discipline of labour geography. In making the connections between labour geography theory and the analysis of union international strategy, the thesis argues for labour geography as a  political economic foundation for industrial relations in the tradition of Hyman&#65533;s  Marxist theory of industrial relations. This provides a critical theoretical perspective  and conceptual vocabulary with which to criticise and extend industrial relations research on international activity. The result is a spatialised theory organised according to topics of interest in industrial relations research that can be applied to the study of Australian international activity.  The thesis is evenly divided between developing this theory and research on international activity in the Australian union movement. Empirical analysis begins with a study of the international activities and policy of the ACTU, distinguishing  different kinds of international activity. By treating the international activities of theACTU as representative of the Australian union movement as a whole, the thesis identifies three functional levels of international activity: strategy-sharing, regional solidarity, and global regulation. The chapter also examines the material and discursive construction of the international scale within the ACTU. The thesis also analyses the international activities of three Australian unions,the TWU, LHMU and CFMEU. While all three unions engage in each level of international activity, the review of their activities shows differences in the focus of each union. The thesis suggests that the explanation for these different ratios depends in part on the spatial structure of the industries that the different unions organise.  The kind of research undertaken in this thesis has little precedent. The work of the labour geographers on international activity does not deal with union revitalisation strategy, and the research from industrial relations on the strategic aspects of international activity have not latched on to labour geography. This thesis  argues that unions scale their activities internationally for particular reasons, some of  which are structural and can be specified up front, and others that are historically  contingent and can only be explored on a case-by-case basis. In examining this &#65533;politics of scale&#65533; the thesis redefines many of the issues in the discussion of international activity and proposes a new conceptual background for industrial relations generally.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">union;internationalism;labour movement;globalisation;revitalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellularity of Twisted Semigroup Algebras of Regular Semigroups</field><field name="creator">Wilcox, Stewart</field><field name="description">There has been much interest in algebras which have a basis consisting of diagrams, which are multiplied in some natural diagrammatic way. Examples of these so-called diagram algebras include the partition, Brauer and Temperley-Lieb algebras. These three examples all have the property that the product of two diagram basis elements is always a scalar multiple of another basis element. Motivated by this observation, we find that these algebras are examples of twisted semigroup algebras. Such algebras are an obvious extension of twisted group algebras, which arise naturally in various contexts; examples include the complex numbers and the quaternions, considered as algebras over the real numbers. The concept of a cellular algebra was introduced in a famous paper of Graham and Lehrer; an algebra is called cellular if it has a basis of a certain form, in which case the general theory of cellular algebras allows us to easily derive information about the semisimplicity of the algebra and about its representation theory, even in the non-semisimple case. Many diagram algebras (including the above three examples) are known to be cellular. The aim of this thesis is to deduce the cellularity of these examples (and others) by proving a general result about the cellularity of twisted semigroup algebras. This will extend a recent result of East. In Chapters 2 and 3 we discuss semigroup theory and twisted semigroup algebras, and realise the above three examples as twisted semigroup algebras. Chapters 4 to 7 detail and extend slightly the theory of cellular algebras. In Chapter 8 we state and prove the main theorem, which shows that certain twisted semigroup algebras are cellular. Under the assumptions of the main theorem, we explore the cell representations of twisted semigroup algebras in Chapter 9. Finally in Chapter 10, we apply the theorem to various examples, including the three diagram algebras mentioned above.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">twisted semigroup algebra;cellular;diagram algebra</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical Interferometry and Mira Variable Stars</field><field name="creator">Ireland, Michael James</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a red tip/tilt and fringe  detection system at the Sydney University Stellar Interferometer  (SUSI), modelling the instrumental performance and effects of seeing at SUSI, making observations of Mira variable stars and finally modelling the atmospheres of Mira variables with physically self-consistent models. The new SUSI tip/tilt system is based around a CCD detector and has been successfully used to both track the majority of tip/tilt power in median seeing at an R magnitude of 4.5, and to provide seeing measures for post processing. The new fringe-detection system rapidly  scans 33 to 140 $\mu$m in delay and detects the fringes using two avalanche-photodiodes. It has been used to acquire  fringe data, provide user feedback and to track the fringe group-delay position. The system visibility (fringe visibility for a point source) and throughput were found to be consistent with models of the SUSI optical beam train. Observations were made of a variety of sources, including the Mira variables R Car and RR Sco, which were observed in two orthogonal polarization states. These measurements were the first successful use of Optical Interferometric Polarimetry (OIP), and enabled scattered light to be separated from bright photospheric flux. Dust scattering was found to originate from a thin shell 2-3 continuum radii from these stars, with an optical depth of 0.1 to 0.2 at 900 nm. Physical models of Mira variables including dust formation were developed, providing consistent explanations for these results as well as many other photometric and interferometric observations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical interferometry;Mira variable stars;AGB stars</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between Two Worlds: the Phenomenon of Re-emigration by Hellenes to Australia</field><field name="creator">Papadopoulos, Anthony</field><field name="description">The centrality of the thesis is the impact upon the individual Greek migrant who chose to leave his place of birth by emigrating, repatriating, and subsequently re-emigrating, and how the surreptitious nature of acculturation alters perceptions and thoughts.  The causes of such migratory translocations will be analyzed within the sociocultural and historicoeconomic conditions that appertained at the time the decisions were taken to deracinate oneself.  The study will provide an analysis of diachronic Hellenic migration and Australian immigration policies (since its inception as a federated state).  There will also be an analysis of Australia&#65533;s diachronic and dedicated immigration control mechanisms since federation, its various post-immigration integration policies of immigrants, the mass immigration program activated in the post-WWII period, and the adoption and incorporation of multiculturalism as the guiding force in migrant selection and integration.  Australia&#65533;s history, its cultural inheritance, its socioeconomic development, and its attraction as a receiving country of immigrants are analyzed, as are Australia&#65533;s xenophobia and racism at its inception, and how these twin social factors influenced its immigration program.  The study examines limitations placed upon social intercourse, employment opportunities, and other hindrances to Greek (and other non-British migrants) immigrants because of Australia&#65533;s adoption of restrictive, racially-based immigration policies.  The study focuses upon the under-development of Hellas in the first half of the twentieth century, its high unemployment and under-employment rates, and the multiple other reasons, aside form unemployment, which forced thousands of Hellenes to seek an alternative (for a better life) through internal or external migration.  Particular emphasis will be placed upon historic occasions in Greece&#65533;s history and the influence of foreign powers upon internal Greek politics.  The motivations for each distinct stage of translocation, in the lives of the respondents, will be examined within the ambit of social, cultural, economic, and historical context, which will place emphasis on the socioeconomic development of Hellas, the development of Hellenic Diaspora, Australia&#65533;s development as a receiving immigrant country, and the effects of acculturation and nostalgia upon first-generation Greek-Australians.    Given that the thesis is based upon personal recollections and detailed information that span decades of the respondents&#65533; lives, the thesis is divided into four parts for greater clarity and comprehension: the first examines respondents&#65533; lives in region of birth, their families&#65533; economic, educational, and social environment, scholastic achievements by respondents, employment status, future prospects, religiosity, hopes and aspirations, and reasons for seeking to migrate.  The second part examines respondents&#65533; lives in Australia, within the contextuality of accommodation, employment, family creation, social adaptation, language acquisition, attitude towards unionism and religion, expectations about Australia, and reasons for repatriating.    The third part analyzes repatriation and life in Greece through resettlement, accommodation, children&#65533;s schooling and adaptation, relatives&#65533; and friends&#65533; attitude, disappointments, and longing for things Australian, while it also examines re-emigratory causes and the disillusionment suffered through repatriation.  The final part assesses resettlement in Australia, and all associated social, economic, and environmental aspects, as well as respondents&#65533; children&#65533;s readaptation to different lifestyle and educational system.

Mencius (Meng Zi 371-289 BCE) is well  known to students of Chinese culture as a key figure in the history of Confucianism and  in the history of China: the second sage no less. Yet modern scholars usually study him,  if he is studied at all, for an idea of how "  Chinese"   think rather than as a thinker worth  studying for his own sake.  I decided to study Mencius as an international relations theorist in response to the  common criticism that international relations, the academic discipline, is too &amp;quote;  eurocentric". This criticism has been made many times. My goal however was not to repeat  the criticism but to find a major thinker outside the euro-centric world. Such a thinker  could be presented as an international relations theorist and thus demonstrate that we  should indeed heed the critics of euro-centrism and make studies outside the euro-centric  framework rather than simply announce that international relations is euro-centric and  proceed to make another euro-centric study.  This study of Mencius, qua international relations theorist, illustrates that point. Mencius  lived in a world of warring states and tried to bring peace and order to that world. In the  course of doing so he developed a sophisticated international relations theory which can  be used to analyse events in the contemporary world. In this thesis I offer a comparison  of Mencius and Kenneth N Waltz, a famous contemporary international relations theorist,  to show the strength of Mencius&#146; theory.  Mencius argues that an anarchical system of states can become an ordered one if the  order is legitimised by what he calls "  benevolence"  , an ethic based on universal values.  Waltz argues that values can never underpin an order that runs contrary to states&#146;  interests. Once an anarchical international system has commenced balance of power  formations will rise to stop it moving towards order. The disagreement between Mencius  and Waltz is profound; it is not simply about the patterns of international relations  ii  systems but whether a policy of reform based on values can succeed in the international  arena. Waltz, and the vast majority of international relations theorists, answer that  question in the negative. This "  ruling out"   of progress distinguishes the study of  international politics from the study of domestic politics. Mencius does not rule it out; he  offers hope for progress and reform in the international arena.  Thus the attempt to address one problem, euro-centrism, led me to approach the greatest  problem, the denial of a role for values in the international world. The thesis sets out to  show that Mencius&#146; international relations theory has greater explanatory power than the  theory of Waltz, the arch positivist. The thesis also seeks to demonstrate that it is a  mistake to rule values out of international politics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mencius;Kenneth N Waltz;international relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Making of Domestic Violence Policy by the Australian Commonwealth Government and the Government of the State of New South Wales between 1970 and 1985: An Analytical Narrative of Feminist Policy Activism</field><field name="creator">Ramsay, Janet Kay</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the processes by which domestic violence, as framed by Australian feminists from the early 1970s, was inserted into the policy agenda of governments, and developed into a comprehensive body of policy. The thesis covers the period between 1970 and 1985. Acknowledging the federal nature of the Australian polity, it examines these processes that unfolded within both the Australian Commonwealth government and the government of New South Wales.    The thesis provides a political history of domestic violence policy making in the identified period. It shows that policy responses to women escaping violent partners included both immediate measures (such as protection and justice strategies) and more long-term measures to attempt to secure the conditions for women&#65533;s financial, legal and personal autonomy. The elements found to have been most significant in shaping the development of such policies were the roles and identities of the participant players, including the driving role of the women suffering partner violence; the lack of contest in the early stages of policy achievement with established professionals in related fields; the uniquely &#65533;hybrid&#65533; role and positioning of refuge feminists; and the degree of integration and continuity which characterised the domestic violence policy process.    The thesis also investigates the relationship between domestic violence policy making and the broader women&#65533;s policy enterprise. It demonstrates the care with which those involved avoided the dangers of sensationalism and tokenism while striving for an appropriate policy response. The thesis pays particular attention to the circumstances in which feminists in the early 1970s experienced their &#65533;discovery&#65533; of domestic violence. It demonstrates the significance of social and economic circumstances in shaping the political options of feminists in the thesis period and those preceding it, and the extent to which policy possibilities are shaped by representations of the nature and functions of policy itself. Finally, the thesis investigates the relationship between the strategic processes undertaken and the policy outcomes produced, finding that policies achieved in the thesis period complemented and in some ways transcended accepted policy practice in the relevant period.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">domestic violence;women's refuges;women's shelters;policy process;women's policy;policy activism;Australian feminism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facial affect processing in delusion-prone and deluded individuals: A continuum approach to the study of delusion formation</field><field name="creator">Green, Melissa Jayne</field><field name="description">This thesis examines attentional and cognitive biases for particular facial expressions in delusion-prone and deluded individuals.  The exploration of cognitive biases in delusion-prone individuals provides one means of elucidating psychological processes that might be involved in the genesis of delusions.    Chapter 1 provides a brief review of the continuum approach to schizophrenia, and outlines recent theoretical conceptualisations of delusions. The study of schizophrenia phenomena at the symptom level has become a popular method of inquiry, given the heterogeneous phenotypic expression of schizophrenia, and the uncertainty surrounding the existence of a core neuropathology.  Delusions are one of the most commonly experienced symptoms of schizophrenia, and have traditionally been regarded as fixed, false beliefs that are pathognomonic of an organic disease process.  However, recent phenomenological evidence of delusional ideation in the general population has led to the conceptualisation of delusions as multi-dimensional entities, lying at the extreme end of a continuum from normal through to maladaptive beliefs.       Recent investigations of the information processing abnormalities in deluded individuals are reviewed in Chapter 2.  This strand of research has revealed evidence of various biases in social cognition, particularly in relation to threat-related material, in deluded individuals.  These biases are evident in probabilistic reasoning, attribution style, and attention, but there has been relatively little investigation of cognitive aberrations in delusion-prone individuals.  In the present thesis, social-cognitive biases were examined in relation to a standard series of faces that included threat-related (anger, fear) and non-threatening (happy, sad) expressions, in both delusion-prone and clinically deluded individuals.    Chapters 3 and 4 present the results of behavioural (RT, affect recognition accuracy) and visual scanpath investigations in healthy participants assessed for level of delusion- proneness.  The results indicate that delusion-prone individuals are slower at processing angry faces, and show a general (rather than emotion-specific) impairment in facial affect recognition, compared to non-prone healthy controls.  Visual scanpath studies show that healthy individuals tend to direct more foveal fixations to the feature areas (eyes, nose, mouth) of threat-related facial expressions (anger, fear).  By contrast, delusion-prone individuals exhibit reduced foveal attention to threat-related faces, combined with &#65533;extended&#65533; scanpaths, that may be interpreted as an attentional pattern of &#65533;vigilance-avoidance&#65533; for social threat.  Chapters 5 and 6 extend the work presented in Chapters 3 and 4, by investigating the presence of similar behavioural and attentional biases in deluded schizophrenia, compared to healthy control and non-deluded schizophrenia groups.  Deluded schizophrenia subjects exhibited a similar delay in processing angry faces, compared to non-prone control participants, while both deluded and non-deluded schizophrenia groups displayed a generalised affect recognition deficit.  Visual scanpath investigations revealed a similar style of avoiding a broader range of negative (anger, fear, sad) faces in deluded schizophrenia, as well as a common pattern of fewer fixations with shorter duration, and reduced attention to facial features of all faces in both deluded and non-deluded schizophrenia.  The examination of inferential biases for emotions displayed in facial expressions is presented in Chapter 7 in a study of causal attributional style.  The results of this study provide some support for a &#65533;self-serving&#65533; bias in deluded schizophrenia, as well as evidence for an inability to appreciate situational cues when making causal judgements in both delusion-prone and deluded schizophrenia.    A theoretical integration of the current findings is presented in Chapter 8, with regard to the implications for cognitive theories of delusions, and neurobiological models of schizophrenia phenomena, more generally.  Visual attention biases for threat-related facial expressions in delusion-prone and deluded schizophrenia are consistent with proposals of neural dysconnectivity between frontal-limbic networks, while attributional biases and impaired facial expression perception may reflect dysfunction in a broader &#65533;social brain&#65533; network encompassing these and medial temporal lobe regions.  Strong evidence for attentional biases and affect recognition deficits in delusion-prone individuals implicates their role in the development of delusional beliefs, but the weaker evidence for attributional biases in delusion-prone individuals suggests that inferential biases about others&#65533; emotions may be relevant only to the maintenance of delusional beliefs (or that attributional biases for others&#65533; emotional states may reflect other, trait-linked difficulties related to mentalising ability).   In summary, the work presented in this thesis demonstrates the utility of adopting a single-symptom approach to schizophrenia within the continuum framework, and attests to the importance of further investigations of aberrant social cognition in relation to the development of delusions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">delusions;delusion-prone;delusional ideation;schizophrenia;psychotic continuum;social cognition;face processing;facial affect;emotion perception;emotions;threat perception;eye movements;visual scanpaths;attribution style;reasoning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Studies of an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism</field><field name="creator">Perrem, Kilian Thomas</field><field name="description">Telomeres are specialised structures, consisting of TTAGGG DNA repeats and binding  proteins, that cap the ends of human chromosomes and maintain chromosome integrity. It has  been shown that telomeres shorten with each round of cell division in most normal human somatic  cells. It has become generally accepted that this shortening is due, in part, to the inability of DNA  polymerases to replicate the extreme ends of chromosomes which is a phenomenon known as the  &#65533;end replication problem&#65533;. An intriguing hypothesis that has emerged from these observations is  that critically shortened telomeres trigger growth arrest and senescence. This is regarded as a key  determining factor in the limited lifespan of normal cells in culture and is commonly known as the  &#65533;Telomere Hypothesis of Senescence&#65533;.  In support of this hypothesis it has been demonstrated that immortalised human cells, that  have an unlimited lifespan in culture, maintain stable telomere lengths and do not undergo  progressive telomere shortening. In most cases this is due to the ribonucleoprotein enzyme  telomerase, the activation of which is as a key step in the immortalisation process. Telomerase  compensates for sequential telomere shortening by utilising an RNA template to catalyse the  addition of repeat sequences by reverse transcription. It is absent from most normal tissue but is  present in the germline and is presumably downregulated during development. Significantly,  analysis of human tumour cells has shown that a majority also have active telomerase, which  supports the importance of immortalisation in tumourigenesis.  Previous work in this laboratory has shown that, although the majority of in vitro  immortalised cells and tumour cells that have been studied maintain telomeres by reactivation of  telomerase, a proportion do not have detectable telomerase activity. These telomerase-negative  cells still maintain telomeres, however, and this is via a mechanism(s) yet to be fully elucidated  known as Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT). ALT is characterised, in addition to lack  of telomerase activity, by extreme telomere length heterogeneity with telomere lengths ranging  from over 50 kilobases (kb) of DNA to almost undetectable. This phenotype is evident, by  Southern analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH), in all ALT cells. Alternative  mechanisms of telomere maintenance, via retrotransposition and recombination, had already been  characterised in lower eukaryotes.  It has been shown in this laboratory that ALT cell lines and tumours contain a novel type  of PML body, referred to as ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). APBs have been found in all of  the ALT cell lines so far tested and also in archival tumour sections, and contain a number of  factors which co-localise. These include PML, TTAGGG repeats, TRF 1 &amp; TRF 2 telomere  binding proteins and proteins involved in homologous recombination: RAD51 &amp; RAD52. More  recently, it has been shown that the RAD50/Mre11/Nbs1 complex, which is involved in cell cycle  checkpoint control and repair of DNA damage, is also present in APBs. The presence of these  RAD proteins in APBs is of great interest as a recombination between telomeres has been  proposed as the central mechanism by which ALT lengthens telomeres. Studies in yeast have  identified such a mechanism and it was proposed that a similar process occurred in human  immortal cells that utilise ALT. It has now been shown by this laboratory that a recombination  mechanism is indeed evident at the telomeres of ALT cells.  To date all in vitro immortalised cell lines and most tumour cell types that have been  studied have a telomere maintenance mechanism either via telomerase or ALT. Targeting  telomerase has become a major focus of anti-cancer research as inhibitors have the potential to  treat a wide variety of different tumour types. An understanding of ALT and its regulation is  likely to be important in such therapeutic strategies, as selective pressure due to telomerase  inhibition may result in ALT revertants within the tumour mass. Development of inhibitors of  both telomerase and ALT may therefore be required when targeting telomere maintenance.  The main focus of this thesis is the understanding of ALT repression in the SV40  immortalised skin fibroblast cell line GM847, as a means to further understanding the mechanism  of ALT. The data presented provide new insights into the repression of ALT and also the  relationship between telomerase and ALT which is important for our understanding of telomere  maintenance in human cancer. Hybrids formed by fusion of normal cells and ALT cells  underwent rapid telomere loss followed by senescence, indicating that normal cells contain factors  that repress ALT. This strongly suggests that ALT is recessive and is activated in part by loss or  mutation of repressors. Similar experiments were performed with ALT cells and telomerasepositive  cells, and the resulting hybrids were all telomerase-positive and ALT repressed. It is  possible that the same negative regulators are involved as additional data show that telomerase  does not act as an ALT inhibitor. Exogenous expression of telomerase in ALT cells did not  repress ALT, but both mechanisms co-existed in these transfected cells. This result provides a  further argument for targeting both ALT and telomerase in any future treatments of tumours as it  demonstrates in principle that these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.  A serendipitous finding was that a dominant-negative telomerase catalytic subunit caused  telomere shortening in ALT cells, had not been reported elsewhere, and indeed was in contrast to  previous findings. This provided further evidence for a link between telomerase and ALT as it  suggested that there were essential components that were common to both pathways. As a further  means to understanding ALT repression, a series of experiments was performed to determine the  chromosomal localisation of ALT repressor(s) by microcell mediated chromosome transfer. This  was done to facilitate the eventual isolation of repressors. A repressor of ALT in the chemically  immortalised fibroblast cell line SUSM-1, had been reported to be localised to chromosome 7.  This result could not be repeated in the GM847 cell line, but ALT repression was evident in  GM847 cells upon transfer of chromosome 6.  Another important question regarding the nature of ALT is the structure and sequence of  the long heterogeneous telomeres generated by ALT specific recombination, which is the focus of  the final series of data that is presented. ALT telomere length heterogeneity was detected under  denaturing conditions, ruling out the possibility that it was an artefact of electrophoresis conditions  due to novel secondary structure. Although the hybridisation signal intensity of TTAGGG  increases at the onset of immortalisation in ALT cells, it had been demonstrated by restriction  digests that degenerate repeats did exist at the telomeres of some ALT cell lines. Sequences  containing telomere repeats were cloned from the ALT cell line WI38 VA13/2RA (SV40  immortalised fibroblasts) and these were found to be interspersed with a number of other  sequence fragments. The significance of these sequences in relation to the mechanism of ALT is  discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telomeres;immortalisation;cancer;alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antitumour Metallocenes</field><field name="creator">Mokdsi, George</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a study of the chemical stability and coordination chemistry of several antitumour metallocenes Cp2MCl2 (Cp = h5-C5H5; M = Ti 1, V 2, Nb 3, Mo 4), as well as derivatives of Cp2TiCl2 1, with nucleic acids, nucleic acid constituents and proteins.   These studies were carried out in order to identify the biologically active species and more fully understand the molecular level mechanism of action of the antitumour metallocenes, in particular Cp2TiCl2 1, which is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials.   The interactions of Cp2MoCl2 4 with four oligonucleotides were studied by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy.  In 50 mM salt solutions of Cp2MoCl2 4, hydrolysis of the halide ligands occurred to give a solution with pD -2, containing a species in which both Cp rings remain metal bound for 24 h.  At pD -7, partial hydrolysis of the Cp rings (-30percent) occurred after 24 h.  Addition of an aqueous solution of Cp2MoCl2 4 in 50 mM salt to the self-complementary sequence d(CGCATATGCG)2, maintaining the pD at 6.0-7.0, showed no evidence for the formation of a metallocene-oligonucleotide complex and only peaks arising from hydrolysis of Cp2MoCl2 4 were detected.  A similar result was obtained in titration experiments with the single stranded sequence d(ATGGTA) at pD 6.5-7.0.  However, at pD 3.0, new signals assigned to a molybdocene-oligonucleotide complex(es), which was stable for hours at pD 3.0, were detected; while at pD -7 the complex is destabilised and only peaks arising from hydrolysis of Cp2MoCl2 4 were detected.  Titration experiments at low pD with Cp2MoCl2 4 and the dinucleotide dCG were consistent with formation of a complex arising due to coordination of molybdenum to guanine N7 and/or cytosine N3.  The results obtained showed that stable oligonucleotide adducts were not formed in 50 mM salt at pD -7 and hence it is highly unlikely that formation of molybdocene-DNA adducts in vivo is the primary action that is responsible for the antitumour properties of Cp2MoCl2 4.  The rate of hydrolysis of the aromatic rings of Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1, OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) and the dimethylsubstituted derivatives (MeCp)2TiX2 (X equals Cl 34, OCOCH2NH3Cl 41), in aqueous solutions at pD 2-8 was studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy.  Rapid hydrolysis of both the halide/glycine and Cp ligands in Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1, OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) occurred and predominantly gave a precipitate at pD -7.  In contrast, under the same experimental conditions, the predominant species present in aqueous solutions of (MeCp)2TiX2 (X equals Cl 34, OCOCH2NH3Cl 41) at pH 2-8 contained both MeCp rings metal bound.  At pD &lt; 5, Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1, OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) and (MeCp)2TiX2 (X equals Cl 34, OCOCH2NH3Cl 41) formed similar complex(es) with purine nucleotides.  However, at pD &gt;5, stable adducts between nucleotides and Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1, OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) were not formed.  In contrast, (MeCp)2TiX2 (X equals Cl 34, OCOCH2NH3Cl 41) formed complex(es) with 5'-dAMP or 5'-dGMP, which were stable for 24 h.  These results suggest that formation of stable chelates between (MeCp)2TiX2 (X equals Cl 34, OCOCH2NH3Cl 41) and nucleic acid constituents in vivo is possible.  However, the methyl substituted derivatives 34 and 41 did not show any antitumour activity against EAT in mice when administered in either 10percentDMSO/90percentsaline or in water at pH 6.2-6.4, which suggests that the labile Cp-Ti bond present in Cp2TiCl2 1 is required for antitumour activity.  The synthesis of a range of Cp substituted titanocene derivatives was investigated in an attempt to prepare derivatives with modified Cp stability in comparison to the methyl substituted derivatives.  The synthesis of derivatives (CpCH2Y)2TiCl2 where Y equals ?CHO 43, ?CONMe2 44, ?NO2 45, (RCp)2TiCl2 where R equals ?COMe 46, ?COOMe 47 or ?CONMe2 48, (CpNMe2)2TiCl2 62 and (Cp(CH2)2NMe2)2TiCl2 63 was unsuccessful, due to the presence of coordinating substituents on the Cp rings and poor stability in polar, protic solvents.  Hence, these derivatives were excluded from further studies.  The rate of hydrolysis of the Cp rings of Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1, OCOCCl3 22 and OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) in aqueous solutions, 10percentDMSO/90percentD2O and 100percent DMSO was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy.  Rapid hydrolysis of both the carboxylate and Cp ligands of Cp2TiX2 (OCOCCl3 22 and OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) occurred in DMSO to give biologically inactive species.  The rate of these reactions were concentration dependent as dilution of these samples with saline or water to give the therapeutic conditions of 10percentDMSO/90percentD2O slowed the hydrolysis chemistry.  In contrast, samples of Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1 and OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) dissolved in water, gave solutions containing the presumed antitumour active species in which the halide or glycine ligands have been hydrolysed but the Cp rings remain metal bound.  Thus, charged X ligands may be incorporated into Cp2TiX2 and will give comparable activity to Cp2TiCl2 1 provided the samples are administered in water.    The antitumour metallocenes Cp2MCl2 (M equals Ti 1, V 2, Nb 3, Mo 4) and the inactive derivative (MeCp)2TiCl2 34 were found to inhibit the relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA pBR322 by human topoisomerase II in vitro.  These results implicated the inhibition of topoisomerase II in the mechanism of antitumour activity although there was no direct correlation between the in vitro results with biological activity against EAT in vivo.    UV spectroscopy confirmed that the metallocenes Cp2MCl2 (M equals Ti 1, Mo 4) became associated with and were stabilised to hydrolysis by calf thymus DNA but not with human serum albumin.  ICP-AES was used to measure the amount of metal associated with either DNA or human serum albumin after incubation with Cp2MCl2 (M equals Ti 1, Nb 3, Mo 4) and dialysis of these solution.  The results confirmed that DNA stabilises or becomes associated with the metallocenes.  However, errors associated with the ICP-AES measurements did not allow these results to be quantified.  1H NMR spectroscopy was used to show that the antitumour metallocene Cp2MoCl2 4 formed an adduct with glutathione 72 in the pH range 3-7 through the sulfur donor group.  In comparison, the antitumour metallocenes Cp2MCl2 (M equals Ti 1, Nb 3) showed limited adduct formation with glutathione 72 at pH -3 and no adducts were detected at pH &gt; 5.5.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antitumour;antitumor;tumour;tumor;cancer;anticancer;metallocenes;titanocene dichloride</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Search for young galactic supernova remnants</field><field name="creator">Misanovic, Zdenka</field><field name="description">A sample of 9 small-diameter radio sources has been selected from the   Molonglo Galactic Plane Survey (MGPS)   and observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in the radio   recombination line (RRL) at   5 GHz, in a search for young Galactic SNRs.    Since the RRL emission is an  unambiguous indicator of a thermal   source, this method has been used to eliminate HII regions from the  selected sample.  In addition, the IRAS and MSX   infrared data and spectral index measurements have been combined with the   RRL studies to distinguish   thermal and non-thermal sources in the selected sample.          One source (G282.8-1.2) is identified here as a possible new young Galactic  supernova remnant, based on its relatively weak infrared emission, steep  radio spectrum and  possible x-ray emission. However, the   ATCA data are  inconclusive and further studies are needed to  confirm this result.               Radio recombination line emission (H107 alpha) has been detected in   3 of the selected sources, eliminating them from  the sample of SNR candidates. In addition, the parameters of the RRL  emission from the identified HII regions have been used to estimate their  properties.           The RRL data are inconclusive for the remaining low brightness, extended sources  in the sample.  However, some of these sources are   likely to be thermal HII  regions according to the infrared and  spectral index data.        The selected method for distinguishing thermal and non-thermal Galactic  radio sources seems promising.

Autonomous systems composed of multiple sensors and multiple platforms potentially have significant importance in applications such as defence, search and rescue mining or intelligent manufacturing. However, the effective use of multiple autonomous systems requires that an understanding be developed of the mechanisms of coordination and cooperation between component systems in pursuit of a common goal. A fundamental, quantitative, understanding of coordination and cooperation between decentralised autonomous systems is the main goal of this thesis.     This thesis focuses on the problem of coordination and cooperation for teams of autonomous systems engaged in information gathering and data fusion tasks. While this is a subset of the general cooperative autonomous systems problem, it still encompasses a range of possible applications in picture compilation, navigation, searching and map building problems. The great advantage of restricting the domain of interest in this way is that an underlying mathematical model for coordination and cooperation can be based on the use of information-theoretic models of platform and sensor abilities. The information theoretic approach builds on the established principles and architecture previously developed for decentralised data fusion systems. In the decentralised control problem addressed in this thesis, each platform and sensor system is considered to be a distinct decision maker with an individual information-theoretic utility measure capturing both local objectives and the inter-dependencies among the decisions made by other members of the team. Together these information-theoretic utilities constitute the team objective.     The key contributions of this thesis lie in the quantification and study of cooperative control between sensors and platforms using information as a common utility measure. In particular,        * The problem of information gathering is formulated as an optimal control problem by identifying formal measures of information with utility or pay-off.        * An information-theoretic utility model of coupling and coordination between decentralised decision makers is elucidated. This is used to describe how the information gathering strategies of a team of autonomous systems are coupled.        * Static and dynamic information structures for team members are defined. It is shown that the use of static information structures can lead to efficient, although sub-optimal, decentralised control strategies for the team.        * Significant examples in decentralised control of a team of sensors are developed. These include the multi-vehicle multi-target bearings-only tracking problem, and the area coverage or exploration problem for multiple vehicles. These examples demonstrate the range of non-trivial problems to which the theory in this thesis can be employed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Team Theory;Sensor Management;Distributed Sensing and Control</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-Reduction for Combinatorial Optimisation</field><field name="creator">Sheppard, Nicholas Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis presents and develops a theory of self-reduction. This process  is used to map instances of combinatorial optimisation problems onto smaller,  more easily solvable instances in such a way that a solution of the former can  be readily re-constructed, without loss of information or quality, from a  solution of the latter. Self-reduction rules are surveyed for the Graph  Colouring Problem, the Maximum Clique Problem, the Steiner Problem in Graphs,  the Bin Packing Problem and the Set Covering Problem.    This thesis introduces the problem of determining the maximum sequence of  self-reductions on a given structure, and shows how the theory of  confluence can be adapted from term re-writing to solve this problem  by  identifying rule sets for which all maximal reduction sequences are equivalent.  Such confluence results are given for a number of reduction rules on problems  on discrete systems. In contrast, NP-hardness results are also presented for  some reduction rules.    A probabilistic analysis of self-reductions on graphs is performed, showing  that the expected number of self-reductions on a graph tends to zero as the  order of the graph tends to infinity.    An empirical study is performed comparing the performance of self-reduction,  graph decomposition and direct methods of solving the Graph Colouring and Set  Covering Problems. The results show that self-reduction is a potentially  valuable, but sometimes erratic, method of finding exact solutions to  combinatorial problems.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">combinatorial optmisation;self-reduction;confluence;decomposition;graph colouring;steiner problem;bin packing;set covering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological study of risk factors associated with progression from ocular hypertension to primary open angle glaucoma</field><field name="creator">Landers, John Arthur William</field><field name="description">Background: As a multifactorial disease glaucoma may be associated with pressure-dependent and -independent factors. Ocular hypertension (OHT) may develop into primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) for many patients. We compared groups with OHT and POAG for pressure-dependent and -independent risk factors. A high prevalence of any factor(s) could indicate a contribution to progression from OHT to POAG.  Method: A sample of patients with POAG (n 438) and with OHT (n 301) were selected from those attending a tertiary referral private glaucoma practice, and data were collected regarding age and intraocular pressure at the time of diagnosis, gender, family history of glaucoma, systemic hypertension, diabetes, Raynaud's phenomenon, migraine and myopia.  Results: After multivariate analysis, older age at time of diagnosis (P&lt;0.001), myopia (odds ratio (O.R) 1.5, 95percent confidence interval (C.I)1.0-2.2; P 0.05), a family history of glaucoma (O.R 1.6, 95 percent C.I 1.1-2.3; P 0.01) and a high intraocular pressure (P 0.002) were associated with POAG. No other significant differences were found between the two groups.

It is becoming increasingly clear that fatty acids have metabolic roles over and above their influence on energy density of the diet. Recent studies have linked changes in the fatty acyl composition of the plasma membrane, induced by the dietary fat profile, to alterations in both lipid and glucose metabolism. These dietary induced changes have profound effects on insulin action, glucose transport and enzyme activity that regulate triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis, factors that ultimately influence protein and lipid deposition of animals.   Because of their high growth rate, broiler chickens have a high requirement for energy and the use of triglycerides as a major energy source has resulted in a fat carcass. A change in the glucose-insulin balance has been suggested as being the main reason for differences in adiposity between broilers selected for fatness or leanness. The hypotheses of this thesis is based on the finding that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA&#65533;s) increase the sensitivity of muscle tissue to insulin and this would presumably augment insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into muscle cells. Therefore, increasing the capacity of broiler muscle tissue to utilise glucose as its principal energy substrate would reduce the bird&#65533;s reliance on triglycerides and this inturn would result in a leaner carcass.   The aims of this study are firstly to explore the role that dietary PUFA&#65533;s from the n-3 and n-6 series have on the growth and body composition of broiler chickens and secondly to determine the relationships between dietary fatty acid profile, tissue insulin sensitivity and lipid deposition. Because dietary fatty acids have been implicated in the modulation of hormones important for the growth and development of animals, a third aim of this thesis is to determine the effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on pituitary and adrenal sensitivity. Since the modulation of metabolism by dietary fatty acids has been attributed to changes in the fatty acyl composition of the plasma membrane, the final aim of this study will be to investigate and characterise the molecular species of the breast muscle choline and ethanolamine phospholipids.   Feeding either fish oil a source of n-3 PUFA&#65533;s or sunflower oil a source of n-6 PUFA&#65533;s fatty acids to broiler chickens resulted in a significant (P&lt;0.01) reduction in the abdominal fat pad mass and a modest increase in breast muscle mass when compared to broilers fed edible tallow. Associated with the changes in carcass composition was an alteration in energy substrate utilisation. This was reflected by lower respiratory quotients and reduced triglyceride and insulin concentrations for the chickens fed the two PUFA diets. Coupled to the shift in energy metabolism was a significant (P&lt;0.05) increase in the proportion of PUFA&#65533;s incorporated into the abdominal fat pad and breast muscle. The dietary fat supplements resulted in the incorporation of specific fatty acid subtypes. Feeding fish oil significantly increased the proportion of long-chain n-3 PUFA&#65533;s whereas feeding sunflower oil significantly increased the proportion of long-chain n-6 PUFA&#65533;s compared to tallow feeding whose tissues were dominated by a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids.    It was further shown that dietary n-3 and n-6 PUFA&#65533;s enhanced glucose /insulin action. Feeding either fish oil or sunflower oil to broiler chickens increased insulin action when examined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The maximal insulin release in response to the glucose infusion was higher in the tallow fed group compared to either the sunflower oil or fish oil groups. To estimate the disappearance rate of glucose from the plasma and its incorporation into tissues, 2-deoxy-D-3H glucose was infused into each chicken. There were no significant differences in the clearance rate of 2-deoxy-D-3H glucose from the plasma. However, when measured under steady state conditions, the labelled glucose incorporation into the breast muscle was greater in birds fed fish oil compared to either tallow or sunflower oil feeding.    The dietary fatty acid induced increase in insulin action suggests that the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin was enhanced. This modulation of tissue sensitivity by dietary fatty acids was also shown to occur at the level of the pituitary. To provide an estimate of pituitary sensitivity, bolus GnRH and GHRH infusions were given on different days to chickens fed the three dietary treatments. Feeding sunflower oil (n-6 PUFA&#65533;s) increased the level of GH that was released in response to the GHRH infusion when compared to birds fed either tallow or fish oil (n-3 PUFA&#65533;s). This dietary fatty acid modulation appears to be specific to certain pituitary cell types as there was no effect on LH secretion following the GnRH infusion. Dietary fatty acid modulation of endocrine gland sensitivity is particular to the gland type. Although the dietary treatments mediated a distinct pattern in pituitary sensitivity to GHRH infusion, these same three diets did not influence adrenal sensitivity, as there was no difference in the corticosterone profile following either ACTH or CRF infusion.    The previously observed physiological changes for the three dietary groups was expected to be positively correlated to an alteration of the plasma membrane phospholipids induced by the dietary fatty acids. Supplementation with fish oil (n-3 PUFA&#65533;s) significantly increased levels of both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) into the choline (PC) and ethanolamine (PE) breast muscle phospholipids compared to either sunflower oil (n-6 PUFA&#65533;s) or tallow supplementation. The increase in n-3 PUFA incorporation was associated with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n-6) an event that would presumably alter substrate availability for the 1- and 2-series eicosanoids. However, feeding sunflower oil or tallow gave a molecular species profile that was remarkably similar in both fatty acid subtype and proportion. This suggests that the plasma membrane dynamics would be similar for these two dietary groups. Therefore, it is appears that factors other than a change in the fatty acyl- composition of the plasma membrane may be responsible for modifying the physiology of the broiler.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chickens;triacylglycerols;energy metabolism;body composition;ethanclamine phospholipids;polyunsaturated fatty acids</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Best Kept Secret in the Church: The Religious Life of Women in Australian Anglicanism 1892-1995.</field><field name="creator">Ball, Gail Anne</field><field name="description">The Best Kept Secret in the Church: The Religious Life of Women in Australian Anglicanism 1892-1995.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women and the anglican church</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative Fibroblast Acylcarnitine Profiling In The Diagnostic and Prognostic Assessment of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid &#65533;-Oxidation Disorders</field><field name="creator">Sim, Keow Giak</field><field name="description">Mitochondrial fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation disorders are a group of clinically and biochemically heterogeneous defects mainly associated with intolerance to catabolic stress. The diseases are potentially fatal, but treatable and the prognosis for most diagnosed disorders is generally favourable. Early diagnosis is thus important to prevent morbidity and mortality.    This project describes an improved and validated quantitative fibroblast acylcarnitine profile assay for the investigation of suspected fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation disorders. Intact cells were incubated with deuterium-labelled hexadecanoate and L-carnitine, and the accumulated acylcarnitines in the medium analysed using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. This modified procedure is less demanding technically, requires fewer cells and better reflects the in vivo acylcarnitine status than previously published methods.    Mitochondrial fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation is coupled to the respiratory chain. Functional defects of one pathway may lead to secondary alterations in flux through the other. The diagnostic specificity and the prognostic potential of the in vitro acylcarnitine profile assay were investigated in fibroblasts from 14 normal controls, 38 patients with  eight enzyme deficiencies of fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation presenting with various phenotypes, and 16 patients with primary respiratory chain defects including both isolated and multiple enzyme complex defects. All fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation deficient cell lines revealed disease-specific acylcarnitine profiles related to the sites of defects irrespective of the severity of symptoms or of different mutation. Preliminary studies suggested a correlation between severity of symptoms and higher concentrations of long-chain acylcarnitine species. However, the fibroblast acylcarnitine profiles from some patients with respiratory chain defects were similar to those of controls, whereas others had abnormal profiles resembling those found in fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation disorders.    In vitro acylcarnitine profiling is useful for the detection of fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation deficiencies, and perhaps the prediction of disease severity and prognostic evaluation facilitating decisions of therapeutic intervention and genetic counselling. However, abnormal profiles do not exclusively indicate these disorders, and primary defects of the respiratory chain remain a possibility. Awareness of this diagnostic pitfall will aid in the selection of subsequent confirmatory tests and therapeutic options.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inborn errors of metabolism;fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation;acylcarnitines;newborn screening;fibroblasts;tandem mass spectrometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minimal music: roles and approaches of teachers engaging students with a contemporary art music through composing activities</field><field name="creator">Blom, Diana Mary</field><field name="description">Since it arose in the 1960s, the minimalist aesthetic has increasingly influenced composers of art and popular music around the world and, in turn, minimalist composers have drawn on the compositional ideas of Western popular music and several non-Western musics. Educationally, minimal music offers much potential for music in the classroom as it embodies a number of musical characteristics known to, and preferred by, students aged 9-18 years at primary, secondary and first year tertiary level.  Socially, it offers teachers an opportunity to engage students, through composing activities, with contemporary society.  The study aims, firstly, to analyse compositions by students aged 9, 12, 15 and 18 years and their teachers, seeking pastiche development of, and compositional expansion beyond, the musical concepts presented in a resource booklet of projects, The Pulse Music Album.  Secondly, this study aims to investigate how nineteen participating teachers in three countries engage their students with minimalist composing activities stimulated through the resource booklet.  The study attempts to determine why teachers adopt their particular roles and strategies by examining music qualifications, preferences and experience, teaching perspectives and teaching environments.  It also seeks to identify reasons why one group of teachers submitted pieces which were pastiches of those presented in the projects and another group submitted compositions which moved well beyond pastiche into an expansion of these same musical concepts and argues for this as evidence of dialogue with contemporary society.    Conclusions drawn from the findings note that while there are many commonalities between the backgrounds and approaches of both groups of teachers, there are clearly observed differences.  These differences suggest approaches to classroom composition for consideration by practising classroom teachers, in-service instructors and teacher training institutions.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">minimalism;minimal music;music education;composition;teaching composition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">You're pretending, you don't need a wheelchair' - children and adolescents with spinal cord injury</field><field name="creator">Leeds, Marilyn June</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the requirements of children and adolescents with severe spinal cord injuries.

The thesis thus begins with a examination of the literature on the needs of people with disabilities and people with spinal cord injury.  Proponents of the social model of disability, which is based on the experiences of people with disabilities, contend that the main requirements of people with disabilities is ending their social marginalisation, and it is hypothesised that the requirements of the children and adolescents will be related to ending social marginalisation.     Open-ended unstructured interviews with parents, parents and adolescents and adolescents alone ( a total of 20 interviews) provided data for analysis.

Luke's narrative is set within the gendered social and cultural framework of first century Mediterranean society. Women are written into the narrative. They tell of a God who acts outside the recognised institution of Temple to announce the salvation Israel has been anticipating. Women are recipients of God's favour, widows are given a prophetic voice within the Lucan narrative. Women come to Jesus in faith. They are healed and forgiven. Women are disciples and full members of the new community of faith. They are partners with Jesus in mission and witnesses to the crucifixion, empty tomb, the angelic announcement of the resurrection and resurrection appearance. They are commissioned by Jesus as witnesses and are to receive the empowering of the Holy Spirit.    The stories of women are critical as they present a narrative that confronts the symbolic universe of Temple and temple system, purity and exclusivity, to reveal a God who becomes present with the outsider and creates community with those who come in faith to Jesus. Luke creates two competing symbolic conceptions of reality - the Temple and the household. Through the narrative he affirms the symbolic reality of household as the place of God's presence and reveals the Temple and temple system as failing to recognise Jesus as the prophet from God.    New symbols of presence create new means of belonging and new patterns of religious, social and economic life for the Lucan community. In contrast to the temple system of purity and exclusivity, Jesus, the prophet from God, now sets the boundaries of the new community - those of inclusivity, faith and forgiveness. Individuals, women and men, who recognise Jesus to be the prophetic word of God, who come in faith and are healed and forgiven, become the new community, the household of faith. The new community adopts the social and economic relationships of household, marked by relationships of reciprocity, mutuality and trust.    For first century readers, who are struggling to interpret their relationship with God following the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple, Luke's gospel narrative provides assurance and legitimation that those who have chosen the path of Christianity are the true Israel.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women;Luke's Gospel</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depression, Thoughts of Self-Harm and Suicidal Ideation in a Twenty One Year Clinic Cohort: Changes in Prevalence and Predictors of Disorder.</field><field name="creator">Starling, Jean</field><field name="description">Introduction. Recent studies have suggested a secular increase in the prevalence of self-harm, suicidal ideation and depression in young people. This study aims to report the changes in prevalence of psychological disturbance over time in a clinic population.    Method: Data on the prevalence of psychological symptoms was measured by the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), in a 21-year clinic cohort of adolescents aged from 12 to 17. This data was analysed to investigate secular changes and predictors of disorder.    Results: Significant secular increases were demonstrated in parent reports of self-harm and suicidal ideation, of 5percent and 4percent per cohort year respectively, but there was no significant change in the anxious/depressed sub-scale. There were no changes demonstrated in self-reports of self-harm, suicidal ideation or anxiety/depression. Self-harm and suicidal ideation, both parent reported and self-reported, significantly increased with increasing age, female gender, drug use, anxiety/depression and other clinically significant scores on the YSR and CBCL sub-scales. The YSR was a more accurate predictor of both self-harm and suicidal ideation than the CBCL.    Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that there has not been a significant increase in psychological disorder in this population. There was, however, an apparent increase due to increasing parental awareness of some symptoms, particularly self-harm and suicidal ideation. While parents have a higher rate of reporting disorder, young people's self-reports remain a more accurate predictor of specific symptoms, including self-harm and suicidal ideation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">depression;suicide;self-harm;adolescent</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuropathic orofacial pain: a review and guidelines for diagnosis and management.</field><field name="creator">Vickers, Edward Russell</field><field name="description">Neuropathic pain is defined as "pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system". In contrast to physiological pain that warns of noxious stimuli likely to result in tissue damage, neuropathic pain serves no protective function. Examples of neuropathic pain states include postherpetic neuralgia (shingles) and phantom limb / stump pain. This pain state also exists in the orofacial region, with the possibility of several variants including atypical odontalgia and burning mouth syndrome. There is a paucity of information on the prevalence of neuropathic pain in the orofacial region. One study assessed patients following endodontic treatment and found that approximately 3 to 6percent of patients reported persistent pain. Patients predisposed to the condition atypical odontalgia (phantom tooth pain) include those suffering from recurrent cluster or migraine headaches.     Biochemical and neurobiological processes leading to a neuropathic pain state are complex and involve peripheral sensitisation, and neuronal plasticity of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Subsequent associated pathophysiology includes regional muscle spasm, sympathetic hyperfunction, and centralisation of pain. The relevant clinical features of neuropathic pain are: (i) precipitating factors such as trauma or disease (infection), (ii) pain that is frequently described as having burning, paroxysmal, and lancinating or sharp qualities, and (iii) physical examination may indicate hyperalgesia, allodynia and sympathetic hyperfunction. The typical patient complains of persistent, severe pain, yet there are no clearly identifiable clinical or radiographic abnormalities. Often, due to the chronicity of the problem, afflicted patients exhibit significant distress and are poor pain historians, thus complicating the clinician's task of obtaining a detailed and relevant clinical and psychosocial history.     An appropriate analgetic blockade test for intraoral sites of neuropathic pain is mucosal application of topical anaesthetics. Other, more specific, tests include placebo controlled lignocaine infusions for assessing neuropathic pain, and placebo controlled phentolamine infusions for sympathetically maintained pain. The treatment and management of neuropathic pain is multidisciplinary. Medication rationalisation utilises first-line antineuropathic drugs including tricyclic antidepressants, and possibly an anticonvulsant. Topical applications of capsaicin to the gingivae and oral mucosa are a simple and effective treatment. Neuropathic pain responds poorly to opioid medication. Psychological assessment is often crucial in developing strategies for pain management. Psychological variables include distress, depression, expectations of treatment, motivation to improve, and background environmental factors.      To enable a greater understanding of neuropathic pain, thereby leading to improved treatments, high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is one analytical technique that has the potential to contribute to our knowledge base. This technique allows drugs and endogenous substances to be assayed from one sample in a relatively short time. The technique can identify, confirm, and measure the concentrations of multiple analytes from a single sample.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neuropathic pain;orofacial pain;liquid chromatography;mass spectrometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Other Radicalism: an Inquiry into Contemporary Australian Extreme Right Ideology, Politics and Organisation 1975-1995.</field><field name="creator">Saleam, James</field><field name="description">This Thesis examines the ideology, politics and organization of the Australian Extreme Right 1975-1995.  Its central interpretative theme is the response of the Extreme Right to the development of the Australian State from a conservative Imperial structure into an American "anti-communist" client state, and ultimately into a liberal-internationalist machine which integrated Australia into a globalized capitalist order.  The Extreme Right after 1975 differed from the various paramilitaries of the 1930's and the conservative anti-communist auxiliary organizations of the 1945-75 period.  Post 1975, it lost its preoccupation with fighting the Left, and progressively grew as a challenger to liberal-internationalism.  The abandonment of "White Australia" and consequent non-European immigration were the formative catalysts of a more diverse and complex Extreme Right.    The Thesis uses a working definition of generic fascism as "palingenetic populist ultra-nationalism", to measure the degree of ideological and political radicalization achieved by the Extreme Right.  This family of political ideas, independent of the State and mobilized beyond the limits of the former-period auxiliary conservatives, expressed itself in an array of organizational forms.    The complexity of the Extreme Right can be demonstrated by using four typologies:  Radical Nationalism, Neo-Nazism, Populist-Monarchism and Radical-Populism, each with specific points to make about social clienteles, geographical distribution, particular ideological heritages, and varied strategies and tactics.  The Extreme Right could mobilize from different points of opportunity if political space became available.    Inevitably a mutual delegitimization process between State and Extreme Right led to public inquiries and the emplacement of agencies and legislation to restrict the new radicalism.  This was understandable since some Extreme Right groups employed violence or appeared to perform actions preparatory thereto.  It also led to show-trials and para-State crime targeted against particular groups especially in the period 1988-91.    Thereafter, Extreme Right organizations pursued strategies which led to electoral breakthroughs, both rural and urban as a style of Right-wing populist politics unfolded in the 1990's.  It was in this period that the Extreme Right encouraged the co-optation by the State of the residual Left in the anti-racist fight.  This seemed natural, as the Extreme Right's vocal references to popular democracy, national independence and the nativist heritage, had permitted it to occupy the Old Left's traditional ground.  In that way too, it was "The Other Radicalism".</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Nationalism;neofascism;neonazism;extreme right;populism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology and prevention of pertussis in Australia</field><field name="creator">Torvaldsen, Siranda</field><field name="description">Pertussis (whooping cough) remains an important public health problem in Australia. Although mortality and morbidity from pertussis declined dramatically following the introduction of mass vaccination programs in 1953, the level of morbidity remains unacceptably high for a vaccine-preventable disease.    Aims and methods    The primary aims of this thesis were (i) to ascertain the epidemiology of pertussis in Australia between 1993 and 2000 by analysing and interpreting sources of routinely collected data on pertussis; and (ii) to examine the effectiveness of vaccination against pertussis in a number of ways. Data from three primary national sources (notifications of disease, hospitalisations for pertussis and death certificates) were used to examine the burden from pertussis in Australia over these eight years. Analyses included the age distribution of cases, temporal and geographic trends, comparisons of notification and hospitalisation data, and the impact of differences in the method of diagnosis of notified cases between years and age groups. In addition to analyses at the national level using data from the national databases, further detailed analyses were undertaken at the State level for New South Wales (NSW), the most populous Australian State.       Pertussis vaccine coverage was estimated using data from the recently established Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR); these data were also used to track the transition from whole-cell to acellular pertussis vaccines.       The different types of studies used to evaluate vaccine effectiveness were reviewed, and a method suitable for ongoing estimation of vaccine effectiveness in Australia was developed. This was then applied to the NSW data, to determine the effectiveness of pertussis vaccination in this State.    Main findings    The annual notification rate for pertussis in Australia ranged from 23&#65533;59 per 100 000 population over the eight years. Infants had the highest notification and hospitalisation rates in Australia &#65533; they accounted for 5percent of notifications, 61percent of hospitalisations and 100percent of deaths. Age-specific notification and hospitalisation rates in children aged less than two years strongly suggested a protective effect of vaccination, with the greatest reduction in rate coinciding with eligibility to receive a second dose of pertussis vaccine at four months of age. Notification rates among 5&#65533;9 year olds progressively decreased in successive age cohorts, consistent with an effect of the introduction in 1994 of a pertussis vaccine booster for preschool-aged children. Although adults (persons aged 15 years or more) accounted for half the notifications, they had the lowest notification rate.      The highest numbers of pertussis notifications were in 1997, when most jurisdictions experienced an epidemic. Notification and hospitalisation rates varied across the States and Territories and also across smaller geographic regions in NSW. Areas and years with high notification rates tended to also have high hospitalisation rates, suggesting that trends in notifications reflected trends in incidence. The number of infant hospitalisations in NSW between July 1993 and June 1999 exceeded the number of notifications by 32percent, highlighting the extent of under-notification.      Overall, and particularly amongst those aged more than 12 months, the majority of cases notified in NSW were based on the results of serological tests. The proportion diagnosed by culture of the organism was greatest in infants; the proportion diagnosed by serological tests increased with age. There was no evidence that the use of serology had increased since 1994 in NSW, hence changes in notification rates after this time are unlikely to be attributable to increased use of serological diagnosis.      ACIR records indicated that in December 2000, 92percent of one-year-old children had received three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine and 90percent of two-year-olds had received four doses. Vaccine coverage varied by jurisdiction. Since 1997, there was an increased use of DTP vaccines containing acellular pertussis components with a corresponding decrease in the use of vaccines containing whole-cell components. In 2000, almost all DTP vaccines administered contained acellular pertussis components.      The results of the vaccine effectiveness study showed that pertussis vaccination was highly effective at preventing pertussis in NSW children, as measured by notified cases. Vaccine effectiveness was highest (91percent) in the youngest age group (8&#65533;23 months) and lowest (78percent) in the oldest age group (9&#65533;13 years). The screening method has not previously been used to estimate pertussis vaccine effectiveness in Australia.    Conclusions    This thesis demonstrates the value of integrating varied data sources in estimating the disease burden from pertussis. The data presented here show that the disease burden is substantial in all age groups, despite high levels of vaccine coverage in infants and children. This problem of disease control does not appear to be due to lack of vaccine effectiveness, but there is evidence of waning immunity over time.       The analyses presented here form a basis for the ongoing monitoring of trends in pertussis epidemiology following the replacement of whole-cell by acellular pertussis vaccines, and will assist consideration of the need for additional booster doses in adolescents and adults.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epidemiology;Pertussis;Vaccine effectiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient Solutions to Autonomous  Mapping and Navigation Problems</field><field name="creator">Williams, Stefan Bernard</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping algorithm as it pertains to the deployment of mobile systems in unknown environments. Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) as defined in this thesis is the process of concurrently building up a map of the environment and using this map to obtain improved estimates of the location of the vehicle. In essence, the vehicle relies on its ability to extract useful navigation information from the data returned by its sensors. The vehicle typically starts at an unknown location with no a priori knowledge of landmark locations. From relative observations of landmarks, it simultaneously computes an estimate of vehicle location and an estimate of landmark locations. While continuing in motion, the vehicle builds a complete map of landmarks and uses these to provide continuous estimates of the vehicle location. The potential for this type of navigation system for autonomous systems operating in unknown environments is enormous.       One significant obstacle on the road to the implementation and deployment of large scale SLAM algorithms is the computational effort required to maintain the correlation information between features in the map and between the features and the vehicle. Performing the update of the covariance matrix is of O(n&#65533;) for a straightforward implementation of the Kalman Filter. In the case of the SLAM algorithm, this complexity can be reduced to O(n&#65533;) given the sparse nature of typical observations. Even so, this implies that the computational effort will grow with the square of the number of features maintained in the map. For maps containing more than a few tens of features, this computational burden will quickly make the update intractable - especially if the observation rates are high. An effective map-management technique is therefore required in order to help manage this complexity.       The major contributions of this thesis arise from the formulation of a new approach to the mapping of terrain features that provides improved computational efficiency in the SLAM algorithm. Rather than incorporating every observation directly into the global map of the environment, the Constrained Local Submap Filter (CLSF) relies on creating an independent, local submap of the features in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle. This local submap is then periodically fused into the global map of the environment. This representation is shown to reduce the computational complexity of maintaining the global map estimates as well as improving the data association process by allowing the association decisions to be deferred until an improved local picture of the environment is available. This approach also lends itself well to three natural extensions to the representation that are also outlined in the thesis. These include the prospect of deploying multi-vehicle SLAM, the Constrained Relative Submap Filter and a novel feature initialisation technique. Results of this work are presented both in simulation and using real data collected during deployment of a submersible vehicle equipped with scanning sonar.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile Robot;Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping;AUV</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breeding of Hygienic Disease Resistant Bees</field><field name="creator">Lapidge, Keryn Lea</field><field name="description">Hygienic behaviour in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) has been shown to be an effective control mechanism against brood diseases such as chalkbrood and AFB.  Chalkbrood has proven to be problematic for the Australian honey industry since it was identified here in 1993.  Hygienic behaviour is a much studied trait.  Rothenbuhler investigated the genetic basis of hygienic behaviour, proposing a two-gene model to explain the uncapping and removal of dead brood.  His elegant experiment remains the textbook example of a behavioural genetic study.  Although this model has been challenged, it is still generally agreed that a small number of unlinked genes produce a large effect on hygienic behaviour, that hygienic alleles are recessive and are inherited in a Mendelian manner.     Experimental backcross colonies were produced from an inbred hygienic line and an inbred non-hygienic line, both provided by Dr. Marla Spivak, University of Minnesota.  These backcross colonies were assessed for hygienic behaviour using a standard assay.  Statistical analyses of the field data indicated that the genetic basis of the trait was more complex than either the simple Mendelian and widely accepted two-gene or three-gene models that have been proposed previously.  Molecular techniques, linkage mapping and QTL analysis then were employed to determine how many loci directly influence hygienic behaviour and the relative level of influence and location of each locus within the genome of A. mellifera.    Full multipoint linkage analysis by Mapmaker v3.0 software produced a new genetic map of the honeybee comprised of 358 marker loci ordered over 25 linkage groups spanning a total distance of 3406.2 cM.  The average distance between each marker was 9.5 cM.  QTL analysis of the experimental data identified seven putative genetic markers associated with hygienic behaviour.  QTLs located on linkage groups 2, 4, 6 and 22 were detected for both overall hygienic behaviour and uncapping behaviour only.  Individually, each QTL is of relatively small effect with each explaining only 9% &#65533; 15% of the variance in hygienic levels observed.  Collectively, the putative QTLs identified here explain 79.4% of the observed variance in the expression of hygienic behaviour.  These results indicate that there are many genes of low to moderate effect rather than few genes of large effect involved in this complex behavioural trait.  This is typical of inherited quantitative traits which do not exhibit Mendelian phenotypic ratios.    DNA extracted from the brood samples taken during testing of commercial stock, and from individual bees identified as either highly hygienic or non-hygienic in a reciprocal backcross experiment, were screened with the candidate markers associated with putative QTLs to test their diagnostic power. Unfortunately, none have produced reliably diagnostic DNA profiles.  As we have now shown that hygienic behaviour is a polygenic, quantitative trait, simple diagnostic markers for Rothenbuhler's 'uncapping' and 'removal' genes are unlikely to be achieved.  Our results show that the most likely way to improve disease resistance in Australian stock is via traditional methods of recurrent selection.     The project was responsible for the importation of new genetic material into Australia from the United States.  This hygienic stock has been well received by industry, has been widely disseminated, and incorporated into local breeding programs.  We hope that it has lead to a general improvement in the level of disease resistance in Australian commercial bees.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hygienic behaviour;honeybee;Apis mellifera</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulating and assessing salinisation in the lower Namoi Valley</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mohammad Faruque</field><field name="description">Dryland salinity is increasing in the upper catchments of central and northern New South Wales, Australia.  Consequently, salts may be exported downstream, which could adversely affect cotton irrigated-farming systems.  In order to assess the potential threat of salinity a simple salt balance model based on progressively saline water (i.e., ECiw 0.4, 1.5, 4.0 and 9.0 dS/m) was used to simulate the potential impact of salinisation due to the farming systems. The study was carried out in the lower Namoi valley of northern New South Wales, Australia.  A comparison has been made of the various non-linear techniques (indicator kriging, multiple indicator kriging and disjunctive kriging) to determine an optimal simulation method for the risk assessment.  The simulation results indicate that potential salinisation due to application of the water currently used for irrigation (ECiw) is minimal and may not pose any problems to sustainability of irrigated agriculture.  The same results were obtained by simulation based on irrigation using slightly more saline water (ECiw 1.4 dS/m).  However, simulations based on irrigation using water of even lower quality (ECiw of 4 and 9.0 dS/m), shows potential high salinisation, which will require management inputs for sustainable cropping systems, especially legumes and wheat, which are used extensively in rotation with cotton.  Disjunctive kriging was the best simulation method, as it produced fewer misclassifications in comparison with multiple-indicator kriging and indicator kriging.  This study thus demonstrates that we can predict the salinity risk due to application of irrigation water of lower quality than that of the current water used.  In addition, the results suggest here problems of excessive deep drainage and inefficient use of water might be a problem.  The second part of this thesis deals with soil information required at the field scale for management practices particularly in areas where deep drainage is large. Unfortunately, traditional methods of soil inventory at the field level involve the design and adoption of sampling regimes and laboratory analysis that are time-consuming and costly.  Because of this more often than not only limited data are collected. In areas where soil salinity is prevalent, detailed quantitative information for determining its cause is required to prescribe management solutions.  This part deals with the description of a Mobile Electromagnetic Sensing System (MESS) and its application in an irrigated-cotton field suspected of exhibiting soil salinity. The field is within the study area of part one of this thesis-located about 2 km south west of Wee Waa.  The EM38 and EM31 (ECa) data provide information, which was used in deciding where soil sample sites could be located in the field.  The ECa data measured by the EM38 instrument was highly correlated with the effective cation exchange capacity.  This relationship can be explained by soil mineralogy.  Using different soil chemical properties (i.e. ESP and Ca/Mg ratio) a detailed transect study was undertaken to measure soil salinity adjoining the water storage.  It is concluded that the most appropriate management option to remediation of the problem would be to excavate the soil directly beneath the storage floor where leakage is suspected.

The aims of this research were to develop an optimised drying schedule for drying blackbutt and to develop and validate a mathematical model for a solar kiln.  In the first stage of this study, the cross-grain physical and mechanical properties were determined for blackbutt timber so that an optimised schedule (based on drying within a limiting strain envelope) can be developed using model predictive control techniques for drying 43 mm thick (green) blackbutt timber boards in solar kilns. This optimised schedule has been developed and tested in the laboratory. The drying time was 10% shorter for this schedule than the original schedule, compared with an expected reduction in drying time of 14% (relative to the original schedule). Overall the quality was slightly better and the drying time was shorter for the optimised schedule compared with the original schedule.  A complete solar kiln model has been developed and validated based on comparisons between the predicted and the measured internal air temperatures, relative humidities and timber moisture contents. The maximum difference between the actual and predicted moisture contents was 0.05 kg/kg. The agreement between the predicted and measured temperatures of the internal air is reasonable, and both the predictions and measurements have a similar cyclical pattern. The generally good agreement between the model prediction of the final moisture content and its measurement may be due to the careful measurement of the boundary conditions such as the solar energy input.  The key uncertainties were identified as the heat exchanger output, the measurement of the initial moisture content, the amount of accumulation of condensate on the floor, and the estimation of sky temperature. The significant uncertainty (18%) in the estimation of the initial moisture content is a key reason for the mismatch between the model prediction and the measurements. In terms of operating variables, the energy release rate from the heat exchanger had the greatest effect on the simulated performance, followed by the water spray and venting rates. The simulation suggested that a material with a lower transmissivity to thermal radiation may effectively lower radiation losses, improving the kiln performance, so such materials for glazing is a high priority.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solar kilns;Timber drying;optimised schedule;wood seasoning;Eucalyptus pilularis;modelling;hardwood</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the large-scale electrical activity of the brain</field><field name="creator">Rennie, Christopher John</field><field name="description">Modeling of brain activity is often seen as requiring great computing power.

The IB has been described as a world movement. The number of global institutions and social movements are increasing greatly in the 1990s. The thesis looks at the historical development of the IB, recent developments of the IB in Canada and Australia and develops the claim that the IB has become a provider of global cultural capital.    The theoretical paradigm adopted is that of Pierre Bourdieu.     Conclusions of the study are:   1 in Australia and Canada the IB is as important for the 'symbolic imposition' it bestows on holders of the IB as it is for the stated intentions of educating the whole person.       2 the IB functions as an agent of 'reproduction' rather than as an international laboratory for experiment both in curriculum and examining methods as originally intended by the founders of the IB.     3 students participating in the IB increase their potential for advantage in the 'global field'.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international;globalisation;international baccalaureate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences on the incidence of clinical deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in a prospectively collated population of 21,000 neurosurgical inpatients</field><field name="creator">Smith, Sarah Faith</field><field name="description">Records of all neurosurgical inpatients admitted to Royal North Shore Hospital since 1976 have been prospectively kept in a relational database.  Demographic details, diagnoses, operations and complications have been entered continuously since 1982 by the author of this study.  Complications are monitored at monthly review meetings attended by medical staff.  The recurrence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) at these meetings, despite continual improvements in patient care, prompted this study.  It aims to use the database to study changes in the incidence of DVT and PE over the previous twenty years; to find what database variables predict these complications; and whether use of mechanical and pharmacological agents has had an impact on DVT and PE rate.  Univariate analysis of the incidence of DVT and PE by age, sex, length of stay (LOS), admission month, diagnosis, operation and surgeon over time was run.  Any significant variables were then analysed by multivariate logistic regression.  The DVT rate was low by world standards, but rose from 0.6% in 1979-83 to 1.2% in 1984-88, then rose exponentially to 3.60% in 1994-98 with a significantly increasing trend over the twenty years (c2 MH  =114.20, with IDF, P&lt;0.001). PE rate doubled significantly over the twenty years from 0.6% to 1.2% (c2 MH  =17.94 with 1DF, P&lt;0.001).  Age, LOS, diagnosis, operation and surgeon were significant predictors of DVT and PE.  After adjustment for LOS, time period and age, vascular surgery was found to be the strongest predictor of DVT (OR=2.82, 95% CI: 2.08-3.82, c2 =43.91, P&lt;0.01).  Vascular diagnosis was the strongest diagnosis predictor.  No effect of sex or month of admission was shown.  After adjustment for LOS, time period and age, spinal fusion was the strongest predictor of PE (OR=4.04, 95% CI: 1.81-9.03).  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm was the diagnosis most highly associated with PE.  The rise in DVT rate may be due to increased complexity of surgical and nursing management, and some screening of patients with the introduction of duplex scanning.  The doubling of PE rate is unexplained.  The risk of brain or spinal cord haemorrhage makes prophylactic anticoagulation a difficult choice. This study reveals groupings which can be used to determine appropriate prophylaxis.  Use of mechanical and pharmaceutical agents is not recorded consistently in the database, but it is known approximately when they were introduced.  No impact on the rate of DVT and PE can be demonstrated by these agents.  More vigilant and widespread use of mechanical prophylaxis might be just as effective in controlling DVT and PE.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">venous thrombosis;pulmonary embolism;neurosurgery;complications</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biodiversity: Its Measurement and Metaphysics</field><field name="creator">Roche, David</field><field name="description">Biodiversity is a concept that plays a key role in both scientific theories such as the species-area law and conservation politics. Currently, however, little agreement exists on how biodiversity should be defined, let alone measured. This has led to suggestions that biodiversity is not a metaphysically robust concept, with major implications for its usefulness in formulating scientific theories and making conservation decisions.    A general discussion of biodiversity is presented, highlighting its application both in scientific and conservation contexts, its relationship with environmental ethics, and existing approaches to its measurement. To overcome the limitations of existing biodiversity concepts, a new concept of biocomplexity is proposed. This concept equates the biodiversity of any biological system with its effective complexity. Biocomplexity is shown to be the only feasible measure of biodiversity that captures the essential features desired of a general biodiversity concept. In particular, it is a well-defined, measurable and strongly intrinsic property of any biological system. Finally, the practical application of biocomplexity is discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biodiversity;biocomplexity;complexity;metaphysics;philosophy of ecology;philosophy of biology;environmental ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the failure of the implementation of intellectual property laws in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Kusumadara, Afifah</field><field name="description">For the past two decades, intellectual property law has been the fastest growing and most dynamic field in Indonesia.

Activation of P2X7 receptors induces multiple downstream effects, of which the best documented is the opening of an ionic channel that is selective for divalent cations.  Another effect of ATP is to induce the shedding of L-selectin (CD62L), a molecule which is involved in the adhesive interactions of lymphocytes on endothelial cells.  High levels of soluble L-selectin and CD23 are found in the serum of patients with B-CLL, although the mechanisms involved in their production are poorly characterized.  Because extracellular ATP causes shedding of L-selectin, we studied the effect of ATP on shedding of CD23, an adhesion molecule expressed on the surface of B-CLL lymphocytes.  ATP induced the shedding of CD23 at an initial rate of 12% of that for L-selectin, while the EC50 of ATP (35 uM) and BzATP (10 uM) was identical for shedding of both molecules.  Inactivation of the P2X7 receptor by pre-incubation with OxATP, an irreversible inhibitor of P2X7 purinoceptor, abolished ATP-induced shedding of both molecules.  Moreover, KN-62, the most potent inhibitor for the P2X7 receptor inhibited ATP-induced shedding of both CD23 and L-selectin with the same IC50 (12 nM).  Ro 31-9790, a membrane permeant zinc chelator which inhibits the phorbol-ester stimulated shedding of L-selectin  also inhibited shedding of CD23 from B-CLL lymphocytes, but the IC50 was different for the two shed molecules (25 versus 1 ug/ml respectively). Although L-selectin was completely shed by incubation of cells with phorbol-ester no CD23 was lost under these conditions. Also, Ca2+ inhibits ATP-induced CD23 shedding but not L-selectin shedding.     Since soluble CD23 and L-selectin are found in the serum of normal subjects and B-CLL patients, the expression of these two adhesion molecules on lymphocytes before and after transendothelial migration was studied in an in vitro model of this process.  In normal and B-CLL subjects, 71&#65533;b5% of L-selectin from both T and B cells and 90% of CD23 from B cells was lost following transmigration, while the expression of a range of other adhesion molecules such as VLA-4, ICAM-1, LFA-1 and CD44 was unchanged.  Lymphocytes incubated with OxATP retained  their capacity for transendothelial migration and showed the same loss of L-selectin as control leukaemic lymphocytes.  Ro 31-9790, which can protect ATP-induced both L-selectin and CD23 shedding, had no effect on inhibiting L-selectin and CD23 lost during transmigration.  These data show the presence of a second pathway for the downregulation of L-selectin and CD23 from the lymphocyte surface.    Data in vivo from 'knock-out' mice show that L-selectin is essential for the emigration of lymphocytes through high endothelial venules into lymph nodes. The migration of normal and B-CLL lymphocytes across confluent human umbilical vein endothelial monolayers was studied  in an in vitro model of this process.  Lymphocytes treated with ATP or BzATP showed 56&#65533;b25% or 67&#65533;b16% loss of L-selectin on the surface and 36&#65533;b24% or 64&#65533;b19% decrease of transmigration, respectively, while OxATP, which does not alter the L-selectin level, had no effect on lymphocyte transmigration.  Further experiments examined this correlation between L-selectin expression and lymphocyte transendothelial migration in this model system.  A quantitative assay for cell surface L-selectin showed that expression of L-selectin was lower on B-CLL lymphocytes (8,880&#65533;b5,700 molecules/cell) than on normal lymphocytes (29,500&#65533;b7,500 molecules/cell, p less than 0.001).  Also the rate of transmigration of B-CLL lymphocytes (1.5&#65533;b0.9 migrated cells/HUVEC) was lower than normal peripheral lymphocytes (2.4&#65533;b0.9 migrated cells/HUVEC, p=0.04).   Incubation of lymphocytes in complete medium for 24 hrs increased the expression of L-selectin on B-CLL lymphocytes by 1.5 to 2 fold while the normal lymphocyte L-selectin remained at the initial level.  This upregulation of B-CLL L-selectin correlated with a 2 fold increased rate of transendothelial migration.  A correlation was found between L-selectin expression on lymphocytes and their ability for  transendothelial migration (r^2=0.6).      This study shows that the adhesion molecules L-selectin and CD23 can be lost from lymphocytes by two different physiological pathways. One is by P2X7 receptor activation by extracellular ATP while the second is activated by transendothelial migration of these cells.  A second finding is that B-CLL lymphocytes have lower level of L-selectin expression and an impaired ability for transendothelial migration compared with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes.  Do these results explain the high serum levels of soluble L-selectin and CD23 observed in B-CLL?  Although B-CLL lymphocytes do not recirculate as rapidly as normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, the greatly increased number of leukaemic cells in B-CLL ensures that much more soluble L-selectin and CD23 is generated during the recirculation of these cells through the body.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L-selectin;CD62L;CD23;transmigration;P2X7;B-CLL</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Structural and Metamorphic evolution of cretaceous high-P granulites, Fiordland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Daczko, Nathan Robert</field><field name="description">Fiordland is located southwest of South Island of New Zealand.

It finds that a-C:N deposited by several methods is essentially identical, with similar bonding environments for carbon and nitrogen atoms. Using evidence from several techniques, the saturation of nitrogen in an sp2 carbon matrix is discussed. The experimental studies on a range of carbon nitride solids show no evidence for a crystalline form of carbon nitride. In addition to the experimental characterisation of a-C:N, ab initio molecular dynamics were used to investigate bonding and structure in carbon nitride. These simulations show that the most common form of nitrogen bonding was three-fold sites with a lone pair of electrons. Two-fold nitrogen sites were also found in agreement with experimental findings. An increase of nitrogen in a-C:N decreases the sp3-carbon fraction, but this is not localised on the nitrogen and the effect is most severe at high densities. A simulation of a low density/high nitrogen content network shows that the nitrogen saturation seen experimentally may be due to the formation of N2 dimers and C-N molecules which are easily driven out of the structure. The ab initio simulations also explore the nature of charged nitrogen and carbon sites in a-C:N. An analysis based on Wannier Function centres provided further information about the bonding and allowed for a detailed classification of these sites. The removal of electrons from the networks caused structural changes that could explain the two-state conductivity in ta-C:N memory devices. Finally, a theoretical study of the electron energy-loss near-edge structure (ELNES) calculated using multiple scattering theory is presented. The calculated ELNES of diamond, graphite and boron, silicon and carbon nitride structures compare well to experiment and supports the experimental finding that no crystalline carbon nitride had (or has) been produced. These ELNES calculations will however, provide a means of identifying crystalline beta-C3N4 should it be synthesised.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbon nitride;CPMD;molecular dynamics;ELNES;wannier function;ultrahard;amorphous materials;bonding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Training community pharmacists in cognitive behavioural intervention strategies for optimising the monitoring of non prescription combination analgesic products</field><field name="creator">De Almeida Neto, Abilio Cesar</field><field name="description">Analgesic products can produce serious side effects.  Because potent analgesics are not under medical surveillance but are available to the public without a medical prescription, any attempt to influence consumer behaviour in relation to these products must be via interventions at pharmacist level.  The Australian government is now pressuring the pharmacy profession to monitor effectively the use of such non-prescription medication.        The aim of this study was to train community pharmacists on brief intervention strategies for use in a pharmacy setting in relation to combination analgesic products.  Focus groups showed that participants had concerns about adopting confrontational counselling styles, as they feared this would antagonise consumers leading to loss of patronage without having an impact on consumer behaviour.  This concern was later reinforced by consumer interviews, which showed that a significant proportion of respondents thought that the use of non-prescription analgesics was their responsibility.  A protocol for the sales of analgesic products was designed with these issues in mind.  The transtheoretical model of change (TTM) and motivational interviewing were selected as theoretical frameworks, as they take into account differences among consumers in motivation and in intention to change behaviour and are congruent with pharmacists' concerns.  Consumer-centred intervention strategies were tailored to the individual consumer according to his/her readiness to change.  This approach was borrowed from the area of smoking secession in which it has been related to positive clinical outcomes.  The assumption was made that TTM-based intervention would also be effective in a pharmacy setting in relation to analgesic products.        In the initial pilot study, community pharmacists who simply attended a workshop in the cognitive-behavioural intervention strategies failed to incorporate the newly acquired skills to their practice and consequently lost their proficiency.  In the subsequent pilot study, when the workshop was followed by ongoing on-site training with immediate feedback and coaching through the use of pseudo-patron visits, the investigator was able to shape community pharmacists' practice behaviour in relation to the monitoring of pharmacist only analgesic products.  The methodology was then refined and in the final study trained pharmacists were significantly more likely than control pharmacists and baseline to engage in a number of behaviours related to the study intervention.  These included handling the sales of pharmacist only analgesics themselves, identifying inappropriate use, assessing readiness to change, and delivering an intervention according to the consumer's readiness to change.  The results suggested that in pharmacy practice post qualifying therapeutic skill transfer is not achieved by workshop presentation alone.  Modelling of the desired behaviour involving reinforcement and feedback is necessary.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">training;intervention;brief intervention;cognitive behavioural intervention;pharmacy;pharmaceutical care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kathakali: A study of the aesthetic processes of popular spectators and elitist appreciators engaging with performances in Kerala</field><field name="creator">Glynn, John Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the diverse aesthetic approaches of onlookers to Kathakali, a traditional dance-drama extant in Kerala, India. Its particular contribution is based on fieldwork undertaken in the period 1991-93, especially in the districts of Trichur and Palghat, and distinguishes a continuum of two over-lapping broad groups: popular spectators and elitist appreciators who provide different, contesting voices in the interviews.    The aesthetic processes of individuals within these groups of onlookers and the ways in which they may gradually change form the primary focus of this work. Respondents to interviews provide diverse descriptions of their interactions with performances according to their perceived membership to groups of popular spectators or elitist appreciators. They also identify dimensions of performance that may contribute to the development of their own performance competence and their subsequent transition from one group of onlookers to another.    The influences that shape the diverse approaches of these groups and have been examined here include traditional Hindu aesthetics, religion, politics, caste structures and the changing shape of patronage, which is itself also a reflection of historical factors of governance.     Kathakali is first presented as vignettes of performance that reflect different locations, venues, patronage and program choices. It is then situated in relation to extant, contiguous performance genres that have contributed to its development and/or often share its billing in traditional settings.    The politics and aesthetics of the worlds of Kathakali are looked at not only in terms of their traditional, folkloric and classical development but also in contrast to more contemporary, secular and controversial dynamics that are impacting upon Kathakali today.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kathakali;Indian Performance;dance-drama;aesthetics;popular spectators;Kerala</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the Lawsonia intracellularis-induced porcine proliferative enteropathies.</field><field name="creator">Collins, Alison Marie</field><field name="description">The porcine proliferative enteropathies (PPE) are a group of diseases ranging from intestinal adenomatosis (PIA), a chronic condition causing reduced growth rates in post weaning pigs, to the often fatal proliferative haemorrhagic enteropathy (PHE), resulting in intestinal haemorrhage.  PHE predominantly occurs in older and heavier pigs than the chronic disease PIA.  This thesis examined whether the age when susceptible pigs are infected affects the clinical response to L.intracellularis infection.    The characteristic pathologic lesion of PPE is the abnormal proliferation of crypt epithelial cells in the ileum and colon.  Closely associated with this proliferation is the presence of an obligately intracellular bacterium, Lawsonia intracellularis.  Characterisation of L.intracellularis was performed in in-vitro co-cultures of L.intracellularis extracted from PHE-affected mucosa.  The efficacy of antimicrobials to inhibit the growth of L.intracellularis in-vitro was evaluated and compared with isolates cultured in the United Kingdom.  The results were analysed with respect to medication strategies currently used to control PPE in piggeries.     PPE occurs in virtually all piggery management systems, including newly developed systems that are aimed at improving the herd health, such as segregated early weaning and multiple site production.  PPE is currently controlled in Australia with the routine addition of antimicrobials in pig feed, in particular olaquindox.  Recommendations to reduce the use of feed-based antibiotics in Australia require the development of alternate strategies to control diseases such as PPE.      Sequential outbreaks of PHE reported in minimal disease herds suggested that pigs could develop immunity to disease.  An experimental model of L.intracellularis infection was developed in this thesis to demonstrate that immunity to re-infection with L.intracellularis could be developed.  Infection was monitored by detection of faecal shedding of L.intracellularis and serum IgG antibodies against L.intracellularis.    Two in-feed antimicrobial strategies were analysed in this thesis for their ability to induce the development of immunity to L.intracellularis, while avoiding clinical signs of disease.  The first strategy evaluated the use of low levels of in-feed antimicrobials to allow subclinical infection and the development of immunity.  The second strategy evaluated the use of high levels of in-feed antimicrobials to terminate infection two weeks after exposure to L.intracellularis.     Gaining a greater understanding of how L.intracellularis infection is spread both within and between piggeries will enable the development of management strategies to control the spread of infection.  This thesis examined the possibility that other species in contact with pigs and piggeries such as rats, mice and birds may transmit infection to pigs.  The transmission of infection between pigs via the faecal/oral route was also examined, as was the survival and infectivity of L.intracellularis over time.      Ultimately this thesis aimed to understand the pattern of L.intracellularis infection and the survival and transmission of L.intracellularis in order to develop effective control measures for PPE, especially in minimal disease herds.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lawsonia intracellularis;immunity;transmission of infection;survival of lawsonia intracellularis;control of the porcine proliferative enteropathies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the relationship between mood states, sense of self, flow and personal constructs in anorexia nervosa participants</field><field name="creator">Scicluna, Helen</field><field name="description">Public view removed at the authors request. 16/07/2006</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">experience sampling method;flow;anorexia nervosa;bulimia nervosa;sense of self</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Separation of Early Christianity from Judaism</field><field name="creator">Dacy, Marianne Josephine</field><field name="description">The Separation of Early Christianity from Judaism The moving apart of early Christianity from Judaism was a gradual process of de- judaisation, with separation taking place on several levels. Chapter One looks at the spread of Christianity and the physical moving apart of Jews and Christians by observing the geographical locations of the bishops attending various councils. Chapter Two examines the question of the Jewish-Christians who attempted to be both Jewish and Christian at the same time. In Chapter Three, statements about Jews in the early church councils which reveal judaising practices have been examined. Chapter Four studies the process of juridical separation of Jews from Christians as shown by an examination of the Theodosian Code. The fifth chapter examines the Jewish roots of Christian liturgy and focuses on the element that radically differentiated Christian from Jewish liturgy - its christological focus. Chapter Six speaks of the separation of Sabbath observance from Sunday observance, outlining the struggle to prevent Christians, who were accused of judaising, from celebrating the Sabbath as well as Sunday. Chapter Seven concentrates on the separation of Passover from Easter. While Chapter Eight investigates the development of a distinctly Christian archaeology, the ninth area of separation concerns the subject of Christianity in the rabbinic writings. In the nine areas studied, two pervasive causes of separation have been identified. The first concerns the non-practice of Jewish ritual law, when Christianity became predominantly a religion of non-Jews. Christianity, in order to define itself closed its ranks to Jewish practices. The second cause leading to separation was the messianic movement centred on Jesus, and the growing emphasis on the divinity of Jesus. This was reflected in the developing Christian liturgy, in the christianisation of Passover, the Eucharist and the practice of Sunday over and above the Jewish Sabbath.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Christianity Judaism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV/STD Prevention in General Practice</field><field name="creator">Proude, Elizabeth Marjorie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines aspects of the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the Australian community, with a particular emphasis on HIV/AIDS in the context of general practice (or primary care settings).  The work has four broad aims:    i) To describe the primary prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, following from the arrival of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Australia    ii) To describe HIV/STD risk behaviour     iii) To summarise previously known evidence of interventions to reduce risk and to raise awareness of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases     iv) To contribute new evidence addressing the potential of the general practitioners' role in HIV/STD prevention      The first chapter gives a brief review of the history of HIV/AIDS from its discovery in the United States of America to its appearance in Australia and New Zealand, and discusses the Australian response strategies, both initial and continuing, to confine the epidemic.  Specifically, the arrival of HIV/AIDS gave rise to increasing awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, which hitherto, although sometimes chronic, were rarely fatal.  The public health risk of HIV necessitated swift government action and led to wider acceptance of publicity about sexual behaviour.  Although the thesis does not concentrate solely on HIV, this is still an emphasis.  This chapter provides useful background to ensuing chapters.    Chapter Two provides an overview of behavioural risk in sexually transmitted diseases.  It gives a review of risk factor prevalence studies, and introduces risk behaviour and cognitive models of behaviour change, as applied to STD risk.  Sexual behaviour is a complex social interaction, usually involving more than one person, and relying on the personality and behaviour patterns intrinsic to the individuals taking part.  It is therefore perhaps more challenging to alter than behaviour which is undertaken alone, being dependent on the behaviour and intentions of both parties. Moreover, comprehensive assessment of sexual risk behaviour requires very detailed information about each incident.  Its private nature makes accurate data difficult to obtain, and sexual risk behaviour is, correspondingly, difficult to measure.     Chapter Three reviews the effectiveness of interventions tested in primary health care settings to reduce sexual risk behaviour.  The candidate uses a replicable method to retrieve and critique studies, comparable with standards now required by the Cochrane Collaboration.  From 22 studies discussed, nine health interventions were short, 'one-shot', efforts owing to limited time, resources and other practical constraints.  This review demonstrates the scarcity of interventions with people who may be perceived as 'low-risk'. Only four interventions were carried out in community health centres and two in university health clinics. One of the university interventions showed no change in sexual behaviour in any of three arms of the intervention (Wenger, Greenberg et al 1992) while the other showed an increase in condom use in both groups, although the intervention group's self-efficacy and assertiveness also improved  (Sikkema, Winett &amp; Lombard 1995).   The rationale for the intervention, where given, is described.    Chapter Four analyses the content, format and quality of sexual health information brochures available in New South Wales at the time of the candidate's own planning for an interventional study.  One of the most effective ways to disseminate information widely is by the use of educational literature, especially when the subject material is potentially sensitive or embarrassing to discuss in person.  In this chapter, the candidate reviews the literature available at the time of designing the intervention used in Chapter Five.  Readability, attractiveness, clarity and the accurate presentation of facts about sexually transmitted disease risk are examined for each pamphlet. Forty-seven pamphlets were scored according to the Flesch formula, and twenty-four of these scored in the 'fairly' to 'very difficult' range.  There was, therefore, a paucity of easy-to-read material on these subjects.    Chapter Five evaluates a general practitioner-based counselling intervention to raise awareness of sexually transmitted diseases and to modify HIV/STD risk behaviour.  While adults aged 18-25 are less likely than older cohorts to have a regular general practitioner or to visit often, most people visit a general practitioner at least once a year.  This could provide an opportunity for the general practitioner to raise preventive health issues, especially with infrequent attendees.  As the effectiveness of an opportunistic intervention about sexual risk behaviour was yet to be tested, the candidate designed an innovative randomised controlled trial to raise awareness of risk and increase preventive behaviour.  The participation rate was 90% and 76% consented to followup; however the attrition rate meant that overall only 52% of the original participants completed the follow-up questionnaire. The intervention proved easy and acceptable both to GPs and to patients, and risk perception had increased at three months' follow-up; however this occurred in both the control (odds ratio 2.6) and the intervention group, whose risk perception at baseline was higher (odds ratio 1.3).    In order to establish some markers of risk in the general population, Chapter Six analyses data resulting from questions on sexual behaviour asked in the Central Sydney section of the NSW Health Survey.  The candidate advocated for inclusion of relevant questions to determine some benchmarks of sexual risk behaviour and to provide an indication of condom use among heterosexuals.  Although limited in scope as a result of competing priorities for questions in the survey, results demonstrate that, while a small percentage of people were at risk, those with higher levels of partner change or of alcohol use were the most likely to always use condoms.  Specifically, 100% of those with more than four new partners in the last 12 months had used condoms with every new partner.  In addition, 'heavy' alcohol users were more likely to report condom use every time with new partners (odds ratio 0.34).    To furnish data to inform future planning of educational activities for general practitioners, Chapter Seven presents the results of a survey of Central Sydney general practitioners' opinions and current practices in HIV risk reduction with in the broader context of sexually transmitted disease prevention. The general practitioner is in an ideal position to provide information and advice, especially if future research affirms the impact of such advice on STD risk behaviour.  General practitioners in this study said they would be slightly more likely to discuss sexual health matters with young patients than with older ones (p=0.091), but this was not significant.  The most cited barrier to discussing sexual health was inadequate remuneration for taking time to do so (over 50% gave this reason).  The next most cited obstacle was difficulty in raising the subject of STDs or HIV in routine consultations, but this reason was given by less than half the sample. Forty-six percent had participated in continuing medical education programs in STDs, HIV/AIDS, or hepatitis diagnosis or management; 32% of GPs had patients with HIV, and 55% of all GPs indicated they would like more training in management and continuity of care of HIV patients.  Approximately half (51%) wanted more training in sexuality issues, including sexual dysfunction.            Chapter Eight reviews the whole thesis and discusses future directions for the research agenda.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV / AIDS;sexual behaviour;sexually transmitted diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rival goals and values in administrative review: a study of migration decision making</field><field name="creator">Fleming, Gabriel Catherine</field><field name="description">Some form of administrative review of executive action is accepted in the common law world for the reason that it serves certain basic values and goals.  This study draws on political, legal and management theory in considering the values that underlie administrative review.  It is primarily concerned with the role of tribunal review.  A full range of values are considered, including fairness, justice, consistency, rationality, dignity, respect, accessibility, equity, efficiency and economy.  Some are seen as fundamental to the administrative review system while others have different purposes.      There is general agreement on many of the values and goals of administrative review.  In their practical application however, values compete, overlap and evolve in accordance with economic, social, political and legal change.  There are value tensions in, for instance, the role of independent tribunals as a check on the power of the executive while they are also within the executive, in the extent of the obligation on administrative tribunals to apply government policy and in the setting of proper limits of judicial review.  There is continuing tension in demands for individual dignity and rights to fair treatment on the one hand and notions of the 'public interest' on the other.  This thesis argues that the provision of tribunal review of administrative decisions is increasingly ideologically driven and focussed on 'functional' or 'management' values.  At times these have trumped other values in decisions about entitlements to procedural fairness, access to review, effectiveness in public administration and the achievement of the 'correct and preferable' decision in the instant case.      The focus of this thesis is a case study of migration decision-making.  The importance of this area of study is evident in the potentially devastating consequences that migration decisions can have for individuals and families.  In the context of Australia's history of inadequate and racially based migration policies, independent administrative review provides security against arbitrariness and discrimination in decision-making.  An analysis of administrative review of decisions made under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) by the Migration Review Tribunal, and its predecessor the Immigration Review Tribunal, illustrates the claim that values, in their application, have real, practical and local importance.       Issues of tribunal independence and accountability, the normative goal of review and procedural justice are considered in depth.  It is argued that where compromises are made in administrative review, underlying values should be revealed so that their practical consequences may be better understood.       The need to articulate and analyze these issues has never been greater.  The Australian administrative review system is in a period of change analogous to that of the introduction of the 'new' administrative law in the 1970s.  If tribunals are to continue to play an effective role then it is important to think clearly about how they can, in practice, embody the right mix of administrative law values.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">administrative law;migration tribunals;values</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jessie Tomlins: An Australian Army Nurse World War One.</field><field name="creator">Rae, Ruth Lillian</field><field name="description">There is an abundance of historical and anecdotal material relating to the experiences of the Australian soldier during World War 1.  These soldiers were conscious both during and after the war that their contribution was important and that it was recognised as such by Australian society at large.  Conversely there is an almost total absence of historical or anecdotal material about the role of the Australian nurse who served during this same conflict.  Whether these nurses had the same degree of consciousness, either during or after the war, that their contributions were valued or seen as important by Australian society remains, largely, unknown. This thesis attempts to redress, in part, this absence by telling the story of a nurse, Jessie Tomlins, who served in the Australian Army Nursing Service during this period.  At the same time specific aspects of the historical events surrounding World War One will be explored.     Jessie Tomlins served, first as a Staff Nurse and later as a Sister, in the 14th Australian General Hospital in Egypt during 1916. At the same time her brother, Fred Tomlins, was already serving in the 1st Australian Light Horse Regiment and spent the entire four years of World War 1 in Palestine and Egypt.  At the end of 1916 their younger brother, Will Tomlins, also joined the Army and became a member of the Anzac Mounted Division. The letters, postcards and photographs that Jessie, Fred and Will sent home to their mother and family, as well as Fred's fourteen diaries, form the foundation of this thesis.       This thesis provides a meaningful snapshot of one woman from rural Australia who completed her nurse training during the war and then served her country during one of the most brutal periods of humankind. Her own words clearly tell the story of her war time experiences whilst, at the same time, conveying her expectations, prior to, during and after, this event. The development of the Australian Army Nursing Service, as it affected Jessie, over this period is also considered.     It will be demonstrated that whilst ordinary men, soldiers, were at the military front line so too were ordinary women, nurses. The thesis will provide support for the contention that the contribution of Australian nurses in World War One, especially that of the ordinary nurse caring for the ordinary soldier, has been poorly recorded and as a result remains under-valued.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing;military;army nursing;AANS;World War One;Australian Nurses;ANZAC;Beersheba</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an Alternative Description of Incomplete Sentences in Agglutinative Languages</field><field name="creator">Ido, Shinji Ido</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses 'incomplete sentences' in languages which utilise distinctively agglutinative components in their morphology.   In the grammars of the languages dealt with in this thesis, there are certain types of sentences which are variously referred to as 'elliptical sentences' (Turkish eksiltili c&#65533;mleler), 'incomplete sentences' (Uzbek to'liqsiz gaplar), 'cut-off sentences' (Turkish kesik c&#65533;mleler), etc., for which the grammarians provide elaborated semantic and syntactic analyses.  The current work attempts to present an alternative approach for the analysis of such sentences. The distribution of morphemes in incomplete sentences is examined closely, based on which a system of analysis that can handle a variety of incomplete sentences in an integrated manner is proposed from a morphological point of view. It aims to aid grammarians as well as researchers in area studies by providing a simple description of incomplete sentences in agglutinative languages.

Ultrasonic image reconstruction is particularly notorious in this  regard, with narrow transducer bandwidths and limited - sometimes sparsely  sampled apertures posing formidable difficulties for conventional signal  processing.  To overcome these difficulties, some form of regularisation is  mandatory, whereby the ill-posed problem is restated as a closely related,  well-posed problem, and then solved uniquely.    This thesis explores the application of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) regularisation  to the problem of reconstructing complex-valued imagery from sparsely sampled  coherent ultrasonic field data, with particular emphasis on three-dimensional  problems in the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of materials.  MaxEnt has not  previously been applied to this class of problem, and yet in comparison with  many other approaches to image reconstruction, it emerges as the clear leader in  terms of resolution and overall image quality.  To account for this performance,  it is argued that the default image model used with MaxEnt is particularly  meaningful in cases of ultrasonic scattering by objects embedded in homogeneous  media.    To establish physical and mathematical insights into the forward problem, linear  equations describing scattering from both penetrable and impenetrable objects  are first derived using the Born and physical optics approximations  respectively.  These equations are then expressed as a shift-invariant  computational model that explicitly incorporates sparse sampling.  To validate  this model, time-domain scattering responses are computed and compared with  analytical solutions for a simple canonical test case drawn from the field of  NDE.  The responses computed via the numerical model are shown to accurately  reproduce the analytical responses.    To solve inverse scattering problems via MaxEnt, the robust Cambridge algorithm  is generalised to the complex domain and extended to handle broadband  (multiple-frequency) data.  Two versions of the augmented algorithm are then  compared with a range of other algorithms, including several linearly  regularised algorithms and lastly, due to its acknowledged status as a competitor  with MaxEnt in radio-astronomy, the non-linear CLEAN algorithm.  These  comparisons are made through simulated 3-D imaging experiments under conditions  of both complete and sparse aperture sampling with low and high levels of  additive Gaussian noise.    As required in any investigation of inverse problems, the experimental  confirmation of algorithmic performance is emphasised, and two common imaging  geometries relevant to NDE are selected for this purpose.  In monostatic  synthetic aperture imaging experiments involving side-drilled holes in an  aluminium plate and test objects immersed in H2O, MaxEnt image reconstruction  is demonstrated to be robust against grating-lobe and side-lobe formation, in  addition to temporal bandwidth restriction.  This enables efficient  reconstruction of 2-D and 3-D images from small numbers of discrete samples in  the spatial and frequency domains.    The thesis concludes with a description of the design and testing of a novel  polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) bistatic array transducer that offers advantages  over conventional point-sampled arrays in terms of construction simplicity and  signal-to-noise ratio.  This ultra-sparse orthogonal array is the only one of  its kind yet demonstrated, and was made possible by MaxEnt signal processing.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inverse problems;image reconstruction;ultrasonics;regularisation;array;maximum entropy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Plastic Behaviour of Cold-Formed Rectangular Hollow Sections</field><field name="creator">Wilkinson, Timothy James</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to assess the suitability of cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS) for plastic design.  The project involved an extensive range of tests on cold-formed Grade C350 and Grade C450 (DuraGal) RHS beams, joints and frames.  A large number of finite element analyses was also carried out on models of RHS beams.  The conclusion is that cold- formed RHS can be used in plastic design, but stricter element slenderness (b/t) limits and consideration of the connections, are required.  Further research, particularly into the effect of axial compression on element slenderness limits, is required before changes to current design rules can be finalised.          Bending tests were performed on cold-formed RHS to examine the web and flange slenderness required to maintain the plastic moment for a large enough rotation suitable for plastic design.  The major conclusions of the beam tests were:      (i) Some sections which are classified as Compact or Class 1 by current steel design specifications do not maintain plastic rotations considered sufficient for plastic design.      (ii) The current design philosophy, in which flange and web slenderness limits are independent, is inappropriate.  An interaction formula is required, and simple formulations are proposed for RHS.            Connection tests were performed on various types of knee joints in RHS, suitable for the column - rafter connection in a portal frame.  The connection types investigated were welded stiffened and unstiffened rigid knee connections, bolted plate knee joints, and welded and bolted internal sleeve knee joints, for use in RHS portal frames.  The ability of the connections to act as plastic hinges in a portal frame was investigated.            The most important finding of the joint tests was the unexpected fracture of the cold-formed welded connections under opening moment before significant plastic rotations occurred.  The use of an internal sleeve moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection centre- line thus eliminating the need for the weld between the RHS, or the RHS and the stiffening plate, to carry the majority of the load.  The internal sleeve connections were capable of sustaining the plastic moment for large rotations considered suitable for plastic design.              Tests on pinned-base portal frames were also performed.  There were three separate tests, with two different ratios of vertical to horizontal point loads, simulating gravity and horizontal wind loads.  Two grades of steel were used for comparison.  The aims of the tests were to examine if a plastic collapse mechanism could form in a cold-formed RHS frame, and to investigate if plastic design was suitable for such frames.            In each frame, two regions of highly concentrated curvature were observed before the onset of local buckling, which indicated the formation of plastic hinges and a plastic collapse mechanism.  An advanced plastic zone structural analysis which accounted for second order effects, material non-linearity and member imperfections slightly overestimated the strength of the frames.  The analysis slightly underestimated the deflections, and hence the magnitude of the second order effects.  A second order plastic zone analysis, which did not account for the effects of structural imperfections, provided the best estimates of the strengths of the frames, but also underestimated the deflections.            While cold-formed RHS did not satisfy the material ductility requirements specified for plastic design in some current steel design standards, plastic hinges and plastic collapse mechanisms formed.  This suggests that the restriction on plastic design for cold-formed RHS based on insufficient material ductility is unnecessary, provided that the connections are suitable for plastic hinge formation, if required.              A large number of finite element analyses were performed to simulate the bending tests summarised above, and to examine various parameters not studied in the experimental investigation.  To simulate the experimental rotation capacity of the RHS beams, a sinusoidally varying longitudinal local imperfection was prescribed.  The finite element analysis determined similar trends as observed experimentally, namely that the rotation capacity depended on both the web slenderness and flange slenderness, and that for a given section aspect ratio, the relationship between web slenderness and rotation capacity was non-linear.    The main finding of the finite element study was that the size of the imperfections had an unexpectedly large influence on the rotation capacity.  Larger imperfections were required in the more slender sections to simulate the experimental results.  There should be further investigation into the effect of varying material properties on rotation capacity.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">steel;cold-formed steel;hollow sections;cold-fromed steel;rectangular hollow sections;RHS;SHS;SSHS;bending;buckling;stability;instability;slenderness limits;web;flange;compactness;plastic design;connections;welding;bolting;rotation capacity;frame;analysis;plastic design;plastic analysis;elastic analysis;finite element analysis;design codes;specifications;FEA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Politeness Phenomena and Mild Conflict in Japanese Casual Conversation</field><field name="creator">Kitamura, Noriko</field><field name="description">Politeness Phenomena and Mild Conflict in Japanese Casual Conversation</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">politeness;conflict;Japanese linguistics;discourse analysis;conversation analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and pharmacological studies of orofacial pain.</field><field name="creator">Vickers, Edward Russell</field><field name="description">For pain research, the orofacial region is unique in a number of ways. The region has complex local anatomy, including substantial sensory innervation from neural pathways, and muscles of facial expression that convey important information concerning pain intensity and associated psychological traits. Although chronic orofacial pain conditions appear prevalent, useful documentation on pain intensity ratings using well established instruments is sparse. In particular, two conditions, atypical facial pain and atypical odontalgia, are poorly understood in aetiology so that definitive treatment modalities are severely limited. The region's local biofluid, saliva, has been used to diagnose various local and systemic disease states, and to quantitate drug concentrations. However, recent studies indicate that saliva also contains some of the same peptides, e.g. bradykinin, that are involved in pain mechanisms. It may be that pharmacological-pharmacokinetic studies of these peptides could shed more information on thesignificance of their presence in saliva.     This thesis consists of four major sections.

Synopsis  The central hypotheses of this thesis are:    that global formulary apportionment is the most appropriate method for the taxation of transnational corporations (TNCs) in lieu of the present system commonly referred to as the separate accounting/arm's length method; and     that it is essential, in order to implement the proposed global formulary model, to create an international organisation which would fulfil, in the taxation field, a role equivalent to that of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in international trade.    The world economy is fast integrating and is increasingly dominated by the activities of transnational enterprises. These activities create a dual tax problem for various revenue authorities seeking to tax gains derived thereon:     Firstly, when two or more countries entertain conflicting tax claims on the same base, there arises what is commonly referred to as a double taxation problem.    Secondly, an allocation problem arises when different jurisdictions seek to determine the quantum of the gains to be allocated to each jurisdiction for taxation purposes.    The traditional regime for solving both the double taxation and the allocation problem is enshrined in a series of bilateral treaties signed between various nations. These are, in general, based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Treaty.1 It is submitted, in this thesis, that while highly successful in an environment characterised by the coexistence of various national taxation systems, the traditional regime lacks the essential attributes suitable to the emerging 'borderless world'.  The central theme of this thesis is the allocation problem. The OECD Model attempts to deal with this issue on a bilateral basis. Currently, the allocation problem is resolved through the application of Articles 7 and 9 of the OECD Model. In both instances the solution is based on the 'separate enterprise' standard, also known as the separate entity theory.  This separate accounts/arm's length system was articulated in the 1930s when international trade consisted of flows of raw materials and other natural products as well as flows of finished manufactured goods. Such trade is highly visible and may be adequately valued both at the port of departure or at the port of entry in a country. It follows that within this particular system of international trade the application of the arm's length principle was relatively easy and proved to be extremely important in resolving both the double taxation and apportionment problems.  Today, however, the conditions under which international trade is conducted are substantially different from those that prevailed until the 1960s.  * Firstly, apart from the significant increase in the volume of traditionally traded goods, trade in services now forms the bulk of international exchanges. In addition, the advent of the information age has dramatically increased the importance of specialised information whose value is notoriously difficult to ascertain for taxation purposes.  * Secondly, the globalisation phenomenon which gathered momentum over the last two decades has enabled existing TNCs to extend their global operations and has favoured the emergence of new transnational firms. Thus, intra-firm trade conducted outside market conditions accounts for a substantial part of international trade.  * Thirdly, further economic integration has been achieved following the end of the Cold War and the acceleration of the globalisation phenomenon. In this new world economic order only TNCs have the necessary resources to take advantage of emerging opportunities.  The very essence of a TNC is 'its ability to achieve higher revenues (or lower costs) from its different subsidiaries as a whole compared to the results that would be achieved under separate management on an arm's length basis.'2 Yet, the prevailing system for the taxation of TNCs overlooks this critical characteristic and is therefore incapable of fully capturing, for taxation purposes, the aggregate gains of TNCs. The potential revenue loss arising from the inability of the present system to account for and to allocate synergy gains is substantial.  It follows that the perennial questions of international taxation can no longer be addressed within the constraints of the separate entity theory and a narrow definition of national sovereignty. Indeed, in order to mirror the developments occurring in the economic field, taxation needs to move from a national to an international level.  Moreover, a profound reform of the system is imperative in order to avoid harmful tax competition between nations and enhance compliance from TNCs. Such a new international tax system needs to satisfy the test of simplicity, equity, efficiency, and administrative ease. To achieve these objectives international cooperation is essential. The hallmark of international cooperation has been the emergence, after World War II, of a range of international organisations designed to facilitate the achievement of certain goals deemed essential by various nations. The need for an organisation to deal specifically with taxation matters is now overwhelming.   Consequently, this thesis recommends the creation of an international organisation to administer the proposed system. The main objective of this international organisation would be to initiate and coordinate the multilateral application of a formulary apportionment system which, it is suggested, would deal in a more realistic way with 'the difficult problems of determining the tax base and allocating it appropriately between jurisdictions'.3  The global formulary apportionment methodology is derived from the unitary entity theory. The unitary theory considers a TNC as a single business which, for convenience, is divided into 'purely formal, separately-incorporated subsidiaries'.4 Under the unitary theory the global income of TNCs needs to be computed, then such income is apportioned between the various component parts of the enterprise by way of a formula which reflects the economic contribution of each part to the derivation of profits.  The question that arises is whether the world of international taxation is ready for such a paradigm shift. It is arguable that this shift has already occurred albeit cautiously and in very subtle ways. Thus, the latest of the OECD Guidelines on the transfer pricing question provides that 'MNE [Multinational Enterprise] groups retain the freedom to apply methods not described in this Report to establish prices provided those prices satisfy the arm's length principle in accordance with these Guidelines.'5 Arguably, the globalisation process has created 'the specific situation' allowed for by the OECD. This thesis, therefore, explores the relative obsolescence of the bilateral approach to the taxation of TNCs and then suggests that a multilateral system is better adapted to the emerging globalised economy.   The fundamental building blocks of the model proposed in this thesis are the following:   * First, the administration and coordination of the proposed system is to be achieved by the creation of a specialised tax organisation, called Intertax, to which member countries would devolve a limited part of their fiscal sovereignty.  * Second, in order to enable the centralised calculation of TNC's profits, the proposed system requires the formulation of harmonised methods for the measurement of the global profits of TNCs. Therefore, the efforts of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) to produce international accounting standards and harmonised consolidation rules must be recognised and, if needs be, refined and ultimately implemented.   * Third, the major function of Intertax would be to determine the commercial profits of TNCs on a standardised basis and to apportion the latter to relevant countries by way of an appropriate formula/formulas.   Once this is achieved, each country would be free, starting from its share of commercial profits, to determine the taxable income in accordance with the particular tax base that it adopts and, ultimately, the tax payable within its jurisdiction. In the proposed system, therefore, a particular country would be able to independently set whatever depreciation schedules or investment tax credits it chooses, and adopt whatever tax accounting rules it deems fit relative to its policy objectives.   Moreover, this thesis argues that the global formulary apportionment model it proposes is not dramatically opposed to the arm's length principle. Indeed, it suggests that the constant assumption to the contrary, even with regard to the usual formulary apportionment methodology, is extravagant because both methodologies are based on a common endeavour, that is, to give a substantially correct reflex of a TNC's true profits.   It has often been objected that global formulary apportionment is arbitrary and ignores market conditions. This thesis addresses such concerns by rejecting the application of a single all-purpose formula. Rather, it recognises that TNCs operating in different industries require different treatment and, therefore, suggests the adoption of different formulas to satisfy specific industry requirements. For example, the formula applicable to a financial institution would be different to that applicable to the pharmaceutical industry. Each formula needs to be based on the fundamental necessity to capture the functions, taking into consideration assets used, and risks assumed within that industry. In addition, if the need arises, each formula should be able to be fine-tuned to fit specific situations. Moreover, it is also pertinent to note that the OECD already accepts 'the selected application of a formula developed by both tax administrations in cooperation with a specific taxpayer or MNE group...such as it might be used in a mutual agreement procedure, advance transfer pricing agreement, or other bilateral or multilateral determination.'6 The system proposed in this thesis can thus be easily reconciled with the separate accounting/arm's length which the OECD so vehemently advocates. Both models have the same preoccupations so that what is herein proposed may simply be characterised as an institutionalised version of the system advocated by the OECD.  Multilateral formulary apportionment addresses both the double taxation and the allocation problems in international taxation. It resolves the apportionment question 'without depending on an extraordinary degree of goodwill or compliance from taxpayers.'7 It is therefore submitted that, if applied on a multilateral basis with a minimum of central coordination, it also seriously addresses the double taxation problem. Indeed, it is a flexible method given that different formulas may be devised to suit the needs of TNCs operating in different sectors. Consequently, formulary apportionment understood in this sense, is a realistic alternative to the limitations of the present system.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">formulary taxation;unitary tax;arms length principle;world wide combined reporting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/846</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hard Cash, John Dwyer and his Contemporaries, 1890-1914</field><field name="creator">Hearn, Mark Graeme</field><field name="description">John Dwyer (1856-1934) was a London docks foreman who emigrated to Australia in 1888. Leaving his London employment on his 'own accord', Dwyer embarked upon a quest for recognition - recognition of his rights as a worker and his identity as an individual. Dwyer and his family arrived in New South Wales to be greeted by the economic depression of the 1890s, and state and employer mobilisation against organised labour and working class radicals. Dwyer was soon reduced to scraping together a living as a boarding house manager in Sydney's poorest districts, as he helped organise the Active Service Brigade, which agitated on behalf of the unemployed.     Dwyer's surviving papers - twenty-one boxes of correspondence, manuscripts, minutes, handbills, tracts and newspaper clippings, plus several other volumes - document the life of a working class political radical and autodidact who embraced temperance, and who was fascinated by new ideas in religion and science - Darwinism, Theosophy and occult spiritualism. This thesis places Dwyer in the context of  the intense ideological ferment of new ideas in politics, theology and science that characterised the period 1890-1914. Ideas that aggressively challenged the old certainties, and which Dwyer embraced in his project to 'change the face of the world.' Changing the world contested with the need to endure its conditions. Theosophy and temperance appealed to Dwyer's notion of duty, and an instinct to rationalise the social and economic roles he seemed unable to escape. The fragmented nature of his papers, and stop-start bursts of public activism - in politics, theosophy and temperance - reflect the tension between an urge to fight, to understand, to create - struggling against the daily demands of making a living and feeding a family.    The thesis explores Dwyer's relationship with fellow radicals and workers, the labour movement and members of Sydney's social and political elite - men and women who shared and contested with his vision. Dwyer's complex and at times apparently contradictory values can be found amongst radicals and labourites alike - for example, William Lane, W.G. Spence and Bernard O'Dowd. Nor was Dywer's interest in theosophy or the occult as unusual as it might seem to modern readers.    Dwyer's papers provide important insights into dilemmas that have challenged historians: the problem of alienation, the role of the individual in the historical process, the nature of working class radicalism. Issues often analysed in theoretically abstract terms, or at a broad level of historical inquiry, across a national or class-wide scale. Broad analyses of social forces or ideologies tend to distort their historical impact and meaning, failing to capture the complex relationship of phenomena such as class or ideology with individual experience. Working from Dwyer's experience, this thesis argues that it is possible to build a complex picture of working class life in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Australia.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian History;Biography;narrative identity;John Dwyer;labour history;federation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Missing Links the role of phase synchronous gamma oscillations in normal cognition and their dysfunction in schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Haig, Albert Roland</field><field name="description">SUMMARY    Introduction: There has recently been a great deal of interest in the role of synchronous high-frequency gamma oscillations in brain function. This interest has been motivated by an increasing body of evidence, that oscillations which are synchronous in phase across separated neuronal populations, may represent an important mechanism by which the brain binds or integrates spatially distributed processing activity which is related to the same object.    Many models of schizophrenia suggest an impairment in the integration of brain processing, such as a loosening of associations, disconnection, defective multiple constraint organization, or cognitive dysmetria. This has led to recent speculation that abnormalities of high-frequency gamma synchronization may reflect a core dimension of the disturbance underlying this disorder. However, examination of the phase synchronization of gamma oscillations in patients with schizophrenia has never been previously undertaken.    Method: In this thesis a new method of analysis of gamma synchrony was introduced, which enables the phase relationships of oscillations in a specific frequency band to be examined across multiple scalp sites as a function of time. This enabled, for the first time, the phase synchronization of gamma oscillations across widespread regions, to be studied in electrical brain activity measured at the scalp in humans. Gamma synchrony responses were studied in electroencephalographic (EEG) data acquired during a commonly employed conventional auditory oddball paradigm.    The research consisted of two sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, data from 100 normal subjects, consisting of 10 males and 10 females in each age decade from 20 to 70, was examined. These experiments were designed to characterize the gamma synchonizations that occurred in response to target and background stimuli and their functional significance in normal brain activity, and to exclude the possibility of these findings being due to electromyogram (EMG) or volume conduction artifact. The examination of functional significance involved the development of an additional new analysis technique. In the second set of experiments, data acquired from 35 patients with schizophrenia and 35 matched normal controls was analyzed. The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether patients showed disturbances of gamma synchrony compared to controls, and to establish the relationship of any such disturbances to medication levels, symptom profiles, duration of illness, and a range of psychophysiological variables.    Results: In the 100 normals, responses to target stimuli were characterized by two bursts of synchronous gamma oscillations, an early (evoked) and a late (induced) synchronization, with different topographic distributions. Only the early gamma synchronization was seen in response to background stimuli. The main variable modulating the magnitude of these gamma synchronizations from epoch to epoch was pre-stimulus EEG theta (3-7 Hz) and delta (1-3 Hz) power. Early and late gamma synchrony were also associated with N1 and P3 ERP component amplitude across epochs. Across subjects, the early gamma synchronization was associated with shorter latency of the ERP components P2, N2 and P3, smaller amplitude of N1 and P2, and smaller pre-stimulus beta power. The control analyses showed that these gamma responses were specific to a narrow frequency range (37 to 41 Hz), and were not present in adjacent frequency bands. The responses were not generated by EMG contamination or volume conduction.    In the 35 patients with schizophrenia, significant abnormalities of both the early and late synchronizations were observed compared to the 35 normal controls, with distinctive topographic characteristics. In general, early gamma synchrony was increased in patients compared to controls, and late gamma synchrony was decreased. These gamma synchrony disturbances were not related to medication level or the four summed symptom profile scores (positive, negative, general and total). They were, however, associated with duration of illness, becoming less severe the longer the patient had suffered from the disorder. The disordered gamma synchrony in patients was not secondary to abnormalities in other psychophysiological variables, but appeared to represent a primary disturbance.    Discussion: The early synchronization may relate to the binding of object representations in early sensory processing, or, given that a constant inter-stimulus interval was employed, may be anticipatory and related to active memory. The late response is probably involved in binding in relation to activation of the internal contextual model involved in late expectancy/contextual processing (context updating or context closure) for target stimuli.    The across epochs effects may relate to whether the focus of attention immediately prior to stimulus presentation is internal or is directed at the task. The across subjects effects suggest that a larger magnitude of the early gamma synchronization might indicate that the subject maintains a more stable and less ambiguous internal representation of the environment, that reduces the complexity of input and facilitates target/background discrimination and subsequent processing. The early gamma synchronization findings in patients with schizophrenia suggest that anticipatory processing involving active memory and forward-prediction of the environment is subject to over-binding or the formation of inappropriate associations. The late synchronization disturbances may reflect a fragmentation of contextual processing, and an inability to maintain contextual models of the environment intact over time.    Conclusion: This research demonstrates the potential importance of integrative network activity as indexed by gamma phase synchrony in relation to normal cognition, and the possible broad relevance of such activity in psychiatric disorders. In particular, the application in this study to patients with schizophrenia showed that an impairment of brain integrative activity (missing links) might be a key feature of this illness.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gamma;phase;synchrony;coherence;oscillations;high frequency;schizophrenia;event related potentials ERP;electroencephalogram EEG</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inverse compton scattering in high energy astrophysics</field><field name="creator">Cullen, Jason Graham</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates some aspects of the inverse Compton scattering process within      various physical contexts in high energy astrophysics. Initially an introduction to the      key results of Comptonization theory for the case of scattering in optically thick plasmas      is given, using a diffusion approach, since these results are required for the interpreta-      tion of Comptonized spectra.      Since Comptonization in astrophysical systems is frequently treated using numerical      techniques, an introduction to these is then presented. Such linear Monte Carlo photon      transport codes are typically applied to scattering in plasmas without temperature and      density gradients. Additionally, treating bulk motion can be difficult even for simple      cases.      It is demonstrated that these problems can be made tractable numerically with the use of      algorithms associated with non-linear Monte Carlo codes. Such codes can already treat      scattering within arbitrary velocity structures in a plasma, and an extension of the algo-      rithm is proposed that enables the easy calculation of photon transport in plasmas with      non-constant density as well as non-constant temperature and/or bulk motion. This      algorithm and code has been developed to treat scattering in astrophysical situations      where bulk motion, temperature gradients and density gradients are simultaneously      present in a plasma.      Both a semi-analytic approach and the numerical approach are then used to treat Comp-      tonization problems of current interest. Firstly, the standard two-phase disk-corona      model for the high-energy spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei is modified to include an      an outflow or wind which may provide an additional source of disk cooling. Earlier      slab disk-corona models predict a spectral index which is consistent with observations      only if all the accretion power is dissipated in the corona. For the models investigated      here, energy spectral indices that are consistent with observations can be obtained with      less accretion power being dissipated in the corona, as a result of an outflow/wind.      However, it is required that the wind extract large amounts of power from the disk, and      it it yet to be seen if this is a plausible scenario.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">comptonization;astrophysics;bulk motin scattering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intentions of the Framers of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution</field><field name="creator">McGrath, Frank Roland</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the speeches and debates in the Australasian Federation Conference of 1890, and the Australasian Federal Conventions of 1891 and 1897-8 for the purpose of establishing what the framers of the Commonwealth Constitution understood to be the meaning and purpose of the individual sections of the Constitution upon which they were called upon either to support or oppose.

The lived experiences of 14 older men and the horizon of this researcher developed an understanding of what it is like for men to grow old and, for some, to live with the effects of a major disability.   The study is grounded in the philosophical hermeneutics of Gadamer and framed in the context of embodiment, masculinity, and narrative. I conducted multiple in-depth interviews with older men aged from 67 to 83 years of age. Seven of the participants had experienced a stroke and I was able to explore the phenomenon of disability with them. Through thematic and narrative analyses of the textual data interpretations were developed that identified common meanings and understandings of the phenomena of ageing and disability.   These themes and narratives reveal that the men&#65533;s understandings are at odds with conventional negative views of ageing and disability. These older men are &#65533;alive and kicking&#65533;, they voice counternarratives to the dominant construction of ageing as decline and weakness, and have succeeded in remaking the lifeworld after stroke. Overall I have come to understand an overarching meaning of older men &#65533;working it out&#65533; as illustrative of a strong face of ageing and disability.  Older men seek out opportunities to participate actively in community life and, despite the challenges of ageing and disability, lead significant and meaningful lives. These findings challenge and extend our limited understandings of men&#65533;s experiences of ageing and living with disability. This interpretation offers gendered directions for policy development, clinical practice, and future research.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older men;ageing;disability;identity;strong face</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient Methods for Predicting Soil Hydraulic Properties</field><field name="creator">Minasny, Budiman</field><field name="description">Both empirical and process-simulation models are useful for evaluating the effects of management practices on environmental quality and crop yield. The use of these models is limited, however, because they need many soil property values as input. The first step towards modelling is the collection of input data. Soil properties can be highly variable spatially and temporally, and measuring them is time-consuming and expensive. Efficient methods, which consider the uncertainty and cost of measurements, for estimating soil hydraulic properties form the main thrust of this study.    Hydraulic properties are affected by other soil physical, and chemical properties, therefore it is possible to develop empirical relations to predict them. This idea quantified is called a pedotransfer function. Such functions may be global or restricted to a country or region. The different classification of particle-size fractions used in Australia compared with other countries presents a problem for the immediate adoption of  exotic pedotransfer functions. A database of Australian soil hydraulic properties has been compiled. Pedotransfer functions for estimating water-retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity from particle size and bulk density for Australian soil are presented. Different approaches for deriving hydraulic transfer functions have been presented and compared. Published pedotransfer functions were also evaluated, generally they provide a satisfactory estimation of water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity depending on the spatial scale and accuracy of prediction. Several pedotransfer functions were developed in this study to predict water retention and hydraulic conductivity. The pedotransfer functions developed here may predict adequately in large areas but for site-specific applications local calibration is needed.   There is much uncertainty in the input data, and consequently the transfer functions can produce varied outputs. Uncertainty analysis is therefore needed. A general approach to quantifying uncertainty is to use Monte Carlo methods. By sampling repeatedly from the assumed probability distributions of the input variables and evaluating the response of the model the statistical distribution of the outputs can be estimated. A modified Latin hypercube method is presented for sampling joint multivariate probability distributions. This method is applied to quantify the uncertainties in pedotransfer functions of soil hydraulic properties. Hydraulic properties predicted using pedotransfer functions developed in this study are also used in a field soil-water model to analyze the uncertainties in the prediction of dynamic soil-water regimes.    The use of the disc permeameter in the field conventionally requires the placement of a layer of sand in order to provide good contact between the soil surface and disc supply membrane. The effect of sand on water infiltration into the soil and on the estimate of sorptivity was investigated. A numerical study and a field experiment on heavy clay were conducted. Placement of sand significantly increased the cumulative infiltration but showed small differences in the infiltration rate. Estimation of sorptivity based on the Philip's two term algebraic model using different methods was also examined. The field experiment revealed that the error in infiltration measurement was proportional to the cumulative infiltration curve. Infiltration without placement of sand was considerably smaller because of the poor contact between the disc and soil surface.   An inverse method for predicting soil hydraulic parameters from disc permeameter data has been developed. A numerical study showed that the inverse method is quite robust in identifying the hydraulic parameters. However application to field data showed that the estimated water retention curve is generally smaller than the one obtained in laboratory measurements. Nevertheless the estimated near-saturated hydraulic conductivity matched the analytical solution quite well. Th author believes that the inverse method can give a reasonable estimate of soil hydraulic parameters. Some experimental and theoretical problems were identified and discussed.   A formal analysis was carried out to evaluate the efficiency of the different methods in predicting water retention and hydraulic conductivity. The analysis identified the contribution of individual source of measurement errors to the overall uncertainty. For single measurements, the inverse disc-permeameter analysis is economically more efficient than using pedotransfer functions or measuring hydraulic properties in the laboratory. However, given the large amount of spatial variation of soil hydraulic properties it is perhaps not surprising that lots of cheap and imprecise measurements, e.g. by hand texturing, are more efficient than a few expensive precise ones.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil physics;inverse method;pedotransfer function;neural networks;uncertainty analysis;soil-water balance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benefits of health care beyond health: an exploration of non-health outcomes of health care.</field><field name="creator">Haas, Marion Ruth</field><field name="description">Recent interest in identifying and measuring health outcomes represents an advance in our understanding of how health care for individuals should be evaluated.  However, the concept of health outcomes has mainly focussed on improvements in health status. Non-health outcomes of health care may also be important to patients. In this thesis, four tasks were undertaken with the aim of identifying non-health outcomes and establishing the extent of their relevance and importance to patients. First, the illness experience literature was reviewed to identify potential non-health outcomes. Seven categories of non-health outcomes were identified: information, being treated with dignity, being able to trust the health care provider, having distress recognised and supported, participating in decision making, legitimation and reassurance. Second, to gain an in-depth understanding of these concepts, topic-specific literature was reviewed and synthesised. Third, in order to confirm how relevant and important the concepts were to patients, a qualitative study was conducted with each of two different groups of health service users. Broadly, patients considered that all the non-health concepts were relevant, although the extent to which they were important varied. Fourth, to test the relative importance of the seven concepts, a Stated Preference Discrete Choice experiment in the context of general practice was conducted. This study showed that most people thought their GP demonstrated behaviour likely to result in the production of non-health outcomes. The results showed that although all the non-health outcomes were, to some extent, preferred by respondents, trust was most important, followed by legitimation and recognition of and support for emotional distress. Once again, these results point to the importance of context in the evaluation of health care from the patient's perspective. While still being perceived as positive aspects of health care, the provision of information and acting autonomously or participating in decisions about their health care were the non-health outcomes considered least important by patients</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health care;outcomes;qualitative;stated preference;discrete choice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymptotic methods for tests of homogeneity for finite mixture models</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Michael  Ian</field><field name="description">We present limit theory for  tests of homogeneity for finite mixture models. More specifically,  we derive the asymptotic distribution of certain random quantities used  for testing that a mixture of two distributions is in fact  just a single distribution. Our methods apply to cases where the mixture  component  distributions come from one of a wide class of one-parameter  exponential families, both continous and discrete. We consider two  random quantities, one related to testing simple hypotheses, the other composite  hypotheses. For simple hypotheses we consider the maximum of the standardised  score process, which is itself a test statistic. For composite hypotheses  we consider the maximum of the efficient score process, which is itself  not a statistic (it depends on the unknown true distribution) but is  asymptotically equivalent to certain common test statistics in a certain sense.  We show that we can approximate both quantities with the maximum of a  certain Gaussian process depending on the sample size and the true  distribution of the observations, which when suitably normalised  has a limiting distribution  of the Gumbel extreme value type. Although the limit theory is not practically  useful for computing approximate p-values, we use Monte-Carlo simulations  to show that another method  suggested by the theory, involving using a Studentised version of  the maximum-score statistic and simulating a Gaussian process to compute  approximate p-values, is remarkably accurate and uses a fraction of the  computing resources that a straight Monte-Carlo approximation would.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mixture models;asymptotic distribution;test of homogeneity;extremes of Gaussian processes;empirical processes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intersectoral collaboration theory as a framework to assist in developing a local government food and nutrition policy</field><field name="creator">Dick, Mathew Philip</field><field name="description">The potential role of local government in NSW to address public health nutrition issues has received encouraging reports. This treatise deals with the question of whether intersectoral collaboration theory is useful to assist development of a relationship with local government to develop food and nutrition policy. Intersectoral collaboration theory describes six conditions necessary for successful action: necessity, opportunity, capacity, relationships, planned action, and sustained outcomes.    The project was a feasibility study carried out in a densely populated and multicultural local government area in Sydney&#65533;s southwest during April 1998. Eight Council employees and one elected representative were interviewed using the semi-structured questionnaire to collect a range of opinions and knowledge about Council&#65533;s involvement in a food and nutrition policy. Conceptual frameworks for the study included the Ottawa Charter and the food and nutrition system. Theoretical underpinning&#65533;s were provided by intersectoral collaboration theory and organisational change theory.     Using intersectoral collaboration theory, analysis of the interviews revealed that participants were very concerned with conditions of necessity, opportunity and capacity to develop food and nutrition policy. Intersectoral collaboration theory correctly predicted that the action proposed would have to assist Council to achieve their core business, gain social and political support and be possible within the current economic environment and level of other resources available.    Participants were not able to identify how a food and nutrition policy would meet these conditions and be feasible within the current capacity of the organisation, and therefore did not become fully engaged in the feasibility study. The health sector needs to develop arguments for local government involvement from their perspective. Organisational change within the heath sector is required to develop capacity for intersectoral partnerships, as an effective strategy to address public health nutrition issues.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">local government;food and nutrition policy;intersectoral collaboration;health promotion theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating Manufacturing Issues into Structural Optimization</field><field name="creator">Barton, Andrew Barton</field><field name="description">This dissertation aims to advance the field of structural optimization by creating and demonstrating new methodologies for the explicit inclusion of manufacturing issues. The case of composite aerospace structures was a main focus of this work as that field provides some of the greatest complexities in manufacturing yet also provides the greatest incentives to optimize structural performance.    Firstly, the possibilities for modifying existing FEA based structural optimization methods to better capture manufacturing constraints are investigated. Examples of brick-based topology optimization, shell-based topology optimization, parametric sizing optimization and manufacturing process optimization are given. From these examples, a number of fundamental limitations to these methods were observed and are discussed. The key limitation that was uncovered related to a dichotomy between analytical methods (such as FEA) and CAD-type methods.    Based on these observations, a new Knowledge-Based framework for structural optimization was suggested whereby manufacturing issues are integrally linked to the more conventional structural issues. A prototype system to implement this new framework was developed and is discussed.

An analysis of investment   performance with respect to a fund managers strategy provides important   information in determining whether performance objectives have been   achieved. There are a number of different types of investment strategies   managed funds may adopt. However, the primary dichotomy is on the basis of   whether the portfolio manager implements either an active or index approach.   Active managers attempt to outperform the market through the use of   price-sensitive information, whereas a passive manager's objective is to   replicate the returns and risk of a target benchmark index. The evaluation   of investment manager characteristics is also evaluated. This is motivated   on the basis that asset management entities place significant emphasis on   both the articulation and differentiation of their investment style relative   to competitors, and selling the strengths of their portfolio management   skills (in terms of past performance) as well identifying the key individuals   comprising their investment team and their unique attributes.   For active equity managers, the methods used in constructing portfolios and   implementing the investment strategy include security selection, in terms of   'top-down' or 'bottom-up' strategies, value-biased, growth-biased or   style-neutral strategies, and portfolios exhibiting market capitalisation   biases (i.e. preferences to large or small-cap securities). In terms of   active bond portfolio management, the most common strategies include duration   management and yield curve positioning. Active managers' strategies are   likely to extend beyond stock selection, in particular, where the fund   manager adjusts the portfolio's composition in anticipation of favourably   capitalising on future movements in the market. For index managers,   replication of both the returns and risk of the underlying index may be   achieved through either full-replication of constituent stocks comprising the   index, or through non-replication techniques (stratified sampling and/or   optimisation). Each essay provides a unique contribution to the literature   with respect to the performance of active and index funds, as well as an   analysis of funds that invest specifically in domestic equities, domestic   fixed interest, and diversified funds that invest across the broad spectrum   of asset classes.   The origins of the performance evaluation literature are ascribed to Cowles'   (1933) pioneering work, and the literature has given increasing attention to   the topic. However the most fundamental issue considered in almost all   previous studies of managed fund performance is the extent to which actively   managed portfolios have earned superior risk-adjusted excess returns for   investors. The literature has overwhelmingly documented (with a small number   of exceptions) that active funds have been unable to earn superior returns,   either before or after expenses (e.g. Jensen (1968), Elton et al. (1993),   Malkiel (1995), Gruber (1996)). While the international evidence is   supported by the few Australian managed fund studies available, Australian   research remains surprisingly scarce. This is perplexing considering the   sheer size of the investment industry in Australia (around $A717 billion as   at 30 June 2001) and the importance placed on the sector with respect to   successive Federal Governments' retirement income policies. The objectives   of this dissertation therefore involve an analysis of managed fund   performance with respect to differences in investment strategies (i.e. active   and index), as well as providing an analysis of funds invested in equities,   bonds and diversified asset classes (or multi-sector portfolios).   The first essay evaluates the market timing and security selection   capabilities of Australian pooled superannuation funds. These funds provide   institutional investors with exposure to securities across many different   asset classes, including domestic and international equities, domestic and   international fixed interest, property and cash. Surprisingly, the specific   analysis of multi-sector funds is scarce in the literature and limited to   Brinson et al. (1986, 1991), Sinclair (1990), and Blake et al. (1999). This   essay also evaluates performance for the three largest asset classes within   diversified superannuation funds and their contribution to overall portfolio   return. The importance of an accurately specified market portfolio proxy in   the measurement of investment performance is demonstrated, where the essay   employs performance benchmarks that account for the multi-sector investment   decisions of active investment managers in a manner that is consistent with   their unique investment strategy. This approach rectifies Sinclair's (1990)   analysis resulting from benchmark misspecification. Consistent with the   literature, the empirical results indicate that Australian pooled   superannuation funds do not exhibit significantly positive security selection   or market timing skill.   Given the evidence in the literature surrounding the inability of active   funds to deliver superior returns to investors, lower cost index funds have   become increasingly popular as an alternative investment strategy. Despite   the significant growth in index funds since 1976, when the first index mutual   fund was launched in the U.S., research on their performance is sparse in the   U.S. and non-existent in Australia. The second essay provides an original   analysis of the Australian index fund market, with specific analysis   applicable to institutional Australian equity index funds offered by fund   managers. While indexing is theoretically straightforward, in practice there   exist potential difficulties in exactly matching the return of the underlying   index. Therefore the magnitude of tracking error is likely to be of concern   to investors. This essay documents the existence of significant tracking   error for Australian index funds, where the magnitude of the difference   between index fund returns and index returns averages between 7.4 and 22.3   basis points per month for funds operating at least five years. However,   there is little evidence of bias in tracking error, implying that these funds   neither systematically outperform or underperform their benchmark on a before   cost basis. Further analysis documents that the magnitude of tracking error   is related to fund cash flows, market volatility, transaction costs and index   replication strategies used by passive investment managers.   The third essay presents evidence of the performance of U.S. mutual funds,   where attention is given to both active and index mutual funds for which the   applicable benchmark index is the S&amp;P 500. This essay examines both the   magnitude and variation of tracking error over time for S&amp;P 500 index mutual   funds. The essay documents seasonality in S&amp;P 500 index mutual fund tracking   error, where tracking error is significantly higher in the months of January   and May, together with a seasonal trough in the quarters ending   March-June-September-December. Statistical evidence indicates tracking error   is both positively and significantly correlated with the dividend payments   arising from constituent S&amp;P 500 securities. In terms of a performance   comparison between actively managed and index funds, active funds on average   are found to significantly underperform passive benchmarks. On the other   hand, S&amp;P 500 index mutual funds earned higher risk-adjusted excess returns   after expenses than large capitalisation-oriented active mutual funds in the   period examined. These results suggest the S&amp;P 500 is consistent with   capital market efficiency, implying an absence of economic benefit accruing   to the average investor utilising actively managed U.S. equity mutual funds.   The fourth essay presented in the dissertation examines the performance of   Australian investment management organisations with direct reference to their   specific characteristics and strategies employed. Using a unique information   source, performance is evaluated for actively managed institutional balanced   funds (or diversified asset class funds), Australian share funds and   Australian bond funds. Performance is evaluated with respect to the   investment strategy adopted, the experience and qualifications held by   investment professionals, and the tenure of the key investment   professionals. This essay also evaluates the performance of senior sector   heads to determine the skills of individuals driving the investment process,   even though these individuals may migrate to competitor organisations. The   essay finds evidence that a significant number of active Australian equity   managers earned superior risk-adjusted returns in the period, however active   managers perform in line with market indices for balanced funds and   Australian bond funds.   A number of manager characteristics are also found to predict risk-adjusted   excess returns, systematic risk and investment expenses. Of particular note,   performance of balanced funds is negatively related to the institution's age   and the loyalty of non-senior investment staff. Performance is also found to   be significantly higher for managers that predominantly operate their   portfolios using a bottom-up, stock selection approach. Interestingly, the   human capital of managers, measured as the years of tertiary education   undertaken, does not explain risk-adjusted excess returns. Systematic risk   is positively related to an institutions age and negatively related to both   senior manager loyalty and the implementation of bottom-up portfolio   management strategies. In terms of management expenses, fees are directly   related to the Australian equities benchmark allocation, the years of   tertiary education, the number of years service (loyalty) for non-senior   investment professionals and the total years experience of senior money   managers. This concluding essay also documents that changes in top   management have significant performance effects. In the 12-month period   after a change in fixed income director or chief investment officer,   performance is significantly lower and significantly higher, respectively.   There is no significant difference in performance where changes in top   management occur for Australian equities. The years of service (loyalty)   provided to asset management firms by equities directors is inversely related   to risk-adjusted return.   The fifth and final essay examines the investment performance of active   Australian bond funds and the impact of investor fund flows on portfolio   returns. This essay represents a significant and original analysis in terms   of its contribution to the literature, given the absence of Australian bond   fund performance analytics and also the limited attention provided in the   U.S. Both security selection and market timing performance is evaluated   using both unconditional models and conditional performance evaluation   techniques, which account for public information and the time-variation in   risk. Overall, the results of this essay are consistent with the U.S. and   international mutual fund evidence, where performance is found to be   consistent with an efficient market. While actively managed institutional   funds perform broadly in line with the index before expenses, the paper   documents significant underperformance for actively managed retail bond funds   after fees. The study also documents that retail fund flows negatively   impact on market timing coefficients when flow is not accounted for in   unconditional models.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investment Manager Characteristics;Strategy and Fund Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imposing peace and prosperity: Australia, social justice and labour reform in occupied Japan, 1945-1949</field><field name="creator">De Matos, Christine</field><field name="description">Historiography tends to seek patterns of inevitability, attempting to explain a decided course rather than incorporating other evident, though unfulfilled possibilities. In the case of historiography on the Allied Occupation of Japan, this is particularly obvious. Occupation scholarship appears absorbed by the overarching US presence in Japan during this period, reflects the dominant paradigm of the Cold War and when it does venture past the US remains focused on the US-Japan dichotomy. Australia also participated in the Occupation, also held a vision for a Pacific future and developed a relationship with Japan. Often the Australian perspective did not coincide with that of the US especially on the terrain of ideological and historical experiences and interpretations. The potential for conflict between the two nations&#8217; approaches to post-surrender Japan is particularly evident in labour reform policy and issues of social and economic justice &#8211; the focus of this thesis. Australian policies towards labour reform under the Chifley Labor Government are examined in this thesis within the context of the Australian labour movement&#8217;s historical legacy, Orientalism and racial stereotypes, the Cold War, US hegemony, idealism and pragmatism and overall Australian policy towards Occupied Japan as a dual-paradigm structure. This thesis investigates attempts to turn labour reform polices and ideals into practice, via the diplomatic control machinery established for the Occupation namely the Allied Council for Japan and Far Eastern Commission and as articulated by Australian government representatives including Dr H.V. Evatt, William Macmahon Ball, Patrick Shaw and Sir Frederick Eggleston. The thesis contests the predominant simplistic harsh peace label given to Australian policy in the current literature.

The district has the potential of growing 3.8 million tonnes of sugarcane. However, a series of dry seasons saw this reduce to 2.1 million tonnes in 2002. Compounding the effects of both dry seasons and limited water supplies has been a 30% reduction in the sugar price over this period. The irrigation requirement of sugarcane in the Bundaberg area is 8 ML/ha. The original allocated volume for sugarcane production in this area was 4.5 ML/ha (based on 1970 production areas). However, as the area under production has increased and announced allocations in each year has reduced, this allocation is now equivalent to an application volume of about 2 ML/ha A change from the traditional practice of full irrigation is required as water supplies become depleted. As there were no clear guidelines on how growers could respond to diminishing water supplies, this research investigated opportunities to fine tune irrigation practices and the performance of irrigation systems (ie. low cost solutions) that would assist growers to maximise sugarcane yield. A grower survey was initially conducted to identify current practice and opportunities for change. Field investigations focused on the performance of water winch and furrow irrigation systems, which make up 91% of the irrigated area in the district. As most of these application systems have insufficient capacity to meet crop demands opportunities to schedule irrigations were limited to start up after rain. Improvements in irrigation system performance were found to provide the greatest potential to increase sugarcane yield under conditions of limited water. Investigations identified that irrigation performance could be significantly improved through relatively minor adjustment. Field trials found that wind speed and direction significantly influenced the performance of travelling gun irrigators. Although growers were generally aware of the effects of wind, meteorological data suggested that the opportunity to operate water winches in low wind conditions is limited. Changing to a taper nozzle under moderate to high wind conditions will reduce the effect of wind on performance. This practice was found to improve the uniformity (measured by Christiansen&#8217;s Uniformity Coefficient, CU) by 16%. The grower survey indicated that there was no preference towards the use of taper nozzles in windy conditions. Additional trial work developed a relationship between the variation in water applied to the field through non uniformity and sugarcane yield. An 8% reduction in yield was determined for a 10% reduction in CU. This indicated that changing to a taper nozzle could potentially increase sugarcane yield by 15% in high wind conditions. Other settings, which also influenced uniformity, included lane spacing and gun arc angle Simple changes to the operation of furrow irrigation systems were also found to dramatically improve irrigation performance. Field measurements in combination with simulation modelling of irrigation events using SIRMOD II identified that current irrigation performance ranged in application efficiency from 45 to 99% (mean of 79%) and a distribution uniformity from 71 to 93% (mean of 82%). Both application efficiency and distribution uniformity were increased to greater than 90% and 84% respectively, except on a cracking clay soil. Improvements in application efficiency and distribution uniformity were achieved by adjusting furrow flow rate (cup size), turning the irrigation off at the right time (ie. just as it reached the end of the field) and banking the end of the field. Growers had a good understanding of the correct cut off time and were attentive to reducing run off through either banking ends or tail water return. However, growers had a poor understanding of the significance of furrow flow rate. Other opportunities to improve irrigation performance on high infiltration soils included alternate furrow irrigation and shallow cultivation practices which maintained compaction in the interspace and reduced infiltration. Soil moisture and crop growth measurements indicated that sugarcane yield could be maximised by starting the irrigation rotation earlier after rainfall (ie. at a deficit equal to the irrigation amount). These observations were modelled using the crop simulation model APSIM sugar to assess the strategy over a longer time interval and the influence of seasonal variation. Simulation modelling showed that final sugarcane yields were not sensitive to irrigation start-up strategies. Yields for the start-up strategies modelled varied by less than 5 tc/ha. This minor difference occurred as the crop yield was driven by the total amount of water available to the plant. The limited amount of irrigation water available to the plant (2 to 3 ML/ha) had only a minor effect on the water balance and no significant change to effective rainfall between strategies. The greatest difference in yield occurred between irrigation treatments when water was left over at the end of the season (9.2 tc/ha). Starting irrigation earlier after rainfall events (on a 14 day rotation) provided the greatest opportunity to use all of the available irrigation supply. By comparison, delaying the application of the first irrigation after rainfall resulted in some of the irrigation water not being applied in 30% of years.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sugarcane</field><field name="subject">yield</field><field name="subject">crop irrigation</field><field name="subject">winch and furrow irrigation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001406/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of emotions in artificial intelligences: an affective agent architecture for intuitive reasoning in artificial intelligences</field><field name="creator">Baillie, Penny</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This dissertation addresses several highly-critical issues in affective computing and agent architecture design including knowledge representation, motivation, emotion appraisal and affective decision making. The approach presented integrates motivational drives, goals and associated behaviours via a multi-dimensional Affective Space. The research focuses on an emotionally motivated artificial intelligence (EMAI) architecture. This architecture dispenses with the ideas implemented in contemporary affective agent architectures where individual emotional states are modelled as individual variables, integrated and processed using complex algorithms. Contemporary approaches required significant programming effort to modify them for domains outside their realm, integration of new emotional states and high-level complex affective decision making. Unlike contemporary affective agent architectures, the EMAI architecture reasons using a multi-dimensional decision making process where emotional states are modelled as coexisting locations in a six-dimensional affective continuum called the Affective Space. Through use of the Affective Space, an EMAI agent can predict the effect that certain behaviours will have on its emotional state and in turn decide how to behave. Furthermore, the agent can use the emotions produced from its behaviour to update its beliefs about particular events and entities. The nature of the Affective Space also allows an EMAI agent to deal with processes related to emotion synthesis in a more effective manner than contemporary architectures. These processes include the natural diminishing of an emotional state's strength over time, the way in which emotions can influence an agent's perspective of a situation and the way in which an agent can migrate from one emotional state to another. This dissertation contributes crucial and unique concepts and formalisations of emotion based intelligence for agent construction to the domain of Artificial Intelligence (in particular Affective Computing). It introduces a unique process for emotionally motivated decision making based on holistic and atomic appraisals made with respect to events. The thesis contained within has been supported through experimentation that has confirmed the effectiveness of the emotion synthesis technique in the EMAI architecture and how this is used to produce intelligent agents capable of emotional reasoning and decision making.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emotionally motivated artificial intelligence (EMAI)</field><field name="subject">emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">event space</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001408/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The NOW Map: consistent, dynamic and contemporary geospatial information</field><field name="creator">Baker, Anthony John</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Mapping agencies, national and regional, are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the currency of their suite of map related products and services. These products include topographic maps and the provision of up to date topographic data. The maintenance of this socially important spatial information is at issue through the duplication of effort that presently exists within government agencies at all levels. A dedicated data sharing and topographic maintenance program has the potential to solve all of these issues. The "NOW Map" gives the "map hungry" public the ability to obtain spatially located data and products in time frames and formats of their choosing. This system is capable of delivering consistent, dynamic and contemporary geospatial information. It will be flexible, in response to a modern ever-changing society, and capable of providing up to date topographic maps and data that not only meets current standards, but also continually exceeds them. After the development of initial procedures, a pilot study was conducted to expand and further refine data collection and analysis procedures. This was followed by a final data-gathering research phase. The research used relevant local, interstate and international examples in all areas of the study. The outcomes of the pilot study and analysis of the second research segment demonstrated that maps can be maintained more efficiently through the utilisation of accurate up to date information.

Safe waste disposal sites are rarely available and the relocation and/or treatment of animal waste is seldom economically viable. The reuse of animal waste for energy recovery and re-feeding is also not popular. Animal waste is a valuable source of plant nutrients and a very good soil conditioner, and has been commonly applied as fertiliser to agricultural fields. However, due to the increasing oversupply of animal waste in recent years, it has often been applied in excess to the agricultural fields. Excessive application of animal waste, without due consideration of its implications, is a serious concern. The run-off and leaching losses of nutrients from the fields fertilised with animal waste have contributed significantly to the eutrophication and toxic blue-green algae blooms in surface water systems and nitrification of ground water systems. It has also led to nutrient imbalances in the soils and odour pollution to the surrounding communities. The animal waste, which is a valuable source of plant nutrients, has thus become both an economic and environmental burden, and there is a need to develop a strategy for its sensible use as a fertiliser in agricultural fields. Sensible use of animal waste involves the consideration of all the agricultural, environmental, social, and economical limitations. A rational method of achieving this is to restrict the use of animal waste to sites suitable for such uses, identify areas where it can be relocated and applied economically, limit the application rates to a safe level, and observe appropriate manure management practices. This study addressed each of these components by developing a comprehensive manure application plan (MAP) for the site-specific use of animal waste as fertiliser in agricultural fields. Various geographic information systems (GIS) based techniques, including a weighted linear combination model and map algebra based cartographic modelling, were employed to achieve the goal. The appropriateness of the existing techniques and procedures were evaluated and modified to meet the current input requirements. New methods of analysis were devised as necessary. The Westbrook sub-catchment of the Condamine River catchment in south-east Queensland was selected as the study area. The sub-catchment covers 24,903 hectares and contains 39 intensive animal industries. The catchment is also a part of the Murray-Darling Basin, which has been suffering from toxic blue green algae blooms recurrently since 1991. This study identified that only about one-fifth of the sub-catchment area is suitable for animal waste application. Depending on the method of site suitability analysis and the number of input factors used the suitable area ranged between 16 and 22 percent. This comparatively small area is mainly due to the presence of a large proportion of non-agricultural areas in the sub-catchment. The suitable areas were also found to have various degrees of suitability for waste application. However, the degree of site suitability was affected by the number of input factors used in the analysis, the weighting of the factors, and the method of factor attribute standardisation. Conventional methods of weighting input factors were found to be cumbersome and not particularly suitable. Hence, this study developed a new &#8216;objective oriented comparison&#8217; method of factor weighting. Standardisation of input factors using a continuous, rather than discrete, classification (ie fuzzy set) method was found to be more consistent in degree of suitability determination. The discrete classification of factor attributes into classes of different numbers and sizes, and the weighting of classes to a sum of one, were identified as a limitation in using this standardisation method. A new &#8216;weight adjustment&#8217; method was devised and demonstrated to reduce factor-weighting biases. The suitable sites, degree of site suitability, and other relevant spatial and non-spatial information were processed within a GIS framework to develop a comprehensive manure application plan. The inherently high presence of available phosphorus in the soils of the study area was recognised and the P2O5 content in the manure was used as the basis for determining manure application rates. A complimentary nitrogen supply map was also generated. Manure management practices applicable to the areas with a lower degree of suitability were also suggested.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geographic information system (GIS)</field><field name="subject">animal waste</field><field name="subject">manure management</field><field name="subject">raster-based</field><field name="subject">object oriented comparison (OOC)</field><field name="subject">weighted linear combination</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001410/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Welding of skin using Nd:YAG laser with bipolar contact applicators</field><field name="creator">Brodie, Lyn</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This thesis investigates the feasibility of closing wounds in skin tissue by laser welding as a substitute for suturing. Such a process would provide advantages in some surgical procedures. The investigation revised available theory on the action of lasers on skin tissue as a basis for the experimental program. The results of experiments using rat skin are then reported. In addition a thorough investigation of the normal (uninjured) tensile strength of rat skin was undertaken to provide a base line comparison. Laser systems permit very high-energy radiation of a single wavelength to be focused on a tiny spot, and have found application in many areas of engineering. They are also currently used in many branches of medicine including ophthalmology, gynaecology, dermatology, otolaryngology, and gastroenterology. These medical applications employ argon, YAG, and carbon dioxide type lasers. In many cases, lasers have been found to be more effective than conventional treatment methods with advantages including reduced blood loss, more accurate removal of unwanted tissue, shorter operating times and less postoperative pain and care (Gibson and Kernohan, 1993). Tissue welding using laser energy represents a small but growing area of medical research and is largely focused on anastomosis. This thesis investigates, using a specific experimental program, the feasibility of the bipolar contact Nd:YAG laser to weld cutaneous tissue. No similar published research has been identified in this area. The available literature focuses on non-contact lasers of various types and settings and mainly in the area of anastomosis. The experimental methodology and the specific technique for the bipolar contact laser is developed, tested and evaluated as part of this project. The welding techniques developed in this project overcome the previous difficulties of tissue alignment. The use of the bipolar laser probes substantially improves the ability to align the tissue edges to be joined. The probes give tactile feedback to the user and the pressure effect of the probes may assist with the welding process. The developed technique was no faster or easier than suturing. Viable welds and a useable technique for welding skin on rats were developed and tested. The resultant healing was comparable with published literature and both sutured and welded wounds returned to full strength as compared with the baseline data collected. All wounds had returned to full strength within 91 days. At 75 days there was not significant difference between laser welded and sutured wounds and they had achieved approximately 90 percent of full strength. Time to half strength was approximately 42 days and there was a larger standard deviation for both laser welded and sutured wounds. The most significant increase in strength and therefore healing occurred in the first 42 days. Simhon et al, 2001 states that a tensile strength of 0.6 N plus/minus 0.4 N was sufficient to hold tissue together. By day 7 the strength of the wound (laser welded) was more than twice the strength needed to maintain closure. There may have been sufficient healing for this to occur earlier but there were insufficient animals to allow for testing of this theory. In conclusion this experimental program and investigation has reviewed the available literature on the current use of lasers in medicine and their specific laser-tissue interaction which leads to tissue welding. It has provided a large database of tensile strength measurements collected with a reproducible methodology and reported in a standardised format. The developed technique for laser tissue welding using a bipolar contact Nd:YAG laser has been established and verified. It produces viable welds comparable in strength and healing rates to sutures.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bipolar</field><field name="subject">Nd:YAG laser</field><field name="subject">skin</field><field name="subject">welding</field><field name="subject">medicine</field><field name="subject">neodymium</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001412/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An outcomes-based framework for assessing the quality of transnational engineering education at a private college</field><field name="creator">Chong, Beng Keok</field><field name="description">The concept of "transnational" education has emerged over the past decade or more as a critical strategy for meeting the growing demand for higher education worldwide. Essentially, transnational higher education allows international providers with outstanding credentials to conduct degree programs at local sites in conjunction with local tertiary institutions. Due to the rapid expansion of transnational programmes and the proliferation of transnational education providers, both governments and parents have, however, raised questions about the quality of education provided through transnational mechanisms. Rapid technological development, coupled with the recent growth of new engineering specialty areas, has led to the development of outcomes-based criteria for engineering education by a range of international engineering professional bodies. The emergence of outcomes-based approaches requires new instruments to measure the success, or otherwise, of engineering programs offered by universities. This study was conducted at a Malaysian private college (pseudonym "Trans College" with the prime purpose of developing an authoritative measurement instrument for evaluating the quality of transnational engineering education. This study generated a theory-based 11-dimension Preliminary Conceptual Framework consisting of four Outcomes dimensions and seven Contributory dimensions for Transnational Engineering Education, and tested the integrity of the theoretical framework through surveys of enrolled students, staff, and representatives of employing agencies. The Preliminary Conceptual Framework was found to have a high degree of conceptual validity, as well as some limitations. The findings of the surveys enabled a Revised Conceptual Framework for Transnational Engineering Education to be developed through reliability test and validated by using confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses. The revised framework comprises five Outcomes and eight Contributory dimensions. It has been transposed into a 13-dimension revised survey instrument consisting of 25 Outcomes items clustered into five Outcomes dimensions, and 49 Contributory items clustered into eight Contributory dimensions. The developed survey instrument was then used to study the perceptions of students, staff, and employers regarding the quality of the transnational engineering education. Through performing t-tests, ANOVA, and other statistical analyses, the results of the study indicate that the quality of the transnational engineering education at Trans College was perceived by students, staff, and employers to be generally sound. It was also revealed that the Contributory construct can be adopted for measuring the satisfaction levels of students. Students, staff, and employers were also satisfied for the most part with their respective experiences of the programs in question. The study is believed to have considerable significance. First, it has generated a conceptual framework for measuring the quality of the transnational engineering education. The validated conceptual framework is transposed into a validated instrument that can be adapted for use by a range of other transnational educational providers. Second, it affirms the value of the "transnational" concept while also providing a number of recommendations for the enhancement of such programmes, particularly at Trans College. Third, the conceptual framework for the delivery of successful transnational engineering education derived from this study may help to improve the quality of transnational engineering programmes conducted in Malaysia, and make Malaysia "the centre of educational excellence" in the ASEAN region, with the transnational providers becoming hubs of tertiary education, and their networks spanning the globe.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">engineering</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">college</field><field name="subject">linear regression</field><field name="subject">ANOVA</field><field name="subject">transnational education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001415/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Principals' processes of professional learning</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description">When a school community decides to implement innovative curricula, the responsibility for leadership of the associated professional learning processes lies with the principal. The onus is on principals to be leader learners. They adapt their leadership style to the context of the school. They encourage learning as a future-oriented, organisation-wide process. They encourage deep learning, and double-loop learning, and they nurture a culture of collaborative learning. They provide practical support for teacher leadership and teacher learning, and they understand that teachers have differing needs for support during a period of significant curriculum change. The research methodology used for this study involved a multiple case study design. Principals and staff from three Queensland state schools who participated in the trial of innovative curricula provided the data for the three case studies. The data collection at three schools related to the processes of professional learning at each site. Interviews conducted with the participants at each school, and observation of meetings and school documentation, provided the researcher with the data to develop a framework for principals who are interested in creating a professional learning community. Data collected from the schools generally supported the findings of the theorists. However, analysis of the data provided more detailed information than is currently available in the literature to inform the establishment of professional learning processes. Analysis of the data indicated that professional learning can be classified according to four themes: personal learning, leadership-related learning, learning related to innovation, and learning related to processes that support a collaborative culture. The findings from the literature review and the findings from the case studies were used to construct a framework for professional learning for principals who wish to create a learning organisation. The framework provides a foundation for professional learning programs for principals, and could be used by a range of people or groups, including district office personnel, professional associations, and networks of principals and aspiring leaders.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">principal</field><field name="subject">professional learning</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">research methods</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001416/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the feasibility and application of fibre composites to flatbed semi-trailers</field><field name="creator">Coker, Rick</field><field name="description">The highly competitive nature of the transportation industry has produced significant demand for increased equipment efficiency. This has been manifested in attempts to increase carrying capacity whilst lowering running costs. While these factors remain at the forefront of trailer design, the dependence on steel as the primary material has limited the extent to which these goals are realised. The advantages associated with the use of fibre composite materials in automotive applications have been well documented, demonstrating that the substitution of steel with fibre composite materials greatly increases the scope for tare mass reduction. However, to fully utilise the advantages produced through the use of fibre composites, it is necessary to formulate a design philosophy that incorporates the selection of materials and the definition of acceptable performance of both the material and the trailer. This dissertation addresses this broad subject. Within this greater context, this study addresses the incorporation of fibre composite materials into semi-trailers, with the significant issues being divided into two areas: - The development of a design philosophy, intended specifically to address the application of fibre composites to semi-trailers. - The design, analysis and experimental validation of a new type of fibre composite trailer chassis, utilising the aforementioned design philosophy. This PhD project is a foundational study on the suitability of fibre composite materials in the heavy transportation industry, primarily focusing on a practical assessment of the potential for tare mass reduction. The work presented in this dissertation is seen to provide a basis for fibre composite trailer design, in addition to a foundation upon which further investigation into this field can be made. The major outcomes of this project include, amongst others: - The definition of significant load cases and trailer classifications &#183; The development of a design philosophy suited specifically to FRP semi-trailers - The establishment of selection criteria which identifies appropriate FRP materials for use in this application - The development of a new type of FRP chassis for a flatbed semi-trailer - Validation of the design philosophy through experimental testing - Affirmation of the potential of FRPs in application to flatbed semi-trailers</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semi-trailer</field><field name="subject">fibre composite</field><field name="subject">FRP chassis</field><field name="subject">transport</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001417/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utopia unrealised: an evaluation of a consultancy to develop a national framework for police education and training to enhance frontline response to illicit drug problems in Australia</field><field name="creator">Conway, Jane Frances</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents an evaluation of a funded consultancy that was intended to bring about change in the education and training of police in Australia in response to illicit drugs. Sponsored by what was at the time known as the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care, the ultimate goal of the consultancy was a national framework for police education and training to enhance frontline police response to illicit drug problems. The research used a case study design. Guba and Stufflebeam&#8217;s (1970) Context, Input, Process, and Product (CIPP) model was used to organise the presentation of a rich description of the design, development and implementation of the consultancy. Application of this framework enabled illumination of a number of issues related to social policy, change and innovation, and quality improvement processes. The study explores the role of education and training in organisational change and concludes that the potential of external consultancy activity to effect meaningful change in police education, training and practice is limited by a number of factors. Key findings of the study are that while a number of consultancy processes could have been enhanced, the primary determinants of the extent to which a change in police education and training will enhance frontline practice are contextual and conceptual factors. The study reveals that the response of frontline police to illicit drug use is influenced by multivariate factors. The findings of this study suggest that while frontline police are keen to provide solutions to a range of practice issues in response to illicit drug problems, they desire concrete strategies that are well defined and supported by management, consistent with policy and within the law. However, the complexity of police activity in response to illicit drugs; the dissonance between the conceptual frameworks of police and health agencies; and, resistance to what is perceived as externally initiated change in police practice, education and training; were found to be powerful inhibitors of an utopian attempt to enhance frontline police response to illicit drug problems. Using the metaphor of board games, the study concludes that the development of an education and training framework will be of little value in achieving enhanced frontline practice in response to illicit drug problems unless the criteria for enhanced response are made more explicit and seen to be congruent with both the conceptualisation and operationalisation of police roles and functions. Moreover, the study questions the mechanisms through which changes in policy are conceived, implemented and evaluated and highlights a need for greater congruence between evaluation frameworks and the nature of change.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">utopia</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="subject">drug problems</field><field name="subject">context input process product (CIPP)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001418/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the utility of a clustering method for analysing psychological test data</field><field name="creator">Dawes, Sharron Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The belief that certain disorders will produce specific patterns of cognitive strengths and weaknesses on psychological testing is pervasive and entrenched in the area of clinical neuropsychology, both with respect to expectations regarding the behaviour of individuals and clinical groups. However, there is little support in the literature for such a belief. To the contrary, studies examining patterns of cognitive performance in different clinical samples without exception find more than one pattern of test scores. Lange (2000) in his comprehensive analysis of WAIS-R/WMS-R data for a large sample of mixed clinical cases found that three to five profiles described variations in test performances within clinical diagnoses. Lange went on to show that these profiles occurred with approximately equal frequency in all diagnostic groups. He additionally found four profiles in an exploratory analysis of WAIS-III/WMS-III data from a similar sample. The goals of the current dissertation were to: a) replicate Lange&#8217;s findings in a larger clinical sample; b) extend the scope of these findings to a wider array of psychological tests; and c) develop a method to classify individual cases in terms of their psychological test profile. The first study assessed 849 cases with a variety of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses using hierarchical cluster and K-Means analysis. Four WAIS-III/WMS-III profiles were identified that included approximately equal numbers of cases from the sample. Two of these profiles were uniquely related to two of Lange&#8217;s profiles, while the remaining two demonstrated relationships with more than one of Lange&#8217;s clusters. The second study expanded the neuropsychological test battery employed in the analysis to include the Trail Making Test, Boston Naming Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, and Word Lists from the WMS-III reducing the number of clinical cases to 420. In order to compensate for the impact of the reduced number of cases and increased number of variables on potential cluster stability, the number of test score variables was reduced using factor analysis. In this manner the 22 variables were reduced to six factor scores, which were then analysed with hierarchical cluster and K-Means analysis yielding five cognitive profiles. The third study examined the potential clinical utility of the five cognitive profiles by developing a single case methodology for allocating individual cases to cognitive profiles. This was achieved using a combination of a multivariate outlier statistic, the Mahalanobis Distance, and equations derived from a discriminant function analysis. This combination resulted in classification accuracies exceeding 88% when predicting the profile membership based upon the K-Means analysis. The potential utility of this method was illustrated with three age-, education-, gender-, and diagnostically-matched cases that demonstrated different cognitive test profiles. The implications of the small number of cognitive profiles that characterise test performance in a diverse sample of neurological and psychiatric cases as well as the clinical utility of an accurate classification method at the individual case level was discussed. The role of such a classification system in the design of individualised rehabilitation programmes was also highlighted. This research raises the intriguing possibility of developing a typology based on human behaviour rather than a medical nosology. In effect, replacing the medical diagnosis so ill-suited to encompassing the complexities of human behaviour, with a more appropriate &#8220;psychological diagnosis&#8221; based on cognitive test performance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychological test data</field><field name="subject">statistical analysis</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001419/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Content-based image retrieval based on emergence index</field><field name="creator">Deb, Sagarmay</field><field name="description">Emergence is a phenomenon where we study the implicit or hidden meaning of an image. We introduce this concept in image database access and retrieval of images using his as an index for retrieval. This would give an entirely different search outcome than ordinary search where emergence is not considered, as consideration of hidden meanings could change the index of search. A feature of an image, which is not explicit would be emergent feature if it can be made explicit. There are three types of emergence: computational emergence, thermodynamic emergence and emergence relative to a model. In computational emergence, it is assumed computational interactions can generate different features or behaviors. This is one of the approaches in the field of artificial life. Thermodynamic emergence is of the view that new stable features or behaviors can arise from equilibrium through the use of thermodynamic theory. In emergence relative to a model, deviation of the behavior from the original model gives rise to emergence. We would use this latter view in our work. Two classes of shape emergence have been identified: embedded shape emergence and illusory shape emergence. In embedded shape emergence all the emergent shapes can be identified by set theory procedures on the original shape under consideration. For example, in a set S= {a,b,c,d,e}, we can find subsets like S1={a,b,c}, S2={c,d,e}, S3={a,c,e} and so on. But in illusory shape emergence, where contours defining a shape are perceived even though no contours are physically present, this kind of set theory procedures are not enough and more effective procedures have to be applied to find these hidden shapes. These procedures could be based on geometrical, topological or dimensional studies of the original shape. Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) techniques, so far developed, concentrated on only explicit meanings of an image. But more meanings could be extracted when we consider the implicit meanings of the same image. To find out the implicit meanings, we first destroy the shape of the original image which gives rise to unstructured image. Then we process the unstructured image to bring out the new emergent image. We discuss emergence, calculation of emergence index and accessing multimedia databases using emergence index in this dissertation. To calculate emergence index in the access of multimedia databases, we take an input image and study the emergence phenomenon of it. Also we study the emergence phenomenon of the images of the database. Both input image and images of database would give rise to more meanings because of emergence as we explained earlier. Based on the new meanings, wherever there would be a match between input image and images of database, we would pick that record up for selection. We defined emergence index as EI = f(D,F,V,C,E) where D stands for domain of the database, F for features of the image, V for various variables that define the image, C for constraints which represent the image and E for emergence phenomenon. We calculate these five variables to get emergence index for each image of the database. Also we calculate these five variables for input image as well. We talk about global aspects of features. It means features of the entire image. Examples are area, perimeter or rectangles, triangles. In some searches, to consider the global features could be advantageous in that a symmetry with the input image could be obtained on the basis of global features only. But as is clearly the case, to consider global features could overlook the individual objects that constitute the image as a whole. In the kind of searches we propose, we take into account the global features of the image of the database while considering in detail local features. Various objects that lie within an image constitute local features. In our example, there are three objects in the image, namely, a lake and two houses. Studying the features of these three objects would add to studying the features of the image globally. We took the example of a geographic location in the thesis and then showed how destruction of original image is done and further processing of the unstructured image gives new emergent image. Partial implementation of this concept is also presented at the end. In implementation, we consider the retrieval of image globally. We do not consider break-up of image into multiple objects which is left for future research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emergence index</field><field name="subject">image</field><field name="subject">symmestry</field><field name="subject">parallelogram</field><field name="subject">shape</field><field name="subject">rectangle</field><field name="subject">triangle</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001420/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A strategic analysis of the performance of the telephone banking channel</field><field name="creator">Devenish-Meares, Peter</field><field name="description">The telephone-banking channel, delivered through call centres, has become an integral part of the distribution mix of retail financial institutions. To get the greatest competitive advantage from this channel, the strategic orientation, structural and behavioural aspects of the call centre must be aligned with its operational-service and sales-performance objectives. Unfortunately, while considerable managerial effort is expended developing call centres, often their performance results remain uncertain or uncommunicated. There are indications also that financial institutions should not underestimate active market orientation benefits; innovative, strategic-thinking and progressive structures; flexible, empathic leadership, and, valuing supportive human resource strategies. Our survey of Australian deposit-taking institutions investigates the extent to which strategic and behavioural aspects are aligned with its operational-service and sales-performance objectives. Specifically, managerial approaches to IT development, competitive positioning, leadership delegation, market research attitudes and product orientation were considered. Approaches to trust, conflict, morale and reward, and, key performance indicator (KPI) choices were sought also. Results show sales performance is positively related to more externally focussed strategic orientations. Reinforcing the importance of innovative human resource practices, performance is also related positively to psychosocial climate in general and employee reward and morale, in particular. This extension of management theory urges financial service leaders to actively contemplate one of its most important resources, people. Further, the survey itself indicated that while the majority of institutions continue to use operationally based key performance indicators, such as minimum call duration, the ability of the call centre to generate sales revenue is also being recognised. In summary, given the size and potential of the telephone-banking channel, this research encourages further, urgent exploration of strategic relationships among the channel, its market, performance measures and comprehensive people-centred HR strategies aimed at developing high employee trust, and satisfaction.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strategic analysis</field><field name="subject">telephone banking</field><field name="subject">human resources (HR)</field><field name="subject">key performance indicator (KPI)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001421/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the role of an online community in the community in the professional learning of teacher librarians</field><field name="creator">Dillon, Kenneth Walter</field><field name="description">The thesis has its origins in a concern that teacher librarians in schools throughout Australia were disadvantaged in the development of their professional learning due to their professional and often geographical isolation in schools. A listserv (online discussion network) called OZTL_NET was developed to facilitate the enhancement of teacher professional learning for this group of teachers. OZTL_NET has been available to teacher librarians and others interested in teacher librarianship for over nine years. The study sought to determine whether usage of OZTL_NET was associated with the enhancement of teacher librarians&#8217; professional learning. The study also explored the characteristics of teacher professional learning from the literature and sought to determine which characteristics of online communities may contribute to teacher professional learning. A case study design for the research was adopted using a mixed methods approach. The methods of data collection were a web survey and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analysed and a detailed description of the object of study, OZTL_NET, was provided. A major finding of this study was that usage of OZTL_NET was significantly related to the enhancement of teacher professional learning. It was concluded that online learning communities may provide appropriate contexts for teacher professional learning and that, in relation to the case of OZTL_NET, various aspects of the concept of online learning communities and, to a lesser extent, communities of practice, are portrayed in the listserv. The findings supported the assertion that online learning communities have the potential to enhance the professional learning of teachers and provide opportunities for teachers to learn online. The study also revealed that community building online is a complex and demanding activity. Usability and sociability factors must be carefully considered and developed over the lifetime of the community. This process should include input from the community, the leadership of which should be broad-based and inclusive. Two broad principles emerged from the research that provide guidance for the management of listservs for teacher professional learning online. First, the study revealed that involvement and collaboration were critical ingredients in teacher professional learning online. Involvement was portrayed not only in the learning that ensued from the interactivity that necessarily underpins the sharing of tacit knowledge through information exchange and professional discussion between and among subscribers online but also by individuals through less obvious means such as lurking, archive searches and off-list communications. In terms of collaboration, this study found that in addition to high levels of trust, subscribers experienced a strong sense of collegiality and support as members of OZTL_NET. Second, the major finding above confirms that involvement and collaboration are strongly related to individual and collective orientations of teacher professional learning. The broad concept of individual or collective orientation recognises that teacher professional learning occurs in both orientations online as it does offline. Teachers have long recognised their colleagues as their major source of professional information. The difficulty in the past has been in the identification of a means by which teachers can readily access a wider pool of colleagues with whom they can discuss important issues, seek advice and so on. This is particularly important for teachers who are professionally isolated as a consequence of their teaching speciality (such as teacher librarians) and those who are geographically isolated making real time meetings with colleagues expensive and/or impracticable. In this context listservs such as OZTL_NET can play a critical role in providing the infrastructure to support distributed models of teacher professional learning online.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher librarian</field><field name="subject">online community</field><field name="subject">OZTL_NET</field><field name="subject">listserv</field><field name="subject">online discussion network</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001422/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of the real-time multivariate Madden-Julian Oscillation Index to intraseasonal rainfall forecasting in the mid-latitudes</field><field name="creator">Donald, Alexis</field><field name="description">The Madden-Julian Oscillation is a tropical atmospheric phenomenon detected as anomalies in zonal winds, convection and cloudiness. This perturbation has a definitive timescale of about thirty to sixty days, allowing its signal to be extracted from background data. The Madden-Julian Oscillation originates over the western Indian Ocean and generates a convective region which moves east along the equatorial region. This perturbation is thought to contribute to the timing and intensity of the eastern hemisphere monsoons, the El Ni&#241;o/ Southern Oscillation and tropical storms and cyclones. The current understanding of the Madden-Julian Oscillation is that it restricts the bulk of its' influence to the tropics, however some evidence suggested that the impact is more extensive. Analysis of about 30 years of data showed significant modulation of rainfall by the equatorial passage of the MJO. The real-time multivariate Madden-Julian Oscillation Index was used to estimate the location and amplitude of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, and forms the basis of the basic rainfall prediction tool developed. The method developed here clearly linked the low latitude passage of the Madden-Julian Oscillation with suppressed and enhanced rainfall events in the Australasian region and beyond. A rudimentary forecasting capability at the intraseasonal time scale has been developed suitable for assisting Australian agricultural sector. A subsequent and independent analysis of global mean sea level pressure anomalies provided evidence of teleconnections between the Madden-Julian Oscillation and higher latitude atmospheric entities. These anomalies confirm the existence of teleconnections capable of producing the rainfall pattern outputs. The MJO is strongly influenced by the season. However the seasonally dependant analysis of rainfall with respect to the Madden Julian Oscillation conducted was inconclusive, suggesting aspects of the MJO influence still require clarification. Considering the importance of rainfall variability to the Australian agricultural sector the forecasting tool developed, although basic, is significant.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Madden-Julian Oscillation Index</field><field name="subject">rainfall</field><field name="subject">mean sea level pressure (MSLP)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001423/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical possibilities: decritique, deracination, and the D.I.S.</field><field name="creator">Flores, Becky</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents the theory and practice of Decritique, a critical pedagogy for the first-year college English classroom that offers an alternative to contemporary applications of critical theory. Underscored by a philosophy of language drawn from Husserl's pure phenomenology and Derrida's deconstruction, a key characteristic of the pedagogy is delineation between re-cognition and recognition: the former actively seeking ways to re-position one's own thinking in relation to perceptions of the world; the latter endorsing existing perception. Concepts of "respect" and "tolerance" are questioned in Decritique, positing that they can operate as agents of oppression; instead, students engage in critical interaction and animated introspection that, in turn, opens the possibility of change. Concerned with the theory and practice of a reconceptualized critical pedagogy, the question at the core of Decritique is ways for students to reach a point of cognitive struggle leading to genuine discovery without the pain that can accompany criticism and critical self-reflection acting as a barrier to learning. Chapters One through Three examine what constitutes "the critical"; namely, critical thinking, critical pedagogy, critical literacy, and critical care, Chapter Four discusses a reconceptualization of these criticalities, Chapter Five examines the theory of Decritique, Chapter Six presents a three-semester pilot study comparing Decritique with a pedagogy of "caring" in both face-to-face and online learning environments, and Chapter Seven provides the study&#8217;s conclusions. Results indicate that students taught with Decritique consistently produced more writing than those taught with a "caring" approach, demonstrated greater evidence of "critical" reflection on essay revisions, engaged more animatedly in verbal and written discourse, exhibited a strong sense of critical camaraderie, particularly in the face-to-face classroom, and that essays averaged nearly five percent, or half a letter grade, higher. Retention and pass rates were higher in the Decritique classes and students were more likely to be satisfied with their learning experience. Implementation of the pedagogy on a wider, cross-institutional level is recommended in order to investigate the potential of Decritique as an alternative critical pedagogy for the first-year college English classroom, one that promotes reflective critical analysis of discourse with a commitment to the possibilities of praxis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decritique</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">egocentric</field><field name="subject">detached intellectualized space (DIS)</field><field name="subject">deracination</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001424/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Five case studies of Emirati working women in Dubai - their personal experiences and insights</field><field name="creator">Gallant, Monica</field><field name="description">This ethnographic case study explored the insights and experiences of a small selection of working graduates from Dubai Women's College. Based on a literature review and a preliminary study, the following themes were identified and employed as stimuli for discussion: the balance between work and family responsibilities, gender issues in the workplace, issues of power relationships for women, coping with restrictions in an Arabic Islamic environment, reasons for work, and sources of influence and satisfaction. The research utilized feminist post-structural theory to collect the data and then analyze and interpret the comments made by the women. Self-reflexivity and transparency of the positionality of the researcher were critical in this research that relied on an unstructured personal interview approach. The research resulted in a rich description of the thoughts and concerns of five diverse women. Through discourse analysis, the dominant socio-cultural discourses in the areas of gender, marriage, kinship, ethnicity, meritocracy, materialism and religion that women interact with in this cultural environment were identified. The extent to which the women take up, disrupt and challenge these discourses was also explored with a view to suggest ways to 'better' women's lives. Implications of this study include an agenda for increased emancipation of women by greater freedom of choice through self awareness and the development of potential strategies to support empowerment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emirati</field><field name="subject">Dubai</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">cultural environment</field><field name="subject">emancipation</field><field name="subject">poststructuralist theory</field><field name="subject">ethnographic approach</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001425/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of on-pond measurement and back calculation of odour emission rates from anaerobic piggery lagoons</field><field name="creator">Galvin, Geordie</field><field name="description">Odours are emitted from numerous sources and can form a natural part of the environment. The sources of odour range from natural to industrial sources and can be perceived by the community dependant upon a number of factors. These factors include frequency, intensity, duration, offensiveness and location (FIDOL). Or in other words how strong an odour is, at what level it becomes detectable, how long it can be smelt for, whether or not the odour is an acceptable or unacceptable smell as judged by the receptor (residents) and where the odour is smelt. Intensive livestock operations cover a wide range of animal production enterprises, with all of these emitting odours. Essentially, intensive livestock in Queensland, and a certain extent Australia, refers to piggeries, feedlots and intensive dairy and poultry operations. Odour emissions from these operations can be a significant concern when the distance to nearby residents is small enough that odour from the operations is detected. The distance to receptors is a concern for intensive livestock operations as it may hamper their ability to develop new sites or expand existing sites. The piggery industry in Australia relies upon anaerobic treatment to treat its liquid wastes. These earthen lagoons treat liquid wastes through degradation via biological activity (Barth 1985; Casey and McGahan 2000). As these lagoons emit up to 80 per cent of the odour from a piggery (Smith et al., 1999), it is imperative for the piggery industry that odour be better quantified. Numerous methods have been adopted throughout the world for the measurement of odour including, trained field sniffers, electronic noses, olfactometry and electronic methods such as gas chromatography. Although these methods all have can be used, olfactometry is currently deemed to be the most appropriate method for accurate and repeatable determination of odour. This is due to the standardisation of olfactometry through the Australian / New Zealand Standard for Dynamic Olfactometry and that olfactometry uses a standardised panel of "sniffers" which tend to give a repeatable indication of odour concentration. This is important as often, electronic measures cannot relate odour back to the human nose, which is the ultimate assessor of odour. The way in which odour emission rates (OERs) from lagoons are determined is subject to debate. Currently the most commonly used methods are direct and indirect methods. Direct methods refer to placing enclosures on the ponds to measure the emissions whereas indirect methods refer to taking downwind samples on or near a pond and calculating an emission rate. Worldwide the odour community is currently divided into two camps that disagree on how to directly measure odour, those who use the UNSW wind tunnel or similar (Jiang et al., 1995; Byler et al., 2004; Hudson and Casey 2002; Heber et al., 2000; Schmidt and Bicudo 2002; Bliss et al., 1995) or the USEPA flux chamber (Gholson et al., 1989; Heber et al., 2000; Feddes et al., 2001; Witherspoon et al., 2002; Schmidt and Bicudo 2002; Gholson et al., 1991; Kienbusch 1986). The majority of peer reviewed literature shows that static chambers such as the USEPA flux chamber under predict emissions (Gao et al., 1998b; Jiang and Kaye 1996) and based on this, the literature recommends wind tunnel type devices as the most appropriate method of determining emissions (Smith and Watts 1994a; Jiang and Kaye 1996; Gao et al., 1998a). Based on these reviews it was decided to compare the indirect STINK model (Smith 1995) with the UNSW wind tunnel to assess the appropriateness of the methods for determining odour emission rates for area sources. The objective of this project was to assess the suitability of the STINK model and UNSW wind tunnel for determining odour emission rates from anaerobic piggery lagoons. In particular determining if the model compared well with UNSW wind tunnel measurements from the same source; the overall efficacy of the model; and the relationship between source footprint and predicted odour emission rate.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">odour emission rates (OERs)</field><field name="subject">frequency intesity duration offensiveness location (FIDOL)</field><field name="subject">STINK model</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001426/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensorless technique for BLDC motors</field><field name="creator">Gambetta, Daniele Morco</field><field name="description">Commutation is a fundamental feature of all DC machines. In conventional DC machines the commutation function is performed by the commutator and brushes. These act as both position sensors and switches. The mechanical commutator has obvious disadvantages. Overcoming those disadvantages has been a major reason behind the development of brushless DC (BLDC) machines. In brushless DC machines commutation is performed by power electronic devices forming part of an inverter bridge. However, switching of the power electronic devices has to be synchronised with rotor position. Position sensing is therefore an essential requirement. This can be done by using sensors such as Hall Effect devices or a sensorless approach may be adopted. Advantages of sensorless techniques include reduced cost and wiring. The most common sensorless method is based on detection of the zero crossing of back EMF signals. But this technique works only above a certain speed since back EMF is directly proportional to speed. As a result BLDC systems which rely solely on back EMF signals for commutation suffer from relatively poor starting performance characterised by back rotation of up to one hundred and eigthty electrical degrees and large fluctuations in electromagnetic torque resulting from non-ideal commutation instants. This may not be acceptable for some applications and many researchers have attempted to overcome those problems. The aim of this project has been to investigate the possibility of a sensorless technique which does not cost more than the back EMF method but with a performance at start-up comparable with that obtained when Hall sensors are used. Initial investigations led to a saliency based method. Detailed theoretical analysis is presented which shows that the method is insensitive to variations in operational parameters such as load current and circuit parameters such as power device voltage drops and winding resistances. There is a close parallel between it and the back EMF method and this makes it easy to swap to the latter method at high speed if necessary. A starting strategy, relying on saliency related measurements, is proposed which offers starting performance much better than the back EMF method and almost as good as Hall sensor based techniques. Experimental evidence is provided to confirm that commutation instants determined by the proposed method are practically coincident with those obtained when Hall sensors are used.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EMF method</field><field name="subject">DC machine</field><field name="subject">development of brushless DC (BLDC)</field><field name="subject">inipolar switching</field><field name="subject">bipolar switching</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001427/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local government marketing model</field><field name="creator">Gardiner, Michael William</field><field name="description">Local government is one of three tiers of government that operate in Australia. This research investigates how marketing can be applied to local government in a holistic manner. To achieve this goal, theory needed to be reviewed and developed with one particular outcome being a model outlining the components of the marketing environments that need understanding prior to the application of marketing practice. Local government was selected as the context of this study as much is written about the marketing of not-for-profit, social and public sector organisations but the literature on the integration of these practices in a holistic approach for local government is very limited. Further local government has a major economic impact on the viability and longevity of many rural and semi-rural areas of Australia. Equally in the metropolitan areas, local government accounts for a considerable proportion of the employment and impact on growth and development of these regions. Traditional marketing theory has been found wanting in the local government area, as traditional marketing practices is being applied in a piecemeal approach. This practice has caused local governments to have conflicting messages and product offerings to the community. However the review of marketing derivatives theory shows that no one derivative addressed the scope of products and activities managed by local government. Reviewing these derivatives show that marketing core concepts are relevant to local government, but the complexity lies in the application of marketing where the components of added complexity were derived from the organisational focus, structure and target market definitions. The theoretical process to develop this understanding of local government marketing and to develop a proposed model for the application of local government marketing was derived from the literature relating to the core traditional marketing concepts and the marketing derivatives of public, not-for-profit and social marketing. This review of the literature aided in defining the complexities of local government marketing and helped found the preliminary local government marketing model. With the use of case analysis three local government cases were explored. The first case, a metropolitan local government, used convergent interviewing to determine the factors relevant to the development of the holistic local government marketing model. Confirmatory case analysis was used for the remaining two cases, one semirural and one rural, to refine the developing model. Ultimately, the model was confirmed in principle but minor changes were required to make the model robust across the three cases. From a theoretical perspective the research identified that the marketing derivatives used in the development of the local government marketing model were relevant and further sets local government apart from but integrated with the three derivatives studied. From a practical perspective the development of the local government marketing model goes some way to developing practices that are coordinated and integrated across the local government organisation, thus providing local government with the advantages of having an integrated local government marketing approach.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">CHORN</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001428/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge management practices in multimedia super corridor status companies in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Goh, Guan Gan Gerald</field><field name="description">Knowledge is recognised as being an important asset in organisations these days. Despite this, many organisations are not doing enough to effectively manage this important asset for its competitive advantage. In response to this, knowledge management which is defined as a process that effectively creates, captures, shares and uses organisation-wide knowledge to improve the organisation's performance was conceived and has since gained widespread acceptance the world over. Despite its widespread acceptance, little is known about the current levels of knowledge management practice within the Malaysian context, in particular amongst the Multimedia Super Corridor status companies in Malaysia. In view of this, the research problem formulated for this study is: 'How and why do Multimedia Super Corridor status companies in Malaysia practise knowledge management?' Based on this research problem, three research questions that look specifically at the knowledge management enablers, knowledge management processes and knowledge management outcomes were identified based on the literature review. The literature review provides an overview of knowledge and the different types of knowledge. It then chronicles the developments of knowledge management and canvasses extant literature on knowledge management within the Malaysian context. It found that there are various enablers of knowledge management that may impact on the level of knowledge management practice in Malaysia. These enablers can be broadly categorised as culture, structure, people and information technology infrastructure. To further comprehend the knowledge creation process, this study utilised Nonaka and Takeuchi's (1995) socialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation (SECI) model for knowledge creation. In addition to this, organisational efficiency, competitive advantage, maximisation of organisational potential, and better management of knowledge assets were identified as key knowledge management outcomes in organisations. These knowledge management enablers, processes and outcomes were used to develop a preliminary theoretical framework upon which this research was based upon. This exploratory research employs the use of qualitative multiple case studies operating within a critical realism research paradigm. This research uses a total of four cases with three interviews each giving a total of twelve interviews. The literature review and two in-depth convergent interviews were the basis upon which the interview protocol was formulated. This interview protocol was then administered to a pilot case involving three interviews. This process was repeated in the main data collection stage on three different cases with three interviews per case. The main findings of this research are the ten different enablers of knowledge management that either take on the roles of inhibitor or facilitator. The facilitators of knowledge management are collaboration, mutual trust, learning, leadership, incentives and rewards, IT infrastructure and T-shaped skills. The inhibitors of knowledge management are centralisation and kiasu-ism. Another variable - formalisation has both positive and negative effects on knowledge management as it acts as an inhibitor to the socialisation knowledge creation process but acts as a facilitator to the other three knowledge processes. This research also found that all four knowledge processes - socialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation are being used by all cases to create knowledge with preference given to socialisation and combination. In addition, knowledge management is found to positively affect the organisations&#8217; competitive advantage, organisational efficiency, maximising organisational potential and effective management of knowledge assets. Further research utilising a quantitative approach to test the theory developed from this study apart from analysing the new variable kiasu-ism and the concept of ba were suggested to better comprehend the practise of knowledge management in Malaysia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">multimedia</field><field name="subject">malaysia</field><field name="subject">socialisation externalisation combination internalisation (SECI)</field><field name="subject">kiasu-ism</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001433/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new structural summary of the MMPI-2 for evaluating personal injury claimants</field><field name="creator">Goh, Hong Eng</field><field name="description">The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) is a popular measure of psychosocial functioning and psychopathology in the assessment of individuals in a variety of settings. However, the method of construction employed with the MMPI more than 60 years ago with psychiatric patients challenges the applicability of the scales for determining the psychosocial functioning of individuals from different settings. The restandardisation conducted in 1987 made no effort to eradicate the item overlap that was a result of the criterion keying method with contrasted groups. Although restandardized and updated with more contemporary language and content, the original psychiatric constructs were retained in order to maintain continuity with its predecessor. The aims of this investigation were to develop a new structure for the MMPI-2 constructed at the item-level, empirically derived and which specifically represents the dimensions that are relevant and appropriate in evaluating the psychosocial functioning of personal injury claimants. This task included comparisons with a comparable scale-level analysis and developing optimal scoring strategies where items in components and facets are allocated weightings based upon their strength of association. Study 1 was conducted using a sample of 2989 personal injury claimants assessed in Australia and the United States of America. The final sample of 3230, included 241 normal individuals, was utilized to develop a scale-level structure from 79 standard MMPI-2 scales and subscales. A nine-component solution consisting of General Maladjustment /Emotional Distress, Asocial Beliefs, Social Vulnerability, Somatic Complaints, Psychological Disturbance, Impulsive Expression, Antisocial Practices, Stereotypic Fears and Family Difficulties was derived using principal component analysis. However, intercorrelation between components in the structure signaled the need to develop a structure that would eradicate problems that were perpetuated by item overlap. The second study was conducted with a set of best practice procedures with the same clinical sample of 2989 personal injury claimants as Study 1. Forty-one components were derived through principal component analysis. Through the application of a set of criteria, a 35-component solution was retained. The pattern coefficients from the allocation of items to components determined the weightings to be applied to each item. Further analysis of the 35 components derived a substructure of 37 facets. The 35 components included only 442 of the 567 items, with the reliability coefficients of the first 25 components that ranged between .5 and .97, and the remaining 10 components that ranged from .29 to .49. The latter unreliable components were not included in the final Structural Summary, leaving 25 components (400 items) and their 33 facets for interpretation. Hence, in demonstrating the utility of the newly-derived structure, only 25 components and their 33 facets were interpreted. The 25 components were grouped conceptually into six domains. In the emotional domain were Psychological Distress (PsyDist), Anger, Fears, Psychotic Symptoms (PsyS), Paranoia (Par), Irritability (Irrit), Elation (Elat), Fear of the Dark (FD), and Financial Worry (FinWo). Somatic Complaints (SomC), Sexual Concerns (SexCon), and Gastrointestinal Problems (GasP) made up the measures in the physiological domain. In the behavioural domain were Cognitive Difficulties (CogDiff), Stimulus-Seeking (StimuS), Discipline (Dis), and Delinquency (Del) whilst the interpersonal domain was formed by Social Withdrawal (SoW), Negative Interpersonal Attitude (NIA), Timidity (Tim), Lie, Dissatisfaction with Self (DWS) and Family Relationship Difficulties (FReD). Alcoholism (Alco) was the only measure in the substance abuse domain, and the gender domain was comprised of Masculinity (Mas) and Femininity (Fem). The third study established preliminary normative means and standard deviations using a small opportunistic Australian university student sample (N = 219). No substantial gender differences were found but gender norms were maintained to facilitate comparisons with the traditional MMPI-2 approach. Comparisons of frequency of 'true' item response between the Australian university student sample and the U.S. restandardisation sample found relatively little differences and permitted evaluation of between sample differences on components and facets. The utility of the structure was demonstrated with the illustration of two clinical case examples, and a comparison was made with the standard MMPI-2 scales and subscales. The Structural Summary for the MMPI-2 demonstrated discriminative measures of psychosocial functioning that were a result of no item overlap, and the ability to attend to the different levels of intensity of self-report items because of differential weightings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MMPI-2</field><field name="subject">personal injury</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">psychological distress (PsyDist)</field><field name="subject">psychotic symptoms (PsyS)</field><field name="subject">paranoia (Par)</field><field name="subject">irritability (Irrit)</field><field name="subject">elation (Elate)</field><field name="subject">fear of the dark (FD)</field><field name="subject">financial worry (FinWo)</field><field name="subject">somatic complaints (SomC)</field><field name="subject">sexual concerns (SexCon)</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal problems (GasP)</field><field name="subject">cognitive difficulties (CogDiff)</field><field name="subject">stimulus-seeking (StimuS)</field><field name="subject">discipline (Dis)</field><field name="subject">delinquency (Del)</field><field name="subject">social withdrawal (SoW)</field><field name="subject">negative interpersonal attitude (NIA)</field><field name="subject">timidity (Tim)</field><field name="subject">dissatisfaction with self (DWS)</field><field name="subject">family relationship difficulties (FReD)</field><field name="subject">alcoholism (Alco)</field><field name="subject">masculinity (Mas)</field><field name="subject">femininity (Fem)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001434/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Typhoid fever in colonial Toowoomba and Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Hampton, Margaret</field><field name="description">Typhoid fever is a forgotten disease in today's society, but for the people of nineteenth century Australia it was part of their every day lives. This thesis examines the role that the Queensland colonial government, the medical profession, and the communities of Toowoomba and Brisbane played in the fight against the disease. At separation from New South Wales the Queensland government officials were new and inexperienced and had inherited a financial debt. These circumstances resulted in cautionary governance when it came to public health policy and issues, but determination and single-mindedness when it came to development of roads and railway lines. The government&#8217;s view at the time was if the colony was to prosper then this type of infrastructure must be developed at all costs. What the government failed to realise was that the infrastructure of drainage and sewerage, associated with good public health policies, needed to go side by side with other types of infrastructure. The prosperity of the colony rested on the health of its people. Because of the failure of the government to recognise the value of strong public health legislation it was up to the medical profession and the community to be vigilant and take the challenge to the government. This study has found that throughout the second half of the nineteenth century the medical profession and the community with the support of various newspapers had to challenge the government on public health issues consistently in relation to typhoid fever. This political pressure was more successful in Toowoomba where William Groom&#8217;s leadership achieved some important engineering solutions whereas campaigns in the capital, Brisbane, were marked by diversity and divisions. Intransigent colonial government policy condemned both cities to inadequate sanitation infrastructure until the twentieth century.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">typhoid fever</field><field name="subject">Toowoomba</field><field name="subject">Brisbane</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001435/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An item and order processing analysis of word length, generation and perceptual interference effects in human memory</field><field name="creator">Hendry, Liam</field><field name="description">When participants are presented with lists of items for immediate serial recall, tradition would suggest that a race begins - between the need to constantly refresh or recycle the memory trace of that list, and a tendency for the memory trace to decay. Standard models in the literature assumed a complex interaction of mental subsystems whereby a controlling attentional process strove to keep the memory of such a list alive for a sufficiently long period of time so it could be remembered and output in order, using a type of recirculating loop rehearsal and storage mechanism to offset the decay process. Evidence supporting such models stemmed from the observation that more short words could be remembered in order than long words (Baddeley, Thomson, &amp; Buchanan, 1975). This word length effect, described in the second chapter, was a crucial piece of evidence for rehearsal and decay models, in the example given, the recirculating loop was seen as being time-based and extremely limited in capacity, such that memory was deemed equivalent to the amount of information which could be cycled through the rehearsal loop in about two seconds. A number of recent challenges to this model of remembering have cast doubt on the nature of the process as described in such models as that of Baddeley (1990; 1996). Chapter 1 began by providing an overview of the development of such models from their earliest form, and also introduced some alternative ideas about the structure and function of human memory. A processing view was described, in which the probability of recalling a list of items depended not upon a race between decay and rehearsal, but on differential processing of items based on their nature. As remembering a list in its original order involves not only remembering the items themselves, but also information about how they relate together in the list, an alternate theory was advanced that in some cases the processing of information about the items, and information about their serial order could dissociate, producing a processing tradeoff. As individual items were better remembered, information about their presentation order diminished. This observation (Nairne, Riegler, &amp; Serra, 1991) was introduced as the item-order hypothesis. The item-order hypothesis suggested that under certain conditions increased item processing could lead to deficits in order processing, and that this produced a dissociation in performance between item and order memory tasks. The generation effect (Slamecka &amp; Graf, 1978) was one such example, as was the perceptual interference effect (Mulligan, 2000), and these were discussed in Chapter 3. The word length effect was seen as another instance where this tradeoff might be observed. A design incorporating elements of item and order tasks based upon Nairne et al. (1991) was detailed in the fourth chapter, leading on to empirical testing of the word length effect (Chapter 5), the generation effect (Chapter 6) and the perceptual interference effect (Chapter 7). This series of experiments compared word length and generation effects under serial recall and single item recognition tasks, using a range of test conditions designed to allow replication and extension of existing data from these separate streams of research. Results did not appear as predicted for some aspects of generation and all aspects of perceptual interference, and further experiments in Chapter 8 attempted to address the current findings. For the experiments involving word length, short words were better recalled than long words on the serial recall task, but long words were better recognised in the recognition task. Following additional manipulations in Chapter 8, the generation effect began to produce a similar pattern, but the results for perceptual interference were inconclusive. Word length data, however, were consistent with the item-order approach and supported a novel explanation for the word length effect. Implications and conclusions were discussed in Chapter 9.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pyschology</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">recall</field><field name="subject">recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001436/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of curvature on axial flux machine cores</field><field name="creator">Hewitt, Andrew</field><field name="description">This work is an investigation into the curvature related potential for flux to flow in the radial direction in the back-iron of laminated axial flux machine cores. Analytical and numerical models are presented. Analysis based on these models has shown that, in practical axial flux machines, the radial component of the flux density can be neglected with respect to the flux density distribution in the core back-iron. It has also been found that if the core permeability, core conductivity and number of poles are sufficiently high then power loss due to curvature related cross-lamination flux is negligible compared to normal eddy current losses. A closed form expression to predict losses due to curvature related radial flux is also presented.

The estimators considered are the unrestricted estimator (UE), restricted estimator (RE), shrinkage restricted estimator (SRE), preliminary test estimator (PTE), shrinkage preliminary test estimator (SPTE), and shrinkage estimator (SE). The performances of the estimators are investigated with respect to bias, squared error and linex loss. For the analyses of the risk functions of the estimators, analytical, graphical and numerical procedures are adopted. In Part I the SRE, SPTE and SE of the slope and intercept parameters of the simple linear regression model are considered. The performances of the estimators are investigated with respect to their biases and mean square errors. The efficiencies of the SRE, SPTE and SE relative to the UE are obtained. It is revealed that under certain conditions, SE outperforms the other estimators considered in this thesis. In Part II in addition to the likelihood ratio (LR) test, the Wald (W) and Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests are used to define the SPTE and SE of the parameter vector of the multiple linear regression model with normal errors. Moreover, the modified and size-corrected W, LR and LM tests are used in the definition of SPTE. It is revealed that a great deal of conflict exists among the quadratic biases (QB) and quadratic risks (QR) of the SPTEs under the three original tests. The use of the modified tests reduces the conflict among the QRs, but not among the QBs. However, the use of the size-corrected tests in the definition of the SPTE almost eliminates the conflict among both QBs and QRs. It is also revealed that there is a great deal of conflict among the performances of the SEs when the three original tests are used as the preliminary test statistics. With respect to quadratic bias, the W test statistic based SE outperforms that based on the LR and LM test statistics. However, with respect to the QR criterion, the LM test statistic based SE outperforms the W and LM test statistics based SEs, under certain conditions. In Part III the performance of the PTE of the slope parameter of the simple linear regression model is investigated under the linex loss function. This is motivated by increasing criticism of the squared error loss function for its inappropriateness in many real life situations where underestimation of a parameter is more serious than its overestimation or vice-versa. It is revealed that under the linex loss function the PTE outperforms the UE if the nonsample prior information about the value of the parameter is not too far from its true value. Like the linex loss function, the risk function of the PTE is also asymmetric. However, if the magnitude of the scale parameter of the linex loss is very small, the risk of the PTE is nearly symmetric.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">linear model</field><field name="subject">unrestricted estimator (UE)</field><field name="subject">restricted estimator (RE)</field><field name="subject">shrinkage restricted estimator (SRE)</field><field name="subject">preliminary test estimator (PTE)</field><field name="subject">shrinkage preliminary test estimator (SPTE)</field><field name="subject">and shrinkage estimator (SE)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001438/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of microwave sensing to the measurement of cheese curd moisture</field><field name="creator">Horsfield, Brendan</field><field name="description">There is a need in the dairy industry for instrumentation capable of providing on-line information about the moisture content of cheese during manufacture. Present measurement techniques are usually performed off-line and can be susceptible to human error. It is demonstrated that microwave-based moisture sensing techniques offer a number of potential advantages over conventional methods due to the strong interaction of microwaves with water. The permittivity of cream cheese curd and low-fat cheddar cheese curd has been measured over a range of frequencies and moisture contents in order to establish the relationship between these variables. A vector reflection coefficient measurement engine based on a six-port reflectometer has been built and tested. A suitable sensing head has been fabricated from a short length of microstrip transmission line. Two sensor characterisation models have been developed and compared with measured data. A novel algorithm has been developed to resolve the ambiguity inherent in many permittivity measurement techniques. It has been discovered that surface waves can propagate on a grounded dielectric slab covered by a material with a higher dielectric constant, provided the loss factor of the covering medium is greater than zero. It has also been found that the dominant mode of microstrip can radiate when the line is covered by a high-permittivity material, although this can be suppressed if the covering material is sufficiently lossy. There are three principal conclusions to draw from the investigation in this thesis. Firstly, changes in the moisture content of cheese curd during manufacture produce measurable variations in permittivity. Secondly, these changes can be measured accurately and cheaply using off-the-shelf microwave hardware. Finally, considerable attention must be paid to the characterisation of the sensing head if the instrument is to achieve its full potential. Promising results have been obtained in this area, however certain issues pertaining to the propagation of multiple dominant modes and higher order modes have not been fully resolved and would repay further theoretical analysis.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microwave sensing</field><field name="subject">cheese</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">polarisation</field><field name="subject">DC conductivity</field><field name="subject">Debye behaviour</field><field name="subject">dielectrics</field><field name="subject">sensors</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001446/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovering web page communities for web-based data management</field><field name="creator">Hou, Jingyu</field><field name="description">The World Wide Web is a rich source of information and continues to expand in size and complexity. Mainly because the data on the web is lack of rigid and uniform data models or schemas, how to effectively and efficiently manage web data and retrieve information is becoming a challenge problem. Discovering web page communities, which capture the features of the web and web-based data to find intrinsic relationships among the data, is one of the effective ways to solve this problem. A web page community is a set of web pages that has its own logical and semantic structures. In this work, we concentrate on the web data in web page format and exploit hyperlink information to discover (construct) web page communities. Three main web page communities are studied in this work: the first one is consisted of hub and authority pages, the second one is composed of relevant web pages with respect to a given page (URL), and the last one is the community with hierarchical cluster structures. For analysing hyperlinks, we establish a mathematical framework, especially the matrix-based framework, to model hyperlinks. Within this mathematical framework, hyperlink analysis is placed on a solid mathematic base and the results are reliable. For the web page community that is consisted of hub and authority pages, we focus on eliminating noise pages from the concerned page source to obtain another good quality page source, and in turn improve the quality of web page communities. We propose an innovative noise page elimination algorithm based on the hyperlink matrix model and mathematic operations, especially the singular value decomposition (SVD) of matrix. The proposed algorithm exploits hyperlink information among the web pages, reveals page relationships at a deeper level, and numerically defines thresholds for noise page elimination. The experiment results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the algorithm. This algorithm could also be used solely for web-based data management systems to filter unnecessary web pages and reduce the management cost. In order to construct a web page community that is consisted of relevant pages with respect to a given page (URL), we propose two hyperlink based relevant page finding algorithms. The first algorithm comes from the extended co-citation analysis of web pages. It is intuitive and easy to be implemented. The second one takes advantage of linear algebra theories to reveal deeper relationships among the web pages and identify relevant pages more precisely and effectively. The corresponding page source construction for these two algorithms can prevent the results from being affected by malicious hyperlinks on the web. The experiment results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithms. The research results could be used to enhance web search by caching the relevant pages for certain searched pages. For the purpose of clustering web pages to construct a community with its hierarchical cluster structures, we propose an innovative web page similarity measurement that incorporates hyperlink transitivity and page importance (weight).Based on this similarity measurement, two types of hierarchical web page clustering algorithms are proposed. The first one is the improvement of the conventional K-mean algorithms. It is effective in improving page clustering, but is sensitive to the predefined similarity thresholds for clustering. Another type is the matrix-based hierarchical algorithm. Two algorithms of this type are proposed in this work. One takes cluster-overlapping into consideration, another one does not. The matrix-based algorithms do not require predefined similarity thresholds for clustering, are independent of the order in which the pages are presented, and produce stable clustering results. The matrix-based algorithms exploit intrinsic relationships among web pages within a uniform matrix framework, avoid much influence of human interference in the clustering procedure, and are easy to be implemented for applications. The experiments show the effectiveness of the new similarity measurement and the proposed algorithms in web page clustering improvement. For applying above mathematical algorithms better in practice, we generalize the web page discovering as a special case of information retrieval and present a visualization system prototype, as well as technical details on visualization algorithm design, to support information retrieval based on linear algebra. The visualization algorithms could be smoothly applied to web applications. XML is a new standard for data representation and exchange on the Internet. In order to extend our research to cover this important web data, we propose an object representation model (ORM) for XML data. A set of transformation rules and algorithms are established to transform XML data (DTD and XML documents with DTD or without DTD) into this model. This model capsulizes elements of XML data and data manipulation methods. DTD-Tree is also defined to describe the logical structure of DTD. It also can be used as an application program interface (API) for processing DTD, such as transforming a DTD document into the ORM. With this data model, semantic meanings of the tags (elements) in XML data can be used for further research in XML data management and information retrieval, such as community construction for XML data.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">webpage</field><field name="subject">XML</field><field name="subject">object representation model (ORM)</field><field name="subject">DTD</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001447/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural behaviour of two-way fibre reinforced composite slabs</field><field name="creator">Huang, Da</field><field name="description">Innovative new flooring systems utilising lightweight fibre reinforced polymer composite materials may have the significant potential to offer both economic and performance benefits for infrastructure asset owners compared to conventional concrete and steel systems. Over recent years, a range of prototype floor systems using fibre reinforced polymer composites have been developed by researchers at the University of Southern Queensland. However before such structural systems can be widely adopted by industries, fundamental understanding of their behaviour must be improved. Such work will allow for the development of new design and analysis procedures which will enable engineers to efficiently and accurately design and analyse such structures. This dissertation presents an investigation into a new two-way fibre reinforced composite floor slab system. The proposed new two-way slab system is, in essence, a sandwich structure with an innovative hollow core made from a castable particulate filled resin system. The key focus of this dissertation is the development of a new analysis tool to analyse the two-way fibre reinforced composite slab and facilitate subsequent parametric studies into slab configurations for concept refinement. The detailed 3D finite element analyses and experimental investigations are performed to verify the new analysis tool, and provide more detailed insight into the structural behaviour of this new two-way fibre reinforced composite slab. Comparisons with detailed 3D FEA and experiments illustrate that the simplified analysis tool is capable of providing sufficient accuracy for the preliminary analysis of a slab structure. Moreover, the 3D finite element analyses agree well with the experiments, and it is concluded that the behavioural responses of the proposed new slab structure can be reliably predicted. The experimental results show that this new slab concept exhibits quite a robust static behaviour and is likely to have a robust fatigue performance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">composite material</field><field name="subject">fibre</field><field name="subject">polymer</field><field name="subject">fibre reinforced polymers (FRP)</field><field name="subject">slab</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001450/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A compositional study of the lunar global megaregolith using clementine orbiter data</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Noel William</field><field name="description">This thesis presents new information about the global megaregolith of the Moon, using 2059 craters (5 to 50 km diameter) as natural probes. Iron (FeO) and titanium (TiO2) concentrations were obtained from crater ejecta blanket data over an area between 600 North to 600 South latitude derived from the 1994 Clementine mission. The average iron and titanium weight percentages for lunar crater ejecta were calculated using the US Geological Survey's ISIS software, and used to determine the variation with depth of iron (FeO) and titanium (TiO2) in the highlands, mare areas and the South Pole Aitken basin. In addition, megaregolith compositional Iron (FeO) and Titanium (TiO2) Maps and compositional Province Maps were generated, and studied in detail. The Lunar Megaregolith Iron Province Map divides the Highland areas into 2 distinct provinces of low-iron Highland I (0-3.7 FeO weight percentage) and low-medium level iron Highland II (3.8-6.4%), and the Mare and South Pole Aitken Basin each into 3 distinct provinces (6.5-9.7%, 9.8-13.6%, and 13.7-18.3%). Similarly, a Titanium Megaregolith Province Map divides the Moon globally into 5 provinces based on weight percentages of TiO2. A new finding is the Highland II Province of elevated iron concentration which surrounds basins. These elevated iron levels may be explained in terms of an "Intrusion Model". In this model, basin formation fractures the surrounding anorthositic bedrock, and the middle level anorthositic crust allows mafic (basaltic?) magma to intrude. This intrusion into the megaregolith is in the form of sills and dykes from deep mafic sources but generally does not intrude into the surface regolith. In some places however, the mafic (basaltic?) lava may have extruded onto the surface, such as near Crater 846 (15.6N 92.2W). The megaregolith, which consists of large volume breccia, would have voids and vacancies in this structure into which mafic or basaltic material could intrude. "Islands" of Highland I Province material surrounded by Highland II Province indicate this intrusion was non-uniform. Another possible explanation for the Highland II Province iron levels comes from the "Thrust Block" model, where deep mafic material has been broken into large blocks by the basin-forming events, and "thrusted" or uplifted to displace most of the overlying anorthosite bedrock, thereby mechanically mixing with the megaregolith to provide the additional iron input. However, this does entirely fit comfortably with the data in this study. A third explanation for the Highland II Province arises from the "Basin Impact Ejecta Model" such as the Imbrium Impact described by Haskin (1998). The Basin Impact Ejecta model describes the effect of basin impacts around 4.0 billion to 3.8 billion years ago in the Moon's history (Ryder, 1990; Taylor, 2001)).

The study by Rugg et al. was replicated and extended by manipulating both the semantic relatedness between study items and the timing of recall. Eventrelated potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 17 scalp electrode sites during performance of a recognition/associative recall task. Forty participants were visually presented with four blocks of 50 word pairs which were either unrelated (Experiments 1 and 2) or weakly semantically related (Experiments 3 and 4). Participants were instructed to form an association between the members of each word pair. At test, the first members of each pair were visually presented intermixed with a similar number of unstudied items. Participants were required to discriminate (i.e., recognise) previously studied items (old) from new items. Participants were also required to recall the study associate for words judged old, and to provide confidence levels for each recognition decision on a 3-point scale. Recall was either immediate (Experiments 1 and 3) or delayed (Experiments 2 and 4). Relative to ERPs to new items, the ERPs elicited by words correctly recognised and for which the associate was correctly recalled exhibited a positive-going shift between 500-800 ms poststimulus onset. The effect was maximal at posterior temporal-parietal electrode sites (the parietal old/new effect). Although the effect was not lateralised to the left hemisphere, this result may be due to the variability in encoding strategies employed by the participants. Behavioural data consistently indicated that response confidence is confounded with response category. The ERP results also revealed that the old/new effect is not evident following the experimental control of response confidence, and that immediate recall is associated with a negative-going shift at posterior electrode sites between 800-1100 ms poststimulus onset. Manipulating the semantic relatedness between the word pairs did not influence the distribution of the old/new effect. The results are discussed in terms of the view that the parietal old/new effect reflects neural activity associated with the recollection of specific previous experiences, and may reflect retrieval processes supported by the medial temporal lobe memory system (Moscovitch, 1992, 1994; Squire, 1992; Squire, Knowlton, &amp; Musen, 1993). It is suggested that future research extend the current findings by examining the influence of response confidence in alternative recognition memory paradigms.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recognition</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">event related potentials (ERPs)</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001454/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relational nature of mentoring gifted children using desktop videoconferencing</field><field name="creator">Lamont, Katrina</field><field name="description">The integration of technology into classrooms, the education of gifted learners, and the challenge this presents to classroom relationships as a result of engaging with computer technology are significant issues for teachers in this decade. The evolving paradigm of technology use, the deep learning of computer skills that students will require for future employment and how this can be incorporated into appropriate pedagogies for gifted learners also poses challenges for teachers. This thesis reports on a unique mentoring program that was developed to utilise desktop videoconferencing (DVC) technology and designed to specifically address these challenges. The study was undertaken in a large independent school (K-12) in New South Wales, Australia and involved six students and six teachers, none of whom had any previous experience of DVC or mentoring. The aim of the study was to investigate learning outcomes for teachers and gifted students. This study employed DVC as a didactic strategy over a 10-week period. The mentoring sessions of the cohorts and their post-mentoring interviews were evaluated using grounded theory methods of data gathering and analysis over a 2-year period. The findings demonstrated that the nature of learning during DVC could be constructed as an emergent theory, based on the teaching philosophies of the teachers and their goals for their students. Technical support, relational mentors and motivational tasks created supportive environments for DVC. Perseverance, enthusiasm and resilience enhanced the uniqueness of mentoring program. Several recommendations are also posited for further research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">desktop videoconferencing (DVC)</field><field name="subject">gifted children</field><field name="subject">social theory</field><field name="subject">mentor</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001455/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">University journeys: alternative entry students and their construction of a means of succeeding in an unfamiliar university culture</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Jill</field><field name="description">This research study takes a multi-disciplinary perspective, using critical discourse theory, transactional communication theory and cross-cultural theory to contribute insight into the experiences of alternative entry students as they strive to access and participate in higher education. The study seeks to determine how these students learn to persevere: how they construct their means of succeeding in the university culture. The methodological structure of the research comprises a collective case study design, encompassing critical ethnography, action research and reflexive approaches to guide a deeper understanding of the experiences of studying at a regional Australian university. The reflexive nature of the research facilitated the development of an original theoretical construct, the &#8216;deficit-discourse&#8217; shift, which challenges higher education policy and practice, in particular, in relation to academics&#8217; roles in making their discourses explicit and in collaborating with students to facilitate students&#8217; perseverance and success. The research has also generated two models: the Framework for Student Engagement and Mastery and the Model for Student Success at University. The Framework re-conceptualises the university as a dynamic culture made up of a multiplicity of sub-cultures, each with its own literacy or discourse. The Framework recasts the first year experience as a journey, with students&#8217; transition re-conceptualised as the processes of gaining familiarity with and negotiating these new literacies and discourses whereas perseverance is viewed as the processes of mastering and demonstrating them. The Model provides a three step practical strategy (incorporating reflective practice, socio-cultural practice and critical practice) for achieving this engagement: for empowering students to negotiate, master and demonstrate their mastery of the university culture&#8217;s multiple discourses. Together, the two models provide students with a means of succeeding in the new university culture.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical discourse theory</field><field name="subject">transactional communication theory</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural theory</field><field name="subject">multiliteracy framework</field><field name="subject">ExcelL</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001456/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and strategic treatment of dystrophic muscle</field><field name="creator">Laws, Nicola</field><field name="description">The mdx mouse is widely used as a model for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a fatal X-linked disease caused by a deficiency of the sub-sarcolemmal protein, dystrophin. This dissertation reports characterisation of the features of dystrophy in the mdx mouse, including parameters such as electrophysiological and contractile properties of dystrophic cardiac tissue, quantitative evaluation of kyphosis throughout the mdx lifespan, and contractile properties of respiratory and paraspinal muscles. Following these characterisation studies, the efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) to induce alternative mRNA splicing in mdx skeletal muscles (diaphragm and paraspinal muscles) was evaluated. The left atria of younger (&lt;6 weeks) and older (&gt;15 months) mdx mice showed consistently lower basal forces and responsiveness to increased calcium, while action potential duration was significantly shorter in young mice (3 weeks) and older mice (9 and 12 months) (P&lt;0.05). Cardiac fibrosis increased with age in mdx atria and ventricles and was elevated in young (6-8 weeks) and old (15 months) mdx compared to control mice (P&lt;0.01). This study provided insights into DMD cardiomyopathy, and suggested that very young or old mdx mice provide the most useful models. Mdx mice show thoracolumbar kyphosis like boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. A novel radiographic index, the Kyphotic Index (KI), was developed and showed that mdx mice are significantly more kyphotic from 9 months of age, an effect maintained until 17 months (P&lt;0.05). At 17 months, the paraspinal and respiratory muscles (latissimus dorsi, diaphragm and intercostal muscles) are significantly weaker and more fibrotic (P&lt;0.05). Administration of AOs at four sites within the diaphragm at 4 and 5 months of age significantly increased twitch and tetanic forces compared to sham treated mdx (P&lt;0.05). However, no difference in collagen was evident and dystrophin was not detected, possibly due to the low concentration of AO utilised. This study suggested that AOs can provide functional improvement in treated skeletal muscles. Monthly injections with AOs into the paraspinal muscles from 2 months to 18 months of age alleviated kyphosis, without significantly altering twitch and tetanic forces of latissimus dorsi, diaphragm and intercostal muscles. There was evidence of less fibrosis in diaphragm and latissimus dorsi muscles (P&lt;0.05) and reduced central nucleation of the latissimus dorsi and intercostal muscles (P&lt;0.05). Again, dystrophin was not detected by immunoblot. These studies indicate that very young and old mdx mice display previously uncharacterised dystrophic features, and are useful models for testing new therapies such as AOs. Low doses of AOs were shown to be safe and efficacious for long-term use, however there remains a need for testing higher concentrations and improved delivery strategies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dystrophic muscle</field><field name="subject">Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)</field><field name="subject">antisense oligonucleotides (AOs)</field><field name="subject">dystrophin</field><field name="subject">muscular dystrophy X-linked mouse (mdx)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001457/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geospatial data sharing in Saudi Arabia</field><field name="creator">Lee, Donald C.</field><field name="description">This research started with a realization that two organizations in Saudi Arabia were spending large amounts of money, millions of dollars in fact, in acquiring separate sets of geospatial data that had identical basemap components. Both the organizations would be using the data for similar engineering purposes, yet both would be independently outsourcing the data gathering. In all probability, resources are being wasted through two organizations each developing and operating stand-alone geographic information systems and then populating the databases with geospatial data obtained separately. Surely with some cooperation, a shared database could be established, with a diffusion of economic benefits to both organizations. Preliminary discussions with representatives from both the organizations revealed high levels of enthusiasm for the principle of sharing geospatial data, but the discussions also revealed even higher levels of scepticism that such a scheme could be implemented. This dichotomy of views prompted an investigation into the issues, benefits and the barriers involved in data sharing, the relative weight of these issues, and a quest for a workable model. Sharing geospatial data between levels of government, between governmental and private institutions, and within institutions themselves has been attempted on large and small scales in a variety of countries, with varying degrees of accomplishment. Lessons can be learned from these attempts at data sharing, confirming that success is not purely a function of financial and technical benefits, but is also influenced by institutional and cultural aspects. This research is aimed at defining why there is little geospatial data sharing between authorities in Saudi Arabia, and then presenting a workable model as a pilot arrangement. This should take into account issues raised in reference material; issues evidenced through experience in the implementation of systems that were configured as independent structures; issues of culture; and issues apparent in a range of existing data sharing arrangements. The doubts expressed by engineering managers towards using a geospatial database that is shared between institutions in Saudi Arabia have been borne out by the complexity of interrelationships which this research has revealed. Nevertheless, by concentrating on a two party entry level, a model has been presented which shows promise for the implementation of such a scheme. The model was derived empirically and checked against a case study of various other similar ventures, with a consideration of their applicability in the environment of Saudi Arabia. This model follows closely the generic structure of the Singapore Land Hub. The scalability of the model should allow it to be extended to other, multi-lateral data sharing arrangements. An alternative solution could be developed based on a Spatial Data Infrastructure model and this is suggested for ongoing investigation. Major unresolved questions relate to cultural issues, whose depth and intricacy have the potential to influence the realization of successful geospatial data sharing in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geospatial data sharing</field><field name="subject">Saudi Arabia</field><field name="subject">geographic information system (GIS)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001458/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dynamics, implications and effects of knowledge creation in professional learning communities: three case studies</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Marian</field><field name="description">Australia faces many challenges in a globalised and rapidly changing world. Schools are increasingly being given responsibility for ensuring the future economic, social and political wellbeing of the nation and its successful transition into the knowledge age. Teachers have the responsibility of educating their students for an as yet unknown future. To meet these complex professional challenges, teachers need to become creators rather than consumers of knowledge. Through engaging in knowledge creation work teachers can re-image their work, reconceptualising the meaning of teacher professionalism. The study explores understandings of knowledge creation that emerge from the experiences of three Queensland schools engaged in IDEAS, a process of whole-school renewal which focuses on the work of teachers. In each case, through collaborative effort, the teachers created new knowledge. How this happened, what was achieved, the dynamics of the relationship between individual and group learning, and the subsequent impact on practice varied from case to case. The nature of the knowledge created was strongly influenced by contextual factors such as the dominant organisational paradigm, socio-emotional climate, cognitive processes, leadership and organisational coherence. In each school extensive data were gathered through in-depth interviews, artefact and document collection, and participant observation, particularly of IDEAS related activities. The story of each school and its engagement with IDEAS &#8211; constructed from the accounts of the teachers &#8211; is told to provide a basis for understanding knowledge creation in each context. In the final stage of analysis, cross-case comparisons are made to provide a more generalised understanding of knowledge creation processes and the factors which impact on the nature of the knowledge produced. The findings indicate a link between the creation of knowledge in the three schools and a re-imaging of teachers&#8217; work.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">innovative designs enhancing achievements schools (IDEAS)</field><field name="subject">tacit knowledge</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001459/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fuzzy logic based robust control of queue management and optimal treatment of traffic over TCP/IP networks</field><field name="creator">Li, Zhi</field><field name="description">Improving network performance in terms of efficiency, fairness in the bandwidth, and system stability has been a research issue for decades. Current Internet traffic control maintains sophistication in end TCPs but simplicity in routers. In each router, incoming packets queue up in a buffer for transmission until the buffer is full, and then the packets are dropped. This router queue management strategy is referred to as Drop Tail. End TCPs eventually detect packet losses and slow down their sending rates to ease congestion in the network. This way, the aggregate sending rate converges to the network capacity. In the past, Drop Tail has been adopted in most routers in the Internet due to its simplicity of implementation and practicability with light traffic loads. However Drop Tail, with heavy-loaded traffic, causes not only high loss rate and low network throughput, but also long packet delay and lengthy congestion conditions. To address these problems, active queue management (AQM) has been proposed with the idea of proactively and selectively dropping packets before an output buffer is full. The essence of AQM is to drop packets in such a way that the congestion avoidance strategy of TCP works most effectively. Significant efforts in developing AQM have been made since random early detection (RED), the first prominent AQM other than Drop Tail, was introduced in 1993. Although various AQMs also tend to improve fairness in bandwidth among flows, the vulnerability of short-lived flows persists due to the conservative nature of TCP. It has been revealed that short-lived flows take up traffic with a relatively small percentage of bytes but in a large number of flows. From the user&#8217;s point of view, there is an expectation of timely delivery of short-lived flows. Our approach is to apply artificial intelligence technologies, particularly fuzzy logic (FL), to address these two issues: an effective AQM scheme, and preferential treatment for short-lived flows. Inspired by the success of FL in the robust control of nonlinear complex systems, our hypothesis is that the Internet is one of the most complex systems and FL can be applied to it. First of all, state of the art AQM schemes outperform Drop Tail, but their performance is not consistent under different network scenarios. Research reveals that this inconsistency is due to the selection of congestion indicators. Most existing AQM schemes are reliant on queue length, input rate, and extreme events occurring in the routers, such as a full queue and an empty queue. This drawback might be overcome by introducing an indicator which takes account of not only input traffic but also queue occupancy for early congestion notification. The congestion indicator chosen in this research is traffic load factor. Traffic load factor is in fact dimensionless and thus independent of link capacity, and also it is easy to use in more complex networks where different traffic classes coexist. The traffic load indicator is a descriptive measure of the complex communication network, and is well suited for use in FL control theory. Based on the traffic load indicator, AQM using FL &#8211; or FLAQM &#8211; is explored and two FLAQM algorithms are proposed. Secondly, a mice and elephants (ME) strategy is proposed for addressing the problem of the vulnerability of short-lived flows. The idea behind ME is to treat short-lived flows preferably over bulk flows. ME&#8217;s operational location is chosen at user premise gateways, where surplus processing resources are available compared to other places. By giving absolute priority to short-lived flows, both short and long-lived flows can benefit. One problem with ME is starvation of elephants or long-lived flows. This issue is addressed by dynamically adjusting the threshold distinguishing between mice and elephants with the guarantee that minimum capacity is maintained for elephants. The method used to dynamically adjust the threshold is to apply FL. FLAQM is deployed to control the elephant queue with consideration of capacity usage of mice packets. In addition, flow states in a ME router are periodically updated to maintain the data storage. The application of the traffic load factor for early congestion notification and the ME strategy have been evaluated via extensive experimental simulations with a range of traffic load conditions. The results show that the proposed two FLAQM algorithms outperform some well-known AQM schemes in all the investigated network circumstances in terms of both user-centric measures and network-centric measures. The ME strategy, with the use of FLAQM to control long-lived flow queues, improves not only the performance of short-lived flows but also the overall performance of the network without disadvantaging long-lived flows.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fuzzy logic (FL)</field><field name="subject">TCP/IP</field><field name="subject">network</field><field name="subject">active queue management (AQM)</field><field name="subject">random early detection (RED)</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">topology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001461/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The principal's microcosm: an exploration of the interplay between the leader's meaning system and school self-renewing processes</field><field name="creator">Lyons, John Joseph</field><field name="description">Despite research on the school principalship having evolved over past decades, the prevailing standpoint has largely remained an outsider's perspective upon external behavioural manifestations of principalship. Whilst valuable in their own right, such models of research accord little importance to the effect of thought and intention on behaviour. The purpose of this research was to articulate the notion of a principal's "microcosm" as a means of capturing the dynamics of meaning making in the principalship, when the cognitive world of the principal and the actual work of school leadership interact. The functional context was the expectations of catholic school authorities that schools will engage in processes of continuous self-renewal. Following comprehensive analysis of recent theoretical and research literature, a preliminary framework for the principal's microcosm was generated. A single-investigator, multiple-site case study methodology was utilised to conduct the field research, which was carried out in a provincial city of an Australian state. Three principals were selected as the subjects for in-depth exploration and analysis over a period of 16 months. A range of qualitative research strategies was employed, encompassing formal and informal interactions with the three principals and selected members of their professional communities. On the basis of the field study, a refined framework for the principal's microcosm was developed. Four major conclusions were identified. First, the notion of microcosm offers promise as an explanatory and analytical tool for focussing upon the complexities of change in school settings. Second, metaphor was observed to be integral to microcosm and its usefulness for comprehending leader behaviours was identified. The third conclusion concerned the potential of the construct microcosm for facilitating leader development through assisting individual leaders to reflect upon and to critically examine personal meanings embedded within their own professional practice. Finally, this research makes a contribution to clarifying the nature of catholic education itself.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">principalship</field><field name="subject">principal</field><field name="subject">microcosm</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001464/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Create accurate numerical models of complex spatio-temporal dynamical systems with holistic discretisation</field><field name="creator">MacKenzie, Tony</field><field name="description">This dissertation focuses on the further development of creating accurate numerical models of complex dynamical systems using the holistic discretisation technique [Roberts, Appl. Num. Model., 37:371-396, 2001]. I extend the application from second to fourth order systems and from only one spatial dimension in all previous work to two dimensions (2D). We see that the holistic technique provides useful and accurate numerical discretisations on coarse grids. We explore techniques to model the evolution of spatial patterns governed by pdes such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the real-valued Ginzburg-Landau equation. We aim towards the simulation of fluid flow and convection in three spatial dimensions. I show that significant steps have been taken in this dissertation towards achieving this aim. Holistic discretisation is based upon centre manifold theory [Carr, Applications of centre manifold theory, 1981] so we are assured that the numerical discretisation accurately models the dynamical system and may be constructed systematically. To apply centre manifold theory the domain is divided into elements and using a homotopy in the coupling parameter, subgrid scale fields are constructed consisting of actual solutions of the governing partial differential equation(pde). These subgrid scale fields interact through the introduction of artificial internal boundary conditions. View the centre manifold (macroscale) as the union of all states of the collection of subgrid fields (microscale) over the physical domain. Here we explore how to extend holistic discretisation to the fourth order Kuramoto-Sivashinsky pde. I show that the holistic models give impressive accuracy for reproducing the steady states and time dependent phenomena of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on coarse grids. The holistic method based on local dynamics compares favourably to the global methods of approximate inertial manifolds. The excellent performance of the holistic models shown here is strong evidence in support of the holistic discretisation technique. For shear dispersion in a 2D channel a one-dimensional numerical approximation is generated directly from the two-dimensional advection-diffusion dynamics. We find that a low order holistic model contains the shear dispersion term of the Taylor model [Taylor, IMA J. Appl. Math., 225:473-477, 1954]. This new approach does not require the assumption of large x scales, formerly absolutely crucial in deriving the Taylor model. I develop holistic discretisation for two spatial dimensions by applying the technique to the real-valued Ginzburg-Landau equation as a representative example of second order pdes. The techniques will apply quite generally to second order reaction-diffusion equations in 2D. This is the first study implementing holistic discretisation in more than one spatial dimension. The previous applications of holistic discretisation have developed algebraic forms of the subgrid field and its evolution. I develop an algorithm for numerical construction of the subgrid field and its evolution for 1D and 2D pdes and explore various alternatives. This new development greatly extends the class of problems that may be discretised by the holistic technique. This is a vital step for the application of the holistic technique to higher spatial dimensions and towards discretising the Navier-Stokes equations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spatio-temporal dynamical systems</field><field name="subject">holistic discretisation</field><field name="subject">Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</field><field name="subject">Ginzburg-Landau equation</field><field name="subject">centre manifold theory</field><field name="subject">Taylor model</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001466/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A CO2 measurement system for low-cost applications using chemical transduction</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, Andrew Douglas</field><field name="description">It is demonstrated that by using a miniature chemical reaction vessel under adaptive mechatronic control, it is possible to design and construct a low-cost carbon dioxide measurement system. With further development such a system would be potentially suitable for low-cost commercial application, in particular as sacrificial, single-mission instrumentation packages in horticultural cargo monitoring. Current instrumentation systems for carbon dioxide (CO2) gas measurement are reviewed and their limitations with respect to low cost commercial applications determined. These utilise technology intended for laboratory measurements. In particular the optical energy absorbance of CO2 in the infra-red electromagnetic spectrum. These systems require large optical paths (typically 10cm) in order to measure small CO2 concentrations. This in turn has a large impact on the physical size of the sensing system. Of the many applications requiring online CO2 sensing packages (such as medical, petroleum, environmental and water treatment)the horticultural industry is the primary focus for this research. CO2 sensing systems are primarily used in horticulture to monitor the produce environment and help extend storage time. For these applications CO2 concentrations are typically low (in the range 0 to 1%) and the paramount need is for low-cost (and possibly disposable) sensing packages. The basis of the measurement technique is the use of bulk (but small volume) aqueous chemical reaction under mechatronic control. Unlike thin film technologies where very thin membranes are passively exposed to the gaseous sample, here a small volume (approximately 2mL) of simple and very cheap liquid chemical indicator (calcium hydroxide solution) is used to produce an opaque precipitate. CO2 concentration is then assessed by low-cost optical attenuation measurements of the developing opacity of the solution. The instrumentation package comprises pumps, flowmeter, reaction cell and infra-red optics for the turbidity measurement, plus reagent and waste vessels, pipelines and electronics. During each measurement cycle, the reaction cell is flushed, with fresh chemical indicator and a sample of gas admitted. The indicator and the sample gas are then vigorously mixed and the change in the indicators optical properties measured at regular intervals. An embedded 8-bit microcontroller performs the necessary analysis to deduce the CO2 concentration (as percentage by volume) for the sample gas by reference to one or more of five ``Time-To-Threshold'' calibration models. These models evaluate the trend in turbidity development as precipitate is formed. First and second prototypes of the measurement system have been constructed and their (low-cost) components and overall performance evaluated, the first a `proof-of-concept' and the second to investigate methodology shortcomings. As a result the design of a third prototype is outlined. The measurement systems have been shown to work adequately well within expected limitations, resulting in a usable low-cost measurement technique. The current prototypes have a useful range of at least 5% to 100% CO2 with a discrimination of typically +-6%. Deficiencies, particularly performance at low concentrations, are identified and potential enhancements for future prototypes proposed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbon dioxide (CO2)</field><field name="subject">chemistry</field><field name="subject">surface acoustic wave sensors (SAW)</field><field name="subject">callibration model</field><field name="subject">software development</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001468/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The integration of sensory control for sugar cane harvesters</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Stuart George</field><field name="description">The research concerns the design and implementation of mechatronic systems to assist in the operation and control of a sugar cane harvester. Two functions were chosen for attention, the primary separation system, and the &#8216;topper&#8217; that discards the leafy crown. Although these operations are given low priority by the operator of the harvester, their optimisation is of particular significance to the industry. Optimum separation requires a fine balance between discarding &#8216;trash&#8217; that would contaminate the quality of the cane billets and losing good sugar-bearing material through over cleaning. Poor control of the topper can create extra load for the separation system and cause it to operate at a low efficiency with high loss. Alternatively it can cause a length of sugar-bearing cane stalk to be lost before it even enters the harvester system at all. A variety of mechatronic techniques were explored, that addressed the problem of providing useful data directly from the harvester functions and the electronic instrumentation to allow the data to be collected in a useful form in real-time. Computer control issues were also investigated, to make best use of the data stream. Novel acoustic transducers were introduced to the sensory separation system to provide a signal that indicated material striking the fan blades. A rotary transformer was required to allow transmission of the signal, and a signal interface system was implemented to record the returned data. Many real-time time-series analyses were conducted, and from these a suitable algorithm to extract an impact signal was developed. This system was assessed under harvesting conditions with results that confirmed its ability to quantify the amount of cane lost from the harvest. An investigation was conducted to detect the optimum topping height on a sugar cane stalk. The techniques considered both the internal and external attributes of the stalk, and a method was selected to measure the sugar concentration with a chemical sensor. An important design parameter was that the sensor must operate on the harvester in real time. The novel refractometer worked well in laboratory conditions, yielding repeatable and accurate results. The field environment complicated the application of this system, however this was partly overcome with introduction of a custom sample-crushing mechanism. This device provided the necessary juice sample from a selection of the topped cane stalks. The complete sampling and measuring mechanism operated well on cane stalks, and returned encouraging results. Both sets of data returned useful information regarding the operation of the particular harvester operations. The control of either the separation system or the topper requires careful balancing, and novel control techniques that consider the ergonomics for the operator are discussed.

However, it was an intuitive framework, developed as part of a reformist argument for a pluralist system of industrial relations. It was not based on a systematic, empirical study of managers and, while applied to research, there has been little testing of the construct. The primary research question addressed in this thesis is whether managers in contemporary SMEs exhibit unitarist characteristics. A number of subsidiary questions follow. The first set explores managers' attitudes towards managerial prerogative, conflict, collective workplace relations and trade unions. Analysis of the data produced 11 unitarist dimensions. The second addresses whether organisational and personal characteristics and managers' perceptions of the limitations on management are significant for SME managers' ideological frameworks. The third identifies whether consultative, participative and collective practices are employed in work organisations. The definition of managerial ideology, including both managers' beliefs and values and also their workplace behaviour and practices, led to testing the relationship between the unitarist dimensions and managerial practice, and managers' satisfaction with employees. Finally, the thesis investigated whether there were any significant links between managerial practices and managers' satisfaction with employee performance. The methodology included a mail survey of SME managers in Eastern Australia with 206 respondents, and an interview programme of 20 SME managers in Brisbane, Queensland. The significant findings of this research are, first, that consultative or participative managerial practices do not necessarily reflect a pluralist ideology or orientation. SME managers limit the scope of decisions for involving employees, and usually shopfloor employees, utilising practices that do not compromise managerial power or managerial prerogative. Second, organisational and personal characteristics are relatively unimportant contextual variables in management behaviour in SMEs, unless it was described as a family business. Third, this thesis provides an alternative to the conclusions of some industrial relations scholars that managers employ a mix of unitarist and pluralist strategies. The adoption of apparently pluralist management practices in consultation and employee participation are revealed in this research as being predominantly non-threatening to managerial prerogative and organisational power structures in workplaces in terms of who is involved or excluded, and about what matters employees are consulted or involved. The overall results of managers' attitudes to collective workplace arrangements and trade unions confirm a general unitarist orientation in Australian SMEs. Fourth, the evidence does not suggest any clear binding of values and beliefs with managerial behaviour. Underpinning normative perspectives on management is an underlying commitment to protecting managers' power in the work organisation. It is this fundamental political commitment that both guides and constrains strategic choice in managing employees in SMEs. Unitarist ideology is thus central to the norms of management, and goes to the core of managerial prerogative. Finally, the results indicated that SME managers in the study usually did not demonstrate strong attachments to their views on the issues presented to them.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">manager</field><field name="subject">enterprise</field><field name="subject">human relations</field><field name="subject">Dunlop's industrial relations theory</field><field name="subject">unitarist construct</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001470/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological factors influencing unsafe behaviour during medication administration</field><field name="creator">McKeon, Christine</field><field name="description">The health system in Australia delivers safe and effective health care to millions of patients each year. However, health care is not as safe as it could be with research indicating that errors involving medications are a leading cause of unintended harm to patients both in Australia and internationally. Historically, hospital authorities have attempted to reduce incidents by focusing on the actions of individuals. However, the health system is now taking advantage of research carried out in other complex industries which indicates that error is inevitable and that identifying individuals as the ultimate cause of adverse incidents is of limited value unless the context in which the incident occurred is well understood. This series of studies used Reason's (1990) model of accident causation as the basis for the search into possible contributing factors to unsafe behaviour by nurses during medication administration. Structural equation modelling was used to operationalise Reason's theory by developing a model linking organisational and individual factors to unsafe behaviour in the hospital system. Study 1 in this series was a preliminary investigation of the role of organisational factors in contributing to violations by nurses in rural and remote areas in Queensland, Australia. Data were collected using a self-report questionnaire with this instrument being used to develop a structural model wherein organisational variables predicted 23% of the variance in self-reported violations. Study 2 extended the number of organisational factors measured by using a validated instrument that is widely used in public sector hospitals in Queensland. This instrument measures organisational climate and also a number of individual factors. In addition to the outcome variable, violation behaviour, a measure of errors was included. Data were collected from nurses working in two rural health service districts. A structural model was developed from this instrument wherein organisational variables predicted 7% of the variance in selfreported violations and 24% of the variance in errors. The hypothesised relationships between the individual factors and errors were not supported in this study. Study 3 investigated the impact of individual factors and a specific type of organisational climate, that is, safety climate on unsafe behaviour. The violation behaviour and error scales were extended and improved in this study, for example, the error scale was expanded to include near misses. In addition, a new scale measuring reporting behaviour was developed and included. Data were collected from nurses working in a large rural centre. The structural model developed from the instrument indicated that safety climate predicted 27% of the variance in violation behaviour, 61% of the variance in errors and near misses, and 20% of the variance in willingness to report. This series of studies identified underlying contributing factors to unsafe behaviour during medication administration, indicated the strength of the relationships among the various elements, and illustrated how the various parts of the system link together to influence safety outcomes. By identifying which elements are important by the use of structural equation modelling, this research provides the basis for predicting unsafe organisational conditions and leads to suggestions for suitably targeted interventions to reduce unsafe behaviour and adverse incidents.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">Reason's model of accident causation</field><field name="subject">medication</field><field name="subject">nurse</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001473/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The active young solar-type star HR 1817 (=HD 35850)</field><field name="creator">Mengel, Matthew Wayne</field><field name="description">The active F dwarf HR 1817 represents the upper temperature extreme of what are broadly termed solar-type stars - stars which have the same internal structure as the Sun, albeit in this case with a much smaller convective zone. To date, studies of the active surface features and magnetic fields of solar-type stars have been restricted to G and K dwarfs. This thesis investigates the surface and magnetic features of HR 1817 using the techniques of Doppler and Zeeman Doppler Imaging, resulting in tomographic maps of the stellar surface and magnetic field. Cooler stars than HR 1817 exhibit large polar spots, and while HR 1817 also exhibits a polar spot, it is not nearly as large as those usually seen. The lower-latitude surface features of HR 1817 are weak but well defined and cover a relatively small area of the stellar surface. Total spot coverage is relatively small (~ 1.7 - 2 per cent). Zeeman Doppler Imaging reveals that HR 1817 exhibits a richly-detailed, though weak magnetic topography. A ring of azimuthal field appears around the pole, while the radial field exhibits many well-defined and distinct bipolar mid-latitude magnetic features, perhaps indicating a more dominant interface dynamo as opposed to the posited distributed dynamo of cooler active dwarfs. Finally, a differential rotation measurement of the star indicates an extremely large rotational shear. Values for the equatorial rotation and rotational shear of 6.494 +/- 0.010 rad/d and 0.256 +/- 0.017 rad/d respectively are found. This equatorial rotation is equivalent to a rotational period for HR 1817 of ~ 0.98 days. The very high rotational shear of 0.256 rad/d is fast enough for the equator to lap the pole in approximately 23 days.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar-type star</field><field name="subject">doppler</field><field name="subject">sun</field><field name="subject">solar</field><field name="subject">HR 1817</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001474/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To what extent will the annual number of episodes of acute confusion within a medical unit be reduced following the introduction of high risk indicators and early intervention strategies</field><field name="creator">Moloney, Clint</field><field name="description">This simple quantitative descriptive case controlled research compared cases (subjects at risk for acute confusion) with controls (subjects without the attribute); comparison was made on the exposure to potential contributing factors suspected of causing acute confusion, for example, heavy smoking, or the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day. Case-control studies were also retrospective, because they focused on conditions in the past that might have caused subjects to become cases, rather than controls. The basic purpose of this research design was essentially the same as that of experimental research: to determine the relationships among variables. This report demonstrates that, with relatively good adherence by the nursing team, proactive screening using a structured risk assessment protocol can be successfully implemented for medical patients. This assessment was associated with a statistically significant 50 per cent reduction in the incidence of acute confusion in the intervention group, compared with usual care retrospectively. Reduction in acute confusion was not associated with shortened length of stay, but length of stay was often predetermined by protocol or critical pathway. Correlation analysis demonstrated that risk screening appeared most effective in preventing or reducing acute confusion in patients without preadmission dementia or ADL impairment. In patients with significant preadmission impairment, the stress of hospitalisation may be sufficient to precipitate an episode, despite otherwise optimal management. Less-impaired patients may require additional insults to precipitate acute confusion, some of which are avertable by risk screening and subsequent early intervention. Determined risk indicators were consistent throughout the four year timeframe set for this research project. This demonstrated that although there were multiple patient types presenting to this clinical area, they were consistently the same over a longitudinal timeframe. It meant they were reproducible, which gave this research additional strength. Also, based on the descriptive statistics, this research has shown that in this clinical area where intervention was introduced the combination did have a positive impact on annual numbers of acute confusion. In summary, these findings suggest that without risk screening and the direction for appropriate management the likelihood of an episode can more than double. In the three subgroups expected to pose the greatest challenges for the risk assessment (i.e. those 70 years or older, those with suspected drug dependency, and those with symptomatic infection), risk assessment retained excellent sensitivity, (a) (d) specificity, and relevant correlation with reduction of episodes. This research has demonstrated throughout that high risk screening and associated intervention based on the risk indicator can decrease the annual number of actual episodes of acute confusion. Interventions to prevent or reduce an episode of acute confusion, as outlined by Wakefield (2002) and this research, definitely increases as a result of high risk screening. Beyond doubt, from both the literature reviewed and the findings of this research, is that risk screening does need to be adapted to the individual clinical setting and cannot be generic.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acute confusion</field><field name="subject">correlation analysis</field><field name="subject">medication</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">elderly</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001475/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Storylines and storyspaces: a folio of learnings related to socially-just pedagogies</field><field name="creator">Nayler, Jennifer</field><field name="description">The Thematic Analysis Statement demonstrates the ways in which the various texts included in Storylines and storyspaces: a folio of learnings related to socially-just pedagogies, are linked in a common exploration of socially-just pedagogies.

In Folio Item 2, A research journey: Reflective journal, I explore my own subjectivities and the discourses which led to this study and which shaped the research in particular ways. The journal also explores the ways in which the research journey itself shaped my subjectivities. The largest item of the folio, Pedagogies: Storylines and storyspaces (Folio Item 3, Part A) adopts the genre of teacher professional development materials and consists of theoretical, methodological and practical perspectives related to socially-just pedagogies. This folio item is accompanied by a companion text, Pedagogies: A journal of storylines and storyspaces (Folio Item 3, Part B). The companion text is designed to provide practical support to readers engaged in professional learning associated with the main text. Two papers both written for academic audiences and with similar titles constitute Folio Item 4. These two papers reflect my own learning journey in terms of developing a theoretical framework that resonates with feminist poststructuralism. These texts are all underpinned by feminist poststructural theorising. Each of these texts is considered in relation to three further aspects. First, the ways in which each item addresses the central research questions are explored. Second, each text is examined in terms of its place in relation to the five key stages of the research journey.

Development of the industry has only occurred within the last thirty years, and despite extensive cross-breeding programs with imported breeds, performance of Chinese cattle is low, and the industry is still subject to traditional farming methods. This study looks at the Australian-developed genetic evaluation system BREEDPLAN, which is regarded worldwide as one of the best systems for assisting with selection of beef cattle for increased performance by evaluating genetics and identifying superior animals, and asks if BREEDPLAN can be successfully applied to the Chinese beef industry. Issues discussed include the complementarity of BREEDPLAN to existing Chinese breeding programs and the benefits of BREEDPLAN if introduced, as well as opportunities for Australians to provide consultancy services to facilitate introduction. The marketing of Australian genetic material in China, and cross-cultural marketing issues are also considered. Field research was conducted in China using itinerant interviews and observational research, together with unstructured, informal interviews and discussions with Australian beef industry experts. It is found that breed improvement programs in China are controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture, and management practises within the government-run herds make them eminently suitable for the application of BREEDPLAN. The objective measurements of BREEDPLAN would provide observable genetic gain, resulting in increased industry productivity and profitability. In addition, it is found that a need exists within the Chinese beef industry for consultants not only with expertise and knowledge about BREEDPLAN, but also with an understanding of Chinese language and culture, which would be an advantage for dealing with cross-cultural difficulties. Market opportunities for Australian genetic material are considerable, but not unlimited, and further research is required to assess the size of the market. It is recommended that immediate steps be taken to introduce BREEDPLAN to the Chinese beef industry.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic technology</field><field name="subject">beef</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">BREEDPLAN</field><field name="subject">estimated breeding value (EBV)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001479/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of English language and cultural variations on Korean students in Australian undergraduate programs</field><field name="creator">Park, Sang Soon</field><field name="description">It is well understood by international students that a high level of proficiency in English language is fundamental to successful tertiary level study in English speaking countries. The necessity for cultural adaptation also emerges as a major concern for international students. Despite there being numerous resources for international students, Korean students continue to encounter problems with English, and with some cultural variations in Australian higher education. Reference to literature, as well as anecdotal evidence suggests that Korean students frequently have difficulties adapting to academic programs delivered in English, and to adjusting to some cultural differences in English speaking contexts. This research aimed to the nature of Korean undergraduate students' experiences regarding these academic problems in undergraduate programs in the Southeast region of Queensland. Firstly, it examined traditional methods of English teaching in Korea within the context of the Korean education system. Secondly, it surveyed the suggested 'attitudes towards studying difficulties studying in the English language in Australian undergraduate study programs'. Thirdly, in-depth interviews were conducted as a follow-up investigation to clarify the issues raised through the survey. This research deals with the questions of the main characteristics of Korean students' experiences in learning English as a second language, the best preparations required for them to enter Australian undergraduate programs, the main difficulties of them in adapting to the use of the English language in general and particularly for Australian tertiary level academic purposes, and the critical cross-cultural challenges that they encounter in the Australian undergraduate programs. Finally, based on the results of this study recommendations are made to assist in two major areas: (i) to provide advice to assist Korean students and other international students in their studies in Australia and; (ii) to improve the provision of English language education in Korea.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">Korea</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001480/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The practice of sport psychology: telling tales from the field</field><field name="creator">Patrick, Tom</field><field name="description">The professional practice of sport psychology has received a tremendous amount of attention over the past two decades. Among the various studies and discussions to date, the most desirable and undesirable sport psychology consultant characteristics have been reported (Orlick &amp; Partington, 1987); boundaries for sport science and psychology trained practitioners in applied sport psychology have been suggested (Taylor, 1994); and various models of delivery have been examined (Hardy &amp; Parfitt, 1994). Recently, Andersen (2000) and Tenenbaum (2001) have called for a further examination of the process of sport psychology consultant-athlete interactions. For example, Petitpas, Giges and Danish (1999) identified congruence, empathy and unconditional positive regard as important facilitative conditions in optimizing client-practitioner relationships. Many others have discussed the importance of establishing trust and respect as important factors relating to effective sport psychology service delivery (e.g. Halliwell, Orlick, Ravizza &amp; Rotella, 1999; Ravizza, 2001). In order to further our understanding regarding the process of sport psychology practitioner-athlete interactions, a phenomenological inquiry was conducted in order to examine various lived experiences and associated meanings regarding the practice of sport psychology. The focus of this study was to describe and interpret the socially generated and shared intersubjective meanings operative within the service delivery of applied sport psychology. To this end, various meanings emerged as a result of the study of the practice of sport psychology. First, multiple identities were experienced by the practitioners and these created tensions both within the practitioner and with others in their immediate environment. Second, the practitioners' various roles and related actions were the result of negotiated realities that involved all members associated with their respective communities of practice. Finally, reflexive actions associated with practice occurred as the result of a number of contextual and internal considerations that occurred before, during and after incidents of practice. It was felt that by closely examining the nature of the interactions and individual perceptions of those involved in the process of sport psychology service delivery, a positive contribution could made to the literature pertaining to the practice of sport psychology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sport</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001482/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facing reality: idealism versus conservatism in Australian theatre and politics at the turn of the twenty-first century</field><field name="creator">Payne, Benjamin John</field><field name="description">This dissertation aims to provide an analysis of mainstream Australian playwriting at the turn of the 21st Century. It will argue that mainstream theatre in the 1990s and early 2000s in many ways reflects the concurrent national political developments, in particular the revision of many of the dominant ideals of previous eras, such as those of the sixties. In this dissertation, I will attempt to outline briefly some of the hallmarks of the theatre of the New Wave, and their relation to the broader social movements occurring in Australia at the time. I will trace the beginnings of disillusionment and revising of these ideals in the late seventies and early eighties. The majority of the argument will then discuss the ways in which early nineties theatre engages with and frequently rebuts these earlier ideals, just as nineties politics saw a revision of many of the ideals of the sixties in society as a whole. I will argue that in the latter nineties, mainstream playwrights begin to reverse this conservative shift, reinstating a number of the ideals of the earlier period. I will demonstrate that Australian mainstream theatre at the turn of the century is integrally related to the politics of the society of the time, and that mainstream theatre demonstrates both radical and conservative tendencies through the period under consideration.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theatre</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">playwriting</field><field name="subject">drama</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001484/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring, modelling and understanding the mechanical behaviour of bagasse</field><field name="creator">Plaza, Floran</field><field name="description">In the Australian sugar industry, sugar cane is smashed into a straw like material by hammers before being squeezed between large rollers to extract the sugar juice. The straw like material is initially called prepared cane and then bagasse as it passes through successive roller milling units. The sugar cane materials are highly compressible, have high moisture content, are fibrous, and they resemble some peat soils in both appearance and mechanical behaviour. A promising avenue to improve the performance of milling units for increased throughput and juice extraction, and to reduce costs is by modelling of the crushing process. To achieve this, it is believed necessary that milling models should be able to reproduce measured bagasse behaviour. This investigation sought to measure the mechanical (compression, shear, and volume) behaviour of prepared cane and bagasse, to identify limitations in currently used material models, and to progress towards a material model that can predict bagasse behaviour adequately. Tests were carried out using a modified direct shear test equipment and procedure at most of the large range of pressures occurring in the crushing process. The investigation included an assessment of the performance of the direct shear test for measuring bagasse behaviour. The assessment was carried out using finite element modelling. It was shown that prepared cane and bagasse exhibited critical state behaviour similar to that of soils and the magnitudes of material parameters were determined. The measurements were used to identify desirable features for a bagasse material model. It was shown that currently used material models had major limitations for reproducing bagasse behaviour. A model from the soil mechanics literature was modified and shown to achieve improved reproduction while using magnitudes of material parameters that better reflected the measured values. Finally, a typical three roller mill pressure feeder configuration was modelled. The predictions and limitations were assessed by comparison to measured data from a sugar factory.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sugar cane</field><field name="subject">bagasse</field><field name="subject">compression</field><field name="subject">shearing</field><field name="subject">geometry</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001485/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of school councils in Queensland state primary schools</field><field name="creator">Pointing, Randall John</field><field name="description">In Queensland, all state schools have the opportunity to decide the model of school-based management they would like to adopt for their school communities. For schools wishing to pursue the greatest level of school-based management, School Councils are mandatory. Because School Councils will play an important role as schools become increasingly involved in school-based management, the operations of newly formed Councils were the basis of this research. The main purpose of the study is to determine, through both literature and research, what makes an effective School Council. Although Education Queensland has identified roles and functions, as well as the rationale behind School Councils, clear guidelines to assist Councils with their implementation and to gauge the effectiveness of Councils do not exist. Because School Councils have only been implemented in Queensland for a very short period of time, there has been very little research undertaken on their operations. There are three main stages to this research. First, an extensive literature review explored the theoretical, research and policy developments in relation to school-based management and School Councils. Second, a pilot study was undertaken of an existing School Council that had been in operation for just twelve months. The final and most significant stage of the research involved multi-site case study of three newly formed School Councils, the research being conducted over a twelve-month period to obtain a longitudinal picture of their operations. Two general theoretical frameworks, based on the concepts of change theory and leadership theory, guided the research. Data from the study were analysed within these frameworks and within six focus areas that were identified from the literature and pilot study. These focus areas formed the basis for the development of criteria for the implementation of an effective School Council that were investigated in the three case studies. The focus areas were: 1. promoting the profile of the School Council within the school community; 2. developing well defined roles, responsibilities and functions of the School Council; 3. developing roles and relationships of School Council members; 4. promoting accountability, monitoring and reporting responsibilities; 5. providing training and professional development for all School Council members; and 6. improving the functioning and operations of the School Council. The research was conducted within the qualitative tradition. Specifically, the method adopted was multi-site case study. Data-collection techniques involved questionnaires, interviews with School Council members, observations of Council meetings and an analysis of Council documentation. The findings from the study outlined a number of theoretical understandings and suggested criteria to assist schools in developing a more effective Council, including examples of strategies to support their effective implementation. It is envisaged that the theoretical understandings, the suggested criteria and specific examples will be of benefit to other schools where School Councils are being formed by providing them with a structure that will assist in the beginning stages of the Council's operation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school councils</field><field name="subject">primary school</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">accountability</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">community involvement</field><field name="subject">devolution</field><field name="subject">educational governance</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">school-based management</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001487/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School leadership and cognitive interests: the development of a leadership framework based on Habermas' theory of knowledge-constitutive interests</field><field name="creator">Quong, Terrence Edward</field><field name="description">This dissertation reports on an exploration of school leadership from the perspective of how school leaders bring multiple cognitive interests to bear in their leadership practice.

Ethnographic techniquess were used for this study, with data collected through interviews, observation and questionnaires. Interviews were conducted with four PNs and four GPs in practices that employed nurses in an increased role similar to that described in the Nursing in General Practice Fact Sheets (Royal College of Nursing Australia, 2002). Two practices were observed to identify work practices and the nurses' interaction within the practice. The main finding of the study was the importance placed on the general practice team. Both GPs and PNs believed that working as a team was vital. They indicated that working together provided holistic care and enabled the practice to provide quality care. The role of the PN in this study was consistent with other studies in Australia. However, the nurses in this study appeared to have more autonomy in regard to care of people with chronic illness and the aged. Continuing education was considered important for the further development of the PN role. However, participants believed that the PN also needed to have considerable and varied experience together with good people skills. To further develop the PN role innovative ways of providing education to PNs should be investigated to ensure nurses have the necessary skills to undertake their role. Payment issues in general practice should also be examined and addressed to ensure that PNs are able to be employed, and receive remuneration appropriate for their experience and job description.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">practice nurse (PN)</field><field name="subject">general practitioner (GP)</field><field name="subject">health care</field><field name="subject">medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001489/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurses' perceptions of their preparation for beginning professional practice: an evaluative study</field><field name="creator">Reilly, Roslyn Corinne</field><field name="description">It is now twenty years since the Federal Government mandated the transfer of nurse education to the tertiary sector. The conflict surrounding the issue of educational preparation for entry to professional nursing practice remains, supported by the oft-repeated comment that "graduates should hit the ground running". Student nurses/graduates are key stakeholders in nursing education and their perceptions are a valuable source of information as they experience the Bachelor of Nursing Program. To contribute to the body of knowledge, this evaluative study focused on the perceptions of students/graduates in relation to their preparation for beginning professional practice. Illuminative evaluation, supported by a qualitative interpretive approach, constructivist learning theory and a quantitative approach, was used to help understand and describe how students/graduates constructed ideas about their preparation for beginning professional practice. Data were collected from the participants in two stages, before and after the completion of the Bachelor of Nursing program, using questionnaires, open-ended questions, documentary information, reflective writings and semi-structured interviews. The participants for both Stages were drawn from the same student cohort. Following thematic analysis of the data it emerged that ninety-nine percent of the participants believed they were adequately prepared for beginning professional practice at an advanced beginner level. The study highlights that context is an important factor in relation to learning and that the theory/practice gap is a natural phenomenon in the learning process. Students experience difficulty in transferring knowledge and skills from one context to another. Also, a real tension exists between preparing a well educated nurse and preparing a practitioner who, on graduation, will not be fully prepared to deal with all the complexities and diversities of the nursing practice setting. Nurse clinicians, administrators and academics have a responsibility to ensure beginning practitioners are prepared for beginning professional practice at an advanced beginning level.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurse</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001491/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inquiry into a transformative approach to professional development for online educators</field><field name="creator">Reushle, Shirley</field><field name="description">This study investigates professional development for online educators within a transformative learning framework. A qualitative, action research method was adopted that captured data from interactions between the researcher and participants, and which allowed the generation of theory that could guide future design efforts. The project was conducted online from Australia during 2002 and 2003 with two groups of participants drawn from a Singapore polytechnic. Data were analysed utilising content analysis of transcripts, interviews, and observations, with the researcher being an active participant in the project. The findings which differentiated online from traditional educational contexts, and which therefore are significant in terms of future design considerations were that since interactions were all text-based and visible, participants were careful to provide reasoned, reflective contributions. Furthermore, the archived interactions were available for inspection by all participants, giving rise to more articulate and constructive dialogues while maintaining evidence of the human "presence". Other findings related to supporting an online community of adult learners by recognising the individuality of each learner and their specific needs in terms of their experience, need for relevance and flexibility in the learning activity, and valuing the sense of human connectivity. Offering of peer support through a peer learning partnership model was found to be an effective way for learners to support each other in a trusting, respectful, empathetic, non-threatening manner. Findings indicated that the provision of exemplars, or models of good practice, supported situated, authentic activity, and contributed to positive, motivated learners. The dynamic (constantly changing, growing, adapting) nature of the Internet required facilitators to be continually evaluating the learning situation in order to promote and nurture an atmosphere that supported the development of new ideas, the challenging of old, the exploration of alternatives, and support for changes in perspective and action. Evidence suggested that the use of the Internet for learning and teaching could go some way towards addressing the challenges of prejudice, discrimination, and celebrate the notion of difference. From these findings, the literature, and the personal experience of the researcher, ten design principles were formulated and, if considered in light of local contextual characteristics, offer a framework for transformative approaches to professional development for online educators. Further research to address the application of this framework to other discipline areas, and other educational settings, is recommended.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001494/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The beliefs of first year Japanese university students towards the learning of English</field><field name="creator">Riley, Paul Anthony</field><field name="description">In the field of second and foreign language learning, beliefs, as one of the affective factors, remain relatively unexplored. Failure to address unrealistic student beliefs and expectations may increase student anxiety (Truitt, 1995; Young, 1991), hinder progress, and ultimately lead to a breakdown in learning (Ellis, 1996; Horwitz, 1985, 1987, 1988; Mantle-Bromley, 1995; Peacock, 1999). This study investigates the beliefs about language learning of first year university students in Japan, employing the Japanese language questionnaire developed by Sakui and Gaies (1999). Two student discussion groups were also formed to provide further data. In addition to describing student beliefs, the study explores differences between student beliefs and teacher beliefs, change in student beliefs during a course of study, and relationships between student beliefs and second language proficiency. A total of 661 first year students, and 34 of their class teachers, participated in this study, at a private Japanese university, between April 2002 and January 2003. Data were analysed using Pearson correlation, Cronbach&#8217;s alpha, t-tests, and a principal components factor analysis. The students in the study appear to hold a variety of beliefs, to varying degrees. Significant differences were found between student responses and teacher responses for more than half of the questionnaire items, with the four main areas of difference relating to translation, error correction, the difficulty of language learning, and motivation. In terms of belief change, significant differences were found in student responses to almost a quarter of the questionnaire items between two administrations in April and December, 2002. Some differences were also identified between the beliefs of students based on their proficiency scores, but the results here are inconclusive. This study contributes to the growing understanding of the role of beliefs in language learning. Further studies of other student groups, at other institutions in Japan, will enable a comparison of results to help produce a clearer picture of the beliefs and expectations about language learning of students at Japanese universities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">university student</field><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">Horwitz</field><field name="subject">beliefs about language learning inventory (BALLI)</field><field name="subject">Kuntz-Rifkin instrument</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001495/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature and extent of internet-enabled e-business adoption by Australian wineries, and factors affecting this adoption</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Barbara</field><field name="description">This research investigates the nature and extent of e-business adoption by Australian wineries in order to describe the activity and increase understanding of the factors influencing the behaviour. Pilot study interviews grounded the research and provided industry-based direction for the survey. A census survey of the 2003 population of Australian wineries, excluding micro-wineries, used a self-administered mail questionnaire. Response rate varied by winery size, from 15% of small wineries up to 46% of very large wineries. Data was collected in five e-business process domains: e-mail, external web sites, and winery B2C web sites, extranets, and intranets; on perceptions of influence of four factors in each process domain: 1) relative advantage, 2) resource capacity, 3) supply chain activity, and 4) government activity; and on barriers to further adoption. Analysis of the survey responses supported the proposition that the nature and extent of adoption varies significantly by winery size. In general, small wineries find less benefit than larger wineries. Customer type and level of customer power also vary by winery size with winery B2C web strategies differing as a result. The proposition that the factors influencing e-business adoption vary between different types of e-business was also supported. This finding indicates that customised frameworks for particular e-business process domains will have increased relevance, and generalisations regarding the level of influence individual factors have on e-business adoption per se are inappropriate. Influence from the activities of supply chain and government organisations, the subject of the third and fourth propositions, was also found. The impact level of these external environment factors increased with winery size. In particular it is the powerful business customers and the Australian Government that drive some of the e-business adoption by wineries. Criticism of low levels of adoption by Australian small and medium sized enterprises in government funded reports appears harsh when applied to small and medium wineries after findings demonstrate that they derive less benefit from e-business than larger wineries. Reduction of the most common barriers to increasing adoption - the high cost and low quality of network connections in regional locations &#8211; remains the responsibility of government.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-business</field><field name="subject">winery</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">online technology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001496/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Southeast Asia: moving beyond the construction of a mascent security community?</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Christopher</field><field name="description">This study applies Deutsch&#8217;s security community framework to the states of Southeast Asia in order to assess whether or not, as at September 2002, there exist dependable expectations of peaceful change. The study has three primary goals. The first is to develop the framework so it may better reflect the realities of interstate and communal relations in Southeast Asia. The second is to assess whether or not Southeast Asia has in fact moved beyond the construction of a nascent security community where there exists adequate empirical evidence to suggest a future sustainable course towards &#8216;dependable expectations of peaceful change&#8217;. The third seeks to analyse the potential for Southeast Asia, as a community of states, to evolve to the higher tiers of integration and be characterised as a mature security community, where disputes between states and state-elites will be resolved without recourse to violence. In investigating these tasks, the dissertation considers a broad range of issues, including (but not limited to): the multilateral security frameworks embracing the region; the impact of ethnic and religious tensions as well as non-traditional security issues (with a focus here on narcotics and piracy); and the impact of terrorism and the recent economic crisis on the normative behaviours and ideologies of state elites throughout the region. It is found that while a substantial degree of interaction, integration and cooperation has developed in Southeast Asia, these developments have been insufficient to alleviate a number of traditional security issues and tensions (such as border and territorial conflicts). Consequently, there exists only a transient sense of expectations of peaceful change throughout Southeast Asia and this level of integration is characterised by the dissertation to represent nothing more than the embryonic phase of a security community&#8217;s evolution.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">security</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">south-east asia</field><field name="subject">ASEAN</field><field name="subject">Asia-Pacific economic cooperation (APEC)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001497/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caring connections: a practical way to both show and teach caring in nursing</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Lorna</field><field name="description">Hospital care is changing, - dominated by the dollar and technology and the patient is taking second place. Nursing, traditionally known as being a caring profession, is not exempt from the changes and the traditional entrance interview to find caring students has been replaced by a computerised system. Graduates from university programs are being branded as non-caring. This research sought to find practical ways in which nurses showed caring to patients, and to develop a framework which could be used to teach and cultivate caring attributes in undergraduate students. A broad sweep of the past was taken to show how, dominated by disease and the necessity to take care of the suffering and infirm, nursing has been inextricably linked to the inability of science to cure. The discussion on the impact of the Therapeutic Revolution and a health care system, dominated by the dollar, places nursing and caring in perspective. Some philosophical, religious and psychological notions of caring were briefly explored. A participative paradigm underpins this research which uses a collaborative inquiry cyclical and reflective process of three phases. In Phase I a group of Graduate Registered Nurses reflected on the enacted/strategies/skills that were used to show caring to patients. Six key enactments were elicited from the total of 64 reflections that were submitted. Phase II constructed a framework that could be used to teach caring, which was then critiqued by an expert group of educators. Phase III returned to Phases I and II and used a process of reflection-on-reflection and a new emergent meaning of caring in nursing ensued. As a result of this reflection-on-reflection, a reconfiguration of the framework resulted in the development of the Care Connections model.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">hospital care</field><field name="subject">registered nurse (RN)</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001498/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emergence of the 'Jiang Zemin Era': legitimacy and the development of the political theory of 'Neo-Conservatism' -- 1989-1995</field><field name="creator">Rolls, David</field><field name="description">This research addresses the establishment of the 'Jiang Zemin Era' whereby Jiang Zemin, and the Chinese Communist Party, have attempted to relegitimise the Party and have attempted to make the Party meaningful to the Chinese populace. What is fundamental to this research is how Jiang Zemin, as the &#8216;core leader&#8217; of the third generational leadership, incorporated the political thought of neo-conservatism (xin baoshouzhuyi) into the framework of Marxist-Leninist-Mao Zedong Thought (MLM) ideology in order to re-legitimise the CCP. The timeframe within the research is from Jiang&#8217;s appointment as the General Secretary of the CCP in 1989 until 1995. It is important that this was a time period whereby Jiang had to consolidate, and therefore legitimise, his &#8216;core leadership&#8217;, and provide a theoretical platform in order to bring forth his own &#8216;era&#8217;. The research is predominantly a historiographical narrative, utilising both primary and secondary sources, that examines the mechanisms Jiang utilised in order to create a strong government, with himself as the &#8216;core&#8217;, which pursued increased levels of marketisation. Indeed, after being appointed General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 1989, Jiang Zemin had to achieve two goals in order to sustain and legitimate his position as &#8216;the core of the third generational leadership&#8217;. First, he had to secure his position as &#8216;the core&#8217; through the creation of secured networks and alliances as well as legitimise of his &#8216;informal&#8217; and &#8216;formal&#8217; positions in the CCP hierarchy. In order to achieve this, Jiang had to first create a sustainable power base in order to retain, and therefore legitimise, his formalized positions as General Secretary of the CCP, Chairman of the Chinese Military Commission and the Presidency. In addition, he needed to be able to create alliances with both allies and prot&#233;g&#233;s as well as differing power factions, be they conservative/elder or reformist, and with other leading figures like Li Peng and Zhu Rongji. Second, in order to further reinforce and legitimize his position as &#8216;the core&#8217;, Jiang had to develop his own &#8216;theoretical framework&#8217; for governing the country &#8211; much as Mao and Deng had done previously. Therefore, the research also examines Jiang&#8217;s usage of the neoconservatism as a means of not only legitimising the CCP&#8217;s ideological framework but also as a means of providing his own &#8216;guiding thought&#8217;, thus enabling him to establish his own &#8216;era&#8217;. Indeed, after establishing himself as the &#8216;core&#8217; through the aforementioned processes, Jiang had to develop such a theoretical framework that complimented Deng&#8217;s economic reforms, especially as he was designated by Deng, yet one that retained a smattering of Mao Zedong&#8217;s &#8216;Thoughts&#8217; that could be applied pragmatically during the 1990s. It can be seen that Jiang Zemin successfully incorporated the political thought of &#8216;neo-conservatism&#8217; within his platform in order to achieve these ends &#8211; including the establishment of a &#8216;Jiang Zemin Era&#8217;. This political thought, a successor to the political theory of &#8216;neo-authoritarianism&#8217;, already had several adherents within the higher echelons of the CCP. Indeed, it would be Jiang&#8217;s 1995 speech, entitled &#8216;Stressing Politics&#8217;, that would signify the incorporation of neo-conservatism within Jiang&#8217;s platform of (self) legitimation that would initiate the successful implementation of a &#8216;Jiang Zemin Era&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jiang Zemin era</field><field name="subject">neo-conservatism</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001500/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of factors influencing Bruneian secondary teachers' use of information and communication technology in teaching: a survey exploration</field><field name="creator">Salleh, Sallimah Hj. Mohd.</field><field name="description">Examining teachers' attitudes/perceptions and their influence on behaviour can be an important step in understanding the psychosocial factors affecting teachers' use of Information and Communication Technology in teaching. This study attempted to provide such an understanding by elaborating Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour (TPB), a widely applied psychosocial theory in modeling behaviours. Basically, TPB explains a behaviour as a consequence of attitude towards the behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. These three direct factors of TPB are, in turn, influenced by salient beliefs or indirect factors: behavioural, normative, and control beliefs, respectively. In this study, the TPB was modified by (1) decomposing each of the three types of beliefs into two dimensions respectively, and (2) incorporating external variables &#8211; age, sex, subject taught, teaching experience, teaching period, qualification, level of class, classroom access, and computer laboratory access. Using these predictor variables, an Information and Communication Technology Use Model (ICTUM) was developed for assessment and comparison in performance with the TPB. Using a survey questionnaire, data were collected from a total of 1,040 secondary school teachers in eighteen government schools in Negara Brunei Darussalam. Structural equation modeling, using AMOS 5.0 software, was employed as the major statistical analytic technique for a series of data analyses: measurement model assessment for validity and reliability tests; and assessments of the models, ICTUM and TPB. The proposed model, ICTUM, was found to fit only marginally and the modification efforts through beliefs decomposition and external variables incorporation provided only a small increase in the amounts of variance explained by the predictor variables. However, the TPB model of direct factors was found to be a good-fitting model showing attitude towards behaviour, and perceived behavioural control; as predictors of intention; and intention as a stronger predictor of use of ICT than perceived behavioural control. By demonstrating the significance of those factors as predictors of intention and use of ICT, this study suggests that augmenting teachers' positive attitudes towards the use of ICT and supporting them technically and personally could encourage teachers to increase the use of ICT in their teaching. This study also suggested a need for future research on the direct influence of salient beliefs on intention, and behaviour (use of ICT) respectively. Although the TPB model is theoretically and statistically justifiable, further testing with different samples is required. Through its use of a theoretical and statistical modeling approach, the current study represents an initial step towards uncovering fundamental mechanisms that explain teacher use of ICT in teaching.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school</field><field name="subject">Brunei</field><field name="subject">information and communication technology (ICT)</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">Ajzen's theory</field><field name="subject">demographic</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001505/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechatronic bakery</field><field name="creator">Schultz, Bradley Jason</field><field name="description">Large-scale bread bakeries generally exist as &#8216;Islands of Control&#8217; - a long line of processes interrelated, but not interconnected in terms of their control systems.

Existing commercial pressure transducers are expensive and they provide a spatial resolution only on the order of millimetres. The full bandwidth of commercial devices (which extends to around 200 kHz) can only be utilised by exposing the transducer to the flow environment with very little thermal or mechanical protection. If insufficient protection is provided, the expensive commercial devices are likely to be damaged. Inexpensive pressure sensors based on extrinsic Fabry-Perot fibre optic interferometry are capable of measurement with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Thermal protection or isolation for these sensors is still required, but they can be exposed directly to the flow if the sensors are disposable (low cost). Excessive thermal or mechanical protection is not required for these sensors because the damaging heat transfer and particle impacts that may occur in transient aerodynamic facilities generally occur after the useful test flow. In this dissertation, a variety of construction techniques for diaphragm-based Fabry-Perot fibre optic pressure sensors were investigated and the advantages and disadvantages of all techniques are compared. The results indicate that using a zirconia ferrule as the substrate, a liquid adhesive as the bonding layer, and a polished copper foil as the diaphragm provide the best results. It is demonstrated that a spatial resolution on the order of 0.1 mm and a bandwidth to more than 100 kHz can be achieved with such constructions. A variety of problems such as hysteresis, response irregularity, low visibility and sensor non-repeatability were observed. By using a thinner bonding layer, a larger bonding area, longer cavity length, increased calibration period, and applying load cycling to the diaphragm, the hysteresis was minimized. Sensor response irregularity was also minimized using a polished diaphragm. Visibility increased to about 90% using active control of the cavity length during the construction process. Non-repeatability was found to be a consequence of adhesive viscoelasticity and this effect was minimized using a thin layer of adhesive to bond the diaphragm to the substrate. Due to the effects of adhesive viscoelasticity, the pressure sensors indicate an error of up to 10% of mean value for the reflected shock pressure. This error could not be further reduced in the current sensors configuration. Some new configurations are proposed to decrease the effect of sensor non-repeatability. The effect of pretensioning the diaphragm was investigated analytically but the results do not indicate any considerable advantage for the levels of pretension likely to be achieved in practice. However, the results do indicate that pretension effects caused by an environmental temperature change can damage the sensor during storage. The effect of the initial diaphragm deflection on the sensor performance and temperature sensitivity was modelled and the results show that an initial diaphragm deflection can improve the sensor performance. The effect of the thermal isolation layer on the sensor performance was also investigated and the results show that for a shock tube diaphragm bursting pressure ratio up to 5.7, heat transfer does not contribute to sensor errors for the first millisecond after shock reflection. However, it was found that the use of a thin layer of low viscosity grease can protect the sensor for about 20 ms while only decreasing its natural frequency by typically 17%. The grease layer was also found to decrease the settling time of a low damping ratio sensor by 40%. The sensor was successfully employed to identify an acoustic disturbance in a shock tube.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fibre optic</field><field name="subject">transient aerodynamic</field><field name="subject">pressure transducer</field><field name="subject">sensors</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001509/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dermatological and musculoskeletal disorders of nursing home workers in Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Smith, Derek Richard</field><field name="description">Although skin disease and musculoskeletal disorders are believed to be common among nursing home workers, to date there have been no coordinated international studies of these occupational issues. Therefore, it was considered appropriate to conduct one of the first cross-cultural investigations of occupational dermatology and ergonomic complaints among nursing home workers in Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan using a standardised methodology. This thesis documents a 4-year investigation of skin disease and musculoskeletal disorders conducted among 465 nursing home staff in Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Skin diseases were diagnosed by specialist physicians during medical examinations, while information on musculoskeletal disorders was collected by means of a self-reported questionnaire. There were major differences in both the location and type of skin disease between the 4 groups. Overall, the Australian group suffered a generally higher prevalence of skin disease than in the other three countries investigated, most likely due to their significantly higher rate of sun-induced skin damage. The high prevalence of cutaneous fungal disease seen within the Taiwanese subjects most probably arose from the comparatively higher temperature and relative humidity of Taiwan. Other potentially important skin disease risk factors included previous skin disease and a history of allergy, both of which are consistent with current knowledge. Although musculoskeletal disorders were found to be most prevalent among the Japanese nursing home staff at almost all body sites, the reasons for this are not clear. It may have related to a generally higher musculoskeletal rate, or a higher degree of self-reporting on their questionnaires. Individual MSD risk factors included moving patients, washing patients, working as an assistant nurse and daily alcohol consumption. Interestingly, MSD was found to be a co-factor for current skin disease. Overall, this study indicated that certain occupational health issues consistently affect nursing home staff in the 4 countries, but the prevalence and rank order varies from nation to nation. It was also shown that nursing home work incurs a reasonable degree of risk and that skin disease and musculoskeletal disorders are important occupational issues within these facilities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dermatology</field><field name="subject">musculoskeletal disorder</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">skin</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">South Korea</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">disease</field><field name="subject">occupational health issue</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001510/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Process studies of odour emissions from effluent ponds using machine-based odour measurement</field><field name="creator">Sohn, Jae Ho</field><field name="description">Odours caused by intensive piggery operations have become a major environmental issue in the piggery industry in Australia. Effluent ponds are the major source of odours in typical piggeries. It is assumed that the odour emissions from ponds are mainly driven by pond loading rate. However, there are few data to corroborate this concept. Allied to this is the need for a convenient and low cost method of odour measurement, which can be used as an alternative method for current olfactometry. The present odour measurement methods using olfactometry is time-consuming, expensive and often impractical because of its fundamental problem of using subjective human panels. In addition, one of the major problems in odour measurement lies in the air sampling method. Wind tunnels have been accepted as a preferred method for the sampling of odour from area sources. However, current wind tunnels do not consider meteorological factors, which directly affect the odour emission rates. A machine-based odour quantification method and a novel wind tunnel were developed and evaluated in this Ph D study. These methods were then used in a demonstration trial to investigate the effects of pond loading rate on odour emissions. The AromaScan A32S electronic nose, and an artificial neural network were used to develop the machine based odour quantification method. The sensor data analysed by the AromaScan were used to train an ANN, to correlate the responses to the actual odour concentration provided by a human olfactometry panel. Preprocessing techniques and different network architectures were evaluated through network simulation to find an optimal artificial neural network model. The simulation results showed that the two-layer back-propagation neural network can be trained to predict piggery odour concentrations correctly with a low mean squared error. The trained ANN was able to predict the odour concentration of nine unknown air samples with a value for the coefficient of correlation, r2 of 0.59. A novel wind tunnel was developed for odour sampling. The USQ wind tunnel was designed to have a capability to control wind speed and airflow rate. The tunnel was evaluated in terms of the aerodynamics of the airflow inside the tunnel, nd the gas recovery efficiency rate, in order to further improve the performance of the wind tunnel. The USQ wind tunnel showed that sample recovery efficiencies ranging from 61.7 to 106.8%, while the average result from the entire trial was 81.1%. The optimal sample recovery efficiency of the tunnel was observed to be 88.9% from statistical analysis. Consequently, it can be suggested that the tunnel will give estimates of the odour emission rate with significant level of precision. However, the tunnel needs to be calibrated to compensate for the error caused by different airflow rates and odour emission rates. In addition, the installation of a perforated baffle upstream of the sampling section was suggested to improve its performance. To investigate the relationship between the pond loading rate and odour emission rate, replicable experimental studies were conducted using a novel experimental facility and the machine based odour quantification method. The experimental facility consisted of reactor vessels to simulate the operation of effluent ponds and the USQ wind tunnel for odour sampling. A strong relationship between organic loading rate (OLR) and physical and chemical parameters was observed except pH and NH3-N. The pH was not affected by OLR due to the buffering capacity of piggery effluent. EC and COD were suggested as indicators to estimate the operating condition of the piggery effluent ponds because the regression results show that these two parameters can be predicted accurately by OLR. The time averaged odour emission rates from the reactor vessels showed a strong relationship with OLR. Consequently, it can be concluded that heavily loaded effluent ponds would produce more odours. The effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) was examined. The HRT was increased from 30 days to 60 days, resulting in a significant decrease in odour emission rates from the reactor vessels. This decrease ranged from 59.1% to 54.9%, with an average of 57.1%. Therefore, it can be concluded that the increasing HRT will decrease the odour emission rate. This trial confirmed the value of the project methodology in obtaining unambiguous data on odour emission processes. However, more data are required for a wider range of OLR, HRT and other pertained variables before a usable model can be formulated.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effluent ponds</field><field name="subject">odour</field><field name="subject">emissions</field><field name="subject">piggery</field><field name="subject">AromaScan</field><field name="subject">aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">gas</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001511/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vivo evaluation of immunomodulatory properties of crude extracts of Echinacea species and fractions isolated from Echinacea Purpurea</field><field name="creator">Spence, Katherine Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the in vivo evaluation of orally administered extracts of Echinacea species, and fractions obtained from Echinacea purpurea for specific immunostimulatory function induced in Balb/c mice by immunization with microbial vaccines.

The second vaccine was a commercial acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) consisting of inactivated diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and native or inactivated virulence factors of Bordetella pertussis (the etiological agent of whooping cough) which is known to induce a humoral immune response but with controversial reports about performance in the induction of cell-mediated immunity.

The phytochemical profile of the ethanolic extracts of Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea pallida, Echinacea angustifolia and one commercial product "Echinacea Triplex" and three fractions prepared from Echinacea purpurea, namely polysaccharides, phenolics and alkylamides, was determined by thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography and/or by chemical analytical techniques. Statistically significant increases in specific anti-Salmonella typhimurium serum antibody were obtained for the Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea angustifolia and Echinacea Triplex [Trade Mark] treatment groups, and also for groups receiving treatment with fractions obtained from Echinacea purpurea, namely, polysaccharide, alkylamide and phenolic fractions. Statistically significant increases in the anti-B pertussis serum antibodies were also obtained in the young Echinacea Triplex [Trade Mark] group vaccinated with the DTaP vaccine. Significant enhancement of serum interleukin-12 titres was observed in the Echinacea Triplex [Trade Mark] as well as the phenolic fraction treatment groups which were vaccinated with killed Salmonella typhimurium vaccine. Of the groups vaccinated with the DTaP vaccine, only Echinacea Triplex [Trade Mark] displayed statistically significant increases in mean interleukin-12 titre compared to the placebo in both young and old groups, however Echinacea purpurea, and Echinacea angustifolia both displayed significant increases in mean interleukin-12 titre in the young treatment mice. Increases in interferon-gamma levels in mice orally dosed with phenolic, polysaccharide or alkylamide fractions of Echinacea purpurea and vaccinated with the killed Salmonella typhimurium vaccine were also observed, however these need to be repeated for confirmation, and statistical analysis.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Echinacea Purpurea</field><field name="subject">immunisation</field><field name="subject">herb</field><field name="subject">in vivo</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001512/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New fibre-reinforced polymer box beam: investigation of static behaviour</field><field name="creator">Springolo, Mario</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses the development of a new type of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) beam for use in civil engineering systems. After a detailed evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of current FRP beam technology, a different approach is proposed which combines traditional laminates with a novel casting technique. To pre-dimension the beam, the classical beam theory is adapted to allow for FRP materials. The resulting formulae were used to determine critical parameters, such as laminate thickness and location in the cross-section, and core dimensions, and to identify failure modes. Based on the results of this analytical study, a detailed testing program was developed. In addition to classical tests, such as bending, shear, and lateral torsion, the performance of the beam was also examined under particular loading regimes specifically designed to induce local failure modes, such as buckling of the web and bearing failure of the section under concentrated loads. The experimental results revealed very good agreement with the analytical predictions. These results were corroborated by a detailed non-linear finite-element analysis, including core cracking and laminate damage. This analysis, in particular, highlighted the synergy between bending and shear behaviour of the beam. This study has revealed that this new type of FRP beam behaves in a predictable manner. Furthermore, the experimental results verified that the cross-section, which combines traditional laminates with cast polymer concrete, did not suffer from many of the disadvantages identified in current FRP beams. The cracking of the polymer concrete under shear, however, does cause the beam to fail prior to the laminates reaching their ultimate shear stress.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP)</field><field name="subject">beam</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">buckling</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001513/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brief encounters: end of life decision-making in critical care</field><field name="creator">Sundin-Huard, Deborah</field><field name="description">The health care system has, in many respects, been developed to oppose suffering. Yet health care&#8217;s almost compulsive urge to treat death as the enemy and to battle disease and injury with all available technology unavoidably results in suffering for someone. This paradox and its impact upon the decision-makers in critical care, has attracted some interest overseas, but none to date in Australia. This study sought to understand the interactions between the key stakeholders in end-of-life decision-making in critical care in the interests of developing strategies to ameliorate the avoidable suffering arising from these processes. A modification of Denzin&#8217;s Interpretive Interactionism (Denzin, 1989), was developed to apply the epistemological and ontological principles of the critical paradigm while preserving the advantages of Denzin&#8217;s design in the investigation of interactions. Semi-structured interviews with relatives, nurses and doctors from a variety of critical care units in South-East Queensland and New South Wales, provided the data that enriches this study. Using the critical lens, analysis focussed on the interactions (and gaps and silences) between the decision-makers at the key moments of decision-making: initiation, maintenance or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. A model of 'best practice' with respect to end-of-life decision-making was produced and concrete recommendations made. This project has found that the amelioration of avoidable suffering in the critical care environment related to end-of-life decision-making requires policy and procedural changes at the organisational level.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health care</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">brain death</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001514/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of business networks in the AusIndustry business network program</field><field name="creator">Sweeting, Barbara</field><field name="description">Researchers have found that inter-firm collaboration, that is, co-operative business networks, can provide a competitive advantage that would not be possible independently for small sized firms. Work has been done by some governments, for example, Danish, Norwegian, New Zealand, American and Japanese, in the area of policy and practice of business networks because they have realised the importance of business networking and have encouraged collaboration of small firms by assisting in the facilitation of networks. The Australian government established a Business Network Program which ran for four years and several studies were completed on various aspects of the program during that period. However, there had been no particular research that examined the success or other outcomes of these networks, thus providing the basis for the research question addressed in this research: How and why did the business networks developed in the AusIndustry Business Networks Program, succeed or not succeed? Further, questions relating to how and why these outcomes may have occurred or how they may have been measured in the Australian government facilitated program were also unanswered. A review of the extant literature in this area established the theoretical foundations upon which this research is based and made possible the development of a model comprising three constructs or research issues that would address the research question: RI 1: How and why is network success evaluated? RI 2: How and why do the internal and external environments affect the outcomes of the network? RI 3: How does facilitation affect the network? In order to address these research issues and the research question, a protocol was developed and case study interviews with the lead business of sixteen networks participating in the AusIndustry Business Network Program were carried out. The resultant data was compared for each of the research issues through a qualitative methodology from which conclusions and answers to the research question and issues were derived. The results of this research showed that network members evaluated their own outcomes often using multiple measures, both qualitative and quantitative, with the most common criteria being whether the network continued or discontinued. Moreover, it was concluded in this research that successful networks usually had a single goal or purpose for joining a network which they ultimately achieved. In contrast the unsuccessful networks generally joined the network with multiple goals and which were not all achieved, thus contributing to their lack of success. This result was not evident in the literature reviewed in chapter 2. Additionally, the findings showed that high levels of trust, commitment and reciprocity were essential elements in the success of business networks. More importantly this study found that whilst all successful networks had these elements, some of the non successful ones also reported high levels of trust, commitment and reciprocity. Thus it appeared in this study that whilst these elements are important for network success, they do not alone ensure that success, further, it was noted that for any network that reported a lack of any one of these elements, non success was more likely. In relation to this finding was the discovery that in these networks formal contracts between the network members increased the levels of commitment and reciprocity and thus increased the chances of success. When external environmental factors were examined in relation to their impact on network success, it was found that whilst all had some impact on their business generally, competition was noted as having the highest impact and government or legal issues the lowest impact. Finally, this research found that facilitation did not necessarily contribute to a network&#8217;s success but that possible a lack of appropriate facilitation style did contribute to the non-success of networks. However, it was clear that the small networks needed less facilitator guidance overall and that the larger networks definitely needed facilitation and guidance. Moreover, it was found that the type of facilitation at the various stages of the network process were more important to the likelihood of success, rather than the mere presence of a facilitator. Thus, the main contribution of this theory building research is to extend the general level of knowledge about business networks and provide new insights into network theory and the value of networks using an original application of existing knowledge. This knowledge can contribute to network education and training in business schools and can contribute to the development of future government policy and practice pertaining to network programs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business</field><field name="subject">networks</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">economics</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">competition</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001516/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ethical nature of the mother-midwife relationship: a feminist perspective</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Faye E.</field><field name="description">This research explored the ethical nature of the mother-midwife relationship in order to refine our understanding of the place of ethics in the context of everyday midwifery practice &#8211; the practice of &#8216;being with woman&#8217; in childbirth. The ethics explicitly available to midwives are derived from practices such as moral philosophy and bioethics, whose ethical frameworks are reductionist in their exclusion of context and relationship. Given that the midwifery profession is currently promoting a model of practice built on partnership and relationship, existing codes and frameworks are examined for their adequacy. An assumption of the study was that a distinctive midwifery ethic was implicitly available in the lived realities and shared engagement of mothers and midwives, embedded in practice. Conceptual theoretical research methodology facilitated exploration of the taken-for-granted assumptions of established theory, official policies such as Codes, and the profession&#8217;s literature. Feminist-constructivist theory formed the epistemological basis for gaining insight into the implicit ethics of midwifery. Personal narratives of mothers and midwives were analysed and interpreted for meaning, and transcripts returned to participants for validation. These constructed meanings were then compared and contrasted with those explicit in Codes and current literature. The central theme to emerge from the narratives was the use and abuse of power in relationships. Other major themes were institutional dominance consistently used to describe the status quo, values conflict especially linked to workplace/service provider versus personal/professional midwifery ethics, and the ethical adequacy of a &#8216;being with woman&#8217; relationship. Findings indicate that midwifery does need a different ethic to that of bioethics and problem-solving principlism, and that such a new ethic would look like those promoted by feminist-virtue ethics. The latter not only redress the politics of the existing hegemonic maternity services system, but they also place women&#8217;s concerns central to practice and deliberation. The aspirations, values and lived reality of mothers and midwives, and the commitment of the professional-friend midwife to the particularity of the birthing woman, are the focus of a reconstructed ethic for midwifery practice, an ethic which reunites morality and personal interest. Implications and recommendations are discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">midwifery</field><field name="subject">maternity</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001517/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulating the flow of some non-Newtonian fluids with neural-like networks and stochastic processes</field><field name="creator">Tran-Canh, Dung</field><field name="description">The thesis reports a contribution to the development of neural-like network- based element-free methods for the numerical simulation of some non-Newtonian fluid flow problems. The numerical approximation of functions and solution of the governing partial differential equations are mainly based on radial basis function networks. The resultant micro-macroscopic approaches do not require any element-based discretisation and only rely on a set of unstructured collocation points and hence are truly meshless or element-free. The development of the present methods begins with the use of the multi-layer perceptron networks (MLPNs) and radial basis function networks (RBFNs) to effectively eliminate the volume integrals in the integral formulation of fluid flow problems. An adaptive velocity gradient domain decomposition (AVGDD) scheme is incorporated into the computational algorithm. As a result, an improved feed forward neural network boundary-element-only method (FFNN- BEM) is created and verified. The present FFNN-BEM successfully simulates the flow of several Generalised Newtonian Fluids (GNFs), including the Carreau, Power-law and Cross models. To the best of the author's knowledge, the present FFNN-BEM is the first to achieve convergence for difficult flow situations when the power-law indices are very small (as small as 0.2). Although some elements are still used to discretise the governing equations, but only on the boundary of the analysis domain, the experience gained in the development of element-free approximation in the domain provides valuable skills for the progress towards an element-free approach. A least squares collocation RBFN-based mesh-free method is then developed for solving the governing PDEs. This method is coupled with the stochastic simulation technique (SST), forming the mesoscopic approach for analyzing viscoelastic flid flows. The velocity field is computed from the RBFN-based mesh-free method (macroscopic component) and the stress is determined by the SST (microscopic component). Thus the SST removes a limitation in traditional macroscopic approaches since closed form constitutive equations are not necessary in the SST. In this mesh-free method, each of the unknowns in the conservation equations is represented by a linear combination of weighted radial basis functions and hence the unknowns are converted from physical variables (e.g. velocity, stresses, etc) into network weights through the application of the general linear least squares principle and point collocation procedure. Depending on the type of RBFs used, a number of parameters will influence the performance of the method. These parameters include the centres in the case of thin plate spline RBFNs (TPS-RBFNs), and the centres and the widths in the case of multi-quadric RBFNs (MQ-RBFNs). A further improvement of the approach is achieved when the Eulerian SST is formulated via Brownian configuration fields (BCF) in place of the Lagrangian SST. The SST is made more efficient with the inclusion of the control variate variance reduction scheme, which allows for a reduction of the number of dumbbells used to model the fluid. A highly parallelised algorithm, at both macro and micro levels, incorporating a domain decomposition technique, is implemented to handle larger problems. The approach is verified and used to simulate the flow of several model dilute polymeric fluids (the Hookean, FENE and FENE-P models) in simple as well as non-trivial geometries, including shear flows (transient Couette, Poiseuille flows)), elongational flows (4:1 and 10:1 abrupt contraction flows) and lid-driven cavity flows.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-newtonian</field><field name="subject">fluid</field><field name="subject">multi-layer perceptron networks (MLPNs)</field><field name="subject">radial basis function networks (RBFNs)</field><field name="subject">stochastic simulation technique (SST)</field><field name="subject">finite</field><field name="subject">Brownian dynamics simulations (BDS)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001518/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an improved shade environment for the reduction of personal UV exposure</field><field name="creator">Turnbull, David J.</field><field name="description">The research from this project has quantified the solar UV environment beneath and surrounding typical local council public shade structures. The effects of changing seasons, atmospheric conditions, structural modifications and surrounding plant life on diffuse UV have been quantified. Strategies to improve current shade structures, so as to significantly reduce the levels of diffuse UV reaching the human body in the shade, have also been developed. For the shade structures used in this research it was found that ultraviolet protection factors ranged from 1.5 to 18.3 for a decreasing solar zenith angle. Correlations have been found relating diffuse erythemal UV to UV in the shade for clear skies and a changing solar zenith angle. The effect of changing atmospheric ozone levels on diffuse erythemal UV levels has been quantified. UV exposures were assessed for a decrease in scattered UV beneath specific shade structures by the use of two types of protection, namely, side-on polycarbonate sheeting and evergreen vegetation. Broadband radiometric and dosimetric measurements conducted in the shade of a scale model shade structure, during summer and winter, showed significant decreases in exposure of up to 65% for summer and 57% for winter when comparing the use and non-use of polycarbonate sheeting. Measurements conducted in the shade of four shade structures, with various amounts of vegetation blocking different sides, showed that adequate amounts and positioning of vegetation decreased the scattered UV in the shade by up to 89% when compared to the shade structure that had no surrounding vegetation. This research shows that major UV reduction could be achieved by the &#8216;shade creation and design industry&#8217;, and that shade guidelines should be updated as soon as possible.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">ultra violet (UV)</field><field name="subject">radiation</field><field name="subject">atmosphere</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001519/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A life changing experience - a rural perspective on living with physical disability</field><field name="creator">van Erp, Ansmarie</field><field name="description">The topic of disability permeates medical literature. Yet, while disability as a medical condition is a focus of research and discussion, this research and discussion occurs often in neglectful ignorance of the total life experience of the individual person. This research is grounded in interpretive phenomenology. The philosophical grounding for the study draws on the works of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. The methodological structure of the research used van Manen&#8217;s (1990) hermeneutic phenomenology to guide a deeper understanding of the human experiences surrounding physical disability. Nine men and women living in different rural communities participated in a series of audiotaped, in-depth, unstructured interviews. The study suggests that living with disability encompasses a complex multidimensional phenomenon to be found within the context of a person&#8217;s life. Defined by physical and social barriers, living with disability denotes an interaction between impairment, activity limitation, and restricted participation. Four themes emerged that explicate the experience: (1) The Everyday Life of the Body; (2) Valuing a Rural Life; (3) Relationships in Life; and (4) Relating Time to Life. Disability was understood as a life-changing experience that entails complex time-consuming and energy-depleting processes and is defined by personal, family and social development. For the participants in this study, the lived experience of disability can be characterised by the expression: &#8220;life is not the same&#8221;. The understanding of the essential nature of this lived experience that emerged from this study has implications for health practice. The practice of disability intervention, based solely on impairment, may be inadequate to facilitate optimal health outcomes for rural people. Instead, physiotherapists can assist these people in discernment of priorities, maintaining existing relationships, advocation of rights, and finding the balance to encounter physical and societal adversity. Thus, the study suggests that health professionals need a broad conceptualisation of what constitutes legitimate knowledge for practice and a recognition that disability is an ongoing journey rather than a final destination.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">physical disability</field><field name="subject">van Manen's hermeneutic phenomenology</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001520/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Access management in electronic commerce system</field><field name="creator">Wang, Hua</field><field name="description">The definition of Electronic commerce is the use of electronic transmission mediums to engage in the exchange, including buying and selling, of products and services requiring transportation, either physically or digitally, from location to location. Electronic commerce systems, including mobile e-commerce, are widely used since 1990. The number of world-wide Internet users tripled between 1993 and 1995 to 60 million, and by 2000 there were 250 million users. More than one hundred countries have Internet access. Electronic commerce, especial mobile e-commerce systems, allows their users to access a large set of traditional (for example, voice communications) and contemporary (for example, e-&#173;shop) services without being tethered to one particular physical location. With the increasing use of electronic service systems for security sensitive application (for example, e-shop) that can be expected in the future, the provision of secure services becomes more important. The dynamic mobile environment is incompatible with static security services. Electronic service access across multiple service domains, and the traditional access mechanisms rely on cross-domain authentication using roaming agreements starting home location. Cross-domain authentication involves many complicated authentication activities when the roam path is long. This limits future electronic commerce applications. Normally, there are three participants in an electronic service. These are users, service providers, and services. Some services bind users and service providers as well as services such as flight services; other services do not bind any participants, for instance by using cash in shopping services, everyone can use cash to buy anything in shops. Hence, depending on which parts are bound, there are different kinds of electronic services. However, there is no scheme to provide a solution for all kinds of electronic services. Users have to change service systems if they want to apply different kind of electronic services on the Internet. From the consumer's point of view, users often prefer to have a total solution for all kinds of service problems, some degree of anonymity with no unnecessary cross authentications and a clear statement of account when shopping over the Internet. There are some suggested solutions for electronic service systems, but the solutions are neither total solution for all kinds of services nor have some degree of anonymity with a clear statement of account. In our work, we build a bridge between existing technologies and electronic service theory such as e-payment, security and so on. We aim to provide a foundation for the improvement of technology to aid electronic service application. As validation, several technologies for electronic service system design have been enhanced and improved in this project. To fix the problems mentioned above, we extend our idea to a ticket based access service system. The user in the above electronic service system has to pay when s/he obtains service. S/He can pay by traditional cash (physical cash), check, credit or electronic cash. The best way to pay money for goods or services on the Internet is using electronic cash. Consumers, when shopping over the Internet, often prefer to have a high level of anonymity with important things and a low level with general one. The ideal system needs to provide some degree of anonymity for consumers so that they cannot be traced by banks. There are a number of proposals for electronic cash systems. All of them are either too large to manage or lack flexibility in providing anonymity. Therefore, they are not suitable solutions for electronic payment in the future. We propose a secure, scalable anonymity and practical payment protocol for Internet purchases. The protocol uses electronic cash for payment transactions. In this new protocol, from the viewpoint of banks, consumers can improve anonymity if they are worried about disclosure of their identities. An agent, namely anonymity provider agent provides a higher anonymous certificate and improves the security of the consumers. The agent will certify re-encrypted data after verifying the validity of the content from consumers, but with no private information of the consumers required. With this new method, each consumer can get the required anonymity level. Electronic service systems involve various subsystems such as service systems, payment systems, and management systems. Users and service providers are widely distributed and use heterogeneous catalog systems. They are rapidly increasing in dynamic environments. The management of these service systems will be very complex. Whether systems are successful or not depends on the quality of their management. To simplify the management of e-commerce systems \cite{Sandhu97}, we discuss role based access control management. We define roles and permissions in the subsystems. For example, there are roles TELLER, AUDITOR, MANAGER and permissions teller (account operation), audit operation, managerial decision in a bank system. Permissions are assigned to roles such as permission teller is assigned to role TELLER. People (users) employed in the bank are granted roles to perform associated duties. However, there are conflicts between various roles as well as between various permissions. These conflicts may cause serious security problems with the bank system. For instance, if permissions teller and audit operation are assigned to a role, then a person with this role will have too much privilege to break the security of the bank system. Therefore, the organizing of relationships between users and roles, roles and permissions currently requires further development. Role based access control (RBAC) has been widely used in database management and operating systems. In 1993, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed prototype implementations, sponsored external research, and published formal RBAC models. Since then, many RBAC practical applications have been implemented, because RBAC has many advantages such as reducing administration cost and complexity. However, there are some problems which may arise in RBAC management. One is related to authorization granting process. For example, when a role is granted to a user, this role may conflict with other roles of the user or together with this role; the user may have or derive a high level of authority. Another is related to authorization revocation. For instance, when a role is revoked from a user, the user may still have the role. To solve these problems, we present an authorization granting algorithm, and weak revocation and strong revocation algorithms that are based on relational algebra. The algorithms check conflicts and therefore help allocate the roles and permissions without compromising the security in RBAC. We describe the applications of the new algorithms with an anonymity scalable payment scheme. In summary, this thesis has made the following major contributions in electronic service systems: 1. A ticket based global solution for electronic commerce systems; A ticket based solution is designed for different kinds of e-services. Tickets provide a flexible mechanism and users can check charges at anytime. 2. Untraceable electronic cash system; An untraceable e-cash system is developed, in which the bank involvement in the payment transaction between a user and a receiver is eliminated. Users remain anonymous, unless she/he spends a coin more than once. 3. A self-scalable anonymity electronic payment system; In this payment system, from the viewpoint of banks, consumers can improve anonymity if they are worried about disclosure of their identities. Each consumer can get the required anonymity level. 4. Using RBAC to manage electronic payment system; The basic structure of RBAC is reviewed. The challenge problems in the management of RBAC with electronic payment systems are analysed and how to use RBAC to manage electronic payment system is proposed. 5. The investigation of recovery algorithms for conflicting problems in user-role assignments and permission-role assignments. Formal authorization allocation algorithms for role-based access control have developed. The formal approaches are based on relational structure, and relational algebra and are used to check conflicting problems between roles and between permissions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">e-commerce</field><field name="subject">system</field><field name="subject">e-payment</field><field name="subject">role based access control (RBAC)</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001522/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What encourages student participation in online discussions</field><field name="creator">Weaver, Cathy M.</field><field name="description">Distance learning began as a means of catering to students who needed to learn in isolated, individual learning environments but, more recently, has been evolving to offer an interactive and collaborative learning environment supported by Computer Mediated Communication (CMC). However, research has found that not all online discussions are productive for learning and that simply making discussions boards accessible to students does not achieve the interactive and collaborative experience for which they are promoted. One of the first requirements needed for successful online discussions is student participation. This study sought to identify what encourages student participation in online discussions. Motivation and social presence were investigated in this study because they have been identified as two concepts that assist in the encouragement of student participation. Motivation assists participation because it is the process whereby goal-directed activity is both instigated and sustained, and social presence because it has been found to increase interaction. This study sought information regarding what motivated or demotivated student participation in online discussions and what Social Presence behaviours students found most important for maintaining their desire to participate in online discussions. It also investigated relationships among, and changes in, student state motivation, student sense of social presence and student perceived sources of motivation and demotivation across the course of a semester. Finally, students' opinion about their motivation, sense of social presence and reasons for participation were investigated through open-ended questions. A Sequential Exploratory design was used to first obtain breadth of data (quantitative) through online surveys (n equals 60 participants). This included a test/retest design. Depth of the data (qualitative) was then explored through interviews that were based on the results of the quantitative data analysis (n equals 14 participants). The main findings of this study were that students' sense of social presence changed significantly across the course of the semester and this change was a decrease in sense of social presence for 50 percent of the students. Context and Social factors were mentioned more frequently as both motivators and demotivators for participation than Structure/format factors. Correlations revealed a significant relationship between state motivation and social presence. Finally, open-ended questions generated a number of major themes that help to promote participation. All of these findings have implications for teachers and designers of online courses. They show that many factors influence student participation and that some of these factors may change over the course of a semester. Teachers and designers should use this information when designing and implementing courses to not only initiate student participation, but also to maintain participation throughout the course.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">student</field><field name="subject">computer mediated communication (CMC)</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001523/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of shielded rectangular dielectric rod waveguide using mode matching</field><field name="creator">Wells, Colin G.</field><field name="description">The limit of current technology for mobile base station filters is the multimode filter, in which each cavity supports two (or possibly three) independent degenerate resonances. Shielded dielectric resonators with a rectangular cross-section are useful in this application. In the design of these filters, manufacturers are using software packages employing finite element or finite difference time domain techniques. However, for sufficient accuracy these procedures require large numbers of points or elements and can be very time consuming. Over the last decade research using the mode matching technique has been used to solve this kind of difficulty for various types of filter design and waveguide problems. In this thesis a mode matching method and computer program is developed to calculate the propagation coefficients and field patterns of the modes in a shielded rectangular dielectric rod waveguide. Propagating, complex, evanescent and backward wave modes are included and the work shows the presence of a dominant mode, and other fundamental modes, not previously identified. The effect of the shield proximity on the propagation characteristics and mode spectrum is investigated, together with the limitations on the accuracy of the mode matching method. In addition, the fields within the shielded rectangular dielectric rod waveguide, are used to calculate the attenuation coefficient of the dominant and fundamental modes. The influence on the attenuation coefficient of the proximity of the shield to the rod is also evaluated for these modes and limitations on accuracy are discussed. The calculated numerical results for the propagation and attenuation coefficient values are verified by measurement. The propagation coefficients results are typically within 2% of those measured. Verification of the attenuation coefficient results is achieved by comparing calculated and measured Q at the resonant frequencies of a number of shielded rectangular dielectric rod resonators.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most severe disorder clinically. The deficiency of dystrophin, in the muscular dystrophy X-linked (mdx) mouse causes an elevation in intracellular calcium in cardiac myocytes. Potential mechanisms contributing to increased calcium include enhanced influx, sarcoplasmic reticular calcium release and\or reduced sequestration or sarcolemmal efflux. This dissertation examined the potential mechanisms that may contribute to an intracellular calcium overload in a murine model of muscular dystrophy. The general cardiomyopathy of the mdx myocardium was evident, with the left atria from mdx consistently producing less force than control atria. This was associated with delayed relaxation. The role of the L-type calcium channels mediating influx was initially investigated. Dihydropyridines had a lower potency in contracting left atria corresponding to a redued dihydropyridine receptor affinity in radioligand binding studies of mdx ventricular homogenates (P&lt;0.05). This was associated with increased ventricular dihydropyridine receptor protein and mRNA levels (P&lt;0.05). The function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in terms of release and also sequestration of calcium via the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase were investigated. A lower force of contraction was evident in mdx left atria in response to a range of stimulation frequencies (P&lt;0.05) and concentrations of extracellular calcium (P&lt;0.05). However, in the presence of 1 nM Ryanodine to block sarcoplasmic reticular calcium release, increased stimulation frequency caused similar forces to those obtained in control mice suggesting enhanced calcium influx via L-type calcium channels in mdx. Rapid cooling contractures showed a reduced contracture in mdx compared to control in response to cooling. This suggests some dysfunction in SR storage, which may be associated with the delayed relaxation time. Concentration-response curves to inhibitors of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum showed no difference in function of the enzyme responsible for calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase mRNA was upregulated, no functional benefit was evident. This study indicates that a deficiency of dystrophin leads to upregulation of L-type calcium channels that contribute to increased calcium influx, with no functional change in sarcoplasmic reticular sequestration. Upregulation of the influx pathway is a potential mechanism for the calcium overload observed in mdx cardiac muscle.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cardiac</field><field name="subject">calcium</field><field name="subject">duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)</field><field name="subject">dystrophin</field><field name="subject">muscular dystrophy x-linked (mdx)</field><field name="subject">utrophin</field><field name="subject">skeletal muscle</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001525/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical success factors for accounting information systems data quality</field><field name="creator">Xu, Hongjiang</field><field name="description">Quality information is critical to organisations&#8217; success in today&#8217;s highly competitive environment. Accounting information systems (AIS) as a discipline within information systems require high quality data. However, empirical evidence suggests that data quality is problematic in AIS. Therefore, knowledge of critical factors that are important in ensuring data quality in accounting information systems is desirable. A literature review evaluates previous research work in quality management, data quality, and accounting information systems. It was found that there was a gap in the literature about critical success factors for data quality in accounting information systems. Based on this gap in the literature and the findings of the exploratory stage of the research, a preliminary research model for factors influence data quality in AIS was developed. A framework for understanding relationships between stakeholder groups and data quality in accounting information systems was also developed. The major stakeholders are information producers, information custodians, information managers, information users, and internal auditors. Case study and survey methodology were adopted for this research. Case studies in seven Australian organisations were carried out, where four of them were large organisations and the other three are small to medium organisations (SMEs). Each case was examined as a whole to obtain an understanding of the opinions and perspectives of the respondents from each individual organisation as to what are considered to be the important factors in the case. Then, cross-case analysis was used to analyze the similarities and differences of the seven cases, which also include the variations between large organisations and small to medium organisations (SMEs). Furthermore, the variations between five different stakeholder groups were also examined. The results of the seven main case studies suggested 26 factors that may have impact on data quality in AIS. Survey instrument was developed based on the findings from case studies. Two large-scale surveys were sent to selected members of Australian CPA, and Australian Computer Society to further develop and test the research framework. The major findings from the survey are: 1. respondents rated the importance of the factors consistent higher than the actual performance of those factors. 2. There was only one factor, &#8216;audit and reviews&#8217;, that was found to be different between different sized organisations. 3. Four factors were found to be significantly different between different stakeholder groups: user focus, measurement and reporting, data supplier quality management and audit and reviews. 4. The top three critical factors for ensuring data quality in AIS were: top management commitment, education and training, and the nature of the accounting information systems. The key contribution of this thesis is the theoretical framework developed from the analysis of the findings of this research, which is the first such framework built upon empirical study that explored factors influencing data quality in AIS and their interrelationships with stakeholder groups and data quality outcomes. That is, it is now clear which factors impact on data quality in AIS, and which of those factors are critical success factors for ensuring high quality information outcomes. In addition, the performance level of factors was also incorporated into the research framework. Since the actual performance of factors has not been highlighted in other studies, this research adds new theoretical insights to the extant literature. In turn, this research confirms some of the factors mentioned in the literature and adds a few new factors. Moreover, stakeholder groups of data quality in AIS are important considerations and need more attention. The research framework of this research shows the relationship between stakeholder groups, important factors and data quality outcomes by highlighting stakeholder groups&#8217; influence on identifying the important factors, as well as the evaluation of the importance and p erformance of the factors.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="subject">accounting information systems (AIS)</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">data quality</field><field name="subject">most critical factor (MCF)</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001526/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Witch images in Australian children's literature</field><field name="creator">Young, Penelope M.</field><field name="description">In this dissertation it is argued that the European witch trials that took place between 1450 and 1700 have resulted in a legacy of stereotypical themes in Australian children's literature. Those accused of witchcraft were almost always women who were old, without protection, and physically ugly. They were accused of consorting with the devil, making harmful spells, flying through the night on a magic staff and exhibiting malevolent intent towards others. An analysis of this period forms the contextual framework for identifying themes that appear in contemporary Australian children's literature. A survey of twenty-three books, identified as stories about witches, was conducted to ascertain whether the stereotypical witch from the European witch-hunts continues to be characterised in Australian children's literature. The findings suggest that the witch figure in Australian children's literature mirrors the historical evidence from the European witch trials, but has evolved into a more powerful and proactive character than that identified in the historical literature. The characterisation of the witch in the books for older readers is powerful and evil, compared to the witch as a trivial and diminished figure in the books for younger readers. Gender is also a major influence in the characterisation of the witch, with all readers exposed to themes that may influence their expectations regarding the behaviour and role of women. The representation of the witch in the books reinforces the misogyny of the witchcraft era, and weaves patterns of meaning in the texts that construct undesirable female images. Readers of all ages can link these images to the social world beyond the text.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">witch</field><field name="subject">story</field><field name="subject">writing</field><field name="subject">fairy tale</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001527/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early family trauma: a comparison between adults with schizophrenia and depression</field><field name="creator">Littler, Susan E.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This study explores similarities and differences in the early family history of an adult group with schizophrenia, and a matched group with major depression. Attachment theory, trauma theory and their relation to serious mental illnesses are used to understand the clinical participants&#8217; reported early traumatic experiences of emotional deprivation and neglect.A retrospective design includes self-report questionnaires from clinical participants, and semi-structured interviews with participants&#8217; mothers/primary caregivers.Data analysis includes:1.	Assessment of matched participants&#8217; reported prevalence of emotional deprivation and neglect in four different age groups;2.	Assessment of themes of early family trauma and sequelae from the mother interviews;3.	Qualitative analysis of sample mother/primary caregiver interviews from each diagnostic group of the manner in which the interviewees construct their stories around trauma;4.	Quantitative analysis of a conceptualised model representing the arguments developed in the body of this dissertation.The second and third forms of analysis above include a panel of three experts, blind to diagnosis, validating this researcher&#8217;s findings.Standard multiple regression analysis indicates participants&#8217; reported neglect across all age groups significantly predicts emotional deprivation, with neglect contributing 27.4% of the variability, but with no individual age band contributing significantly to the equation.Themes from the mother interviews are clustered into three constructs, guided by the research questions and this researcher&#8217;s clinical experience, the mothers&#8217; emphases and the expert panel into Early Family Trauma, Maternal Fatigue, and Clinical Participants&#8217; Early Attachment Difficulties.The mothers&#8217; manner of discussing early family trauma is defined via speech markers as dissociative (disorganised, incoherent, and unresolved) or coherent (grounded, sequential and resolved) according to Attachment Theory and the literature on dissociation. Speakers are assigned as using dissociation or not as a categorical variable.A model is conceptualised to represent the interrelatedness of data from the participants and their mothers, including the manner in which the mothers relate early family trauma. Canonical Discriminant Function Analysis indicates that early family trauma and maternal fatigue discriminate little between diagnostic groups and that maternal non-resolution of early traumatic events and (possibly related) participant offspring attachment difficulties contribute most to distinguishing between the two diagnostic groups. Finally, a greater number of participants from the schizophrenia sample than from the depression sample continue to live with mother, possibly indicating that the early attachment difficulties remain unresolved.Discussion offers a reconceptualisation of several major and/or established theories concerning risk factors in schizophrenia, and examines shortcomings in the literature, concluding with suggestions for future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult</field><field name="subject">adults</field><field name="subject">shizophrenia</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">mental illness</field><field name="subject">comparison</field><field name="subject">similarities</field><field name="subject">differences</field><field name="subject">early family trauma</field><field name="subject">early family history</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00002495/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">China and peripheral conflicts</field><field name="creator">Burathoki, Tunna P.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: China&#8217;s enormous size and stature as a new hub of economic growth in tandem with its military modernisation make China a rising power. The strategic consequences of China&#8217;s economic growth synergised with its military muscles are multiple and profound, especially, for the neighbours in its conflict-prone periphery. The aim of this dissertation is not only to assess the importance and complexities of conflicts in the periphery of China, but also about the necessity for the neighbours to coexist with a more powerful China. At the same time, in the Chinese geopolitical context, domestic stability and hence, the CCP&#8217;s legitimacy has been perpetually paramount, and external threats or conflicts are usually perceived in the context of aggravating domestic and international stability, thereby hampering its strategic aim of achieving global economic command and power-projection military capability.With the dawn of 21st century, China is grooving to an exuberant global beat, the intensity of conflicts along China&#8217;s periphery has dimmed to such an extent that its political, economic, and social order will probably not disintegrate into chaos in the near future. Instead, China&#8217;s rapidly growing economic capacity and its soaring prestige in faraway capitals like Washington and Paris has meant an expansion of Chinese &#8220;soft power&#8221;, i.e., an assertive China with an ability to get what it wants by attracting and persuading others to adopt its goals, instead of blunt economic and military coercion. And, China could reasonably be expected to manage most, if not all, the conflicts in its periphery to its own advantage. These include: efforts to augment its military capabilities in a manner commensurate with its increased economic muscle and acquire new allies and underwrite the protection of others in its periphery. It is unlikely that the PRC will actually acquire new or reclaim old territory for China&#8217;s resources or for symbolic reasons by penalizing, if necessary, any opponents or bystanders who resist such claims. While it may wish to redress past wrongs it believes to have suffered; or attempt to rewrite the prevailing international &#8220;rules of game&#8221; to better reflect its own geostrategic interests; or in the most extreme policy choice, perhaps even ready itself for preventive war or to launch predatory attacks on its foes on the pretext of the &#8220;cult of defence,&#8221; &#8211; all of which have been seen as the bedrock of the contemporary China&#8217;s strategic culture, however, it is iiprobable that China will not pursue these at the cost of its future economic and/or social security agenda.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">periphery</field><field name="subject">peripheral</field><field name="subject">People's Republic of China (PRC)</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00002825/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A foundational investigation of vinyl ester / cenosphere composite materials for civil and structural engineering</field><field name="creator">Davey, Scott W.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: With the increasing use of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites in civil engineering structures, there is a growing realisation of the need to develop newstructural systems which can utilise the unique characteristics of these materials in a more efficient and economical manner. In many instances this will require thedevelopment of new materials tailored to address the unique performance and economic parameters of mainstream construction. Over recent years, researchers at the University of Southern Queensland have pioneeredthe use of a new type of particulate filled polymer core material which greatly improves the robustness and cost effectiveness of FRP structural systems. These compositematerials are composed of small hollow spherical fillers (microspheres) in a thermosetting polymer matrix. Initial research into these materials, including theirfeasibility in prototype structural elements, have shown these materials to have major potential for widespread application in structural composite systems.One of the most promising classes of these materials investigated to date are vinyl ester / cenosphere composites, which utilise cenospheres derived from fly ash in a vinyl ester matrix. Previously reported studies into these materials have been restricted to initialsurveys of material behaviour which sought to identify key parameters in achieving desired performance outcomes in the composite. This dissertation presents the first in-depth investigation of these materials specifically as a core material option for civil infrastructure applications. The particular focus of this work is on the relationship of the vinyl ester matrix to the characteristics of the resultingcomposite. Several key matrix parameters were identified and assessed as to their influence on cure characteristics, fabrication operations, mechanical properties and theretention of such properties under elevated service temperatures. The outcomes of this work have significantly improved the understanding of matrix influences on the behaviour of these composite systems and have been drawn together to provide a number of recommendations on the application of this new technology to new structural systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vinyl ester / cenosphere composites</field><field name="subject">civil engineering applications</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003180/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learner autonomy in the LOTE classroom:
a case study of teacher and student beliefs about roles and responsibilities</field><field name="creator">Kehrwald, Jane</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Learner autonomy in language learning has been described as the ability to take charge of one&#8217;s own learning by determining the objectives, defining the contents and progressions, selecting methods and techniques to be used, monitoring the procedure of acquisition and evaluating what has been acquired (Holec, 1979). Few would doubt that learner autonomy in language learning is a positive thing and can lead to learners who are more proficient in the target language. These sentiments are echoed in many language programs, which have as their explicitly stated goal the development of autonomous, self-directed learners. This project is a pilot study with the aim of investigating one such program: the Languages Other Than English (LOTE) (Indonesian) program at a regional public high school.Taking a collective case study approach this investigation sought to determine two LOTE (Indonesian) learners&#8217; and their teacher&#8217;s beliefs about roles and responsibilities in the language learning process and how these beliefs are translated into their teaching and learning behaviour. Prior to any interventions aimed at facilitating the transfer of responsibility for the management of the learning process from the teacher to the learner, it is essential to access learners&#8217; and teachers&#8217; beliefs and attitudes as these have a profound impact on their learning and teaching behaviour and erroneous beliefs may lead to less effective approaches to learning, ultimately impacting on learners&#8217; success in language learning (Horwitz, 1987).The data, collected through structured interviews and classroom observations, suggest that the subjects simultaneously exhibit characteristics consistent with and in contradiction to the profiles of autonomous learners and of a teacher who engages in pedagogy aimed at the development of autonomous learners. The two LOTE learners&#8217; beliefs, and their learning behaviour, suggest that they defer responsibility to the teacher for the technical aspects of their learning, such as identifying learning objectives and topics, selecting learning activities and resources. On the other hand, through their expressed beliefs, and from the observed lessons, it appears that the two learners accept some level responsibility for reflecting and evaluating their learning and fully accept responsibility for maintaining their interest and motivations in learning the LOTE. While the LOTE learners defer responsibility for the technical aspects of their learning to their LOTE teacher, the LOTE teacher herself defers responsibility to the LOTE syllabus. However, the LOTE teacher was observediiiworking with learners, helping them to evaluate and reflect upon their learning and maintaining their interest and motivation in learning the LOTE.Recommendations for pedagogy to promote the development of learner autonomy and further research are presented.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learners;</field><field name="subject">autonomy;</field><field name="subject">learner</field><field name="subject">autonomy;</field><field name="subject">LOTE;</field><field name="subject">languages</field><field name="subject">other</field><field name="subject">than</field><field name="subject">English;</field><field name="subject">classroom;</field><field name="subject">teachers;</field><field name="subject">students;</field><field name="subject">responsibility;</field><field name="subject">responsibilities</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003184/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of gender identity in elite sports: a mixed methods exploration</field><field name="creator">Lamont-Mills, Andrea</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This dissertation explored how gender identity is constructed in elite sport. I argued that sport is a unique socio-cultural context where gender category membership, may be enacted both the same and differently than in other contexts. Historically, most gender stereotyping, gender trait, and gender identity research in sport (e.g., Andre &amp; Holland, 1995; Csizma, Wittig, &amp; Schurr, 1988; Harris &amp; Griffin, 1997) has employed researcher-generated constructions of masculinity and femininity, or non-sporting constructions of masculinity and femininity. By failing to define and construct gender from the participants' perspective, researchers have imposed their own preconceived cultural standards of gender upon participants (Doyle &amp; Paludi, 1995). To generalise these preconceptions to other groups is to do so without consideration of cultural diversity and possible difference (Doyle &amp; Paludi). Therefore, previous sport gender studies that have used these methodologies are tenuous as contemporary and future models upon which to base gender work.Further, gender identity research that has utilised a discursive psychological theoretical and methodological framework has produced findings that question the empirical validity of current models of gender in sport and exercise psychology (see Wetherell &amp; Edley, 1999). These discursive results suggest that gender is a multifaceted, multidimensional, multifactorial, negotiated, dynamic, and variable concept (Wetherell &amp; Edley, 1999). Therefore, two research questions were addressed by this dissertation: 1) How do participants perceive themselves in terms of gender-related characteristics?; and 2) How do elite sportswomen and sportsmen enact and negotiate membership of idiosyncratic, gender, and gender identity in sport categories?In order to address these research questions two self-report measures were utilised, the 24-item Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ) (Spence &amp; Helmreich, 1978) and a semi-structured interview concerning identity prescription. Thirty-eight elite level coaches (19 women, 19 men) and 37 elite level athletes (19 women, 18 men) voluntarily participated in this study. The interview data were analysed using two divergent theoretical and analytical frameworks, an a-priori content analysis (imposition of the PAQ items on interview responses) and a discursive psychological framework.The results of the PAQ analysis suggest that sportswomen and sportsmen perceive themselves differently in relation to gender-related characteristics. Differences which did not reach statistical significance, were found between male and female responses on the PAQ Masculine (M), Feminine (F), and Masculine-Feminine (M-F) sub-scales. Statistically significant differences were found with reference to PAQ classification, with women more likely to be classified as Androgynous and men as Masculine. There were no statistically significant occupational differences on either PAQ sub-scale responding or PAQ classification. The above results call into question the underlying assumptions and theoretical foundations of the PAQ.The a-priori content analysis also revealed a number of contradictory findings with reference to the assumptions and foundations of the PAQ scale. For example, women were more likely to utilise the PAQ M item Self-confident to describe themselves as gendered individuals than men. Whereas men were more likely to use the PAQ F item Gentle than women in the same identity category. Further, Feminine classified people were more likely to use the PAQ M-F item Very Dominant when describing themselves as women/men in elite sport. Therefore, the PAQ and a priori results cast doubt on the empirical utility of two factor models of gender to understand gender as a complex and dynamic construct. The results suggest that elite sport might be a context where gender is distinctively enacted and constituted.In order to determine how gender identity is enacted and negotiated in competitive sport, the interview data were analysed using a discursive psychological approach. Discursive psychology focuses upon how representations are constructed within, and constitutive of, the social practices that are found in language. In this respect, gender is conceptualised as being negotiated within the local interactive context where culture, history, and social contexts are reflected within discursive practices. In Research Question Two, interest centred on the interpretative repertoires and reflexive positions that participants used to prescribe themselves as idiosyncratic, gendered, and gendered individuals in sport.Interpretative repertoires are recurrent, culturally familiar global discursive patterns that individuals use to make sense of themselves in conversations (Wetherell, 1998; Wetherell &amp; Potter, 1988). Reflexive positions are offered as an alternative discursive notion to the social psychological concept of role (Davies &amp; Harr&#233;, 1990). A person is not considered as an individual free agent, but rather as the subject of the interaction, where the individual takes up or is placed in various subject positions depending upon the discourse and the particular social context in which the individual interacts. Thus we make sense of ourselves, or position ourselves, within social interactions through the cultural and personal resources (interpretative repertoires) that are made available to us in our discourse.Overall, the results of the discursive analysis suggest that participants enacted something gender scholars would call Masculinity, Femininity, and Androgyny when prescribing themselves across the three identity categories. That is, participants used gendered, culturally familiar discursive patterns (interpretative repertoires) to make sense of themselves across identity categories. However, participants were also able to draw upon non gender-related discourses during this process. Thus, identity work was characterised by variability, inconsistency, and contradiction. Different interpretative repertoires and reflexive positions were used by participants both within and across identity categories.Therefore, the use of gender-related interpretative repertoires differed according to the identity that was being scripted up. Thus participants were able to be Masculine, Androgynous, and Feminine, and position themselves differently depending upon the identity that was being prescribed and the local interaction context. That is, participants used interpretative repertoires to talk one way, but walk another (e.g., Androgynous interpretative repertoire, Hegemonic Masculine reflexive position) that was specific to the social, historical, and cultural context, and the local interactional context. The above results call into question Spence and Helmreich&#8217;s (1978) postulation that there is one Masculine and one Feminine identity. Indeed the results are suggestive of many Masculinities and many Femininities.Participants also deployed specific discursive strategies that incorporated the action and epistemological orientation of their talk when constituting their identities. That is, they worked to increase the facticity of their talk and worked to align themselves with certain positions (e.g., Hegemonic Masculine man) and not others (Feminine man) through their discourse. Thus gendered talk carried with it gendered ideological practices that participants used to reproduce, reinforce, and challenge the current gender order.The above results, combined with the disparity between the PAQ results and the a-priori content analysis, suggest that earlier and current models of gender that conceptualise gender as a multifaceted, multidimensional, bi-directional but static concept are probably not representative of how people do gender in everyday talk. The results support extant theory that gender identities might exist rather than a single gender identity. Overall, the results of this dissertation -suggest that elite sportswomen and sportsmen enact and negotiate membership of identity categories that is specific to the local interactional context, as well as the cultural, social (i.e., sport), and historical context. I infer, therefore, that current static gender models in sport and exercise psychology may not fully capture the complexity of gender in everyday talk and that alternative ways of understanding gender in sport are needed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">identity;</field><field name="subject">elite</field><field name="subject">sports;</field><field name="subject">sport;</field><field name="subject">methods</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003186/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working-class writing and Americanisation debates in Britain and Australia: 1950-1965</field><field name="creator">Herbertson, Ian Richard</field><field name="description">[From Introduction]: &#8216;Work&#8217; is not a topic that much concerns contemporary novelists or fires the creative imagination. Today, writing about work is primarily done by investigative reporters like Elizabeth Wynhausen, whose Dirt Cheap: Life at the Wrong End of the Job Market (2005) is a striking &#8211; if rare &#8211; under-cover expos&#233; of what &#8216;economic reform&#8217; really means for menial Australian workers. There is certainly no literary equivalent now of the British and Australian novels, appearing in the 1950s and 1960s, preoccupied with the relationship between changing patterns of work and working-class experience: the lived transformations of traditional class and family ties; the impact of new consuming habits and popular cultural pursuits; the political situation of ordinary working people, and shifts in their attitudes and values. These British and Australian novels generally assumed that reorganisations of the working coal face or factory floor extended into the private sphere, informing or producing the stressful personal dramas played out in communities and at the kitchen sink.This thesis argues that these novels were elements of a broader dialogue in the 50s and 60s: one in which work and working-class life were significant subjects, articulated in a range of complementary discourses that were interlocutory &#8211; economic and political analysis, sociology, nascent cultural theory, popular newspaper commentary and literature. Consequently, a main objective of this thesis is to reveal how these representational forms or disciplines converged in the period 1950&#8211;1965: to examine their common themes and interests, and their collectiveresponses to questions concerning working-class life. The thesis argues that all these forms or disciplines shared the view that the condition of the working classes, in both Britain and Australia, crucially mattered to the overall social architecture of the time. It also argues that they all regarded the presence of America, the era&#8217;s pre-eminent global force, as central to such questions; and that America was complexly understood as an idealised political concept, a power-house of popular cultural production, and a very real engine of socio-economic change.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">working</field><field name="subject">class</field><field name="subject">writing;</field><field name="subject">working</field><field name="subject">class;</field><field name="subject">Britain;</field><field name="subject">Australia;</field><field name="subject">British;</field><field name="subject">Australian;</field><field name="subject">novels;</field><field name="subject">Americanisation;</field><field name="subject">1950-1965;</field><field name="subject">1950s;</field><field name="subject">1960s</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003190/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The microclimate of Australian cattle feedlots</field><field name="creator">Petrov, Ryan</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The incidence of cattle heat stress is a significant production and welfare issue for the feedlot industry. It is hypothesised that the presence and physical nature of feedlots causes significant microclimatic variations compared to the external environment.In order to test this hypothesis, data was collected using a series of automatic weather stations located in the external environment surrounding two Australian feedlots. Comparison of this data with regional Bureau of Meteorology sites was undertaken to verify the quality of these &#8216;control&#8217; sites. To determine the climate within the feedlot separate automatic weather stations were placed within the cattle pens at each site, with one station located in an unshaded pen and one directly under an artificial shade structure within an adjacent pen.This dissertation reports the collection and analyses of detailed climatic data from the surrounds and within the cattle pens of these two Australian feedlots. The project also sought to determine microclimatic differences within the feedlot pen area that may be caused by the presence of the shade structures.It was found that the presence of a feedlot does create significant microclimatic variations. Specifically, it was determined that the albedo values of the feedlot pen surface are significantly lower (ranging from 0.13 to 0.19) than those of the external feedlot environment (typically 0.15 to 0.25). This is a result of the surface changes arising from the establishment of clay based manure covered pens. Under wet conditions the differences in albedo values were further increased. It was found that the short wave radiation reflection from the external feedlot environment was 4% greater than that from the unshaded feedlot pen surfaces under dry conditions and 10% greater under wet conditions. The increased adsorption of solar radiation by the feedlot pen surface created ground temperatures that were on average 2 to 4&#176;C warmer than those of the feedlot surrounds. The re-radiation of heat from the pen surface was found to create warmer air temperatures within the feedlot pens compared to the external environment, particularly overnight. Between the hours of 4am to 6am it was found that on average the air temperatures of the shaded and unshaded feedlot pens were 0.7&#176;C and 0.5&#176;C warmer than the external feedlot environment.It was found that feedlot pen infrastructure and cattle significantly reduce wind speeds under a height of 10 metres. The average 2 metre wind speeds of the external feedlot environments were found to be 29% and 9% higher than those recorded in the unshaded pens at the northern and southern feedlots respectively.Shade structures within feedlot pens were found to be effective in reducing incoming solar radiation with the galvanised sheeting reducing incoming solar radiation by 76% and the shade cloth providing a 72% reduction. These reductions provided both lower ground temperatures and a significant reduction in radiant heat loads under the shade. It was determined that the environment under shade structures was more humid compared to that of the unshaded pens with humidity levels recorded being 8 to 12% higher. Shade structures also restrict horizontal wind movement with the 2 metre wind speeds in the shaded pens being on average 11% and 0.5% lower than those recorded in the unshaded pens for the Queensland and NSW feedlots respectively.Research has shown that microclimatic variations such as increased air temperatures, increased humidity and restricted air movement can have an adverse effect on cattle health. It is concluded from this project that in order to mitigate these effects a number of feedlot design concepts be implemented, and management practices should be adopted. Maintaining minimal quantities of manure on the pen surface will provide lower ground temperatures, dryer pen conditions and inhibit the re-radiation of heat and evapotranspiration from the pen surface. Adequate air flow should be maintained by siting feedlots in areas of suitable topography, and designing feedlot infrastructure and shade structures to maximise air movement. Shade structures need to aim at providing dryer pen surfaces to minimise humidity levels. Incorporation of these recommendations into feedlot design and management will assist in optimising the feedlot microclimate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian;</field><field name="subject">Australia;</field><field name="subject">cattle;</field><field name="subject">feedlots;</field><field name="subject">microclimate</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003191/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of a leadership training program on school based management and school community action in Praya Barat Daya, Lombok, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Atwell, Alison</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Indonesia decentralized its education system in January 2001 requiring all schools to become self managing at their local level. Training was put in place to assist schools with tasks that would facilitate this process such as writing School Development Plans and establishing the newly mandated School Committees. However no specific plans emerged to provide schools with training in educational leadership. Understandingand practising leadership goes hand in hand with understanding the nuances of decentralization. A different style of leadership is required to make sense of decentralization, a style of leadership that does not rely upon top-down authority but instead shares leadership across the school community and encourages leadership to emanate from below. In 2004 a leadership training project was undertaken in three rural school communities in Central Lombok. Its purpose was to consider the emergence of new leadership practices when schools are given the opportunity to be involved in leadership training across a six month period. The leadership training project was attached to a current Aid project to gauge the appropriateness of including a leadership training program in future Aid projects. Within Indonesia Aid projects from a range of international donors are a frequent source of enhancing physical and teaching and learning environments in schools. The leadership training project commenced with a two day live in workshop followed by six months in-school experience, which involved school and individual projects to practise leadership. The design included six-weekly site visits and all participants maintained a weekly reflective journal. The data collected was presented in the form of case studies of each of the three schools, which were subsequently used to inform a Report presented tothe Indonesian Ministry of National Education. Findings presented in this Report affirm that a leadership training program of this nature does provide a valuable way forward through training in school leadership practices that allow school communities to effectively work within a school based management environment. This Report recommended that the trialled leadership training program would be a valuable inclusion in future educational AID projects throughout Indonesia.ii</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leadership;</field><field name="subject">training;</field><field name="subject">program;</field><field name="subject">programme;</field><field name="subject">rural;</field><field name="subject">school;</field><field name="subject">schools;</field><field name="subject">Lombok;</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003192/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cotton quality - fibre to fabric: fibre properties relationships to fabric quality</field><field name="creator">Bel, Patricia Damian</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The textile industry has a recurrent white speck nep problem in cotton. &#8220;White specks&#8221; are immature clusters of fibres that are not visible as defects until dyeing, after which they remain white on the surface of a darkly dyed fabric, or appear as non uniform streaks in the fabric. Both results render the fabric unsuitable for commercial fashion fabrics. The white speck potential of cotton is difficult to predict except in extremely immature cottons. Competitive synthetic fibres are uniform in length and strength and never have a maturity problem resulting in dye defects. They are much more predictable in the mill. As a result, cotton faces the risk of being replaced by synthetic fibres. Industry requires a method to predict fabric quality from cotton bale fibre properties to minimize this risk. This research addresses the problem of predicting white specks in dyed cotton fabrics. It is part of a large study, which is supported jointly by US and Australian agencies. The main objective is to predict fabric quality from bale fibre properties given controlled gin and mill processing.  Gin and mill processing must be controlled so that field and varietal effects can be seen without the interaction of mechanical processing differences. This results in achieving other objectives, including the provision of baseline data for Australian varieties, ginning effects and comparison of ring and open-end spinning.   Initially a reliable method for measuring white specks had to be found. Several systems have been evaluated and are reported here. The systems accuracy was compared using fabrics from the US Extreme Variety Study (EVS), which was grown specifically to have different levels of white specks.  The fabrics made from the US (Leading Variety Study 1993 (LVS) and The American Textile Manufacturers Institute (ATMI) Cotton Variety Processing Trials, 2001) and the Australian (1998 &amp; 1999) variety studies were analysed using AutoRate-2-03, the best of the image analysis systems studied. The final release of AutoRate (February 2003) was developed by Dr. Bugao Xu to measure white specks on dark fabrics in conjunction with this research. This final analysis of these studies results in white speck prediction equations from high-speed fibre measurement systems. This information should be immediately useful to as a tool to measure the effects of field and ginning practices on the levels of white specks without having to carry the research out to finished fabrics.  Cotton breeders will be able to use the equations in the development of new varieties with low white speck potential, by eliminating varieties with high white speck potential early on. The research will continue on a much larger scale in the US and hopefully a WSP (White Speck Potential) value will be incorporated into the US Cotton Grading System.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fibre</field><field name="subject">properties;</field><field name="subject">fabric</field><field name="subject">quality;</field><field name="subject">cotton</field><field name="subject">fabric;</field><field name="subject">textile</field><field name="subject">industry;</field><field name="subject">white</field><field name="subject">specks</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003193/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Death charged missives': Australian literary responses to the Spanish Civil War</field><field name="creator">Beasley, Brian Glen</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: &#8216;Spanish Civil War&#8217; is an important, absent signifier in Australian history, letters, writing and cultural politics of the 1930s. I argue that despite the glossing over of the importance of Spain&#8217;s war in the period, events in Spain had a pervasive influence on Australian society, and writers in particular &#8211; on their political re-alignments, on their nationalist and internationalist cultural outlooks, and on their common acceptance that they lived in an essentially tragic age. Consequently, the critical neglect of Spain and its impact on Australian cultural affairs in the 30s is unwarranted.My thesis research has covered a very wide range of texts: the ephemeral pamphlet, the small circulation journal, poetry, agitprop, the mainstream novel, the &#8216;mass declamation&#8217; and the associated &#8216;new media&#8217; of the 30s &#8211; photography and film. It has also looked at different groups or cultural networks in the period, all of which (despite their disparate politics) saw Spain as a central cause: the Catholic Church, the Communist Party, anti-fascist and peace movements amongst others.The theoretical dimension of my work is driven by Raymond Williams&#8217; concept of &#8216;structure of feeling&#8217;, first formulated in his study The Long Revolution then developed in a series of subsequent works. The generous range of texts I study conforms to Williams&#8217; theory of &#8216;structure of feeling&#8217;, arguing that to understand the &#8216;field&#8217; of a period, one should survey the interconnectivity of all its texts. Also drawing on Williams&#8217; theory, I read the structured feeling of the 30s as essentially tragic: revealing exactly how Spain focalised fears and apparently symbolised the impasse of &#8216;modernity&#8217; itself &#8211; Spain was a spectacle that graphically demonstrated how the inner destructiveness of technological modernity had tragically cancelled the possibility of progress and the arrival of variously imagined utopias.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spanish</field><field name="subject">Civil</field><field name="subject">War;</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">literature;</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003199/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business-to-business communication and the requirements for an ontology for the Australian timber and wood products industry</field><field name="creator">Blake, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">[Executive Summary&#65279;]: The purpose of this thesis is to describe business-to-business 	 communication and the characteristics of an open standard for electronic 	 communication within the Australian timber and wood products industry. The 	 current issues, future goals and strategies for using business-to-business 	 communication identified by respondents in a questionnaire are discussed. 	 The study addresses these questions, by using a self-administered 	 questionnaire which was constructed and mailed to 2000 organisations. The 	 questionnaire was used to ascertain a base-line of information systems&#8217; use 	 in the Australian timber and wood products industry, and to establish how to 	 make successful the introduction of a more accessible means for system to 	 system interoperation between organisations. 	 A prototype domain specific ontology was engineered using content analysis 	 of a representative timber and wood product organisation product listing. A 	 visual representation of the ontology modelled using unified modelling 	 language is presented. The formal specification of the ontology was 	 constructed using an ontology editor, Prot&#233;g&#233;. 	 The outcomes of the questionnaire include that the industry has a small 	 number of large enterprises and a large proportion of small to medium 	 enterprises. Computer and Internet use in the industry is comparable to that 	 in other Australian industry sectors. For both intrabranch and business-to-	 business the established communication modes of postal service, telephone 	 and facsimile are those most frequently used. However where advanced 	 information technology modes exist, it is used extensively. Use of electronic 	 data interchange is now used mostly by organisations employing over 100 	 employees, whereas supply chain management use is limited. Small to 	 medium enterprises have failed to adopt an information systems strategy 	 plan, while organisations employing over 100 do have plans in place. 	 Attitudes toward information technology, business-to-business 	 communication and information systems security are dependent upon 	 organisational size while compliance to information systems&#8217; standards was 	 not. Barriers to adoption of technology specific communication identified in 	 the study are location, lack of resources, organisational size and a lack of 	 planning. 	 Drivers to increase the bandwagon effect in the industry are education and 	 the availability of a simple low-cost complete package to demystify 	 technology intensive electronic business-to-business communication.

Subsequent questions examine the Federal Government&#8217;s view of globalisation, as a &#8216;top-down&#8217; approach, and the relationship between trade, security, and &#8216;the national interest&#8217;, before considering the merits of constructing a &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; approach from the base of civil society, through bodies such as unions. Human security, as a recent addition to security thinking, seeks to empower&#8216;ordinary&#8217; people as active actors in their quest for &#8216;real&#8217; security, as they seek freedom from both &#8216;fear&#8217; and &#8216;want&#8217;. This reverses the Realist tradition that demandssecurity be derived &#8216;from above&#8217;, organised within the realm of sovereign states as they fulfil their task of protecting &#8216;the national interest&#8217;. Emerging post-Cold War,human security has been used to argue that the Realist approach to security, involving balance-of-power mechanisms, may be usurped by a more holisticapproach. One that invests people as central actors rather than states, favouring individuals above the territorial entities they inhabit. The current phase ofglobalisation poses various challenges to states&#8217; security, as the physical bordersecurity erodes through technological advance, and new modes of business. The proposed Australia-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA) carries both potentialbenefits and disruptions to the lives of ordinary Australians. But, the debate is unbalanced, largely flowing downwards from the international sphere to individualsbelow. Alternatives generated within civil society struggle for legitimacy, failing the dominant &#8216;commonsense&#8217; paradigm, as the current hegemony ensures that the mostpowerful tools in the &#8216;toolbox of power&#8217; are held firmly in the grip of those better positioned to dictate policies.The search for a new definition of human security faltered, as research revealed a lower level of awareness in issues further removed from the firefighter&#8217;s control.From this finding emerged a web-based self-education research tool, and later, a simple pictorial tool, the &#8216;Orbits of Security&#8217;. Both instruments were inspired byGramsci&#8217;s notion of &#8216;cultural hegemony&#8217;. Both are intended to show the UFUQ membership how, through education, they can begin to assert greater ownership over their personal human security &#8216;orbit&#8217; by comprehending the nature of &#8216;cultural hegemony&#8217;. The study concludes by arguing that the rightful place of &#8216;ordinary people&#8217; is atsociety&#8217;s core, not at the periphery. In this way, &#8216;human security&#8217; becomes a useful counter-hegemonic tool for the UFUQ, and a valuable addition to their &#8216;toolbox ofpower&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United</field><field name="subject">Firefighters&#8217;</field><field name="subject">Union;</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Branch;</field><field name="subject">UFUQ;</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">security</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003205/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organizational learning in a food industry value chain</field><field name="creator">Dunne, Anthony John</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This dissertation documents and evaluates the transformational change process undertaken by a major Australian food manufacturer, Golden Circle Limited. The study focuses on evaluating what impact the change process had on the organization&#8217;s capacity to learn and its ability to apply such learning to improve its competitive performance. The primary data used in this evaluation were generated by three sets of semi-structured interviews conducted with respondents drawn from different levels of management within Golden Circle and its key value chain partners over a two year period. From January 2004 to December 2005, the company reported a cost reduction of 21% within the Supply Chain and Operations Area, which had been the focus of the transformational change process. This improvement in performance was based on three success factors: the presence of an effective change champion, the formation of cross-functional project teams that were empowered, responsible and accountable, and the presence of a structured process designed to develop a culture of continuous improvement. Improved relationships with the organization&#8217;s supply chain partners directly contributed to the improved operational performance through higher quality inputs, better operational alignment and reduced inventory holdings.The study identified that there were three key factors that were essential for the development of an organizational climate that nurtured learning: leadership that was inclusive, supportive and proactive; a culture of individual responsibility and team accountability; and an organizational structure that promoted open communication and collaboration. Further, this study identified four factors that enabled new knowledge to be applied: the presence of a shared vision, adequate resources (both financial and personnel), a willingness to participate, and the capabilities to participate.A significant component of this research was the construction, testing and refinement of a model of organizational learning in the context of a value chain that would be of value to future research and managerial practice in the area of organizational adaptation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Golden</field><field name="subject">Circle</field><field name="subject">Limited;</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">process;</field><field name="subject">organizational</field><field name="subject">adaptation;</field><field name="subject">organizational</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003206/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the process of transfer of training in the workplace</field><field name="creator">Machin, M. Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis aimed to describe the conditions under which transfer of training would occur and the processes that are involved in the transfer of training to the workplace. Two studies were conducted that assessed the individual, situational, and training design factors that impacted on the transfer of training to the workplace. Study 1 examined the influence of individual and situational factors on the achievement of trainees&#8217; transfer goals. Trainees&#8217; goals for transfer and their commitment to those transfer goals were found to act as mediators of the influence of self-efficacy, motivation, and situational constraints on transfer goal achievement. This result supported previous research that has shown that the impact of personal and situational factors on performance is mediated by the personal goal level and level of goal commitment (Wofford, Goodwin &amp; Premack, 1992). Study 2 was based on a model of the determinants of training transfer proposed by Thayer and Teachout (1995). The model was modified to focus on the determinants of trainees&#8217; transfer implementation intentions and implementation activities. Climate for transfer was assessed prior to training commencing and was found to influence pre-training levels of self-efficacy. However, positive and negative affect also influenced pre-training levels of both self-efficacy and motivation, and the two climate for transfer factors (Positive and Negative Work Climate) were found to influence positive and negative affectivity, respectively. It was concluded that climate for transfer does impact direct and indirectly on pre-training levels of self-efficacy and motivation. A second structural model found that pre-training self-efficacy is a strong determinant of the learning that occurs during training, and the level of post-training self-efficacy. Post-training self-efficacy is a strong determinant of transfer implementation intentions, which in turn were a strong determinant of implementation activities. Implementation activities were positively related to transfer success. Separate structural models were developed to assess the impact of in-training transfer enhancing activities on learning, post-training self-efficacy, transfer implementation intentions, and implementation activities. Self-control cues, relapse prevention activities, and goal setting (when assessed separately) were found to positively influence post-training self-efficacy and implementation intentions. Relapse prevention activities and goal setting (when assessed separately) were also found to positively influence implementation activities. The results strongly supported the modified model of training transfer that was presented. It was also concluded that situational factors do exert an indirect influence on the transfer process, apart from simply influencing what trainees are able to do after training has completed (Mathieu &amp; Martineau, 1997, Qui&#241;ones, 1997).</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transfer of training</field><field name="subject">climate for transfer</field><field name="subject">transfer implementation intentions</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003234/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification, validation, and pyramiding of quantitative trait loci for resistance to crown rot in wheat</field><field name="creator">Bovill, William D.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Crown rot (causal organism: Fusarium pseudograminearum) is a significantdisease affecting wheat in Australia. Although first reported over 60 years ago, the disease has become more prevalent in recent years due to the adoption ofminimum tillage and stubble retention practices. Breeding for resistance to crown rot is difficult - phenotypic selection, which is usually done at harvest, istime-consuming, expensive, and subject to between year variability due to sensitivity to environmental conditions. For these reasons, the coupling ofmolecular techniques with conventional plant breeding (marker-assisted selection) has the potential to more rapidly and reliably identify genomic regionsthat contribute to resistance. The objective of this study was to identify, validate,and pyramid quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to crown rot present in aW21MMT70 x Mendos doubled haploid wheat population.Replicated seedling trials were conducted in 2001, 2003, and 2005. In eachseedling trial, W21MMT70 displayed partial resistance to crown rot whereasMendos seedlings were susceptible. A bulked segregant analysis (BSA), using390 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers chosen for their coverage of thewheat genome, was initially conducted based upon the 2001 seedling trial data inan attempt to rapidly identify genomic regions associated to resistance. The BSAdid not reveal any markers associated with resistance to crown rot. As a result, afull mapping study was conducted. One hundred and twenty eight (128) SSRmarkers were mapped across the population to produce a framework map.Previously screened AFLP markers were added to the map. Composite intervalmapping revealed eight QTL associated with resistance. Of these, three (locatedon chromosomes 2B, 2D, and 5D) were consistently detected in each of the threeseedling trials. Two QTL (on chromosomes 1A and 3B) were detected in two ofthe three trials. The 2D, 3B, and 5D QTL were inherited from W21MMT70,whereas the 1A and 2B QTL were inherited from Mendos.Two software programs were used to identify epistatic interactions betweenQTL. While the results of the two programs differed markedly, both programsdetected a highly significant interaction between the W21MMT70 inherited 5DQTL and a locus on chromosome 2D inherited from Mendos. The overall effectof the epistatic interactions was not as great as the additive effects of nonepistaticQTL. Nonetheless, the presence of epistasis may indicate that,particularly in the case of 5D, the effect of this QTL may be dependent on thebackground into which it is introgressed.Validation of three W21MMT70-inherited QTL (on chromosomes 2D, 3B, and5D) was conducted on three F2 populations with W21MMT70 as one of theparents. While the 5D QTL was validated in two of the three crosses, neither the2D nor the 3B QTL were detected in any of the F2 validation populations. It islikely that the size of the F2 populations (the largest composed of 94 individuals),in conjunction with the variability that is inherent when screening for resistanceto crown rot, precluded validation of these regions. Validation of the 2BMendos-inherited QTL was conducted on a Sunco x Batavia doubled haploidpopulation because Sunco possesses the same Triticum  timopheevi  2B introgression that is present in Mendos. This validated QTL (designatedQ.CR..usq-2B2) explained 11 % of the phenotypic variance in the Sunco xBatavia population.To assess the effectiveness of pyramiding QTL for resistance to crown rot, a 2-49x W21MMT70 population was examined. A number of lines of this populationperformed significantly better than each of the parents in the replicated seedlingtrial that was conducted. Four QTL, located on chromosomes 1A, 1D, 2D, and3B, were detected. The 1A and 1D QTL were inherited from 2-49 whereas the2D and 3B QTL were inherited from W21MMT70. The 1A QTL from 2-49 hasnot been previously validated, and this QTL has been designated QCr.usq-1A1.The 3B QTL (designated QCr.usq-3B1) had the highest effect (LRS 42.1;explaining 21.0 % of the phenotypic variance) in the 2-49 x W21MMT70population. The 2D QTL (QCr.usq-2D1) was shown to have a minor effect. The5D QTL that was inherited from W21MMT70 in the W21MMT70 x Mendospopulation was not detected in the 2-49 x W21MMT70 population. A number ofpossible explanations for the inability to detect this QTL in the 2-49 xW21MMT70 population are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crown</field><field name="subject">rot;</field><field name="subject">wheat;</field><field name="subject">Australia;</field><field name="subject">quantitative</field><field name="subject">trait</field><field name="subject">loci</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003549/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social presence and learner support: understanding learners' experiences with mediated social processes in text-based online learning environments</field><field name="creator">Kehrwald, Benjamin</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This study focuses on the nature, role and function of online social presence in text-based online learning environments and how it relates to learner support. Ultimately, the study seeks to understand the relationships between the nature, role and function of social presence, the social learning processes employed in contemporary online learning environments and the mechanisms which support learning in these environments. This study is guided by the question: In what ways might social presence enhance the provision of learner support in text-based online learning environments? Of particular interest in this study is information related to (a) how participants in online courses experience social presence; (b) how learners in online courses perceive and/or experience learner support in online courses and (c) how these experiences affect learner activity in online learning environments.The research design employs a collective case study approach which focuses on learners in four separate online courses within a single university context to inform understanding of the phenomena in question. Using a combination of interview-like techniques, the study seeks to ground the understanding of social presence, mediated social processes (i.e., interpersonal interaction, collaboration and community development) and learner support in the experiences of online learners.The results suggest a number of important findings with regard to social presence and learner support. First is an understanding of social presence as a quality of individual actors in the online environments. Social presence exists as a response to the limits of the technology and media in text-based online learning environments. Next, the study identifies social presence an essential component of online learning environments because it facilitates and supports mediated social processes including interpersonal interaction (or transaction), the development of relations between individuals and amongst groups of individuals, the progressive development of productive collaboration and the establishment and growth of community. Finally, the study highlights a revised model for learner support in text-based online learning environments which is informed by the development of learning communities and understanding of mediated social processes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">presence;</field><field name="subject">text-based</field><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">environments;</field><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">environments</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003555/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agricultural intensification and ecosystem function in a brigalow (Acacia harpophylla)landscape: implications for ecosystem services</field><field name="creator">Collard, Stuart J.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Agricultural intensification, involving habitat fragmentation and modification, typically leads to a decline in biodiversity and ecosystem function.

Large regional devices including sediment ponds and constructed wetlands are common features in the urban landscape to treat runoff. In keeping with this approach, data requirements to evaluate stormwater impacts have mainly been met by the monitoring of sizeable urban catchments, typically greater than 10ha in area. Urban runoff characteristics have thus been conventionally linked with broadly defined catchment attributes. Land use, as defined by zonings such as Residential, Commercial and Industrial, is an attribute often used to evaluate stormwater runoff from urban catchments.The emergence of Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia is changing the management focus from the reliance on a small number of large-scale devices to many smaller-scale source controls distributed throughout the catchment. This paradigm shift in stormwater management places greater emphasis on small-scale processes within urban areas. Subsequently there is a need for more knowledge about stormwater generated from specific urban surfaces (roads, roofs, grassed areas etc).The objective of this study was to demonstrate how urban stormwater quality can be managed on the basis of urban surfaces. The study involved the collection of data for typical urban surfaces and the development of predictive models to estimate stormwater quality. A series of case studies is provided to illustrate the use of surface-related data and modelling tools in stormwater management, particularly in the context of WSUD.Non-Coarse Particles (NCP), defined as suspended solids less than 500&#956;m in size, was selected as the stormwater pollutant under consideration. NCP is divided into the following particle size classes; Very Fine Particles (VFP, &lt;8&#956;m), Fine Particles (FP, 8-63&#956;m) and Medium Particles (MP, 63-500&#956;m). Laboratory methods to determine the concentration of these particle classes within stormwater runoff were adapted and refined from current standard methods. Organic content of each stormwater particle class was also determined.An innovative device, the flow splitter, was developed to collect runoff samples from urban surfaces. The flow splitter was designed to obtain a composite flow-proportional sample, necessary to derive the Event Mean Concentration of stormwater particles. Hydraulic and sediment testing of a prototype flow splitter confirmed that the device is an accurate and unbiased sampling method.Flow splitters were installed at five monitoring sites within inner city Toowoomba, Australia. The sites have small catchments (50 to 450m2 area) representative of urban impervious areas (galvanized iron roof, concrete carpark and bitumen road pavement) and pervious areas (grassed and exposed bare soil). Overall, runoff from 40 storms with rainfalls from 2.5mm to 64.3mm was sampled during the period December 2004 to January 2006.A scatter plot analysis identified potential correlations between measured NCP loads and basic rainfall parameters such as rainfall depth and intensity. An exponential-type trend, consistent with many washoff models, is evident between load and average rainfall intensity for all surfaces. A composite index, referred to as the Rainfall Detachment Index (RDI), was found to be better than average rainfall intensity in explaining a relationship between NCP load and storm rainfall characteristics.The insight gained from the RDI led to the development of a particle Mass Balance Model for impervious surfaces. Depending on the surface type, the model was able for provide reasonable estimates (R2 = 0.74 to 0.97) against the measured NCP loads. Simpler analytical methods for particle load estimation were also developed in the study. A total of five methods were produced. An error analysis was conducted to compare the performance of each method to accurately reproduce the measured NCP loads. The analysis also included three methods used in current practice, which performed poorly compared to the new modelling techniques.The analytical methods provide useful tools in urban stormwater planning. The Mass Balance Model and measured surface-specific data were used in a number of case study examples to demonstrate possible applications. The applications included assessments of 1) the relative contribution that different urban surfaces make to the particle load in runoff; 2) how surface-specific data can be directly transferred to represent a large-scale urban catchment located in a different climate; 3) the particle loads generated from Residential and Commercial land uses; 4) the effect of exposed areas of bare soil on the particle loads from a Residential catchment; 5) the effect that widespread adoption of rainwater tanks may have on particle concentration in Residential urban runoff and 6) the particle load reductions by the use of a grass swale to treat road runoff.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban</field><field name="subject">runoff;</field><field name="subject">stormwater</field><field name="subject">characteristics;</field><field name="subject">particle</field><field name="subject">size</field><field name="subject">distributions;</field><field name="subject">stormwater</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003558/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic development in the Kimberley region of Western Australia: a history and dependency theory perspective</field><field name="creator">Sharpe, Leslie J.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]:The focus of the research undertaken for this dissertation is the economic development of the Kimberley region of Western Australia. The period studied is, approximately, the one hundred years from 1900&#8211;2000. The region has many of the characteristics of an underdeveloped area and of a low income economy.This research used dependency theory as a framework for examining the causes of underdevelopment in the Kimberley. The development that occurred in the region during the relevant period has been catalogued by the creation of a database. This has enabled the collected information to be examined and manipulated in many ways. The database has allowed the detail of development in the Kimberley to be studied with respect to time, place and type of activity. This made it possible to examine the five hypotheses proposed by A. G. Frank which he considered likely to lead to fruitful research. The detailed study of these hypotheses would not have been possible in the way described without the database.It was found that dependency theory does help to explain and understand the development experience of the Kimberley region of Western Australia during the twentieth century. This was the clear and positive result of this study.The extension to Frank&#8217;s core dependency theory, the five hypotheses, were not found to be applicable to the Kimberley region nor supported by the data. The hypotheses, therefore, do not add to our understanding of the nature of Kimberley development during the period examined. This does not invalidate or devalue the usefulness of dependency theory in this study.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">development;</field><field name="subject">kimberly</field><field name="subject">region;</field><field name="subject">Western</field><field name="subject">Australia;</field><field name="subject">1900-2000;</field><field name="subject">dependency</field><field name="subject">theory</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003564/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New midge resistance for Australian grain sorghum</field><field name="creator">Hardy, Adam</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The development and commercial release of midge resistant grain sorghum hybrids in Australia has been one of the real success stories of the sorghum industry. Almost all the current commercial sorghum hybrids grown contain a significant baseline of midge resistance that has greatly reduced that pest status of this insect. However while breeding efforts have been successful, it seems only one mechanism of resistance remains present in commercial hybrids. This mechanism of resistance known as &#8216;ovipositional-antixenosis&#8217; is polygenic in nature and has contributed to the gradual reduction in the genetic base of commercial sorghum hybrids, potentially limiting the advancement of other agronomic traits.In order to expand both the level of resistance and the genetic diversity within Australian commercial sorghum hybrids, research was undertaken to capture new sources of midge resistance. Initially the goal of this work was to isolate and characterise the most promising new antibiosis sources of midge resistance previously documented within international breeding lines. However as the work progressed the discovery of a previously undescribed tolerance source of midge resistance led to more detailed studies of midge larval biology within a narrow range of sorghum germplasm lines to better characterise the resistance mechanism.To complete this work a new water-injection technique was developed to allow more precise studies of midge larval biology where previous traditional screening methods were deemed inadequate. Using this method several antibiotic lines were shown to contain diverse modes of action, while the tolerance mechanism of resistance was confirmed and more accurately characterised. In all cases plant characters within the developing spikelet were associated with each resistance mechanism.Overall, one source of resistance, found in lines derived from the Indian land race line DJ6514, was identified as superior to the others tested. Germplasm derived from this source was found to confer inter-related antibiosis and tolerance mechanisms. Both mechanisms were indirectly shown to be caused by the unique antibiotic properties of the developing caryopsis. Larval mortality (antibiosis) increased in this line, in line with increased feeding against the developing caryopsis. A second tolerance mode of action was also linked to anti-feeding properties of the developing caryopsis. Larvae were recorded at higher than normal rates feeding away from the caryopsis resulting in the survival of both larvae and grain in a significant proportion of spikelets. This escape &#8216;tolerance&#8217; mechanism of resistance was confirmed indirectly in several studies and could be artificially induced in other genotypes when larval feeding against the caryopsis was delayed. As such the resistance is better described as antixenosis to caryopsis feeding.When both resistance mechanisms are present, the resistance isolated from DJ6514 was found to cause a three to four fold increase in seed set in resistant lines. This source of resistance has been directly selected for incorporation into the Australian breeding program and has been shown to be inherited simply as a single gene that needs to be deployed on both sides of the breeding program to ensure stable expression. When breeding efforts are complete a new suite of highly resistant and genetically diverse midge resistant sorghum hybrids will emerge into the marketplace.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">midges;</field><field name="subject">resistance;</field><field name="subject">midge</field><field name="subject">resistance;</field><field name="subject">Australia;</field><field name="subject">Australian;</field><field name="subject">sorghum</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003566/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling student performance in a tertiary preparatory course</field><field name="creator">Carmichael, Colin S.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: In this dissertation a review of the literature as it applies to the modelling of educational performance data is undertaken. Statistical linear models, including the novel Beta, Tweedie and Tobit regression models, are then applied to the performance data of students who have undertaken a preparatory mathematics course. These models are then critically reviewed and compared with the commonly used standard linear regression model.Issues that arise from the application of statistical linear models to educational performance data are then explored. For example, the effects of non-Normality, which characterizes educational performance data, and thepresence of large numbers of students who fail to complete the course (a characteristic of this particular context), are examined and reported. Both of these effects can violate the underlying assumptions of the standard linearregression model. Simulation studies are then used to assess the appropriateness of the linear model when it is applied under the condition of non-Normality and the presence of large numbers of missing observations.Findings from this study indicate that issues relating to model effectiveness are clouded in the educational context by typically large values of the error variance (high noise) and the difficulty in finding suitable performancepredictors. Educational models of performance typically lack statistical power, so that in many instances it doesn&#8217;t matter what model is applied to the data. Nevertheless, the study highlights many reasons why modelsalternative to the standard linear regression model should be applied to such data. For example, in situations where the effect is not constant over the entire domain of the explanatory variable, a linear model based upon the betadistribution will be much more appropriate. Similarly, in situations where the performance data contains exact zeros (for example the performance of students who withdraw from the course without providing any measure of achievement) it is more appropriate to use a Tweedie linear model than the standard linear regression model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">modelling;</field><field name="subject">educational</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">data;</field><field name="subject">statistical</field><field name="subject">linear</field><field name="subject">models;</field><field name="subject">tertiary</field><field name="subject">preparatory</field><field name="subject">class</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003577/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian prediction distributions for some
linear models under student-t errors</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Azizur</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This thesis investigates the prediction distributions of future response(s), conditional on a set of realized responses for some linear models havingstudent-t error distributions by the Bayesian approach under the uniform priors. The models considered in the thesis are the multiple regression modelwith multivariate-t errors and the multivariate simple as well as multiple re-gression models with matrix-T errors. For the multiple regression model, results reveal that the prediction distribution of a single future response anda set of future responses are a univariate and multivariate Student-t distributions respectively with appropriate location, scale and shape parameters.The shape parameter of these prediction distributions depend on the size of the realized responses vector and the dimension of the regression parameters' vector, but do not depend on the degrees of freedom of the error distribu-tion. In the multivariate case, the distribution of a future responses matrix from the future model, conditional on observed responses matrix from the realized model for both the multivariate simple and multiple regression mod-els is matrix-T distribution with appropriate location matrix, scale factors and shape parameter. The results for both of these models indicate that prediction distributions depend on the realized responses only through the sample regression matrix and the sample residual sum of squares and products matrix. The prediction distribution also depends on the design matricesof the realized as well as future models. The shape parameter of the prediction distribution of the future responses matrix depends on size of the realized sample and the number of regression parameters of the multivariatemodel. Furthermore, the prediction distributions are derived by the Bayesian method as multivariate-t and matrix-T are identical to those obtained under normal errors' distribution by the di&#174;erent statistical methods such as the classical, structural distribution and structural relations of the model approaches. This indicates not only the inference robustness with respect todepartures from normal error to Student-t error distributions, but also indicates that the Bayesian approach with a uniform prior is competitive withother statistical methods in the derivation of prediction distribution.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bayesian;</field><field name="subject">prediction</field><field name="subject">distributions;</field><field name="subject">student-t</field><field name="subject">errors</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003581/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of sex hormones on cardiac and skeletal muscle function in the MDX mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</field><field name="creator">Bookless, Connie</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal recessive genetic human disease affecting one in 3500 live male births. DMD is progressive, there is no cure, and patients typically die of respiratory or cardiac failure intheir second decade of life. Clinical disease symptoms are exacerbated at the onset of puberty and the physiological basis of this is unknown. The mdx mouse is the preferred experimental animal model of DMD, although aspectsof the model remain poorly understood. This dissertation characterises physiological and histological features of the dystrophic mdx mouse in response to manipulations of hormonal status including testosterone treatment, surgical castration, and oestrogen treatment. Sex-specificdifferences in the mdx were also examined. Furthermore, physiological and histological features of the dystrophic mdx mouse model throughout the mdx lifespan were evaluated. Cardiac muscle contractility, left atrial response to exogenous calcium, and the contractile properties of both fast-twitch (EDL)and slow-twitch (SOL) skeletal muscles were examined in male mdx miceranging from 14 to 330 days of age. Testosterone treatment produced a nonsignificant trend towards a dose-dependent decrease in both basal and maximal left atrial contractility in the mdx. Surgical castration produced nosignificant cardiac effects within mouse strains. The mdx castrates had a 45% lower maximum atrial force of contraction than control castrates (p&lt;0.05). Conversely, oestrogen treatment significantly improved cardiaccontractility in the mdx. An increase in basal left atrial contractility was evident at doses of 0.08 mg/kg/day (p&lt;0.05) and 0.16 mg/kg/day (p&lt;0.01)and in maximum left atrial contractility at a dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day (p&lt;0.01). Gender studies showed cardiac forces in mdx were not different between males and females at any age tested and that both sexes in mdx had adampened cardiac responsiveness to exogenous calcium. Skeletal muscle function studies showed that castration produced a 25% increase in mdx EDL specific force generation (p&lt;0.01) and no increase in SOL forces.Oestrogen treatment produced a non-significant trend towards increased EDL forces and a 29% increase in SOL specific force at a dose of 0.16mg/kg/day (p&lt;0.05). Gender studies revealed no differences between male and female mdx in terms of skeletal muscle force production. Further to the hormonal investigations, lifespan characterisation studies revealed that themdx mouse showed reduced basal and maximal left atrial contractility specifically at ages 14 and 90 days (p&lt;0.05). Skeletal muscle studies showed that specific tetanic force production was significantly lower thancontrols at 19 (p&lt;0.05), 21, 23, 27, and 330 days of age (p&lt;0.01) for EDL muscles and at 19, 21, and 23 days of age in SOL muscles (p&lt;0.01). These studies further improve our understanding of the mdx mouse as an experimental model of DMD and emphasises that the model is most appropriate a specific ages for specific muscles. These studies furtherillustrate that testosterone does not improve cardiac contractility in the mdx mouse but that oestrogen improves both cardiac and skeletal muscle function. Further research is warranted into the potential of oestrogen as atherapeutic agent in the treatment of both cardiac and skeletal musclemanifestations of DMD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sex</field><field name="subject">hormones;</field><field name="subject">MDX</field><field name="subject">mouse</field><field name="subject">model;</field><field name="subject">Duchenne</field><field name="subject">Muscular</field><field name="subject">Dystrophy</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003582/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of online discussion forums in supporting learning in higher education</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Jacquelin</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This study investigates the contribution of asynchronous, online discussion forums to student learning in an Australian, online postgraduate course. The study of online forums is an emerging field of research and therefore calls for a methodology suited to the context where knowledge and application is still at the exploration stage. Grounded theory &#8211; an open, qualitative methodology &#8211; was chosen as an appropriate method to explore the nature of the interaction in the online forums.The grounded theory analysis of the data revealed that participant interaction did generate instructional design knowledge across a range of conceptual levels. The study also showed that interaction was effectively facilitated through the use of asynchronous text-based forums, and that participants used the online interaction to build a learning community and to generate knowledge within the learning community. These findings, although from a small case study, help to justify the widespread use of discussion forums in higher education.The research findings revealed that participant interaction was a key component that enabled the teachers and learners to build and participate in an online learning community. The subcategories that emerged from participant interaction &#8211; teaching role, building a learning community and generating knowledge &#8211; were all contributing categories to the core category: interaction as a facilitator of learning. Research revealed that the teacher had an important role in managing and facilitating the interactive online learning environment, through both design and implementation of the course. The teaching role was complex and integral in the building of a learning community and facilitating knowledge generation.One outcome of particular interest for online researchers is that most of the categories that emerged from the data in this study strongly correlated to the categories in the Interaction Analysis Model (IAM); as well as categories identified by the Canadian Institute of Distance Education Research (CIDER), the research arm of the Centre for Distance Education at Athabasca University. The grounded theory approach in this study generated similar categories to CIDER and IAM, despite the research being conducted without any reference to categories existing in the literature. The correlation between the CIDER, IAM and my categories provides credibility to each set of research outcomes. Also, it can be argued that the correlation between findings of independently conducted research studies means that these categories can be more confidently generalised to other online contexts. While the CIDER categories are now being applied in a number of empirical studies, I suggest that further research in a range of contexts is required to confirm whether these are &#8220;the&#8221; important variables in online interaction.The grounded theory approach generated categories unique to this research and provided a framework for the design and implementation of interactive online learning. From these findings, the literature, and personal experience, recommendations are presented in regard to design principles, a design framework, and implementation strategies and tactics. The implications of online learning for institutional policy and practice are outlined, and a reflection on the online teaching role is presented &#8211; one that challenges some existing conceptions of a diminished role for online teachers. The debate surrounding the role of teaching in learning-centred pedagogy is an important discussion for higher education.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">and</field><field name="subject">teaching;</field><field name="subject">interaction;</field><field name="subject">computer-mediated</field><field name="subject">communication;</field><field name="subject">grounded</field><field name="subject">theory</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003588/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficiency, productivity, change and market structure of the banking industry in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Seelanatha, Senarath</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: During the last 27 years, the banking industry in Sri Lanka has undergone a series of changes through financial reforms, advancement of communication and information technologies, globalisation of financial services, and economic development. Those changes should have had a considerable effect on efficiency, productivity change, market structure and performance in the banking industry. The motivation of this study is to investigate empirically the impact of those changes on the banking industry. Thus, this study aims to address three main research issues related to the banking industry in Sri Lanka, namely:1. Whether deregulation of the financial services sector has led to improvement in efficiency and productivity gains.2. Whether banks&#8217; inefficiency in the banking industry in Sri Lanka is determined by a set of microeconomic and macroeconomic variables.3. Whether the changes in efficiency or changes in market structure have influenced the overall operational performance of banks in Sri Lanka.This study adopts a non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) to measure efficiency and productivity gains of banks in Sri Lanka using financial and other information representing all local banks over a sixteen year period from 1989 to 2004. Input and output variables are refined to represent the intermediation and assets transformation roles of banks. Window analysis of mean estimated efficiency scores in both aspects indicates a negative trend in estimated efficiency during the study period. However, the analysis of efficiency scores (intermediation) of different forms of banks shows a negative trend during the first half of the study period and a slight positive trend during the end of the second half. These results imply that deregulation may have failed to improve the efficiency of the Sri Lankan banking industry in the short-term. However, the expected benefits of deregulation can be achieved in the long-term. Interestingly, the two state-owned banks have responded poorly to the initial phase of Sri Lankan financial reforms. However, the improved autonomy given to boards of management under the commercialisation process has led not only to improved efficiency, but also to the reduction of the efficiency gap between the state-owned banks and privately-owned banks. The analysis of efficiency scores (asset transformation) of different forms of banks records a stable trend in estimated efficiency. On the otherhand, estimated MPIs show that Sri Lankan banks have focused on improving productivity in the asset transformation process rather than the intermediationprocess.Analysis of determinants of technical efficiency shows that technical efficiency in intermediation has positive relationships with variables such as profitability,operational risk, purchased funds, liquidity and stock market capitalization; and negative relationships with variables such as product quality and line of business(commercial bank). Further, results show that efficiency in the asset transformation process has positive relationships with capital strength, operational risk, and market capitalisation; and negative relationships with line of business ownership (privately owned banks) and old banks. The investigation of influence of market structure and efficiency on operational performance finds that banks&#8217; relative market power and technical efficiency have a significant influence on their return on assets (ROA). Noevidence supports any relationship of net interest margin with variables such as market power, concentration and efficiency.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">banking</field><field name="subject">industry;</field><field name="subject">Sri</field><field name="subject">Lanka;</field><field name="subject">efficiency;</field><field name="subject">productivity;</field><field name="subject">change;</field><field name="subject">market</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003589/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accomplishing identity in bilingual interaction: codeswitching practices among a group of multiethnic Japanese teenagers</field><field name="creator">Greer, Timothy S.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The number of so-called &#8216;half-Japanese&#8217; children (haafu) has been increasing in Japan over the last twenty years, and one place in which such multiethnic people exist in community is in the international school system. Although international schools typically deliver their curricula in English, most multiethnic students are equally familiar with the dominant Japanese culture and language, and can alternate between English and Japanese to accomplish discourse functions and express their hybrid identities. However, little research has been conducted into the bilingual interactional practices that multiethnic Japanese people use to accomplish aspects of their identity in mundane conversation.In conjunction with ethnographic observations and focus group discussions, this study adopts a conversational analytic (CA) approach to investigate some of these interactional practices. Specifically, the investigation draws on video-recorded data of the participants&#8217; speech in naturally occurring conversations to explore the role of codeswitching in co-constructing aspects of identity in interaction with others.The study draws on Membership Categorization Analysis to examine the participants&#8217; use of competency-related category bound activities to index identity in mundane talk, and Conversation Analysis to explore the role of discursive and situated identities in indexing transportable identities like &#8216;multiethnic Japanese&#8217; in bilingual interaction. The investigation found several bilingual practices that index identity in multi-party talk, including the use of forward-oriented self-repair in bilingual word search sequences and backwards-oriented repair to design a translation in bilingual multi-party talk for a known non-native (or novice) speaker. In combination with embodied practices such as gaze shift, these bilingual practices worked by altering the participant constellation to partition recipients based on their perceived language preference.Throughout the study, mundane talk is seen as a key site in which multiethnic identity is made visible and co-accomplished by the participants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">identity;</field><field name="subject">bilingual</field><field name="subject">interaction;</field><field name="subject">multiethnic;</field><field name="subject">Japanese;</field><field name="subject">codeswitching;</field><field name="subject">mundane</field><field name="subject">conversation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003592/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New product development in start-up technology-based firms (STBFs)</field><field name="creator">Beven, Peter W.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]:Firms undertaking new product development are faced with an environment which ischaracterised by long lead times from basic research to industrial application, acommercialisation phase with short lead times and an increasingly accelerated rate ofobsolescence under the global competition of the new product development process.While this is true for all firms, STBFs face further complications from the inherentlyhigher risks associated with such firms. In examining how STBFs undertake their newproduct development (NPD), the relationship between corporate strategy, NPD processfeatures and new product success factors specifically need to be considered. Anadditional consideration is the role that business incubators play in assisting tenantSTBFs to undertake their new product development. As such, the theory of how newproduct development is undertaken by STBFs lies across several disciplines includingcorporate strategy theory, new product development theory, entrepreneurial theory,technology management theory, economic development theory and business incubatortheory. Specifically, the research problem for this research is: what are the origins andnature of new product development processes within STBFs and how do they contributeto STBF success?In undertaking a review of the literature some insights were obtained to specificallyexplain how STBFs undertake their new product development, the relationship betweenNPD process activity and new product and firm success and the role of businessincubators. As a result, a theoretical framework was developed which in turn, resulted inthree research questions:RQ 1: What elements of NPD are adopted by STBFs when developing new products?RQ 2: How does the lack of adoption of the elements of NPD contribute to new productand firm failure in STBFs?RQ 3: How and in what ways do business incubators influence the performance of theelements of NPD adopted by STBFs?A three-stage qualitative research design within the realism paradigm was used for thisresearch. It combined exploratory interviews with a case study methodology in order tobuild theory through induction. This was then followed up with a series of interviews todiscover which firms had experienced product failure, had discontinued their NPDprocess and/or had suffered firm failure over the duration of the study. As a result,meaningful insights were able to be obtained into the relationships between the adoptionof elements of NPD, new product failure and firm failure in the context of STBFs.The findings revealed that there were several aspects of the ways in which STBFsundertake their new product development activities which were not identified in theliterature. In this respect, it was evident that unlike larger and established firms in whichnew product development activity is derived out of corporate strategy, STBFs undertakecorporate strategy development as a component of new product development. It was alsofound that the corporate strategy &#8211; product development nexus was not linear but rathercomprised a number of close inter-relationships between elements of corporate strategy,NPD process features and new product success factors requiring parallel activity.Furthermore, the majority of STBFs adopted only 15 of the 22 best practice elements ofNPD proposed as part of the theoretical framework of new product development inSTBFs. In addition, it was found that the STBFs that suffered failure over the course ofthe study adopted comparatively fewer elements of NPD than did their continuing STBFcounterparts.Importantly, it was also found that business incubators provided only a modest positiveinfluence on the performance of NPD activities by their tenant STBFs. Moreover, asSTBFs are commonly single product centric, that is their overall new productdevelopment effort is focused on a single product or a narrow product line, therelationships between new product development effectiveness, new product success andfirm success are closely aligned. More specifically, ineffective support for NPD activitiescan lead to a potential lack of effectiveness of business incubators in reducing the risk of failure of their tenant STBFs. This is despite the more general focus of businessincubators in assisting tenant STBFs with corporate strategy development.The main contribution of this theory building research was the development of anempirically confirmed, theoretical and practical model for the development andmanagement of new product development by start-up technology based firms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">new</field><field name="subject">product</field><field name="subject">development;</field><field name="subject">start-up</field><field name="subject">technology-based</field><field name="subject">firms</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003594/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The unemployment experience: psychological factors influencing mental health, coping behaviours, and employment outcomes</field><field name="creator">Hoare, Patricia Nancey</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: A stress and coping framework was used to explore psychological factors influencing coping behaviours, mental health, and employment outcomes among the unemployed. Jahoda&#8217;s (1982) deprivation theory was also incorporated in the exploration. Jahoda proposed that unemployment not only deprives individuals of the manifest, or financial benefits, of employment, but it also deprives them of five latent, or psychosocial benefits, including collective purpose, social contact, status, time structure, and activity. Two studies were carried out, the first being a cross-sectional paper-based survey of 371 unemployed participants (214 males and 157 females, aged between 16 and 65 years) from South East Queensland. A follow-up survey was then carried out 6 months later on 115 of those same participants (59 males and 56 females, aged between 17 and 64). At Time 2, 58 participants had found jobs and 57 had remained unemployed. The variables measured in Study One included coping resources, cognitive appraisals, coping behaviours, and mental health. The coping resources included the personal resources of self-esteem, job seeking efficacy, positive affect, negative affect, and employment commitment, along with financial resources, measured by net fortnightly income, and social resources, measured by social contact during leisure. Job seeking efficacy was measured by self-promotion efficacy and task-focused efficacy. The former involves interpersonal tasks, such as promoting oneself to others as a job seeker, whilst the latter is more impersonal and involves tasks such as writing a resume. The cognitive appraisal variables included employment expectation, satisfaction with employment status, leisure meaningfulness, economic deprivation, and perceived access to the five latent benefits of employment, outlined by Jahoda. The coping behaviours included leisure activity and job search behaviours, including job applications, job search intensity, and job search methods. Mental health was measured by the GHQ-12 (Goldberg, 1972). The same variables were measured in Study Two, with the exception of the leisure variables. Other variables measured in Study Two included job satisfaction and job quality. Study One found that the most consistent predictors of job search behaviours were geographic region, employment commitment, and self-promotion efficacy, with participants living in the metropolitan area, those with a higher commitment to work, and those with greater efficacy being more actively engaged in job seeking. Leisure activity was significantly correlated with mental health and was predicted by availability of financial resources, positive affect, time structure, leisure meaningfulness, and level of education. That is, more frequent leisure activity was associated with being less financially restricted, higher positive affect, greater time structure, more meaningful leisure, and higher levels of education. Mental health was predicted by self-esteem, positive affect, negative affect, employment commitment, satisfaction with employment status, and financial hardship. Participants with better personal coping resources, greater satisfaction with their employment status, and less financial hardship were less likely to have clinical symptoms. The aforementioned variables accounted for 56% of the variance in mental health, and the logistic regression model correctly classified over 84% of cases as having clinical or non-clinical symptoms. The same model, with the exception of employment commitment, was tested in Study Two for the 57 continuously unemployed participants. It accounted for 62% of the variance in mental health, with similar classification accuracy to that at Time 1. The mental health of the 58 employed participants at Time 2 was predicted by occupation, collective purpose, activity, positive affect, and negative affect. Participants in higher skilled occupations, with higher collective purpose, greater activity, higher positive affect, and lower negative affect were less likely to have clinical symptoms. Those variables accounted for 62% of the variance in mental health and correctly classified 84.5% of cases as being clinical or non-clinical. One of the consistent predictors of job search behaviours at Time 2 was job search training. Participants who had completed a training program some time during the 6 months of the research project were more actively looking for work. Training did not, however, enhance participants&#8217; job seeking efficacy or employment expectations. Study Two demonstrated that self-promotion efficacy, employment expectations, and job search behaviours had deteriorated over the 6 month research period, whilst task-focused efficacy increased. Employment status (i.e., gaining employment or remaining unemployed) was predicted by age, job applications, satisfaction with employment status, self-promotion efficacy, employment commitment, and time structure. Job acquisition was predicted by being younger, having submitted more job applications, being dissatisfied with employment status, having higher self-promotion efficacy, having higher employment commitment, and having less structured time. The logistic regression model including those variables accounted for 28% of the variance in employment status (employed or unemployed). Results of a mixed design analysis of variance in Study Two demonstrated that self-esteem, negative affect, satisfaction with employment status, financial hardship, financial strain, social contact, time structure, and mental health were all positively influenced by gaining employment, but showed either very little change or deteriorated for participants who remained unemployed. This research identified important predictors of coping behaviours, mental health, and job acquisition that can be used as a guide for developing suitable intervention strategies for the unemployed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">unemployed;</field><field name="subject">unemployment;</field><field name="subject">psychological</field><field name="subject">factors;</field><field name="subject">mental</field><field name="subject">health;</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">behaviours;</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">outcomes;</field><field name="subject">Jahoda;</field><field name="subject">deprivation</field><field name="subject">theory</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003600/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audit committees and financial reporting quality</field><field name="creator">Baxter, Peter J.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]:This research investigated whether the formation of audit committees and their characteristics are associated with improved financial reporting quality. Modified versions of the models developed by Jones (1991) and Dechow and Dichev (2002) provided three measures of earnings quality, which were used to proxy for financial reporting quality. The audit committee characteristics investigated were: independence, expertise, activity, size and tenure.Several contributions to knowledge are made by this research. First, this research examined the association between audit committee formation and financial reporting quality. This could not be done in many of the prior studies that used data on companies in the United States (Klein 2002a; Xie, Davidson and DaDalt 2003a; Bedard, Chtourou and Courteau 2004; Vafeas 2005; Yang and Krishnan 2005; Dhaliwal, Naiker and Navissi 2006), where audit committees have been mandatory for companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1978. A large number of public and private sector groups have recommended mandatory audit committee establishment for all Australian listed companies. However, there has been a lack of empirical support for these recommendations and this research provides evidence regarding this association.Second, audit committees are more heavily regulated in the United States than Australia. Given the relative lack of audit committee regulation for Australian companies, Australia represented a richer empirical setting for the examination of the association between audit committee characteristics and financial reporting quality. The use of Australian company data for the selected time period, avoided the confounding effect of regulation on this association.Third, this research used both a modified version of the traditional Jones (1991) discretionary accruals model and the more recently developed accrual estimation error model from Dechow and Dichev (2002) to estimate proxies for financial reporting quality. Most of the prior studies predominantly used the Jones (1991) model, which has been subject to criticism in the literature. Therefore, the use of multiple models provides more powerful tests of the association between audit committees and financial reporting quality. Finally, this research included changes tests in addition to cross-sectional tests to reduce the likelihood of problems with omitted variables.Several conclusions can be drawn from the results. First, there was some evidence that earnings quality measured using the modified Jones (1991) model significantly reduced in the year following audit committee formation, thus providing some support for the notion that the formation of audit committees improves financial reporting quality. However, a comparison of these results with those of tests using earnings quality measures based on Dechow and Dichev (2002) indicates that audit committees appear more effective at reducing opportunistic earnings management, rather than total accrual estimation errors. Second, there was little evidence of a significant association between the characteristics of audit committees and improved financial reporting quality. Consequently, it can be suggested that, once audit committees are established, variations in their characteristics do not significantly affect financial reporting quality.These conclusions provide support for the mandatory audit committee requirement under the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listing rules, which became effective from 1 January 2003. However, there are doubts over the usefulness of several aspects of the ASX Corporate Governance Council's recommendations concerning the composition and size of audit committees.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">audit</field><field name="subject">committees;</field><field name="subject">financial</field><field name="subject">reporting</field><field name="subject">quality</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003632/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-evaluating land use choices to incorporate carbon values: a case study in the South Burnett region of Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Maraseni, Tek Narayan</field><field name="description">[Abstract]:Land use change from forest to non-forest use is a major source of greenhouse gases in Australia. From 1996, the Queensland Government provided incentives for landholders to plant ex-pasture and cropping areas with hardwood plantations through the Southeast Queensland Regional Forest Agreement program. Spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora subspecies Variegata) was a target hardwood species for Southeast Queensland (SEQ); however, the long-term viability of timber-alone plantations relative to cropping and livestock production, in the medium to low rainfall areas of SEQ, and elsewhere in Australia, is questionable. Carbon credits resulting from additional carbon sequestration may change the relative profitability of these land uses. The aim of this research was to compare spotted gum plantations with peanut-maize cultivation and beef pasture in low rainfall areas, incorporating carbon values.This study covers all variable costs and benefits, and different sources and sinks of three major greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. For the case study of three land use systems (maize-peanut cropping, pasture, and spotted gum plantations in the Kingaroy district of SEQ), production, carbon sequestration and emissions data were supplemented by formal and informal interviews with landholders, agronomists, sawmill staff and government extension personnel. Forest inventory, biomass and soil sampling, and stakeholder interviews were used as sources of primary data. The costs and benefits of all land use systems were converted into monetary terms and discounted to produce net present values. If the comparison of net present values is limited to traditional benefits (i.e. income from crops and hay in cultivation, beef in pasture and timber in plantation), cultivation is the most profitable option, followed by pasture and plantations. Even after the inclusion of beef value, plantations could not compete with other land use systems. After the inclusion of greenhouse gas value, plantations were the most profitable option, followed by pasture and cultivation. However, if the carbon price was reduced from the price assumed in this thesis of $10.5 t-1CO2e to $4.3 t-1CO2e, cultivation would remain the most profitable option. If the currently used nominal (pre-text) discount rate (six percent) increased to seven or eight percent, the optimal rotation of plantation would reduce from 34 to 31 years and 29 years, respectively. At a seven percent discount rate, plantations would be a less profitable than pasture, but marginally more profitable than cultivation. If the discount rate were eight percent, plantations would be less profitable than both pasture and cultivation.These findings have some implications for attempts to increase the plantation estate to three million hectares by 2020, through policy frameworks such as the Australian Government&#8217;s &#8216;Vision 2020&#8217;. Therefore, this study has recommended several measures to increase the benefits from plantations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">greenhouse</field><field name="subject">gas;</field><field name="subject">land</field><field name="subject">use;</field><field name="subject">carbon</field><field name="subject">values;</field><field name="subject">South</field><field name="subject">Burnett;</field><field name="subject">Queensland;</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003655/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intermediate and advanced piano music of Dmitry Kabalevsky: pedagogical implications</field><field name="creator">Pingel, Kathy</field><field name="description">This study investigates the intermediate and advanced piano repertoire of 20th Century Russian composer, Dmitry Borisovich Kabalevsky, with the main focus being on the artistic and pedagogical relevance of these works.Background details of the composer's life, as they pertain to these works and to his style of composition, were gathered through a review of the literature found in books, doctoral theses, encyclopedias, journal articles and programme notes accompanying compact disc recordings and editions of his music.A selection of Kabalevsky's intermediate and advanced piano compositions was chosen for an in-depth analysis of their artistic, technical and pedagogical aspects. A broad examination of their structure is also made. The works selected for analysis include Concerto No. 2 in G minor Op. 23, Numbers 1,2,3,4,6 and 24 from Twenty-Four Preludes Op. 38 and Sonata No. 2 in E flat major Op. 45. In order to gauge both the level of awareness and usage of Kabalevsky's piano repertoire, two written surveys were formulated and issued to teachers and performers within Australia. The first of these (Survey A) was distributed to private studio teachers, most of whom were teaching at an elementary and intermediate level, whilst the second one (Survey B) was sent to  teachers who were likely to have had experience in teaching and/or performing more advanced  works. In order to determine the frequency with which Kabalevksy's piano works are set for examinations, a review of various syllabuses, including the Australian Music Examination Board (AMEB), Trinity College of London and Austrlaina and New Zealand Cultural Arts Limited (ANZCA), was undertaken. These findings, together with the results of the surveys (which include comments made by a number of teachers/performers within Australia about a selection of these pieces) and the researcher's in-depth analyses, were all considered in ascertaining the usage and level of awareness of Kabalevsky's intermediate and advanced piano repertoire within Australia and the artistic and pedagogical contribution of these works. The in-depth analyses of a selection of Kabalevsky's intermediate and advanced piano works revealed that Kabalevsky made a worthy contribution to the piano literature of this standard, and that these works are also of considerable pedagogical value. The feedback from the surveys revealed that whilst most of the respondents had a high repect and regard for Kabalevsky's elementary piano compositions, the usage and familiarity with his intermediate and advanced works was significantly less. Many of the factors suggested for the lack of awareness of this repertoire were extraneous to the merits of the pieces themselves and, hence, it is hoped that a greater awareness of its existence and an appreciation of the artistic and pedagogical contribution of this literature, will bring it to the attention of students, teachers and performers alike.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">keyboard music</field><field name="subject">piano teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003837/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stratified protocols for mobile gaming</field><field name="creator">Koh, Sunny</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Mobile Games are becoming very popular. Players play games under various conditions and so we need protocols which can adapt. However, unlike the desktop, there are many issues with that of mobile communication. This dissertation proposes a stratified protocol to be implemented in order to solve these communication problems more effectively. The protocol itself dynamically adapts to the changing bandwidth capacity of the network. The term stratified means that the payload in the protocol packets is subdivided into different categories, or strata, of data which are handled differently dependingon network conditions. Such a protocol needs to be responsible as it must make decisions which do notworsen the problem of network congestion when it arises.An experiment was conducted with a view to determining whether it is important to address difficulties with technical quality of communication. This experiment showedthat gaming satisfaction of players does depend on technical quality of communication and that the way in which this dependence on technical quality is exhibited depends upon the particular gaming genre. This dependence on genre and the fact that different games make use of communication services differently suggests that stratification of communication protocols could be useful.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobile</field><field name="subject">games;</field><field name="subject">mobile</field><field name="subject">gaming;</field><field name="subject">stratified;</field><field name="subject">protocols</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003851/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The principal in a process of school revitalisation: a metastrategic role</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Allan Robert</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: The educational literature has popularised models of school leadership such as Instructional, Transformational, Strategic, Educative, and Servant Leadership. Whilst valuable as ways of conceptualising leadership styles, worldviews, traits, roles and functions of individual principals, these models fall short of capturing the dynamic between the outcomes of leadership and the leadership process in contemporary school contexts. Distributed leadership theory is held by many to be more attuned to the post-industrial needs of organisations, and its influence on educational research has seen the emergence of new ways of comprehending leadership in schools. One influential example is &#8216;parallel leadership&#8217;, a derivative of distributed leadership that describes teachers as leaders of curriculum and pedagogy and principals as metastrategic leaders. This study looks specifically at the leadership processes of a small sample of principals in the process of school revitalisation titled IDEAS (Innovative Designs for Enhancing the Achievements of Schools). A key motivation for this study was that the concept of &#8216;parallel leadership&#8217; had been subjected to little serious critique. Uncertainty surrounded how principals in IDEAS schools conceptualised their leadership, and what impacts experience with the IDEAS Project has on conceptions of leadership. The purpose of this study was to tease out the meanings that a sample of principals gave to their highly complex role as principal, whilst engaging with the concept of &#8216;parallel leadership&#8217; during their schools&#8217; implementations of IDEAS.  The Research Problem was stated as: What conceptions of principal leadership arise out of a sample of principals&#8217; experiences with a process of school revitalisation that emphasises a distributed approach to school leadership? The overarching inquiry took the form of a multi-case or collective case study and comprised four principals who had engaged with IDEAS over a period of at least two years. Data collection strategies included the in-depth interview, which was chosen as the primary method for informants to describe their perceptions of their leadership, together with concept mapping and a structured interview that was utilised to gain staff perceptions of informants&#8217; leadership. Methods of analysis involved detailed transcriptions of taped interviews and tools derived from the literature review that were used to code and categorise the texts of interviews.Crowther et al. (2001) proposed a Model of Successful School Revitalisation as a result of their research conducted under the auspices of the Australian Research Council and Commonwealth Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DETYA). Source: (Crowther, Hann &amp; McMaster 2001, p. 141). First, the Model identifies principal leadership and teacher leadership as each having concrete meaning and significance and that success occurs through a mutual and respectful association. This relationship is captured by the authors in the new concept of &#8216;parallel leadership&#8217;. Second, the Model makes clear a view that effective school leadership impacts three school processes that are conceptualised as culture building, shared approach to pedagogy and schoolwide learning. Third, the Model proposes that through the enrichment and integration of these three processes school outcomes are enhanced.This study focussed on the principal leadership aspect of &#8216;parallel leadership&#8217; and resulted in a Model of Metastrategic Principal Leadership that conceptualises the intersection of principal leadership and the ideas process which Crowther et al. described as the Stimulus.The present study thereby extends the definition of &#8216;parallel leadership&#8217; by describing how principals contribute to transformations of leadership, learning, and pedagogy through three principal-led processes. The proposed Model of Metastrategic Principal Leadership suggests that when activated by a principal&#8217;s continuous professional learning the combination of the interactions of personal style (Personal), the process of revitalisation (Processual), and personal conceptualisation of role (Conceptual) result in principal-led processes that support successful school revitalisation. The three principal-led processes that were uncovered are described as re-imaging school leadership, support of organisation-wide learning, and management of meaning.The researcher hopes the outcomes of the study will be of benefit to principals and teachers in the increasing numbers of schools now engaging with IDEAS across Australia and internationally. A further hope is that the present study&#8217;s descriptions of new ways of comprehending leadership in schools might be of assistance to school practitioners seeking to move from traditional to distributed forms of leadership and also educational theorists who are working in the field of school improvement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">leadership;</field><field name="subject">distributed</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">theory;</field><field name="subject">parallel</field><field name="subject">leadership;</field><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">revitalisation;</field><field name="subject">IDEAS;</field><field name="subject">Innovative</field><field name="subject">Designs</field><field name="subject">for</field><field name="subject">Enhancing</field><field name="subject">the</field><field name="subject">Achievements</field><field name="subject">of</field><field name="subject">Schools</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004077/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At the heart of school change: the experience of participation in a whole-school revitalisation project</field><field name="creator">Dunne, Trudy Anne</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: What is at the heart of whole school change? The focus of this research is how a whole school revitalisation process impacted on the professional community, professional learnings and professional practices in a secondary Catholic College in regional southeast Queensland. It identifies the factors within the school context that impacted on the progress of the project.A review of literature provides support for each of the dimensions of the focus of the research, the research-based framework of the revitalisation project and the factors relevant to a whole school change process. The research paradigm involves interpretivist inquiry, the methodology is case study and a narrative method is used to interpret and present the study. Multiple sources of data are employed: three sets of semi-structured interviews conducted over a three year period from 2004 to 2006; the researcher&#8217;s journal; and school documents.Some evidence indicates that the revitalisation project had some impact upon the development of a shared vision and improved whole school collaboration and professional dialogue. The implementation of the change process led to an increase in whole school professional development which impacted on teachers&#8217; shared understandings of pedagogical principles and further there is some evidence of perceived change in teachers&#8217; professional practices as a result of engagement in the project.The study identifies cultural and other factors existing in the school which hindered the progress of the change process. These include teachers&#8217; resistance to change, a culture of &#8216;blame&#8217;, and a lack of teacher leadership and of collaborative decision making on the part of the school leadership team. One outcome of the study was the construction of a set of recommendations to assist a school in overcoming the impact of these identified hindrances to the change process.A model of effective change is developed as a second key outcome of the study. The model is consistent with the key &#8220;school change&#8221; literature, but its significance lies in the unique context from which it was drawn.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whole</field><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">change;</field><field name="subject">whole</field><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">revitalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004078/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a decision support system for furrow
and border irrigation</field><field name="creator">McClymont, David Jeffrey</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Furrow and border irrigation practices in Australia and around the world are typically inefficient. Recent advances in computer-based surface irrigationdecision support technology have the potential to improve performance, but have had little uptake. Despite considerable academic achievements with individualcomponents of the technology, the implementation of this knowledge into usable tools has been immature, hindering adoption. In particular, there has been littleprogress in encapsulating the different decision support components into a standalone system for surface irrigation. Therefore, the research problem addressed in this dissertation aims to develop a new decision support system for furrow and border irrigation aimed at increasing the usability of the technology, and improving decision making capabilities. Specifically the research hypothesis is:&#8220;That calibration, optimisation, and parameter analysis capabilities can be developed and integrated with an accurate and robust simulation model into a decision support system to improve furrow and border irrigation performance.&#8221;Six research objectives have been identified to support the hypothesis including: (RO1) investigate existing surface irrigation modelling technology to determine amodel and solution technique structure suitable for incorporating into a decision support system; (RO2) develop a robust reliable simulation engine for furrow andborder irrigation for automation within a decision support system under optimisation and systematic response evaluation; (RO3) investigate and develop parameter estimation (calibration) capabilities for the decision support system; (RO4) investigate and develop optimisation capabilities for the decision support system; (RO5) investigate and develop parameter response (design charts)capabilities for the decision support system; and (RO6) develop an objectoriented framework to combine the components developed in Research Objectives 2 to 5 with data management facilities and a graphical user interface.Successful completion of these objectives has resulted in the development of a decision support system for furrow and border irrigation featuring an automationcapablehydrodynamic simulation engine, automated full-hydrodynamic inverse solution, automated optimisation of design and management variables, and automated user-definable real-time generation of system response. This wascombined with a highly flexible object-oriented program structure and webbrowser-like graphical user interface. Each of these components represents a unique implementation of the required functionalities, differing from the established software packages (such as SIRMOD and WinSRFR) that use alternate technologies with no automation or optimisation capabilities.Development of the hydrodynamic simulation engine has involved the refinement of the commonly used implicit double-sweep methodology with the objectives ofachieving robustness and reliability under automation. It was subsequently found that only subtle changes and manipulations were required in much of thenumerical methodology, including derivation of simplified solution equations. The main focus of this research has targeted the computational algorithms that drivethe numerical solution process. Key factors effecting robustness and reliability were identified in a study of simulation operation, and treated through thesealgorithms. Validation was undertaken against output from the SIRMOD simulation engine, with robustness and reliability tested through tens of thousands of simulations under optimisation and automated system response evaluation.The calibration facilities demonstrated that the inverse-solution using the fullhydrodynamic model is a viable and robust methodology for the unique identification of up to three infiltration/roughness parameters. Two optimisationmethods were investigated during this research with objective-functions based upon either a volume-balance time-of-advance equation, or complete simulationsof the hydrodynamic model. A simple but robust optimisation algorithm was designed for this purpose. While the volume-balance method proved fast andreliable, its accuracy is reduced due to the underlying assumptions and simplistic model structure. The hydrodynamic method was shown to be accurate, althoughit suffered slow execution times. It was therefore decided to use the two methods in tandem during the solution process where the faster volume-balance method is used to provide starting estimates for the more accuratehydrodynamic method. Response-surface investigation for the advance-based objective function identified a unique solution when solving for three parameters.It was found that the automated unconstrained optimisation of design and management practices is limited to the selection of one solution variable (time to cut-off) due to non-unique multi-variable solutions. Nevertheless, the developed facilities provide a unique benchmarking of irrigation performance potential. This research has used the earlier-developed optimisation algorithm to automatesimulations using a prototype objective-function based upon user-defined weightings of key performance measures. A study of the response-surfaces ofdifferent configurations of the objective-function identified parabolic ridges of alternate solutions, so, in practice, the optimisation process simplifies down tooptimising only one parameter: time-to-cutoff. It was also recognized that the performance-based objective functions are highly sensitive to numerical discretisation inconsistencies that occur between simulations, which impede solution convergence.The highly customisable, automated, system response evaluation facilities developed in this research offer potential as both a research and practitionertool, capable of multidimensional analysis of irrigation systems subject to temporal and spatial infiltration variations. A preliminary study demonstrated theimportance of infiltration variation on irrigation decision-making, and provided initial guideline layout designs that combined the effects of variable infiltrationand three decision variables using a fixed management strategy of minimising runoff. A limited range of response outputs for a fixed management objectivenegated the potential benefit of visualising a large number of dimensions. Nevertheless, this study provided direction for the subsequent software development with recommendations including: representing system outputs ascontours and iso-curves, rather than by the chart axes; representing different infiltration conditions in separate design charts; allowing the user to assignvariables to each chart axis; and representing only two decision variables in each chart.Finally, the simulation, calibration, optimisation and parameter analysis components were combined with a database and graphical user interface todevelop the FIDO (Furrow Irrigation Decision Optimiser) decision support system. There were three focus areas during this marriage of components; firstly, anobject-oriented structure was developed to accommodate program elements concentrating on separating the graphical user interface components from other task related objects for flexible future development; secondly, a database wasdeveloped using XML-based technologies to store property, paddock, event and model information; and thirdly, a user-friendly graphical user interface was created with web-browser-like functionality. The software design evolved through many different prototypes with its current design being heavily influenced from the successes and mistakes of the previous attempts.This work represents the first coordinated attempt to develop a decision support system for furrow irrigation linking a database, simulation engine, calibrationfacilities, optimisation facilities, and parameter analysis capabilities. A major feature of this work is that all components of the system have been developedfrom first principles using an object-oriented structure, with the primary goal of implementation into a decision support system. This research has contributed tothe development of a professional-quality software package to improve the decision-making capabilities of researchers, irrigation consultants, and irrigators.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">furrow</field><field name="subject">irrigation;</field><field name="subject">border</field><field name="subject">irrigation;</field><field name="subject">decision</field><field name="subject">support</field><field name="subject">system</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004083/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A common storage mechanism in short-term, working and long-term memory?: some evidence from control and schizophrenia samples</field><field name="creator">Byrne, Linda Kathleen</field><field name="description">[Abstract]:Background:Baddeley and Hitch&#8217;s (1974) multi-component model of working memory (WM) has provided the basis for exploration into the nature of remembering and manipulating information over a short period of time. This model arguesthat the passive short-term storage system is not involved in the more dynamic working memory tasks and has formed the basis of much research on clinical populations known to have deficits in WM. However, other models argue that short-term memory and working memory rely on common storagefacilities. The aim of this thesis was to explore whether there is justification for the continued separation of WM into fractionated components.Schizophrenia (SZ) is associated with a wide range of cognitive deficits, including working memory problems. There is also some evidence to suggest that psychotic symptoms exist on a continuum and cognitive deficits similar to those found in SZ have been reported in people endorsing &#8220;psychotic-like&#8221; symptoms without a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia. It was hypothesizedthat the pattern of errors made by the SZ group would help to delineate the nature of deficit shown on WM tasks.Methods:General MethodsIn order to explore the structure of WM and performance of groups hypothesized to be impaired on WM tasks, a range of span and non-span tasks were administered. Forty-two (42) control subjects were recruited for the study. Based on their scores on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ - Raine, 1991), this group was divided into low scoring (NCL = 27 ) and high scoring (NCH = 15) groups. Thirty (30) people with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were also recruited.Experiment 1Experiment one investigated the performance of these groups on simple, complex and delayed span tasks. A simple four-word recall task, with and without interference was used to examine accuracy, error types and anyrelationship to symptomatology.Experiment 2Experiment two set out to investigate the contributions to span performance. All subjects were administered measures of articulation speed, lexical access ability, and a range of STM, WM and LTM tasks.Experiment 3This experiment used a cued-recall paradigm to explore proactive interference effects by manipulating phonological and semantic representations over briefperiods. The task consisted of trials where the subject studied a series of one or two blocks of four words.Results:Experiment 1The results of this experiment replicated previous findings (Tehan, Hendry &amp; Kocinski, 2001) of similar patterns of performance across the three tasks withperformance decrements increasing with task difficulty. The SZ group showed significant deficits even on the simple four-word span task. Patterns of errors were similar across the groups once overall levels of performance were taken into account. SZ subjects made more movement (order) errors than the other two groups and movement errors were associated with disorganised symptoms. The association between disorganised symptomsand loss of items from the end of the list were suggestive of impaired maintenance of item information. The high schizotypy control group performed below that of the low schizotypy controls, but only a few of the differences were significant.Experiment 2For both groups articulation and lexical access formed two of the composites. For the control group, all memory tasks contributed to form one single factor. For the SZ group three separate memory composites were needed. Usingregression analyses previous findings (Tehan &amp; Lalor, 2000; Tehan, Fogarty &amp; Ryan, 2004) were replicated for the control group with both lexical access and to a lesser degree, rehearsal speed contributing to memory performance.Rehearsal speed was a more important predictor for recall of familiar materials (such as letters and digits) in the SZ group. The reverse was true for simple word span, with lexical access making a significant impact and rehearsal speed having little impact. For more complex memory tasks,neither articulation rate nor access to lexical memory contributed to the performance of the SZ group. Once again poorer performance for the SZ group was associated with disorganised symptoms.Experiment 3The findings from this experiment revealed that even on the simple one block trials, the SZ subjects had difficulty accurately recalling the target word with acategory cue, even in the absence of distractor activity. The SZ group made more omissions and significantly more intrusion errors than the control groups. Intrusion errors were associated with disorganised symptoms on thePositive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). Despite their poorer overall performance, the SZ group did not have significantly more block-1 intrusions than the control groups suggesting that the interference effects for semantic and phonemic information were the same.Conclusions:This thesis presented evidence which is somewhat supportive of a common storage approach to WM. It calls into question the need to fractionate WMinto components. The multi-component model of WM is often used to investigate performance of SZ subjects, a population know to have WM deficits. Errors across a range of STM, WM and LTM tasks were examined in a SZ group and their performance was compared to two groups of controls: agroup with high scores on a measure of psychometric schizotypy and one with low scores. Implications regarding the purported source of deficits in WM are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">storage</field><field name="subject">mechanisms;</field><field name="subject">short-term</field><field name="subject">memory;</field><field name="subject">long-term</field><field name="subject">memory;</field><field name="subject">working</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004084/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental and teacher influences on the consumption of plain drinking water by primary school aged children</field><field name="creator">Beccaria, Lisa Mara</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: A rise in the rate of overweight and obesity in children coupled with an increasing availability and consumption of sweet drinks raises questions about the place or importance of plain water in a child&#8217;s overall nutritional intake. In terms of influencing a child&#8217;s nutritional behaviour, teachers and parents play a crucial role in educating, promoting and encouraging healthy behaviour whether that be in the home or school environment. Schools are seen to be an important setting for health promotion and as such, factors that promote healthy behaviour or barriers against it should be explored.The primary aims of this study were to 1) investigate parents&#8217; and teachers&#8217; beliefs about water consumption by children whilst at school 2) investigate how parents and teachers perceive themselves as role-models in relation to water consumption in children; and 3) investigate parents&#8217; and teachers&#8217; self-reported behaviour in relation to their promotion of water consumption. This qualitative study was based upon Social Learning Theory and used an exploratory qualitative descriptive design. Using Pender&#8217;s Health Promotion Model as a framework, data were collected from 9 participants in total (including 6 parents and 3 teachers). This included semi-structured interviews and a 24-hr Fluid Recall Form. Participants were from one regional primary state school.Thematic analysis was conducted from the data, and 9 major themes were identified. The results indicated that parents and teachers rated a high importance of their child / student drinking water. Parents and teachers were unsure as to how much water their child / student was drinking each day, nor how much was recommended for them to drink. Some parents and teachers were more active in encouraging and promoting water as a choice of drink, particularly in hotter weather or when children were active playing sport or doing Physical Education Classes. Parents and teachers reported a range of strategies that they used to encourage children to drink water and in the school setting, allowing children to have easy access to a water bottle in the classroom was seen as being positive. Some teachers were unsure what roles they could play in the school to promote water (if it was perceived as part of their role at all). In terms of perceptions of the current school water drinking facilities, many parents and teachers held negative views in terms of hygiene, location and maintenance.Establishing a habit of drinking plain water was expressed as a difficult task by some participants, citing problems with remembering and taste preferences. Results from the 24-hr Fluid Recall Form supported the fact that many parents drank only small amounts of plain water. Those parents and teachers who did drink more water participated in regular exercise, and therefore their higher water consumption may be as a result of this.A small number of parents made a connection between what fluids they consumed as a child and what they encourage their child to drink now. Some teachers hoped that by drinking water in front of children in the classroom that this might have a positive influence on the students.It was concluded that the issue of water consumption in children is worthy of further investigation. There may be opportunities within the school to adopt a &#8216;whole of school&#8217; approach whereby parents, teachers, students and the broader community work towards establishing and sustaining an environment which continues to promote healthy water drinking behaviours.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parental</field><field name="subject">influences;</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">influences;</field><field name="subject">consumption;</field><field name="subject">water;</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">consumption;</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">school</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004085/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of vision sensing in agriculture</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Mark</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: &#65279;Machine vision systems in agricultural applications are becoming commonplace as technology becomes both affordable and robust. Applications such as fruit and vegetable grading were amongst the earliest applications, but the field has diversified into areas such as yield monitoring, weed identification and spraying, and tractor guidance. 	 Machine vision systems generally consist of a number of steps that are similar between applications. These steps include image pre-processing, analysis, and post-	 processing. This leads the way towards a generalisation of the systems to an almost &#8216;colour by number&#8217; methodology where the platform may be consistent between many applications, and only algorithms specific to the application differ. 	 Shape analysis is an important part of many machine vision applications. Many methods exist for determining existence of particular objects, such as Hough Transforms and statistical matching. A method of describing the outline of objects, called s-&#968; (s-psi) offers advantages over other methods in that it reduces a two dimensional object to a series of one dimensional numbers. This graph, or chain, of numbers may be directly manipulated to perform such tasks as determining the convex hull, or template matching. 	 A machine vision system to automate yield monitoring macadamia harvesting is proposed as a partial solution to the labour shortage problems facing researchers 	 undertaking macadamia varietal trials in Australia. 	 A novel method for objectively measuring citrus texture is to measure the shape of a light terminator as the fruit is spun in front of a video camera. A system to accomplish this task is described. 	 S-psi template matching is used to identify animals to species level in another case study. The system implemented has the capability to identify animals, record video and also open or shut a gate remotely, allowing control over limited resources.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">systems;</field><field name="subject">machine</field><field name="subject">vision;</field><field name="subject">guidance;</field><field name="subject">agriculture;</field><field name="subject">agricultural</field><field name="subject">applciations</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004102/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical design aspects of a lightweight neonatal retrieval system</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Adrain Keith</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: This work involves the development of a lightweight, high efficiency, integrated Neonatal Retrieval System consistent with the requirements of medical personnel, with the capability to be loaded into ambulance vehicles without lifting.By studying the current systems in use and surveying the potential end users a basic specification is established.

Consequently, for utility connected PV generation to become a viable alternative energy source, its efficiency needs to be improved, its cost reduced, and the quality of power supplied by the inverters must meet stringent standards.This dissertation describes the research work carried out to optimise the conversion efficiency and to minimise the cost of a single-phase, hysteretic current controlunipolar switched inverter system, for use as an interface between solar panels and the grid network. The 1 kW (peak power) PV system being considered does not useenergy storage batteries and the inverter output is connected to the grid supply without the use of a power transformer. Improvements in the efficiency of such aninverter system often come at the expense of the quality of its output power and an increase in cost. However, in the proposed inverter system the harmonics of theoutput current has been improved without compromising its overall efficiency or its cost. An improvement in power quality has been achieved using a novel AC splitinductorfilter network that reduces electromagnetic interference, prevents unwanted operation of the inverter switches, attenuates switching frequency harmonics,minimises low frequency harmonics and provides an average value of the inverter output current necessary for the removal of DC offset currents.An improvement in inverter efficiency and a reduction in cost has been achieved by omitting the 50 Hz power transformer (transformerless) and by optimising theinverter current control strategies. In Australia, some power supply authorities permit transformerless PV inverters of less than 10 kW rating to be connected to their supply system. However, avoiding the use of transformers can lead to magnitudes of DC offset current outside the limits specified by Australian Standard 4777.2, 2005 being injected into the grid supply. In this project a new cost effective DC offset current controller that removes DC offset current from the output of the inverter has been realised. This result translates into two primary benefits; firstly, a saving of about20% in the cost of the power transformer and in the cost of providing additional solar panels to overcome transformer power losses, and secondly the DC offset controller can also be utilised in inverter applications where power transformers are used, to prevent distortion of the magnetising current.The novel design procedure proposed in this thesis for a current controller takes into account intentional and unintentional switching circuit delays, and yields higherefficiencies without sacrificing power quality or increasing the cost of the inverter system. The inclusion of the effect of circuit delays in the design procedure issignificant as it is shown that delay not only has an adverse effect on the performance of the current controller but also on the efficiency and the power quality of the inverter system.Of paramount importance for the successful completion of this project was the relationship between switching circuit delays and the level of low frequencyharmonics generated by unipolar switched inverters. Theoretical analysis is developed to show why circuit delays, inverter DC input voltage and the inductanceof the current loop, are responsible for low frequency harmonics in unipolar switched and not in bipolar switched inverters. It has also been established that unipolarswitched inverters can be designed to operate within the limits specified by the Australian Standard 4777.2, 2005 and that the low frequency harmonics can be maintained at acceptable levels.For a current controller using unipolar switching, the choice of only one of four equivalent switching combinations of the inverter switches leads to suppression of switching noise, and prevents unwanted switching without the need for additional filters. Results are presented to demonstrate the unique advantage of unipolarswitching over bipolar switching.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar</field><field name="subject">energy;</field><field name="subject">single-phase</field><field name="subject">transformerless</field><field name="subject">unipolar</field><field name="subject">switched</field><field name="subject">inverter</field><field name="subject">system</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00004120/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Registration of mass-like objects in sequential mammograms using graph matching</field><field name="creator">Ma, Fei</field><field name="description">Sequential mammograms contain important information, such as changes of the breast or developments of the masses, for diagnosis of disease. Comparison of sequential mammograms plays an important part for radiologists in identifying malignant masses. However, currently computer-aided detection (CAD) programs can not use such information eciently. The diculties lie in the registration of sequential mammograms.

Most of current methods register sequential mammograms based on control points and image transformations. For these methods to work, extraction and correspondence of the control points is essential. This thesis presents a new approach in registering mammograms. The proposed method registers mammograms by associating mass-like objects in sequential mammograms directly. The mass-like objects appear in the images of normal breasts as well as images of breast with cancer. When the mass-like objects in sequential mammograms are accurately associated, measurements of changes in mass-like objects over time become possible.
This is an important way to distinguish mass-like objects associated with cancer from cysts or other benign objects.

The proposed method is based on graph matching. It uses the internal structure of the breast represented by the spatial relation between the mass-like objects to establish a correspondence between the sequential mammograms. In this method, the mammogram is firstly segmented into separate components using an adaptive pyramid (AP) segmentation algorithm. A series of filters, based on the features of components, is then applied to the components to remove the undesired ones. The remaining components, the mass-like objects, are represented by a complete graph. The spatial relations between the remaining mass-like objects are expressed by fuzzy spatial relation representation and are associated to the edges of the graph as weights. Association of the mass-like objects of two sequential mammograms is realized by finding a common subgraph of the corresponding two graphs using the backtrack algorithm.

The segmentation methods developed in the course of this work were tested on a separate problem in computer-aided detection of breast cancer, namely the automatic extraction of the pectoral muscle.

The graph matching method was tested independently of the segmentation method on artificially distorted mammograms and the full process, including the segmentation and the graph matching, was evaluated on 95 temporal mammogram pairs. The present implementation indicates only a small improvement in cancer detection rates but also presents opportunities for a substantial development of the basic method in the future.</field><field name="date">Oct. 10, 2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mammography</field><field name="subject">registration</field><field name="subject">detection</field><field name="subject">graph matching</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090323.155040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feature-based stereo vision on a mobile platform</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Du Quan</field><field name="description">It is commonly known that stereopsis is the primary way for humans to perceive depth.  Although, with one eye,  we can still interact very well with our environment and do very highly skillful tasks by using other visual cues such as occlusion and motion,  the resultant e ect of the absence of stereopsis is that the relative depth information between objects is essentially lost  (Frisby,1979).  While humans fuse the images seen by the left and right eyes in a seemingly easy way,  the major problem - the correspondence of features - that needs to be solved in all binocular stereo systems of machine vision is not trivial.  In this thesis,  line segments and corners are chosen to be the features to be matched because they typically occur at object boundaries,  surface discontinuities,  and across surface markings.  Polygonal regions are also selected since they are known to be well-configured and are,  very often,  associated with salient structures in the image.  The use of these high level features,  although helping to diminish matching ambiguities,  does not completely resolve the matching problem when the scene contains repetitive structures.  The spatial relationships between the feature matching pairs enforced in the stereo matching process,  as proposed in this thesis,  are found to provide even stronger support for correct feature matching pairs and,  as a result,  incorrect matching pairs can be largely eliminated.  Getting global and salient  3D structures has been an important prerequisite for environmental modelling and understanding.  While research on postprocessing the  3D information obtained from stereo has been attempted  (Ayache and Faugeras, 1991), the strategy presented in this thesis for retrieving salient  3D descriptions is propagating the prominent information extracted from the 2D images to the  3D scene.  Thus,  the matching of two prominent 2D polygonal regions yields a prominent  3D  region,  and the inter-relation between two 2D region matching pairs is passed on and taken as a relationship between two  3D regions.  Humans,  when observing and interacting with the environment  do not confine themselves to the observation and then the analysis of a single image.  Similarly  stereopsis can be vastly improved with the introduction of additional stereo image pairs.  Eye,  head,  and body movements provide essential mobility for an active change of viewpoints,  the disocclusion of occluded objects,  the avoidance of obstacles,  and the performance of any necessary tasks on hand.  This thesis presents a mobile stereo vision system that has its eye movements provided by a binocular head support and stepper motors,  and its body movements provided by a mobile platform,  the Labmate.  With a viewer centred coordinate system proposed in this thesis  the computation of the  3D information observed at each individual viewpoint,  the merging of the  3D in  formation at consecutive viewpoints for environmental reconstruction,  and strategies for movement control are discussed in detail.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robot vision</field><field name="subject">Stereoscopic cameras</field><field name="subject">Depth perception</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface modelling and surface following for robots equipped with range sensors</field><field name="creator">Pudney, Christopher John</field><field name="description">The construction of surface models from sensor data is an important part of perceptive robotics.  When the sensor data are obtained from  fixed sensors  the problem of occlusion arises.  To overcome occlusion,  sensors may be mounted on a robot that moves the sensors over the surface.  In this thesis the sensors are single&#8211;point range  finders.  The range  finders provide a set of sensor points,  that is,  the surface points detected by the sensors.  The sets of sensor points obtained during the robot&#8217;s motion are used to construct a surface model.  The surface model is used in turn in the computation of the robot&#8217;s motion,  so surface modelling is performed on&#8211;line,  that is,  the surface model is constructed incrementally from the sensor points as they are obtained.  A planar polyhedral surface model is used that is amenable to incremental surface modelling.  The surface model consists of a set of model segments,  where a neighbour relation allows model segments to share edges.  Also sets of adjacent shared edges may form corner vertices.  Techniques are presented for incrementally updating the surface model using sets of sensor points.  Various model segment operations are employed to do this:  model segments may be merged, fissures in model segment perimeters are  filled, and shared edges and corner vertices may be formed.  Details of these model segment operations are presented.  The robot&#8217;s control point is moved over the surface model at a fixed distance.  This keeps the sensors around the control point within sensing range of the surface,  and keeps the control point from colliding with the surface.  The remainder of the robot body is kept from colliding with the surface by using redundant degrees&#8211;of&#8211;freedom.  The goal of surface modelling and surface following is to model as much of the surface as possible.  The incomplete parts of the surface model (non&#8211;shared edges) indicate where sections of surface that have not been exposed to the robot&#8217;s sensors lie.  The direction of the robot&#8217;s motion is chosen such that the robot&#8217;s control point is directed to non&#8211;shared edges, and then over the unexposed surface near the edge.  These techniques have been implemented and results are presented for a variety of simulated robots combined with real range sensor data.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robots</field><field name="subject">Robot vision</field><field name="subject">Pattern recognition systems</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Noncontact 3D biological shape measurement from multiple views</field><field name="creator">Ge, Youmei</field><field name="description">Many clinically important applications require measurements on a large portion of the human body surface that may not be visible from a single view.  For example,  a single view may be insufficient for the measurement of a complete facial surface for facial plastic surgery.  And observing breast surfaces from multiple views is needed in accurate breast volume measurement.  On the other hand  most  3D vision systems only recover  3D data from a single viewpoint  and the recovered  3D data are often incomplete due to the occlusion problem and thus cannot uniquely define the surface.  A unique and more complete description of the surface is necessary for most applications such as measuring area or volume and  finding the best  3D registration between corresponding surfaces.  This thesis describes a structured light based system for fast and noncontact  3D measurement of the human body from multiple views.  A particular application of our system is the study of human lactation through measuring the breast surface and volume.  Fast,  accurate,  non-contact,  and biologically safe measurement is the key requirement in our application.  We use structured light to fulfill the requirement.  Based on the SHAPE system  [4,3],  a single view structured light system developed at Monash University, our system for breast volume measurement generates more complete  3D information on object surfaces by observing the object from more than one viewpoint.  The breast volume is computed using the integrated data from all views.  We present a simple method that performs  3D measurement from multiple views simultaneously.  Combined with a camera and a projector,  a mirror is used in the method to create an additional viewpoint to recover the occluded regions that are illuminated by the light source but were previously invisible to the camera.  Images from the two views  one directly seen by the camera and the other seen via the mirror  are taken simultaneously.  We develop the method for the purpose of achieving more complete measurements without increasing image capture time,  which is very useful in situations where both speed and accuracy are important.   The complete  3D description of the surface of objects requires the acquisition of several images from different vantage viewpoints.  Each image contains information on the part of the object that is visible from its viewpoint.  A very important task consists in the integration of the information present in each view.  We have developed a two view system to achieve a more complete breast volume measurement.  The system uses a stationary sensor at each view.  Our system can largely eliminate the occlusion regions produced by a single view system  and all data from different views are integrated into an object centered coordinate system and resampled by a single parametric grid.  The system has been used to accurately measure short term changes in breast volume for lactating mothers.  Currently,  the system is also used to observe the breast volume change of pregnant women over many weeks'  time.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image processing</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional display systems</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual guidance of robot motion</field><field name="creator">Gu, Lifang</field><field name="description">Future robots are expected to cooperate with humans in daily activities.  Efficient cooperation requires new techniques for transferring human skills to robots.  This thesis presents an approach on how a robot can extract and replicate a motion by observing how a human instructor conducts it.  In this way, the robot can be taught without any explicit instructions and the human instructor does not need any expertise in robot programming.  A system has been implemented which consists of two main parts.  The  first part is data acquisition and motion extraction.  Vision is the most important sensor with which a human can interact with the surrounding world.  Therefore two cameras are used to capture the image sequences of a moving rigid object.  In order to compress the incoming images from the cameras and extract  3D motion information of the rigid object,  feature detection and tracking are applied to the images.  Corners are chosen as the main features because they are more stable under perspective projection and during motion.  A reliable corner detector is implemented and a new corner tracking algorithm is proposed based on smooth motion constraints.  With both spatial and temporal constraints, 3D trajectories of a set of points on the object can be obtained and the  3D motion parameters of the object can be reliably calculated by the algorithm proposed in this thesis.  Once the  3D motion parameters are available through the vision system,  the robot should be programmed to replicate this motion.  Since we are interested in smooth motion and the similarity between two motions,  the task of the second part of our system is therefore to extract motion characteristics and to transfer these to the robot.  It can be proven that the characteristics of a parametric cubic B-spline curve are completely determined by its control points, which can be obtained by the least-squares fitting method,  given some data points on the curve.  Therefore a parametric cubic B&#8211;spline curve is  fitted to the motion data and its control points are calculated.  Given the robot configuration  the obtained control points can be scaled,  translated,  and rotated so that a motion trajectory can be generated for the robot to replicate the given motion in its own workspace with the required smoothness and similarity,  although the absolute motion trajectories of the robot and the instructor can be different.  All the above modules have been integrated and results of an experiment with the whole system show that the approach proposed in this thesis can extract motion characteristics and transfer these to a robot.  A robot arm has successfully replicated a human arm movement with similar shape characteristics by our approach.  In conclusion,  such a system collects human skills and intelligence through vision and transfers them to the robot.  Therefore,  a robot with such a system can interact with its environment and learn by observation.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robots -- Motion</field><field name="subject">Robot vision</field><field name="subject">Manipulators (Mechanism) -- Optical equipment</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invariant measures of image features from phase information</field><field name="creator">Kovesi, Peter</field><field name="description">If reliable and general computer vision techniques are to be developed it is crucial that we  find ways of characterizing low-level image features with invariant quantities.  For example,  if edge significance could be measured in a way that was invariant to image illumination and contrast,  higher-level image processing operations could be conducted with much greater confidence.  However,  despite their importance,  little attention has been paid to the need for invariant quantities in low-level vision for tasks such as feature detection or feature matching.  This thesis develops a number of invariant low-level image measures for feature detection, local symmetry/asymmetry detection,  and for signal matching.  These invariant quantities are developed from representations of the image in the frequency domain.  In particular,  phase data is used as the fundamental building block for constructing these measures.  Phase congruency is developed as an illumination and contrast invariant measure of feature significance.  This allows edges,  lines and other features to be detected reliably, and  fixed thresholds can be applied over wide classes of images.  Points of local symmetry and asymmetry in images give rise to special arrangements of phase,  and these too can be characterized by invariant measures.  Finally, a new approach to signal matching that uses correlation of local phase and amplitude information is developed. This approach allows reliable phase based disparity measurements to be made,  overcoming many of the difficulties associated with scale-space singularities.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer vision</field><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual recognition of hand motion</field><field name="creator">Holden, Eun-Jung</field><field name="description">Hand gesture recognition is an active area of research in recent years, being used in various applications from deaf sign recognition systems to human-machine interaction applications. The gesture recognition process, in general, may be divided into two stages: the motion sensing, which extracts useful data from hand motion; and the classification process, which classifies the motion sensing data as gestures. The existing vision-based gesture recognition systems extract 2-D shape and trajectory descriptors from the visual input, and classify them using various classification techniques from maximum likelihood estimation to neural networks, finite state machines, Fuzzy Associative Memory (FAM) or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). This thesis presents the framework of the vision-based Hand Motion Understanding (HMU) system that recognises static and dynamic Australian Sign Language (Auslan) signs by extracting and classifying 3-D hand configuration data from the visual input. The HMU system is a pioneer gesture recognition system that uses a combination of a 3-D hand tracker for motion sensing, and an adaptive fuzzy expert system for classification. The HMU 3-D hand tracker extracts 3-D hand configuration data that consists of the 21 degrees-of-freedom parameters of the hand from the visual input of a single viewpoint, with an aid of a colour coded glove. The tracker uses a model-based motion tracking algorithm that makes incremental corrections to the 3-D model parameters to re-configure the model to fit the hand posture appearing in the images through the use of a Newton style optimisation technique. Finger occlusions are handled to a certain extent by recovering the missing hand features in the images through the use of a prediction algorithm. The HMU classifier, then, recognises the sequence of 3-D hand configuration data as a sign by using an adaptive fuzzy expert system where the sign knowledge are used as inference rules. The classification is performed in two stages. Firstly, for each image, the classifier recognises Auslan basic hand postures that categorise the Auslan signs like the alphabet in English. Secondly, the sequence of Auslan basic hand postures that appear in the image sequence is analysed and recognised as a sign. Both the posture and sign recognition are performed by the same adaptive fuzzy inference engine. The HMU rule base stores 22 Auslan basic hand postures, and 22 signs. For evaluation, 44 motion sequences (2 for each of the 22 signs) are recorded. Among them, 22 randomly chosen sequences (1 for each of the 22 signs) are used for testing and the rest are used for training. The evaluation shows that before training the HMU system correctly recognised 20 out of 22 signs. After training, with the same test set, the HMU system recognised 21 signs correctly. All of the failed cases did not produce any output. The evaluation has successfully demonstrated the functionality of the combined use of a 3-D hand tracker and an adaptive fuzzy expert for a vision-based sign language recognition.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gesture</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Sign language</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clustering with genetic algorithms</field><field name="creator">Cole, Rowena Marie</field><field name="description">Clustering is the search for those partitions that reflect the structure of an object set.  Traditional clustering algorithms search only a small sub-set of all possible clusterings  (the solution space) and consequently, there is no guarantee that the solution found will be optimal.  We report here on the application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) --    stochastic search algorithms touted as effective search methods for large and complex spaces --  to the problem of clustering.  GAs which have been made applicable to the problem of clustering  (by adapting the representation,   fitness function,  and developing suitable evolutionary operators)  are known as Genetic Clustering Algorithms  (GCAs).   There are two parts to our investigation of GCAs:  first we look at clustering into a given number of clusters.  The performance of GCAs on three generated data sets,  analysed using  4320 differing combinations of adaptions,  establishes their efficacy.  Choice of adaptions and parameter settings is data set dependent, but comparison between results using generated and real data sets indicate that performance is consistent for similar data sets with the same number of objects, clusters,  attributes,  and a similar distribution of objects.  Generally,  group-number representations are better suited to the clustering problem,  as are dynamic scaling,  elite selection and high mutation rates.  Independent generalised models  fitted to the correctness and timing results for each of the generated data sets produced accurate predictions of the performance of GCAs on similar real data sets.  While GCAs can be successfully adapted to clustering,  and the method produces results as accurate and correct as traditional methods,  our  findings indicate that,  given a criterion based on simple distance metrics,  GCAs provide no advantages over traditional methods.  Second,  we investigate the potential of genetic algorithms for the more general clustering problem,  where the number of clusters is unknown.  We show that only simple modifications to the adapted GCAs are needed.  We have developed a merging operator,  which with elite selection,  is employed to evolve an initial population with a large number of clusters toward better clusterings.  With regards to accuracy and correctness,  these GCAs are more successful than optimisation methods such as simulated annealing.  However,  such GCAs can become trapped in local minima in the same manner as traditional hierarchical methods.  Such trapping is characterised by the situation where good  (k-1)-clusterings do not result from our merge operator acting on good k-clusterings.  A marked improvement in the algorithm is observed with the addition of a local heuristic.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cluster analysis -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local energy feature tracing in digital images and volumes</field><field name="creator">Robins, Michael John</field><field name="description">Digital image feature detectors often comprise two stages of processing: an initial  filtering phase and a secondary search stage.  The initial  filtering is designed to accentuate specific feature characteristics or suppress spurious components of the image signal.  The second stage of processing involves searching the results for various criteria that will identify the locations of the image features.  The local energy feature detection scheme combines the squares of the signal convolved with a pair of  filters that are in quadrature with each other.  The resulting local energy value is proportional to phase congruency which is a measure of the local alignment of the phases of the signals constituent Fourier components.  Points of local maximum phase alignment have been shown to correspond to visual features in the image.  The local energy calculation accentuates the location of many types of image features,  such as lines,  edges and ramps and estimates of local energy can be calculated in multidimensional image data  by rotating the quadrature  filters to several orientations.  The second stage search criterion for local energy is to locate the points that lie along the ridges in the energy map that connect the points of local maxima.  In three dimensional data the relatively higher energy values will form  films between connecting  laments and tendrils.  This thesis examines the use of recursive spatial domain  filtering to calculate local energy.  A quadrature pair of  filters which are based on the  first derivative of the Gaussian function and its Hilbert transform,  are rotated in space using a kernel of basis functions to obtain various orientations of the  filters.  The kernel is designed to be separable and each term is implemented using a recursive digital  filter. Once local energy has been calculated  the ridges and surfaces of high energy values are determined using a  flooding technique.  Starting from the points of local minima we perform an ablative skeletonisation of the higher energy values.  The topology of the original set is maintained by examining and preserving the topology of the neighbourhood of each point when considering it for removal.  This combination of homotopic skeletonisation and sequential processing of each level of energy values,  results in a well located,  thinned and connected tracing of the ridges.  The thesis contains examples of the local energy calculation using steerable recursive  filters and the ridge tracing algorithm applied to two and three dimensional images.  Details of the algorithms are contained in the text and details of their computer implementation are provided in the appendices.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A temporal 3D-registration framework for computer-integrated surgery</field><field name="creator">Backman, Ronald Bruce</field><field name="description">Traditionally, volumetric modalities such as CT and MRI have provided static snapshots of anatomy enabling insight into the progression of disease and to the severity of injury.  Recently, 3D-registration algorithms, originating in the neurosurgical field, have been used to merge these images resulting in richer visualizations.  However, in situations where trauma patients are unable to be moved or are at risk of infection, there have been comparatively few advances.  This thesis presents a 3D-registration framework that supports longitudinal study of morphologic changes in surface images of the upper body based on an optical technique - structured light imaging.  The framework incorporates soft-tissue deformation modeling to allow coordinate frame determination and specific point tracking required for applications of Computer-Integrated Surgery.  The framework is implemented in three stages using a coarse-fine approach that separately addresses the different sources of registration error commonly found in temporal registration applications.  The coarse stage defines seven thoracic fiducials that form a rigid body.  A special anthropomorphic stand is designed and used to enforce a rigid body assumption.  Experimental results show the fiducials to have precision of approximately 2 mm.  The medium stage incorporates the novel use of ultraviolet light as a surface registration technique.  UV is used to avoid error caused when the projected light stripes interfere with the marker material - a common problem with external landmarks and optical assessment systems.  A semi-automatic algorithm for identifying the centre of the fiducials is given and shown to be highly accurate - to within 1 pixel precision compared to the visually assessed centre.  The movement of these fiducials is also modelled at the extremes of the respiratory cycle with individual fiducials moving from 5-17 mm.  A least-squares algorithm is implemented to bring surfaces together based on their fiducial locations and rigid-body motion.  This algorithm results in RMS error of approximately 1.17 +/- 0.45 mm.  The fine stage involves finding fixed point correspondences in changed regions between a base surface and a comparison surface acquired at a different time given the rigid body registration from the previous stages.  Five algorithmic variants are assessed using two simulations of thoracic swelling.  The results do not show statistical significance between variants but do indicate visually some promising results.  An application of this framework could be the near real-time guidance of the FAROArm, a precision measuring instrument commonly used in Computer-Integrated Surgery, to these points.  This would facilitate the collection of functional information of clinical interest while maintaining positional congruence with data acquired at a different time point.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surgery</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional imaging in medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An efficient algorithm for extracting Boolean functions from linear threshold gates, and a synthetic decompositional approach to extracting Boolean functions from feedforward neural networks with arbitrary transfer functions</field><field name="creator">Peh, Lawrence T. W.</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the Abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  Artificial neural networks are universal function approximators that represent functions subsymbolically by weights, thresholds and network topology.  Naturally, the representation remains the same regardless of the problem domain. Suppose a network is applied to a symbolic domain.  It is difficult for a human to dynamically construct the symbolic function from the neural representation.  It is also difficult to retrain networks on perturbed training vectors, to resume training with different training sets, to form a new neuron by combining trained neurons, and to reason with trained neurons.  Even the original training set does not provide a symbolic representation of the function implemented by the trained network because the set may be incomplete or inconsistent, and the training phase may terminate with residual errors. The symbolic information in the network would be more useful if it is available in the language of the problem domain.  Algorithms that translate the subsymbolic neural representation to a symbolic representation are called extraction algorithms.  I argue that extraction algorithms that operate on single-output, layered feedforward networks are sufficient to analyse the class of multiple-output networks with arbitrary connections, including recurrent networks. The translucency dimensions of the ADT taxonomy for feedforward networks classifies extraction approaches as pedagogical, eclectic, or decompositional.  Pedagogical and eclectic approaches typically use a symbolic learning algorithm that takes the network&#8217;s input-output behaviour as its raw data.  Both approaches construct a set of input patterns and observe the network&#8217;s output for each pattern.  Eclectic and pedagogical approaches construct the input patterns respectively with and without reference to the network&#8217;s internal information.  These approaches are suitable for approximating the network&#8217;s function using a probably-approximately-correct (PAC) or similar framework, but they are unsuitable for constructing the network&#8217;s complete function. Decompositional approaches use internal information from a network more directly to produce the network&#8217;s function in symbolic form.  Decompositional algorithms have two components.  The first component is a core extraction algorithm that operates on a single neuron that is assumed to implement a symbolic function.  The second component provides the superstructure for the first.  It consists of a decomposition rule for producing such neurons and a recomposition rule for symbolically aggregating the extracted functions into the symbolic function of the network. This thesis makes contributions to both components for Boolean extraction.  I introduce a relatively efficient core algorithm called WSX based on a novel Boolean form called BvF.  The algorithm has a worst case complexity of O(2 to power of n divided by the square root of n) for a neuron with n inputs, but in all cases, its complexity can also be expressed as O(l) with an O(n) precalculation phase, where l is the length of the extracted expression in terms of the number of symbols it contains. I extend WSX for approximate extraction (AWSX) by introducing an interval about the neuron&#8217;s threshold.  Assuming that the input patterns far from the threshold are more symbolically significant to the neuron than those near the threshold, ASWX ignores the neuron&#8217;s mappings for the symbolically input patterns, remapping them as convenient for efficiency.  In experiments, this dramatically decreased extraction time while retaining most of the neuron&#8217;s mappings for the training set. Synthetic decomposition is this thesis&#8217; contribution to the second component of decompositional extraction. Classical decomposition decomposes the network into its constituent neurons.  By extracting symbolic functions from these neurons, classical decomposition assumes that the neurons implement symbolic functions, or that approximating the subsymbolic computation in the neurons with symbolic computation does not significantly affect the network&#8217;s symbolic function.  I show experimentally that this assumption does not always hold.   Instead of decomposing a network into its constituent neurons, synthetic decomposition uses constraints in the network that have the same functional form as neurons that implement Boolean functions;  these neurons are called synthetic neurons.  I present a starting point for constructing synthetic decompositional algorithms, and proceed to construct two such algorithms, each with a different strategy for decomposition and recomposition. One of the algorithms, ACX, works for networks with arbitrary monotonic transfer functions, so long as an inverse exists for the functions.  It also has an elegant geometric interpretation that leads to meaningful approximations.  I also show that ACX can be extended to layered networks with any number of layers.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Computer algorithms</field><field name="subject">Algebra, Boolean</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstruction for visualisation of discrete data fields using wavelet signal processing</field><field name="creator">Cena, Bernard Maria</field><field name="description">The reconstruction of a function and its derivative from a set of measured samples is a fundamental operation in visualisation.  Multiresolution techniques, such as wavelet signal processing, are instrumental in improving the performance and algorithm design for data analysis, filtering and processing.  This dissertation explores the possibilities of combining traditional multiresolution analysis and processing features of wavelets with the design of appropriate filters for reconstruction of sampled data. On the one hand, a multiresolution system allows data feature detection, analysis and filtering.  Wavelets have already been proven successful in these tasks.  On the other hand, a choice of discrete filter which converges to a continuous basis function under iteration permits efficient and accurate function representation by providing a &#8220;bridge&#8221; from the discrete to the continuous.  A function representation method capable of both multiresolution analysis and accurate reconstruction of the underlying measured function would make a valuable tool for scientific visualisation. The aim of this dissertation is not to try to outperform existing filters designed specifically for reconstruction of sampled functions.  The goal is to design a wavelet filter family which, while retaining properties necessary to preform multiresolution analysis, possesses features to enable the wavelets to be used as efficient and accurate &#8220;building blocks&#8221; for function representation.  The application to visualisation is used as a means of practical demonstration of the results. Wavelet and visualisation filter design is analysed in the first part of this dissertation and a list of wavelet filter design criteria for visualisation is collated.  Candidate wavelet filters are constructed based on a parameter space search of the BC-spline family and direct solution of equations describing filter properties. Further, a biorthogonal wavelet filter family is constructed based on point and average interpolating subdivision and using the lifting scheme.  The main feature of these filters is their ability to reconstruct arbitrary degree piecewise polynomial functions and their derivatives using measured samples as direct input into a wavelet transform.  The lifting scheme provides an intuitive, interval-adapted, time-domain filter and transform construction method.  A generalised factorisation for arbitrary primal and dual order point and average interpolating filters is a result of the lifting construction. The proposed visualisation filter family is analysed quantitatively and qualitatively in the final part of the dissertation.  Results from wavelet theory are used in the analysis which allow comparisons among wavelet filter families and between wavelets and filters designed specifically for reconstruction for visualisation. Lastly, the performance of the constructed wavelet filters is demonstrated in the visualisation context.  One-dimensional signals are used to illustrate reconstruction performance of the wavelet filter family from noiseless and noisy samples in comparison to other wavelet filters and dedicated visualisation filters. The proposed wavelet filters converge to basis functions capable of reproducing functions that can be represented locally by arbitrary order piecewise polynomials.  They are interpolating, smooth and provide asymptotically optimal reconstruction in the case when samples are used directly as wavelet coefficients. The reconstruction performance of the proposed wavelet filter family approaches that of continuous spatial domain filters designed specifically for reconstruction for visualisation.  This is achieved in addition to retaining multiresolution analysis and processing properties of wavelets.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Signal processing -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Visualization -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Wavelets (Mathematics) -- Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated facial metrology</field><field name="creator">O'Mara, David Thomas John</field><field name="description">Automated facial metrology is the science of objective and automatic measurement of the human face. There are many reasons for measuring the human face. Psychologists are interested in determining how humans perceive beauty, and how this is related to facial symmetry [158]. Biologists are interested in the relationship between symmetry and biological  fitness [124]. Anthropologists, surgeons, forensic experts, and security professionals can also benefit from automated facial metrology [32, 101, 114]. This thesis investigates the concept of automated facial metrology, presenting original techniques for segmenting 3D range and colour images of the human head, measuring the bilateral symmetry of n-dimensional point data (with particular emphasis on measuring the human head), and extracting the 2D profile of the face from 3D data representing the head. Two facial profile analysis techniques are also presented that are incremental improvements over existing techniques. Extensive literature reviews of skin colour modelling, symmetry detection, symmetry measurement, and facial profile analysis are also included in this thesis. It was discovered during this research that bilateral symmetry detection using principal axes is not appropriate for detecting the mid-line of the human face. An original mid-line detection technique that does not use symmetry, and is superior to the symmetry-based technique, was developed as a direct result of this discovery.   There is disagreement among researchers about the effect of ethnicity on skin colour. Some researchers claim that people from different ethnic groups have the same skin chromaticity (hue, saturation) [87, 129, 206], while other researchers claim that different ethnic groups have different skin colours [208, 209]. It is shown in this thesis that people from apparently different ethnic groups can have skin chromaticity that is within the same Gaussian distribution. The chromaticity-based skin colour model used in this thesis has been chosen from the many models previously used by other researchers, and its applicability to skin colour modelling has been justified.  It is proven in this thesis that the Mahalanobis distance to the skin colour distribution is Gaussian in both the chromatic and normalised rg colour spaces. Most facial profile analysis techniques use either tangency or curvature to locate anthropometric features along the profile. Techniques based on both approaches have been implemented and compared. Neither approach is clearly superior to the other, but the results indicate that a hybrid technique, combining both approaches, could provide significant improvements. The areas of research most relevant to facial metrology are reviewed in this thesis and original contributions are made to the body of knowledge in each area. The techniques, results, literature reviews, and suggestions presented in this thesis provide a solid foundation for further research and hopefully bring the goal of automated facial metrology a little closer to being achieved.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metrology -- Computer programs</field><field name="subject">Face -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Human skin color -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Three-dimensional imaging</field><field name="subject">Digital mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Video analysis in MPEG compressed domain</field><field name="creator">Gu, Lifang</field><field name="description">The amount of digital video has been increasing dramatically due to the technology advances in video capturing, storage, and compression. The usefulness of vast repositories of digital information is limited by the effectiveness of the access methods, as shown by the Web explosion. The key issues in addressing the access methods are those of content description and of information space navigation. While textual documents in digital form are somewhat self-describing (i.e., they provide explicit indices, such as words and sentences that can be directly used to categorise and access them), digital video does not provide such an explicit content description. In order to access video material in an effective way, without looking at the material in its entirety, it is therefore necessary to analyse and annotate video sequences, and provide an explicit content description targeted to the user needs. Digital video is a very rich medium, and the characteristics in which users may be interested are quite diverse, ranging from the structure of the video to the identity of the people who appear in it, their movements and dialogues and the accompanying music and audio effects. Indexing digital video, based on its content, can be carried out at several levels of abstraction, beginning with indices like the video program name and name of subject, to much lower level aspects of video like the location of edits and motion properties of video. Manual video indexing requires the sequential examination of the entire video clip. This is a time-consuming, subjective, and expensive process. As a result, there is an urgent need for tools to automate the indexing process. In response to such needs, various video analysis techniques from the research fields of image processing and computer vision have been proposed to parse, index and annotate the massive amount of digital video data. However, most of these video analysis techniques have been developed for uncompressed video. Since most video data are stored in compressed formats for efficiency of storage and transmission, it is necessary to perform decompression on compressed video before such analysis techniques can be applied. Two consequences of having to first decompress before processing are incurring computation time for decompression and requiring extra auxiliary storage.To save on the computational cost of decompression and lower the overall size of the data which must be processed, this study attempts to make use of features available in compressed video data and proposes several video processing techniques operating directly on compressed video data. Specifically, techniques of processing MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 compressed data have been developed to help automate the video indexing process. This includes the tasks of video segmentation (shot boundary detection), camera motion characterisation, and highlights extraction (detection of skin-colour regions, text regions, moving objects and replays) in MPEG compressed video sequences. The approach of performing analysis on the compressed data has the advantages of dealing with a much reduced data size and is therefore suitable for computationally-intensive low-level operations. Experimental results show that most analysis tasks for video indexing can be carried out efficiently in the compressed domain. Once intermediate results, which are dramatically reduced in size, are obtained from the compressed domain analysis, partial decompression can be applied to enable high resolution processing to extract high level semantic information.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital video -- Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A phenomenological and mechanistic study of fatigue under complex loading histories</field><field name="creator">Wong, Yat Khin</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract.  Please see pdf format for complete text.]  Over the years much work has been done on studying sequence effects under multilevel loading. Yet, the underlying fatigue mechanisms responsible for such interactions are not fully understood. The study of fatigue under complex loading histories begins by investigating strain interaction effects arising from simple 2-step loading sequences. Fatigue for all investigations were conducted under uniaxial push-pull mode in strain-control. Fatigue is traditionally classified as either low or high cycle fatigue (LCF and HCF respectively). The boundary for LCF and HCF is not well-defined even though the fatigue life of LCF is typically dominated by crack &#8220;initiation&#8221;, while for HCF, fatigue life is usually dominated by stable crack growth. The terms LCF and HCF, apart from referring to the low and high number of fatigue cycles required for failure, also bear little physical meaning in terms of describing the state of fatigue imposed. As a result, conventional definitions of the two distinct regimes of fatigue are challenged and a new method of classifying the boundary between the two regimes of fatigue is proposed. New definitions are proposed and the terms plastically dominant fatigue (PDF) and elastically dominant fatigue (EDF) are introduced as suitable replacements for LCF and HCF respectively. PDF refers to the condition of a material undergoing significant reverse plasticity during cyclic loading, while for EDF, minimal reverse plasticity is experienced. Systematic testing of three materials, 316 L stainless steel, 6061-T6 aluminium alloy and 4340 high strength steel, was performed to fully investigate the cycle ratio trends and &#8220;damage&#8221; accumulation behaviour which resulted from a variety of loading conditions. Results from this study were carried over to investigate more complex multilevel loading sequences and possible mechanisms for interaction effects observed both under 2-step and multi-step sequences were proposed. Results showed that atypical cycle ratio trends could result from loading sequences which involve combinations of strain amplitudes from different fatigue regimes (i.e. PDF or EDF). Mean strain effects on fatigue life were also studied. The objective of this study was to identify regimes of fatigue which are significantly influenced by mean strains. Results indicated that mean strains affected EDF but not PDF. 2-step tests, similar to those performed in earlier studies were conducted to investigate the effects of mean strain on variable amplitude loading. Again, atypical cycle ratio trends were observed for loading sequences involving combinations of PDF and EDF. It is understood that fatigue crack growth interaction behaviour and mean stress effects are two dominant mechanisms which can be used to explain cycle ratio trends observed. The significance and importance of proper PDF/EDF definition and specification are also stressed. The study of fracture mechanics is an important component of any fatigue research. Fatigue crack growth in 4140 high strength steel CT specimens, under conditions of plane stress and plane strain were studied. In this investigation, the effects of R and overload ratios were also studied for both plane stress and plane strain conditions. Results indicate that differences in the point of crack &#8220;initiation&#8221; under both plane stress and plane strain conditions decrease with increasing load range, while the extent of crack retardation as a result of overloading, is greater under plane stress than plane strain conditions. The extent of crack growth retardation increases with decreasing R ratios and increasing overload ratios. The final phase of this project involves the proposal of two practical models used to predict cumulative &#8220;damage&#8221; and fatigue crack propagation in metals. The cumulative &#8220;damage&#8221; model proposed takes the form of a power law and the exponent which governs &#8220;damage&#8221; accumulation can easily be calculated by knowing the failure life, Nf, for a given strain or load level. Predictions for the &#8220;damage&#8221; model performed better when compared to other popular cumulative &#8220;damage&#8221; models. The second model proposed predicts fatigue crack growth behaviour from known monotonic and smooth specimen fatigue data. There are several benefits of having a model that can predict fatigue crack growth from monotonic and smooth specimen fatigue data: a) traditionally, engineers had to rely on expensive and time-consuming crack propagation tests to evaluate and select materials for maximum fatigue resistance, and b) monotonic and smooth specimen fatigue data are readily available. The crack propagation model is proposed to alleviate the material selection process by providing engineers a means to rapidly eliminate and narrow down selections for possible material candidates.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminum alloys -- Fatigue</field><field name="subject">Aluminum alloys -- Fracture</field><field name="subject">Aluminum alloys -- Cracking</field><field name="subject">Steel -- Fatigue</field><field name="subject">Steel -- Fracture</field><field name="subject">Steel -- Cracking</field><field name="subject">Crack growth</field><field name="subject">Fatigue life prediction</field><field name="subject">High cycle fatigue</field><field name="subject">Low cycle fatigue</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing electricity markets with evolutionary computation</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Duy Huu Manh</field><field name="description">The use of electricity in 21st century living has been firmly established throughout most of the world, correspondingly the infrastructure for production and delivery of electricity to consumers has matured and stabilised. However, due to recent technical and environmental&#8211;political developments, the electricity infrastructure worldwide is undergoing major restructuring. The forces driving this reorganisation are a complex interplay of technical, environmental, economic and political factors. The general trend of the reorganisation is a dis&#8211;aggregation of the previously integrated functions of generation, transmission and distribution, together with the establishment of competitive markets, primarily in generation, to replace previous regulated monopolistic utilities. To ensure reliable and cost effective electricity supply to consumers it is necessary to have an accurate picture of the expected generation in terms of the spatial and temporal distribution of prices and volumes. Previously this information was obtained by the regulated utility using technical studies such as centrally planned unit&#8211;commitment and economic&#8211;dispatch. However, in the new deregulated market environment such studies have diminished applicability and limited accuracy since generation assets are generally autonomous and subject to market forces. With generation outcomes governed by market mechanisms, to have an accurate picture of expected generation in the new electricity supply industry, it is necessary to complement traditional studies with new studies of market equilibrium and stability. Models and solution methods have been developed and refined for many markets, however they cannot be directly applied to the generation market due to the unique nature of electricity, having high inelastic demand, low storage capability and distinct transportation requirements. Intensive effort is underway to formulate solutions and models that specifically reflect the unique characteristics of the generation market. Various models have been proposed including game theory, stochastic and agent&#8211;based systems. Similarly there is a diverse range of solution methods including, Monte&#8211;Carlo simulations, linear&#8211;complimentary and quadratic programming. These approaches have varying degrees of generality, robustness and accuracy, some being better in certain aspects but weaker in others. This thesis formulates a new general model for the generation market based on the Cournot game, it makes no conjectures about producers&#8217; behaviour and assumes that all electricity produced is immediately consumed. The new formulation characterises producers purely by their cost curves, which is only required to be piece&#8211;wise differentiable, and allows consumers&#8217; characteristics to remain unspecified. The formulation can determine dynamic equilibrium and multiple equilibria of markets with single and multiple consumers and producers. Additionally stability concepts for the new market equilibrium is also developed to provide discrimination for dynamic equilibrium and to enable the structural stability of the market to be assessed. Solutions of the new formulation are evaluated by the use of evolutionary computation, which is a guided stochastic search paradigm that mimics the operation of biological evolution to iteratively produce a population of solutions. Evolutionary computation is employed as it is adept at finding multiple solutions for underconstrained systems, such as that of the new market formulation. Various enhancements to significantly improve the performance of the algorithms and simplify its application are developed. The concept of convergence potential of a population is introduced together with a system for the controlled extraction of such potential to accelerate the algorithm&#8217;s convergence and improve its accuracy and robustness. A new constraint handling technique for linear constraints that preserves the solution&#8217;s diversity is also presented together with a coevolutionary solution method for the multiple consumers and producers market. To illustrate the new electricity market formulation and its evolutionary computation solution methods, the equilibrium and stability of a test market with one consumer and thirteen thermal generators with valve point losses is examined. The case of a multiple consumer market is not simulated, though the formulation and solution methods for this case is included. The market solutions obtained not only confirms previous findings thus validating the new approach, but also includes new results yet to be verified by future studies. Techniques for market designers, regulators and other system planners in utilising the new market solutions are also given.

Within this member a diverse fauna of ostracodes and foraminifera are present. During the Cisuralian the northern Perth Basin formed part of the Gondwanan supercontinent and was linked to Greater India via an epeiric sea that opened to the north. The ostracode fauna is restricted to the calcareous beds of the member and consists of a diverse benthic fauna comprising 31 new species and 13 previously recorded species. Species from the Healdioidea, Bairdioidea, Youngielloidea, and Thlipsuroidea dominate the assemblage and suggest a normal-marine environment during the period represented by the calcareous beds, with an overall shallowing trend up the sequence. The fauna shows some similarity to faunas from the Tethyan deposits of North America and the Boreal deposits of Russia during the Late Carboniferous and Cisuralian. Twenty-eight species of foraminifera were recorded from the Fossil Cliff Member and underlying Holmwood Shale and comprise two distinct faunas, an agglutinated benthic foraminiferal fauna found within the shale beds and a calcareous benthic foraminiferal fauna present in the calcarenite units. The agglutinated foraminifera are inferred to represent deposition in dysoxic to suboxic (0.1-1.5 mL/LO2;), poorly circulated bottom waters below wave base. The calcareous foraminifera are inferred to represent deposition in normal-marine conditions. Both foraminiferal assemblages show a shallowing trend in their distribution that matches the trend identified in the ostracode fauna. Based upon the palaeoecology of the ostracode and foraminiferal faunas, the depositional environment for the Fossil Cliff Member is inferred to have been within shallow water in an epeiric basin during an overall marine regression that is overprinted by eustatic and isostatic oscillations resulting from deglaciation that occurred during the early Sakmarian (Cisuralian). These sea-level oscillations raised and lowered the oxic surface waters of the epeiric sea above and below the substrate resulting in a sparse agglutinated foraminiferal fauna or an abundant and diverse ostracode and calcareous foraminiferal fauna respectively.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ostracoda, Fossil -- Western Australia -- Perth Basin</field><field name="subject">Foraminifera, Fossil -- Western Australia -- Perth Basin</field><field name="subject">Ostracode</field><field name="subject">Permian</field><field name="subject">Taxonomy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indicators of infant and childhood mortality for indigenous and non-indigenous infants and children born in Western Australia from 1980 to 1997 inclusive</field><field name="creator">Freemantle, Cecily Jane</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract.  Please see pdf format for complete text.]  Background : The excess burden of mortality born by young Indigenous Australians and the disparity in infant and childhood mortality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians have been well documented. The accuracy and completeness of national data describing the health of Indigenous Australians is inconsistent. The Western Australia (WA) Maternal and Child Health Research Database (MCHRDB), is a linked total population database that includes perinatal maternal and infant data, and infant and childhood morbidity and mortality data. Overall, these data are more than 99% complete, with a similar high level of completeness and validity for Indigenous Western Australians. Aim : The aim of this thesis is to measure Indigenous infant (0 to &lt;1 year) and childhood (&gt;=1 to &lt;19 years) mortality and the disparity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous infants and children in WA for birth cohorts from 1980 to 1997 inclusive. To achieve this aim a number of secondary aims were identified, including the measurement of certain maternal and infant variables, and the age-specific, all-cause and cause-specific mortality for WA infants and children.  Method : The study comprises a longitudinal birth cohort study, the primary data source being the MCHRDB. Data included on the MCHRDB are complete for all births in WA from 1980 onwards, with new birth cohorts linked on an annual basis. Maternal and infant variables and the geographical location of the residence and the time of birth and death were included in the descriptive and multivariate analyses. Each infant and childhood death was coded using a three-digit code developed primarily for research purposes. The descriptive analyses of mortality referred to the probability of dying in infancy and in childhood as the cumulative mortality risk (CMR), for various diseases and various population subgroups. Age-specific childhood rates were also calculated. The results of multivariate analyses included the fitting of Cox and Poisson regression models, and estimates of effect were represented as hazard ratios (Cox regression) and relative rates (Poisson regression).  Results : Between 1980 and 1997, births to Indigenous mothers accounted for 6% of total WA births. Approximately 46% of Indigenous births were to mothers living in a remote location compared to 9% of non-Indigenous births. Indigenous mothers gave birth at an earlier age (30% of births were to teenage mothers compared to 6% of non-Indigenous births), and were more likely to be single than non-Indigenous mothers (40% Indigenous, 9% non-Indigenous). Indigenous infants had more siblings, were born at an earlier gestation and with a lower birth weight and percentage of expected birth weight. The CMR for Indigenous infants was 22 per 1000 live births compared with 6.7 for non- Indigenous infants, a relative risk (RR) of 3.3 (95%CI 3.0, 3.6). While there was a decrease in the CMR over the birth year groups for both populations, the disparity between the rate of Indigenous and non-Indigenous infant mortality increased. The Indigenous postneonatal (&gt;28 to 365 days) mortality rate (11.7 per 1,000 neonatal survivors) was higher than the neonatal (0 to 28 days) mortality rate (10.3 per 1,000 live births). This profile differed from that for non-Indigenous infants, where the neonatal mortality rate (4.3 per 1,000 live births) was nearly twice that of the postneonatal mortality rate (2.4 per 1,000 neonatal survivors). The main causes of infant mortality among Indigenous infants were potentially preventable. These causes were infection followed by Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which differed from the main causes for non-Indigenous infants, sequelae of prematurity and birth defects. The CMR attributable to SIDS increased over the years amongst Indigenous infants and decreased significantly over the years in the non-Indigenous population. Furthermore, the disparity in mortality between the two populations increased and, in 1995 to 1997, was over seven times higher amongst Indigenous infants. The CMR was highest amongst infants living in remote locations for all causes of death except for Indigenous deaths attributable to SIDS, where the risk of death was highest amongst infants living in metropolitan locations. With the exception of infection, there was no difference in cause-specific mortality amongst Indigenous infants according to geographical location. Indigenous infants living in a remote location were at a significantly increased risk of death due to infection compared with their peers living in a rural or metropolitan location. The risk of death for Indigenous children was more than three times higher than for non-Indigenous children. This risk was significantly increased when most of the perinatal maternal and infant variables were considered.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children, Aboriginal Australian -- Western Australia -- Mortality -- Statistics</field><field name="subject">Infants -- Western Australia -- Mortality -- Statistics</field><field name="subject">Children -- Western Australia -- Mortality -- Statistics</field><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">Mortality</field><field name="subject">Infant</field><field name="subject">Childhood</field><field name="subject">Cause of death</field><field name="subject">Geographical location of death</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stabilisation of the human ankle joint in varying degrees of freedom : investigation of neuromuscular mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Skoss, Ann Rachel Locke</field><field name="description">Previous research investigating the stability of the ankle joint complex may be categorised into two methodological groups, employing either an actuator to perturb the limb, or a form of standing balance disturbance such as a tilting platform, both of which test the joint in single degree of freedom (DOF). The aim of this thesis was to investigate how we control foot position and stabilise the joint when there is potential for movement in three DOF. A secondary aim of the thesis was to model the intrinsic mechanical properties of the ankle joint complex in three dimensions when coupled movement of the tibio-talar and talo-calcaneal joints are possible. This thesis details (i) the development of a perturbation rig that allows foot movement in single- or three-DOF with associated real-time visual target-matching software, and (ii) the use of the rig to investigate the stabilisation of the ankle joint complex in single- and three-DOF. The experimental procedure used a common task performed in three experimental conditions. Subjects were required to maintain a neutral foot position while developing varying levels of plantar-flexion torque. A perturbation was applied to the foot if subjects were within specified tolerance for both foot position and torque, represented by the visual display. Performance of the task in the first condition required the subject to only match torque as the foot position was fixed, with the perturbation being applied in dorsi-flexion (ie, single-DOF). The second experimental condition allowed the foot to move in the sagittal plane, hence subjects were required to control both torque and foot position in single-DOF, with perturbation applied in dorsi-flexion. The third condition enabled movement in dorsi/plantar-flexion, inversion/eversion and adduction/abduction (three-DOF) in both task and perturbation. Subjects were required to maintain the neutral foot position and the necessary torque level. There were three areas of interest common to each experimental protocol. The muscle strategy used to complete the task was investigated using a combination of surface and fine-wire electromyography on lower leg and thigh muscles. The 500ms period prior to perturbation was investigated to determine if synergies were evident between muscles such as medial and lateral gastrocnemius, soleus and peroneus longus. Two classes of activation strategies for the three-DOF condition emerged from the subject population: differential activation of the triceps surae group, and co-contraction. The former strategy may take advantage of the distinct morphology of the lateral gastrocnemius and peroneus longus muscles to best perform the position-matching component of the 3D task. The results suggest that the ankle joint is mostly stabilised in 3D by the intrinsic mechanical actions of the muscles producing plantar flexion moments. The muscles stabilised the foot in inversion, but not in eversion where there was very little motion. However, the different activation strategies employed may have varied efficacy in contributing to joint stability. This form of active stabilisation means that the previous literature focus on reflexes to stabilise the joint may need to be reassessed. Likewise, it may be appropriate to use the perturbation rig to quantify active ankle joint stability in order to assess the probability of ankle injury, rather than the current clinical measures employed. The reflexive response due to the perturbation was examined in the 200ms following perturbation. Variation in the modulation of monosynaptic reflexes was observed between subjects in various muscles in the higher DOF tasks. This is likely due to the differing activation strategies used to perform the task, and the variability in the kinematic response to perturbation. An attempt was made to calculate the intrinsic mechanical properties of the joint in 3-D using the kinematic and kinetic data during the first 15 ms period of perturbation. The system was modelled as a spring-damper using a constrained non-linear least squares, with stiffness and viscous terms for each axis, and inertial tensor elements as variables in the routine. The effect of increased muscle activation on the displacement of the foot about each of the anatomical axes was to significantly lower the movement of the sub-talar joint.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankle -- Mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">Joints -- Range of motion -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Degree of freedom</field><field name="subject">Muscles -- Motility</field><field name="subject">Muscle activation</field><field name="subject">Perturbation</field><field name="subject">Reflexes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local feedback regulation of salt &amp; water transport across pumping epithelia : experimental &amp; mathematical investigations in the isolated abdominal skin of Bufo marinus</field><field name="creator">Thomson, Susmita</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This study describes the results of a four and a half year investigation examining local regulation of ion transport through pumping epithelial cells. The study focussed on the standard isolated toad skin preparation, made famous by Hans Ussing. Originally, the objective was to perform some simple manipulations on the isolated toad skin, a standard and well-tested epithelial layer, which, according to the literature, was a well-behaved and stable preparation. The purpose of doing these toad skin experiments was to gain familiarity with the experimental techniques, such as measuring the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the short-circuit current (Isc) across an epithelium. In the process, the experimental information that was obtained was to assist in the development and refinement of a mathematical model of a single pumping epithelial cell . . . Finally, it should be emphasised the toad skin was a convenient tissue model for exploring more general issues such as: (i) how pumping epithelial cells may adjust to changes in the extracellular environment by locally regulating their membrane conductances; (2) how the topology of a cell can influence its function (i.e. the topology can determine whether a cell is optimised for salt transport or water transport). (3) how different cells, with different functions, may be positioned in apposition in a pumping epithelial tissue so that gradients generated by one cell type can be utilised by another. From a broader perspective, it is likely that such issues are also applicable to other pumping epithelia, and ultimately, may assist in understanding how these epithelia function.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epithelial cells -- Electric properties</field><field name="subject">Cellular control mechanisms -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Bufo marinus -- Cytology</field><field name="subject">Salt and ion transport</field><field name="subject">Toad skin</field><field name="subject">Pumping epithelia</field><field name="subject">Local feedback regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tumour necrosis factor : alpha signal transduction in rat corpus luteum apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Abdo, Michael A.</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  Apoptosis is a morphologically distinct form of cell death that is involved in the regulation of normal and aberrant cell systems. The complexities of the apoptotic cell death pathway arise from variation in both the cellular specialisation and initial stimulus. The corpus luteum (CL) is an endocrine gland that whilst critical to the maintenance of pregnancy in the rat, regresses at the completion of each oestrous cycle and pregnancy. This regression is facilitated through apoptosis; though, the stimulus and factors involved in the apoptotic pathway are poorly understood.  Previous studies suggest that CL regression is not initiated through failure of luteotrophic support, but rather the active production of a luteolytic factor, of which tumour necrosis factor -alpha (TNF&#945;) is one possible candidate. Several publications have reported the participation of the immune system in ovarian events. There is evidence that TNF&#945; expression within the ovary is coordinated between cells of the immune system and the hormonal regulation of the CL.  This study has focussed on the role of TNF&#945; in CL apoptosis and the factors involved in this apoptotic pathway. TNF&#945;-induced cell death is governed by the presence of the two TNF&#945; receptors (TNFR) and several second messenger systems that include; the sphingolipids, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, nitric oxide (NO), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&#954;B) and the caspases.  These factors and their interactions were assessed in the rat CL during pregnancy and post-partum, and in vitro. Apoptosis was measured through the analysis of DNA fragmentation using DNA 3&#8217; end labelling and single cell electrophoresis (COMET assay). Assessment of mRNA and protein expression was through Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis; proteins were localised within the CL by immunocytochemistry. In addition, specific measurement of sphingolipid expression and nitric oxide (NO) production was by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and NO assay respectively.  Following parturition, TNF&#945; mRNA and protein expression increased corresponding to the onset of CL apoptosis and increased expression of the chemotactic factor monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP-1). Furthermore, CL apoptosis was induced by treatment with recombinant TNF&#945; in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A similar effect was observed in isolated luteal cells. Simultaneously, the functional regression of the CL was assessed by measurement of both progesterone synthesis and steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein expression. StAR mRNA and protein expression declined toward parturition in vivo.  Immunocytochemical studies revealed the presence of TNF&#945; receptors 1 (TNFR1) and 2 (TNFR2) in luteal cells. Furthermore, TNFR mRNA was isolated from CL throughout pregnancy and post-partum. Subsequently, the role of the sphingolipids ceramide and sphingosine was examined during CL apoptosis in vitro. Ceramide and sphingosine were found to be potent apoptotic agents when administered in vitro (50&#181;M).  The downstream signal transduction of TNF&#945; and ceramide was assessed through MAP kinase expression. Both TNF&#945; and ceramide increased expression of the pro-apoptotic p38 MAP kinase with no change to the non-apoptotic extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1&amp;2). Despite previous reports of c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK) involvement in the cell death pathway, JNK expression was not evident in the rat CL.  The caspases are a family of cysteine proteases central to the regulation and execution of apoptosis. General inhibition of the caspase cascade in vitro was effective in preventing apoptosis regardless of the apoptotic stimulus (TNF&#945;, ceramide and sphingosine), suggesting that this pathway is central to CL apoptosis. Specific inhibition of several caspases produced a varying effect; inhibition of caspases 3, 6 and 8 significantly reduced the level of TNF&#945;-induced apoptosis, thus supporting their classification as either regulatory or effector caspases.  NO is endowed with the unique ability to initiate and to block apoptosis and this dichotomy extends to the cytotoxic actions of TNF&#945;. Inhibition of NO production by treating CL with L-NAME prevented the onset of apoptosis, whilst NO production increased in response to increasing levels of apoptosis following trophic withdrawal. However, this effect was not seen during TNF&#945;-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the actions of NO are independent of TNF&#945;.  The data presented within this study examine multiple elements of the TNF&#945; cell death pathway in a single system. The results suggest that these elements are involved in TNF&#945; signal transduction and furthermore, in rat CL apoptosis. It can be said that TNF&#945; plays an active role in CL regression through the activation of the caspases, the sphingolipids and the MAP kinases.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rats -- Reproduction -- Endocrine aspects</field><field name="subject">Corpus luteum</field><field name="subject">Tumor necrosis factor</field><field name="subject">Cellular signal transduction</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">TNF&#945;</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="subject">Rat</field><field name="subject">Ovary</field><field name="subject">Cell death pathways</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calcareous nannofossil and foraminiferal analysis of the middle to upper cretaceous Bathurst Island Group, Northern Bonaparte Basin and Darwin Shelf, Northern Australia</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Robert John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The Northern Bonaparte Basin and adjacent Darwin Shelf form part of a major petroleum province on the northwestern margin of Australia. The middle to Late Cretaceous Bathurst Island Group consists of siliciclastic and pelagic carbonate strata that form the regional seal to underlying Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous reservoir sandstones. The Bathurst Island Group has previously been subdivided into four stratigraphic sequences or &#8216;play intervals&#8217; bound by regional disconformities in the Valanginian (KV horizon), Lower Aptian (KA horizon), upper Lower Cenomanian (KC horizon), Middle Campanian (KSC horizon), and at the CretaceousPaleocene boundary (T horizon). Correlation of these sedimentary packages and stratigraphic surfaces requires high-resolution calcareous microfossil biostratigraphy, while palaeobathymetric determinations based on benthonic foraminiferal assemblages are important for determining the subsidence history of the area and relative sea-level changes.  This study presents the first detailed stratigraphic distributions, taxonomic lists and illustrations of foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils from the Bathurst Island Group of the Northern Bonaparte Basin and Darwin Shelf. A biostratigraphic framework has been constructed for the study area incorporating &#8216;standard&#8217; (Tethyan) Cretaceous planktonic foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil events where applicable, and integrating locally defined events where necessary. This framework allows Cretaceous strata to be correlated regionally across the study area and to the global chronostratigraphic scale. Correlation of the Northern Bonaparte Basin and Darwin Shelf strata to the Cretaceous Stages and international time scale is based on recent ties of nannofossil and foraminiferal events to macrofossil zones and palaeomagnetic polarity chrons at ratified and proposed Global Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs). Calcareous nannofossil events recorded in the study area that are critical for defining stage boundaries include the lowest occurrences of Prediscosphaera columnata, Micula decussata, Lithastrinus grillii, and Aspidolithus parcus parcus, and the highest occurrences of Helenea chiastia, Lithastrinus moratus, Aspidolithus parcus constrictus, and Eiffellithus eximius. Important planktonic foraminiferal events for correlation include the lowest occurrences of Rotalipora gr. globotruncanoides, and Dicarinella asymetrica, and the highest occurrences of Planomalina buxtorfi, Rotalipora cushmani, and Dicarinella asymetrica. During the middle to Late Cretaceous the Northern Bonaparte Basin and Darwin Shelf occupied mid-high palaeolatitudes between 35&#186;S to 45&#186;S. These palaeolatitudes are reflected in the transitional character of the planktonic microfossil assemblages, which combine elements of the low-latitude, warm-water Tethyan Province to the north and the cool-water high-latitude Austral Province to the south. &#8216;Standard&#8217; Tethyan zonations are most applicable for uppermost AlbianMiddle Campanian strata because equator-to-pole temperature gradients were weakly developed, and global climate was warm and equable during this interval. These conditions resulted in broad latitudinal distributions for Tethyan marker species, and consequently most UC calcareous nannofossil zones and European-Mediterranean planktonic foraminiferal zones are recognised. In contrast, the EarlyLate Albian and the late Middle CampanianMaastrichtian were intervals of greater bioprovinciality and stronger palaeotemperature gradients. In these intervals application of the Tethyan zonations is more difficult, and a number of the Tethyan biostratigraphic markers are absent from the study area (e.g. Ticinella species in the Albian and Radotruncana calcarata in the Late Campanian). Cretaceous palaeobathymetric reconstruction of the study area is based on comparison of the foraminiferal assemblages with those of previous Cretaceous palaeobathymetric studies. Marginal marine assemblages consist solely of low diversity siliceous agglutinated foraminifera (e.g. Trochammina). Inner and middle neritic water depths (0-100 m) contain rare to common planktonic foraminifera (mainly globigerine forms), robertinids (e.g. Epistomina), siliceous agglutinates, lagenids, buliminids (e.g. Neobulimina), and rotaliids. The outer neritic zone (100-200 m water depth) contains abundant planktonic foraminifera (keeled and globigerine), calcareous agglutinates (e.g. Dorothia), and diverse lagenids, buliminids, and rotaliids. Upper-middle bathyal water depths (200-1000 m) are characterised by abundant planktonic foraminifera, common siliceous agglutinated taxa (e.g. Glomospira), rare to common Osangularia, and globular species of Gyroidinoides, Pullenia, and Paralabamina.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paleontology -- Australia -- Bonaparte Gulf Basin (W.A. and N.T.) -- Cretaceous</field><field name="subject">Foraminifera, Fossil -- Australia -- Bonaparte Gulf Basin (W.A. and N.T.)</field><field name="subject">Nannofossils -- Australia -- Bonaparte Gulf Basin (W.A. and N.T.)</field><field name="subject">Paleontology -- Northern Territory -- Bathurst Island -- Cretaceous</field><field name="subject">Foraminifera, Fossil -- Northern Territory -- Bathurst Island</field><field name="subject">Nannofossils -- Northern Territory -- Bathurst Island</field><field name="subject">Paleontology -- Northern Territory -- Darwin Shelf -- Cretaceous</field><field name="subject">Foraminifera, Fossil -- Northern Territory -- Darwin Shelf</field><field name="subject">Nannofossils -- Northern Territory -- Darwin Shelf</field><field name="subject">Cretaceous</field><field name="subject">Foraminifera</field><field name="subject">Calcareous nannofossils</field><field name="subject">Northern Bonaparte Basin</field><field name="subject">Darwin Shelf</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of dietary phenolic compounds in the detoxification of reactive nitrogen species</field><field name="creator">Morton, Lincoln William</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract.  Please see the pdf format for the complete text.]  Interest in the role of peroxynitrite in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has increased due to many in vitro studies which have demonstrated its potent oxidising and nitrating capability and immunohistochemical staining studies which demonstrate nitration of tyrosine in vivo. It is frequently suggested that the production of nitric oxide and superoxide at sites of inflammation implicates peroxynitrite as the major damaging reactive nitrogen species in vivo. Evidence for a role for peroxynitrite is often demonstrated by measurement of 3-nitrotyrosine yet even this cannot distinguish peroxynitrite from other nitrating species. Clearly, however, if peroxynitrite is important in atherogenesis, then identification of mechanisms for its detoxification could provide a means of preventing such effects. Therefore, this Thesis has sought to determine whether phenolic compounds of dietary origin can be preferentially nitrated by reactive nitrogen species thereby protecting endogenous structures, such as low density lipoproteins, from atherogenic modifications. This Thesis focuses upon phenolic acids as they have received relatively less attention than other classes of phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, yet they are quite abundant in socially important beverages such as red wine. In order to complete the required analyses, the development of methods to detect phenolic acids and their nitration products together with 3-nitrotyrosine, dityrosine and 5-nitro-&#947;-tocopherol was necessary. The initial in vitro experiments described herein sought to determine the products of reaction of peroxynitrite with phenolic acids of the 4-hydroxy and 3,4-dihydroxy type and then to examine whether these products could account for a protective effect upon tyrosine, lipids and endogenous anti-oxidants, if any was observed, when isolated LDL was treated with SIN-1, which releases peroxynitrite through the simultaneous generation of nitric oxide and superoxide. A concurrent minor focus was to examine the relationship between structure and activity of these phenolic acids under various regimes of oxidative insult. These experiments indicate that, at least in this in vitro model, oxidation is a dominant mechanism over nitration. Peroxynitrite was shown to nitrate coumaric acid in moderate yields but exclusive oxidation of caffeic acid appeared to occur. Although a potential role for &#947;-tocopherol as an anti-nitration agent was inferred, all types of chemical treatment of LDL in the presence of phenolic acids yielded oxidation as the primary end point. In fact, nitration of tyrosine was not detected and nitration of coumaric acid was at the limit of detection. Since nitration of tyrosine is generally regarded as important in many disease states, a more physiological nitrating mechanism involving artificially stimulated neutrophils was used. This system demonstrated that although physiologically relevant reactive nitrogen species can result in nitration of phenolic compounds, in a complex system including biological structures (LDL) and phenolic compounds, oxidation but not nitration of all species appears to occur. As a consequence of the results above, an examination of carotid plaque was undertaken to determine to what extent nitration occurred relative to oxidation in atherosclerotic tissue. These studies applied methods developed herein to detect 3-nitrotyrosine and dityrosine in complex biological matrices as markers of nitration and oxidation respectively. The data obtained demonstrated that nitration was a minor modification of protein (0.01%) compared to oxidation (0.3%) even in a highly diseased tissue such as carotid artery plaque. A secondary study examining plasma revealed that dityrosine, which has been implicated in irreversible albumin aggregation in chronic renal failure and more recently in heart disease, is elevated in chronic renal failure subjects compared to well matched controls. A separate examination of plasma from healthy subjects revealed that in both the fasting and post prandial state 3-nitrotyrosine could not be detected and, in fact, interfering species could be problematic in the GC-MS analysis of 3-nitrotyrosine. The lack of nitration of any substrate observed in vitro using reactive nitrogen species generated in the aqueous phase, the relative lack of nitration of tyrosine in plaque proteins and the lipophilicity of nitric oxide, the precursor of all reactive nitrogen species, suggested that nitration could be more closely associated with lipid structures. The known ability of &#947;-tocopherol to form 5-nitro-&#947;-tocopherol was used to probe this concept. The 5-nitro-&#947;-tocopherol content of lipid extracts obtained from carotid artery plaques was very high (30%). This indicated that nitration is predominantly a lipid phase phenomenon and that nitrating species are present in much greater abundance than oxidising species in vivo.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis -- Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">Antioxidants -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Phenolic acids -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Nitration -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Vitamin E -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Nytrotyrosine</field><field name="subject">Nitro-gamma-tocopherol</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0026</field></doc></add>
