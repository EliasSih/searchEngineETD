However it places physical and chemical stress upon soil structure, which may affect soil physical properties, soil water availability and grapevine functioning. Common soil types within Australian vineyards appear vulnerable to soil degradation and there is emerging evidence of such degradation occurring. Two South Australian vineyards (one located at Nuriootpa in the Barossa Valley, the other in the McLaren Vale winegrowing region) were used to examine evidence of altered soil physical properties due to irrigation. Significantly higher soil strength and lower permeability was found under or near the dripper in irrigated soils. There was also evidence that irrigation increased subsoil bulk density at Nuriootpa. It was uncertain how irrigation caused these changes. While sodicity was present at Nuriootpa, it appeared the physical pressures exerted by irrigation, such as rapid wetting and prolonged wetness, also contributed. To gauge the severity of the degradation at Nuriootpa, a modelling study assessed the impact of higher soil strength and salinity on grapevine transpiration. The SWAP model (Soil- Water-Atmosphere-Plant) was modified and then calibrated using soil moisture data from Nuriootpa. Simulations were conducted for different irrigation regimes and the model output indicated that degradation led to a reduction in cumulative transpiration, which was almost entirely due to higher soil strength. However the reduction was relatively minor and there was evidence of water extraction by roots in all soil layers. Hence the degradation, in terms of higher soil strength and salinity, was not considered a significant management problem in the short - term. Evidence of increased waterlogging and its consequences require further investigation. Roots were observed in soils at Nuriootpa with penetration resistance (PR) much greater than 2 MPa, which was thought to completely impede grapevine root growth. It was hypothesised that roots avoided the physically hostile matrix by using biopores or structural cracks. A pot experiment tested this hypothesis and examined the relationship between soil strength, biopores and root growth for grapevines. Grapevine rootlings (cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) were grown into pots with varying degrees of soil compaction, with and without artificial biopores. No root growth occurred when PR&gt;2 MPa unless biopores were present. Pores also improved root growth in non-compacted soil when PR approached 1 MPa, which suggested biopores influence root growth in soils regardless of compaction levels. Therefore PR should not be the only tool used to examine the rooting-potential of a vineyard soil. An assessment of soil structure, such as biopore density and size, should be incorporated. In drip-irrigated vineyards, there is a possibility that degraded clayey subsoils could be ameliorated by manipulating zones of soil drying. At distances away from the dripper, drying events could generate shrinkage cracks that improve drainage and provide opportunities for root growth. From a practical perspective, drying events could be manipulated by moving the dripper laterally or by changing the irrigation frequency and intensity. The potential of this simple, non-invasive, ameliorative approach was investigated. Large, intact cores were sampled from Nuriootpa subsoil where degradation had been identified. Individual core bulk density was calculated using a formula that was derived by solving two common soil physics equations simultaneously. This proved to be an accurate and non - invasive method. Half the cores were leached with a calcium solution, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K [subscript s] ) was measured on all cores before and after drying to a matric potential of -1500 kPa. Soil drying led to a significant increase in K [subscript s], which indicated an improvement in structure through the creation of shrinkage cracks and heaving. Calcium treatment had no impact on K [subscript s], but that could change with more wetting and drying cycles. Results indicated the need for further investigation in the field, where different compressive and tensile forces operate. Harnessing this mechanism may provide an attractive soil management option for growers. The soil physical degradation identified is concerning for sustainable production in irrigated vineyards. Given the sites were representative of typical irrigation practices, such degradation may be widespread. While modelling suggested the impact of higher soil strength and salinity was minimal, these properties should be monitored because they may worsen with continuing irrigation. Furthermore, the impact of irrigation on subsoil permeability needs to be defined more accurately. An increased incidence of waterlogging could significantly restrict production, which was evident when overly wet growing seasons were modelled. If subsoil permeability was found to be significantly lower in irrigated soils, amelioration may be required. In this instance, the use of drying events to generate structure provides an option. Ultimately, the impact of drip irrigation on soil physical quality warrants further attention, and it is imperative to monitor the physical quality of vineyard soils to ensure sustainable production.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58642</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of environmental factors on the development of corticotroph subpopulations in the fetal sheep pituitary.</field><field name="creator">Farrand, Kirsten</field><field name="description">The prepartum surge in fetal plasma cortisol, essential for the maturation of organs in mammals and the normal timing of parturition in some species, including sheep, may result from an increase in the molar ratio of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the fetal circulation. Related to this, the cleavage of POMC to ACTH by the enzyme, prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), may be influenced by corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the capacity of individual corticotrophs to process POMC to ACTH may vary and individual corticotrophs are differentially responsive to CRH. It is not known, however, if there are separate corticotroph subpopulations in the fetal sheep pituitary which can be identified by differential colocalisation of POMC, ACTH and the CRH receptor 1, CRHR&#8321;, nor if changes in the relative proportions of such subpopulations play a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the overall changes in pituitary function described previously during gestation and in response to suboptimal uterine environments. To investigate these hypotheses, it was first necessary to develop novel methods for the simultaneous immunohistochemical labelling of POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; in individual cells on sections of fetal sheep pituitary. In addition, I developed and validated an automated method to categorise and count individual cells to increase the quantitative power of this study. Pituitary tissue was collected from control fetuses at 53-55 (n=6), 63-85 (n=6), 110 (n=4), 139-141 (n=4) and 144-145 (n=6) days gestation. Two animal models, known to alter pituitary function in the fetal sheep, were used to investigate corticotrophic adaptations to suboptimal uterine environments. For the maternal periconceptional undernutrition (PCUN) model, maternal feed was reduced to 70% of maintenance requirements from at least 45 days before to 7 days after mating and fetal tissues were collected at 53-55 days gestation (n=7). For the placental restriction (PR) model, the majority of the placental attachment sites were removed in five ewes before mating and fetal tissues were collected at 140 (n=4) and 144 (n=4) days gestation. Pituitary sections were simultaneously labelled with antisera raised against full length POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; and the proportions of pituitary cells with combinations of antisera were quantified. Four subpopulations of corticotrophs were identified, which expressed either: POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321;, ACTH+CRHR&#8321;, POMC+ CRHR&#8321; or POMConly. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of pituitary cells expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; between 53-55 and 65-85 days gestation, before an increase at 110 days gestation and a further marked decrease between 139-141 and 144-145 days gestation. In fetuses from the PCUN group, the proportion of pituitary cells expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; in early gestation was reduced. PR resulted in a significantly higher proportion of corticotrophs expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; during the prepartum period. This work represents the discovery of the differential expression of POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; in individual corticotrophs of the fetal sheep pituitary and the first insights into the pituitary adaptations to periconceptional nutrient restriction and placental restriction at the level of individual corticotrophs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endocrinology; ontogeny; fetal origins of adult disease; periconceptional undernutrition; placental restriction; immunohistochemistry; image analysis</field><field name="subject">Sheep Fetuses Physiology.</field><field name="subject">Pituitary gland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58643</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of phosphorus uptake pathways in a non-responsive arbuscular mycorrhizal host.</field><field name="creator">Grace, Emily Jane</field><field name="description">AM plants acquire Pi via two pathways; the direct uptake pathway via plant roots and the AM pathway via external fungal hyphae and colonised cortical cells. It has been assumed that these two pathways are additive and therefore in non-responsive plants the AM pathway is often considered to be non-functional. However, data from &#179;&#178;P uptake studies indicates that the AM pathway is functional in many non-responsive symbioses and in some instances supplies the majority of plant P. In recent years the high-affinity Pi transporters involved in both direct and AM Pi uptake pathways have been identified. They are expressed at the root epidermis and the symbiotic interface of colonised cortical cells and respond to the P and AM status of the plant. The overall objective of the work described in this thesis was to characterise Pi uptake via the AM pathway in barley, a non-responsive AM host, using an approach which integrated physiological measurements of plant responsiveness and AM contribution with investigations of gene expression and functional characterisation of the plant Pi transporters. A preliminary survey of field-grown barley demonstrated the persistence of AM colonisation under commercial cropping regimes in southern Australia and highlighted the relevance of AM studies to commercial agriculture. Under glasshouse conditions AM colonisation of barley induced depressions in growth and P uptake compared to NM controls. Growth depressions were unrelated to percent colonisation by two AM fungal species and could not readily be explained by fungal C demand; the strong correlation between growth and P content suggested that P was the limiting factor in these experiments. However, a compartmented pot system incorporating &#179;&#178;P-labelling demonstrated that the AM pathway is functional in colonised barley and, in the interaction with G. intraradices, contributed 48% of total P. This suggested that P flux via the direct uptake pathway is decreased in AM barley. The expression of three Pi transporters, HvPT1, HvPT2 and HvPT8 was investigated in colonised roots. HvPT1 and HvPT2 have previously been localised to the root epidermis and root hairs and are involved in Pi uptake via the direct pathway whilst HvPT8 is an AM-inducible Pi transporter which was localised by in-situ hybridisation to colonised cortical cells. Using promoter::GFP gene fusions the localisation of HvPT8 to arbuscule-containing cortical cells was confirmed in living roots from transgenic barley. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the expression of these three Pi transporters indicated that HvPT1 and HvPT2 were expressed constantly, under all conditions regardless of AM colonisation status and indicated that decreased P flux via the direct pathway is not related to expression of these transporters. HvPT8 was induced in AM colonised roots. However, the level of expression was not related to flux via the AM pathway or arbuscular colonisation. The HvPT8 transporter was further characterised by constitutive over-expression in transgenic barley. &#179;&#178;P uptake assays in excised roots demonstrated increased Pi uptake from low P solution compared to wild-type roots and confirmed that HvPT8 is a functional Pi transporter with high-affinity transport properties. This is the first report of characterisation of an AM-inducible Pi transporter in planta. When these transgenic plants were grown in solution culture there was no increase in growth or P uptake relative to wild-type or transgenic controls and growth in soil and AM colonisation were also unaffected in these transgenic lines. The data presented in this thesis highlights the importance of combined physiological and molecular approaches to characterising plant AM interactions. The persistence of AM colonisation in barley in the field indicates the importance of improving our understanding of symbiotic function in non-responsive plants. Future efforts should be directed towards understanding the signals which regulate P flux via both the direct and AM pathways with the ultimate aim of enhancing AM responsiveness of non-responsive species. Making the direct and AM pathways additive in nonresponsive species should be a key aim of future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphorus; phosphate transporter; barley; arbuscular mycorrhiza; symbiosis; plant nutrition; plant gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58644</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An extension of the Jolly-Seber model combining two sources of capture-recapture data</field><field name="creator">Madon, B&#233;n&#233;dicte</field><field name="description">I propose a modification of the Jolly-Seber model, the two-source Jolly-Seber (TSJS) model, to estimate population size by combining two sources of capture-recapture data of the same population where there might be an unknown overlap between two datasets. This is the case with recent surveys of whales and dolphins where researchers use individual identification records from both photo-identification and DNA profiling of skin biopsy samples. This sampling configuration results in two datasets that might contain the same individuals. This new approach enables the estimation of the overlap and the calculation of the population size using capture-recapture information arising from both sampling methods. Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the properties of the present estimator. When all the assumptions are met, the estimator seems to be unbiased as long as the occasion-specific simultaneous sampling probability is above 0.2. Simulation analyses also indicate that the proposed method performs better than existing closed-population estimators when there is little heterogeneity among individuals in capture probabilities and when the average capture probability is high. Alternatives have been explored and a two-source version of model M0 has also been developed and compared to the TSJS estimator. Traditional closed-population estimators have been compared to the new approaches (TSJS and two-source M0 models) when the population is open and the assumption of homogeneous capture probability is violated. Both procedures are finally applied to real data on the humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, on the wintering grounds of New Caledonia (South Pacific), where individuals have been sampled independently by skin sampling biopsy and photo-identification or simultaneously by both methods on a same capture occasion. The proposed methods hold great promise in monitoring by providing researchers and managers with a method allowing a diversity of sampling protocols. It could be more efficient in estimating population size, in terms of both precision and bias, than models based only on one type of data. And as it is important to control variation in a sampling design, this methodology could also provide a useful way to reduce variation by increasing the sample size and, hence, to enhance the estimator precision.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5631</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tuo Mao: the Operational History of the People's Liberation Army</field><field name="creator">Andrew, Martin Kenneth</field><field name="description">This thesis shows that the doctrine of Active Defence has been the overriding concern of the PLA since 1950 and not any form of People&#8217;s War. Active Defence is based on three basic principles: no provocation of other nations; no bases anywhere on foreign soil; and no seizure of territory. The PLA&#8217;s articulated doctrine in the 1950s was to &#8216;Protect the North and Defend the South&#8217;. In the 1960s this changed to &#8216;Lure the Enemy Deep into the Country&#8217; in order to crush him with &#8216;People&#8217;s War&#8217;. In the 1970s, this became &#8216;Prepare to Fight Early and Fight Big&#8217;. By using examples of the PLA in battle this thesis shows how the doctrine changed in light of failures in battle. The post-Mao reorganisation of the PLA to rectify these faults turned it into a modern military force, building on this legacy by transforming itself into a hardened and networked military. The PLA has now reached a stage of its history where it can fully implement its operational art that took root in the theories espoused in the 1920s and 1930s through the Soviet model, and tried to be implemented in the 1950s and 1960s only to be thwarted by the Cultural Revolution.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Storytelling memories : a tangible connection to bomber command veterans : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Marriott, Tanya</field><field name="description">As we pass the 6oth anniversary of the end of World War Two (WW2) historians are diligently collecting the memoirs of veterans to preserve for future generations. Public archives of memorabilia, letters, photos and artefacts, in the process of digitisation are complimenting the stone memorials of the past. This material culture of memory discusses human interaction. &#8220;The poor, the rich, the brave and the afraid, the hero and the deserter&#8221; (Moriarty, 1999, p 654). In contemporary museum culture this digitised information is presented in either web-based systems, or interactive kiosks. However, this approach to packaging memories and historical data often leaves out much of the depth of the topic information, skimming the surface of the knowledge conveyed. New solutions to memory and artefact display have been developed effectively in the Churchill room&#8217;s exhibit designed by Small Design (Kabat,2008) and Memory Miner (Memory Miner, 2008), a home-based memory archive programme by John Fox. Both convey the memories and artefacts upon a mapped interface, using our desire to discover and connect with memories to navigate the narrative in a self-guided format. The Storytelling Memories project seeks to build on current research to formulate an interactive platform of memory immersion and experience within a museum environment. The project utilises a touch sensitive surface as an interface between the viewer and the memories. A physical controller, when placed near the interface surface will &#8220;unlock&#8221; contained memories, enabling an open-ended storytelling experience. The design encourages the user to interact directly with the memories to create their own dialogue, with the intention of developing a more emotive, personal connection to the Veteran.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World War Two</field><field name="subject">museum exhibit design</field><field name="subject">war veterans</field><field name="subject">interactive platform</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410306 Communications and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1045</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He urupounamu e whakahaerengia ana e te wh&#257;nau : wh&#257;nau decision processes : a thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health (M&#257;ori), Massey University.

This thesis describes principles and practice that whanau utilise in decision processes from the findings of a retrospective qualitative case study of three whanau, who decided to participate in genetic research into a medical condition affecting their health. Four elements of whanau decision processes emerged from the data. Hui, rangatiratanga, manaakitanga and kotahitanga are Maori constructs that emphasise the collective nature of whanau decision making, and substantiate philosophical, theoretical and anecdotal evidence that Maori have distinctive ways of reaching decisions, underpinned by unique philosophical conventions. The results of this research place greater significance on the process of decision making than actual decisions, an incidental finding that has not been articulated by previous studies of Maori health and whanau. Contrary to western theoretical knowledge of decision making, whanau decision processes are collective activities. Individual decision making is closely linked to and depends on the collective, because individual identity manifests from the collective, and individual wellbeing is closely linked to that of the collective. When decision processes are familiar to members of a whanau, they are more likely to engage in decision making because they have a greater sense of knowledge and thus control of the processes, and they feel more able to contribute meaningfully to achieving aspirations for their own health. This thesis provides evidence that the New Zealand health sector, health legislation and policies are largely unfavourable for guaranteeing whanau engagement in decision processes. Yet, whanau decision making is an overall objective of the Government&#8217;s Maori Health Strategy: He Korowai Oranga, to address inequalities in health between Maori and other New Zealanders that have unacceptably become the norm.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori health</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Wh&#257;nau</field><field name="subject">Decision making</field><field name="subject">Hauora</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1349</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bringing the market 'back into' supermarket : creating a social hub for local communities : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walters, Amie</field><field name="description">This design project addresses the contemporary supermarket chain, seeking to bring back to this typology the traditional sociality and dynamic qualities of the urban marketplace. In this sense to &#8216;bring back&#8217; does not mean to restore time, but rather to provide the means for public engagement by establishing the supermarket as an active civic space. By negotiating between the micro-levels of everyday life and the macro-levels of culture and civic society, I propose to transform the supermarket into a communal &#8216;event-space&#8217; by formulating a &#8216;kit of parts&#8217; that is applied to the national supermarket chain New World &#8211; &#8220;the only local supermarket nationwide&#8221; &#8211; thereby establishing it as a viable, productive social hub. Encouraging health and wellbeing benefits through the rituals of cooking, dining, learning, communing and consuming, this sociocultural connection to the commercial environment also reinforces health research studies, which advocate a community-based approach toward producing the best outcome for upward mobility and community revitalization. The concept is developed through research into historical and contemporary models to a final proposal of a range of Communal Elements. These elements are adapted and applied to three site-specific locations around New Zealand within an urban, suburban and rural context. This new approach to land use, innovative partnerships, health planning and sensory-based design strategies instigates a radical revision of the role of the supermarket. The thesis proposes that this is not only fiscally viable but that it provides positive assets to communities and neighbourhoods as a global entity within a local reality.

Polyrhythm is a musical term for the simultaneous occurrence of two or more independent rhythms.

These issues of recruitment and retention are reflected in other areas for Maori such as health, where Maori have worse levels of health Maori are more likely to have lower socioeconomic status. The initial findings of recent research indicate that Maori nursing students find it a struggle to remain on the Bachelor of Health Science in nursing degree programme. This study is designed to explore further what might be occurring for Maori nursing students by obtaining a snapshot of their health. Aim: To describe the health status of Maori nursing students. Participants: 75 nursing students undertaking nursing degree programmes in New Zealand, who identified as Maori. Method: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken with Maori nursing students completing nursing degrees from thirteen of sixteen tertiary institutions in New Zealand. Instrument: A questionnaire comprising demographic data, SF-36, and two cultural questions was used for students to self assess their health status. Participants were also invited to write relevant comments on the survey. Findings: Descriptive statistical data revealed participants with a stronger cultural identity as Maori were more likely to have their cultural needs met whilst studying compared to participants with a weaker Maori cultural identity. Participants in a relationship had more income than those who were not in a relationship. Participants&#8217; overall health was worse than one year prior and their physical health was better than their mental health. More specifically, for physical health, general health, tiredness and lack of vitality were most affected, while roles and relationships were most affected for mental health. Implications: Institutions providing cultural support and kaupapa Maori programmes may assist in improving the recruitment and retention of Maori in nursing programmes. These results revealed a snapshot picture of the health 3 status of Maori nursing students and identified issues around their health status which is consistent with the literature.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing students</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">M&#257;ori</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1353</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical investigation of traffic flow : inhomogeneity induced emergence : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Liu, Mingzhe</field><field name="description">This research work is focused on understanding the effects of inhomogeneity on traffic flow by theoretical analysis and computer simulations. Traffic has been observed at almost all levels of natural and manmade systems (e.g., from microscopic protein motors to macroscopic objects like cars). For these various traffic, basic and emer- gent phenomena, modelling methods, theoretical analysis and physical meanings are normally concerned. Inhomogeneity like bottlenecks may cause traffic congestions or motor protein crowding. The crowded protein motors may lead to some human diseases. The congested traffic patterns have not been understood well so far. The modelling method in this research is based on totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). The following TASEP models are developed: TASEP with single inhomogeneity, TASEP with zoned inhomogeneity, TASEP with junction, TASEP with site sharing and different boundary conditions. These models are motivated by vehicular traffic, pedestrian trafficc, ant traffic, protein motor traffic and/or Internet traffic. Theoretical solutions for the proposed models are obtained and verified by Monte Carlo simulations. These theoretical results can be used as a base for further developments. The emergent properties such as phase transitions, phase separations and spontaneous symmetry breaking are observed and discussed. This study has contributed to a deeper understanding of generic traffic dynamics, particularly, in the presence of inhomogeneity, and has important implications for explanation or guidance of future traffic studies.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traffic flow</field><field name="subject">Computer modelling</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280210 Simulation and modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1350</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of subjective memory complaints in predicting cognitive impairment associated with future Alzheimer&#8217;s disease: a community based study</field><field name="creator">Tarantello, Concetta</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memory disorders -- Diagnosis.</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease -- Diagnosis.</field><field name="subject">Cognition disorders -- Diagnosis.</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychological tests.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6190</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing power balance in matrix organizations.</field><field name="creator">Saracoglu, Nursen Emine</field><field name="description">Modern organizations require new structural forms to cope with uncertainties arising from the challenges of global competition and rapid technological and environmental changes (Clarke and Clegg, 1998). One of the most important developments in the area of planned change has been on how to work with large systems so as to initiate and sustain change over time. It was from such contexts that the matrix concept emerged. During the 1950s the term matrix emerged in the United States aerospace industry and, as it has developed through the years, the term has come to be accepted in both business and academic circles. In the 1960s the matrix was sought as a fundamental alternative for dealing with unique management problems of coordination, communication and control (Davis and Lawrence, 1977). In the 1970s and 1980s interest in matrix organizational structures peaked. Since that time, research and literature on the matrix has diminished; contrarily, organizations continue to adopt the matrix as a viable alternative to deal with their increasingly complex business environment. In the recent past, some of the companies that applied a complex global matrix structure have included Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), Zurich (1991); Brown &amp; Root (BR), UK (1999); Hatch (1999) &#8211; Formerly BHPE and Kaiser mergers; IMC (1999); Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB), (1999); and Sinclair Knight and Merz (SKM), (2002). These companies have used matrix structures to achieve worldwide economies of scale, combined with local flexibility and responsiveness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of political theories of organizations in major international companies that have implemented matrix structure, with a focus that includes identifying: i. The key factors behind the strategic decision to change the corporate organization in international companies to a matrix structure. ii. The weaknesses and strengths of these matrix structures for subsequent organizational performance. iii. The effects of transition to matrix structure on organizational performance. iv. The factors used to maintain a power balance between divisions. v. A model that seeks to diminish or reduce matrix structure weaknesses to increase organizational effectiveness. The research was conducted in the form of a questionnaire survey and semistructured interviews. To illustrate the implementation of the matrix structure that occurred in a real world environment, SKM has been researched as an intensive case study. Preface As a professional engineer I have had opportunities to be involved with major projects in various international organizations. I have also had opportunities to observe organizations and to analyse their operations by exploring existing procedures and manuals. It was noticeable that the overall success of the projects relied very much on organizational decision making. This observation led my paradigm shift from projects to organizational studies and to the idea of conducting research that aims to investigate the weaknesses and strengths of matrix structures for organizational performance. Introduction Thesis structure This thesis presents a detailed account of the research activities undertaken by Nursen Saracoglu and the outcomes of that research. The purpose of this research is to investigate the validity of political theories of organizations in major international companies that have implemented matrix structure. Data has been collected using a combination of methods, including questionnaires, semistructured interviews, and direct examination of library catalogues and databases. The structure of this thesis is designed as follows: Chapter 1 introduces, and describes the background to the research project. The theories that provide a background to the various factors involved in organizations choosing to change to matrix structures, and the resulting positive and negative effects on the organization, are presented in this chapter. Chapters 2 reviews and analyses the literature review that has been conducted to focus, especially, on how changes to the structure and design of power in matrix organizations can have important implications and consequences. The literature review looks in detail at different organizational theories, particularly theories on power within organizations, which have a bearing on the effect of a matrix structure on an organization. Each theory is critiqued in terms of its relevance to matrix structure analysis. Strategic Contingencies Theory (SCT) and Resource Dependency Theory (RDT) best explain the effect of different levels of power inside a matrix structure. Chapter 3 details the research design and methodology. This chapter describes the advantages and disadvantages of quantitative and qualitative approaches and presents the rationale of selecting research methodology. The participating organization, SKM, is described in terms of its history and its matrix structure is outlined. Chapter 4 illustrates the results of research that defines potential areas of concern associated with matrix structures. The discussion mainly centres on the methods used to analyse the data and then focuses on the different dependent and independent variables derived from the data that are used in the analysis for correlation purposes. The aim of this chapter is to explain the various statistics used to analyse the data and to list the variables that came up as a result of answers to questionnaire. These variables are then analysed against each other in order to develop a sense of the effectiveness of the matrix structure in SKM. In Chapter 5 the qualitative data was examined using the responses obtained from interviews with the top managers of SKM. This chapter aims to identify the themes that have emerged from these interview responses and present them in order of most to least common within each area of research, illustrated with comments from some of the respondents. Chapter 6 discusses the survey and interview results in order to exploit quantitative findings to identify patterning in qualitative data. In parallel with SCT and RDT, the relationship between power and performance in matrix organizations is presented. The new concepts that emerged based on the research findings are introduced and discussed according to the relevance to the research objectives. Chapter 7 This chapter concludes the research and presents research limitations, boundaries, the contribution to the body of knowledge and a summary of future research opportunities. The case studies give a sense of how various elements of Matrix structure that outlined in this research were actually applied by other particular organizations are exhibited in Appendix A.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behaviour.</field><field name="subject">Organizational change.</field><field name="subject">Matrix organization.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1073</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and the follow-through experience in three year Bachelor of Midwifery programs in Australia. &#8216;Placements with women, not institutions&#8217;</field><field name="creator">Gray, Joanne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Background This research explored the follow-through experience in three year, pre-registration Bachelor of Midwifery programs in Australia. The follow-through experience involves midwifery students following women on their journey through pregnancy, labour and birth and into the early parenting period. The concept was introduced to midwifery education in Australia in 2001 when it was embedded in the foundational Australian College of Midwives. National Education Standards for Bachelor of Midwifery programs. The inclusion of the follow-through experience in Bachelor of Midwifery education programs was a deliberate strategy to ensure midwifery students would experience midwifery continuity of care. Aims The aims of this research were to: explore the follow-through experience in order to better understand its impact on students, midwifery education providers and midwives, and, to identify the learning that is associated with this experience. Setting This research was conducted in Australia. Students from all three-year pre-registration Bachelor of Midwifery programs were invited to participate. Design A qualitative study was undertaken. In-depth interviews were conducted with key stakeholders who had been involved in the development and implementation of the follow-through experience. Data were collected from former and current Bachelor of Midwifery students through an online survey and telephone interviews. A thematic analysis was undertaken and situated learning and constructivist theories were used to identify whether learning occurred in the context of the follow-through experience. Results The findings provided a unique insight into the follow-through experience from the perception of students and stakeholders. This research established that students do learn from their engagement in this experience. This learning was characterised by the primacy of the relationship with the women. Students also identified the challenges they faced in undertaking these experiences, including problems with recruitment and time commitment. Difficulties were identified around requirements of the follow-through experience, the lack of support at times for students, and the lack of congruence with the existing Australian maternity system. These difficulties were identified as having a significant impact on the students. ability to engage in, and to maximise their learning from, this experience. A conceptual model was developed to provide a synthesis of the results of this research and a framework for effective implementation and management of the follow-through experience. Implications This research has implications for midwifery education, particularly in Australia but also internationally. This experience does indeed provide unique learning opportunities for students. It is however essential that the student is given adequate support to aid their learning and to ensure they gain the most from these experiences. Conclusions The follow-through experience is an innovative education strategy and this research identified that learning occurred within this experience. This learning was identified as being situated in the context of students being placed with women. This research clearly identifies the value of the follow-through experience as an important component of student learning.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery students.</field><field name="subject">Midwifery education.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1081</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economics of managing congestion: with special reference to backcountry recreation</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Geoffrey N.</field><field name="description">The management of congestible recreation resources has been based largely on the concept of satisfaction. This concept is poorly defined and often does not reflect objectives for management of recreation resources. One way of addressing these problems is to define and use measurable objectives for management of recreation resources. One such objective is economic efficiency. The concept of efficiency is defined and economic theory developed to identify efficient allocations of congestible resources, the efficient capacities of resources under different allocation mechanisms, and the efficiency costs of use of lottery-based allocation mechanisms. The usefulness of this body of economic theory in allocation of backcountry recreational resources is addressed through investigation of ability to measure demand for congestible resources, and the problems associated with use of surrogate measures of demand.  Theoretical models of efficient management of congestible resources cannot be applied with the current state of knowledge because existing non-market valuation methods are not able to identify Hicksian-compensated demand functions for congestible backcountry recreation. Use of Marshallian demand measures introduces the possibility of resource misallocations of unknown direction and magnitude.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">congestion</field><field name="subject">recreation</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">crowding</field><field name="subject">welfare</field><field name="subject">demand</field><field name="subject">displacement</field><field name="subject">rationalisation</field><field name="subject">non-market valuation</field><field name="subject">160402 - Recreation, Leisure and Tourism Geography</field><field name="subject">140205 - Environment and Resource Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1971</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maturity modelling of corporate responsibility: New Zealand case studies</field><field name="creator">Nichols, E.</field><field name="description">Corporations are increasingly being expected to be responsible to not only shareholders, but also to employees, society and for the environment. This expectation increases as business crises, such the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the Enron collapse, continue to occur. In New Zealand several umbrella organisations were established to aid organisations in the quest to become sustainable or corporately responsible, such as New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development, New Zealand Businesses for Social Responsibility, and the Sustainable Business Network. A number of high profile companies such as Hubbard Foods Ltd, Landcare Research, Fonterra and Telecom belong to these umbrella organisations and have produced reports that reflect not only economic prosperity but also environmental quality and social equity. The aim of this research is to identify how organisations are implementing corporate responsibility issues into the operations, and using this information to construct a maturity model. The value of a maturity model is as an analytic tool, where an organisation can be benchmarked against the best in the field. Developing a maturity model for integrating corporate responsibility into an organisation enables managers to identify at which stage the organisation is currently situated and then provides an action plan of where to progress in the future. A preliminary maturity model is developed based on previous models from the fields of corporate responsibility, environmental management and sustainability. This exploratory study used the case study method to analyse six organisations that are members of the New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development and are producing annual sustainability reports. Using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines for sustainability reporting, 10 years of annual reports from each case company were analysed and compared against these guidelines. The results were used to identify what corporate responsibility areas businesses are currently reporting on and therefore implementing within the organisation, and identifying if there is an evolutionary pattern applicable to all organisations thereby enabling the construction of a maturity model. The findings show that although there was an increase in the GRI indicators included the reporting is poorly developed. The major areas of change have been in the reporting of governance and management structures, the development and inclusion of vision statements and changes in management policies. There was increased reporting in some environmental and social indicators, but no clear patterns of change emerged. Using the data and analysis a refinement of the proposed maturity model was made.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporate responsibility</field><field name="subject">global reporting initiative</field><field name="subject">maturity modelling</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">sustainability reporting</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340100 Economic Theory</field><field name="subject">150303 - Corporate Governance and Stakeholder Engagement</field><field name="subject">150106 - Sustainability Accounting and Reporting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1968</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of imperfect mixing in suspended plant and animal cell cultures</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Caleb Kin Lok, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A common problem observed in large-scale cell cultivation is reduced culture performance compared with small-scale processes due to the existence of concentration gradients caused by poor mixing. Small-scale simulations using microbial cell suspensions have shown that circulation of cells through concentration gradients of oxygen, pH and glucose can result in reduction of cell growth and product formation similar to the effects observed in large-scale bioreactors. This study was aimed at using scale-down studies to investigate poor mixing in large-scale bioreactors used for suspended plant and animal cell culture. Two plant cell suspensions and a hybridoma cell line were used in this work. The range of oxygen transfer coefficients achieved in the hybridoma and plant suspensions were about 50???20 h-1 and 12???6 h-1, respectively. One-vessel simulation was developed to induce fluctuations of dissolved oxygen tension in a 2-L bioreactor using intermittent sparging of air and nitrogen. The effect of dissolved oxygen fluctuations on the cells was examined by comparing the performance of the cultures with those operated at constant dissolved oxygen tension. In the hybridoma suspension culture, only slight effects on cell growth were observed at circulation times above 300 s. No effect on the specific glucose uptake rate or antibody production was observed at the circulation times tested. Analysis of gene expression for selected hypoxia-related genes also suggested that the overall effect was limited. In plant cell suspensions, the specific growth rates and biomass yields on total sugar in the cultures under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension were essentially the same as those at constant dissolved oxygen tension for both transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Thalictrum minus. Under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension, no effect on antibody accumulation was observed in transgenic N. tabacum suspensions, but a decrease in berberine accumulation was observed in T. minus. From the results, it can be concluded that only minimal effects due to the development of concentration gradients would be expected in large-scale bioreactors used for the cultivation of the hybridoma and plant cell suspensions tested in this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Plant cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25200</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Novel hydrogels for protein drug delivery</field><field name="creator">Mawad, Damia, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Embolic agents are used to block blood flow of hypervascular tumours, ultimately resulting in target tissue necrosis. However, this therapy is limited by the formation of new blood vessels within the tumour, a process known as angiogenesis. Targeting angiogenesis led to the discovery of anti-angiogenic factors, large molecular weight proteins that can block the angiogenic process. The aim of this research is development of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) aqueous solutions that cross-link in situ to form a hydrogel that functions as an embolic agent for delivery of macromolecular drugs. Methods: PVA (14 kDa, 83% hydrolysed), functionalised by 7 acrylamide groups per chain, was used to prepare 10, 15, and 20wt% non-degradable hydrogels, cured by UV or redox initiation. Structural properties were characterised and the release of FITCDextran (20kDa) was quantified. Degradable networks were then prepared by attaching to PVA (83% and 98 % hydrolysed) ester linkages with an acrylate end group. The effect on degradation profiles was assessed by varying parameters such as macromer concentration, cross-linking density, polymer backbone and curing method. To further enhance the technology, radiopaque degradable PVA was synthesised, and degradation profiles were determined. Cell growth inhibition of modified PVA and degradable products were also investigated. Results: Redox initiation resulted in non-degradable PVA networks of well-controlled structural properties. Increasing the solid content from 10 to 20wt% prolonged the release time from few hours to ~ 2 days but had no effect on the percent release, with only a maximum release of 65% achieved. Ester attachment to the PVA allowed flexibility in designing networks of variable swelling behaviors and degradation times allowing ease of tailoring for specific clinical requirements. Synthesis of radiopaque degradable PVA hydrogels was successful without affecting the polymer solubility in water or its ability to polymerize by redox. This suggested that this novel hydrogel is a potential liquid embolic with enhanced X-ray visibility. Degradable products had negligible cytotoxicity.  Conclusion: Novel non-degradable and radiopaque degradable PVA hydrogels cured by redox initiation were developed in this research. The developed PVA hydrogels showed characteristics in vitro that are desirable for the in vivo application as release systems for anti-angiogenic factors.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug delivery systems</field><field name="subject">Drug targeting</field><field name="subject">Polymers in medicine</field><field name="subject">Drugs - Controlled release</field><field name="subject">Polymeric drug delivery systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25221</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Was the Tooth Fairy breast fed? The politics of infant tooth decay</field><field name="creator">Luxford, Yvonne, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the mid 1970s American paediatric dentists started publishing claims that breast feeding an infant on demand and/or during the night was as dangerous to the infant's dental health, in terms of the production of caries, as the previously established dangers of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay. It was argued by some dentists that this danger increased if the infant was breast fed for an extended period of time. Such claims have gained support from many dentists, and their professional bodies, into the twenty-first century. This thesis examines the historical, social, commercial and cultural influences that supported the development of such assertions. It analyses the ways in which expert reinforcement was gained, and scrutinises the scientific controversy as publicly fought in professional journals and other outlets. The thesis also examines the growing status of the dental profession, especially in connection with its claim to specialised scientific and medical knowledge in the production of dental caries. Further, consideration is given to the medicalisation of breast feeding and the associated commercial infant feeding dispute. The thesis attempts to redress the current lack of theoretical analysis of the construction of dental knowledge. To date there has been minimal academic contribution to the history of dentistry; however, the absence of extensive analysis has been advantageous in enabling an original approach to the material.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breastfeeding.</field><field name="subject">Dental caries in children.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25224</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereotype threat behind the wheel</field><field name="creator">Yeung, Nai Chi, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Stereotype threat refers to the pressure that individuals feel when they are at risk of confirming a demeaning stereotype about themselves. Research has found that stereotype threat impairs performance on cognitive-based tasks by inducing mental interference (e.g., Schmader &amp; Johns, 2003). This thesis hypothesised that this finding would generalise to driving and that drivers who are better able to inhibit cognitive interference (i.e., with better inhibitory ability) would be less susceptible to the disruptive effect of stereotype threat than drivers who are less able (i.e., with poorer inhibitory ability). A series of three experiments conducted in a driving simulator tested the predictions using the gender stereotype of driving skills and investigated the interpretation of the results. The experiments revealed that stereotype threat exerted both a facilitative and debilitative influence on driving performance, as indicated by different performance measures. The facilitative effect diminished when drivers experienced increased mental demands or when they were assessed by an unexpected performance measure, while the debilitative effect was more likely observed among drivers who received negative feedback than drivers who received positive feedback. Moreover, the results supported the prediction that inhibitory ability would moderate the detrimental impact of stereotype threat as the performance of drivers with poorer inhibitory ability was impeded more than that of drivers with better inhibitory ability. Regarding the processes underlying the present findings, the experiments provided suggestive evidence that stereotype threat elicits cognitive interference and simultaneously motivates drivers to concentrate on particular performance areas in an attempt to refute the stereotype. In combination, these processes appear to be at least partly responsible for the performance deficits and boosts observed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stereotype (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Stereotypes (Social psychology)</field><field name="subject">Bahavior modification</field><field name="subject">Automobile driving - Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Performance - Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26242</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a validated falls risk assessment for use in clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Tiedemann, Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Falls risk factor assessment is the first step in the development of appropriate intervention strategies for the prevention of falls. However, few multifactorial, validated falls risk assessments exist which are suitable for use in busy clinical settings. This project aimed to develop a reliable and valid falls risk assessment that was feasible for use in various clinical settings. The QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment was developed and evaluated via four methods; a) the test-retest reliability of the measures was assessed with 30 community-dwelling older people, b) the concurrent validity of the measures was assessed by comparison with performance in the Physiological Profile Assessment, c) the predictive validity of the measures was assessed by comparison of performance with prospective falls in two studies involving large samples of community dwelling older people and d) the feasibility of the assessment was evaluated with 40 clinicians who trialled the assessment with their patients. The QuickScreen clinical falls risk assessment consists of eight measures, including previous falls, total medications, psychoactive medications, visual acuity, touch sensation, the sit to stand test, the near tandem stand test and the alternate step test. The test-retest reliability of the assessment measures was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.89) and the assessment measures discriminated between multiple fallers and non-multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. The clinicians that trialled the assessment reported that it was quick and easy to administer and that it assisted in the management of their elderly patients. These results show that the QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment has proven validity, test-retest reliability and is practical for use in a variety of clinical settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) in old age</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27255</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strength and ductility of high-strength concrete shear walls under reversed cyclic loading</field><field name="creator">Dabbagh, Hooshang, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study concerns the strength and behaviour of low-rise shear walls made from high-strength concrete under reversed cyclic loading. The response of such walls is often strongly governed by the shear effects leading to the shear induced or brittle failure. The brittle nature of high-strength concrete poses further difficulties in obtaining ductile response from shear walls. An experimental program consisting of six high-strength concrete shear walls was carried out. Specimens were tested under inplane axial load and reversed cyclic displacements with the test parameters investigated being longitudinal reinforcement ratio, transverse reinforcement ratio and axial load. Lateral loads, lateral displacements and the strains of reinforcement in edge elements and web wall were measured. The test results showed the presence of axial load has a significant effect on the strength and ductility of the shear walls. The axially loaded wall specimens exhibited a brittle behaviour regardless of reinforcement ratio whereas the specimen with no axial load had a lower strength but higher ductility. It was also found that an increase in the longitudinal reinforcement ratio gave an increase in the failure load while an increase in the transverse reinforcement ratio had no significant effect on the strength but influenced the failure mode. A non-linear finite element program based on the crack membrane model and using smeared-fixed crack approach was developed with a new aggregate interlock model incorporated into the finite element procedure. The finite element model was corroborated by experimental results of shear panels and walls. The finite element analysis of shear wall specimens indicated that while strengths can be predicted reasonably, the stiffness of edge elements has a significant effect on the deformational results for two-dimensional analyses. Therefore, to capture the deformation of walls accurately, three-dimensional finite element analyses are required. The shear wall design provisions given in the current Australian Standard and the Building Code of American Concrete Institute were compared with the experimental results. The comparison showed that the calculated strengths based on the codes are considerably conservative, specially when there exists the axial load.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Concrete walls -- Testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27467</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of surface science to sulfide mineral processing</field><field name="creator">Goh, Siew Wei, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surface spectroscopic techniques have been applied to facets of the flotation beneficiation and hydrometallurgical extraction of sulfide minerals to enhance the fundamental understanding of these industrially important processes. As a precursor to the determination of surface chemical composition, the sub-surface properties of some sulfide minerals that have not previously been fully characterised were also investigated. The electronic properties of ??-NiS and ??-NiS (millerite), Ni3S2 (heazlewoodite), (Ni,Fe)9S8 (pentlandite), CuFe2S3 (cubanite), CuFeS2 (chalcopyrite), Cu5FeS4 (bornite) and CuS (covellite) were investigated by conventional and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy augmented by ab initio density of state calculations and NEXAFS spectral simulations. Particular aspects studied included the relationship between sulfur coordination number and core electron binding energies, the higher than expected core electron binding energies for the sulfur in the metal-excess nickel sulfides, and the formal oxidation states of the Cu and Fe in Cu-Fe sulfides. It was concluded that the binding energy dependence on coordination number was less than previously believed, that Ni-Ni bonding was the most likely explanation for the unusual properties of the Ni sulfides, and that there was no convincing evidence for Cu(II) in sulfides as had been claimed. Most of the NEXAFS spectra simulated by the FEFF8 and WIEN2k ab initio codes agreed well with experimental spectra, and the calculated densities of states were useful in rationalising the observed properties. XPS, static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and NEXAFS spectroscopy were used to investigate thiol flotation collector adsorption on several sulfides in order to determine the way in which the collector chemisorbs to the mineral surface, to differentiate monolayer from multilayer coverage, and to characterise the multilayer species. It was found that static SIMS alone was able to differentiate monolayer from multilayer coverage, and together with angle-resolved NEXAFS spectroscopy, was also able to confirm that 2-mercaptobenzothiazole interacted through both its N and exocyclic S atoms. The altered layers formed on chalcopyrite and heazlewoodite during acid leaching were examined primarily by means of threshold S KLL Auger electron spectroscopy, but no evidence for buried interfacial species was obtained.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface chemistry</field><field name="subject">Sulphide minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32912</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spontaneous recovery in Pavlovian fear extinction and latent inhibition</field><field name="creator">Leung, Hiu Tin, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments reported in the present thesis examined the behavioural processes of Pavlovian fear extinction and latent inhibition. The first series of experiments studied the reacquisition of extinguished fear responses following different amounts of extinction training. Rapid reacquisition occurred when rats were reconditioned after moderate extinction, showing that the original learning remained intact across this extinction. In contrast, when reconditioning was given after massive extinction, reconditioned responding was first depressed but then spontaneously recovered over time. This suggests that massive extinction produces a relatively permanent loss of the originally learned responding, while additionally imposes on the extinguished CS a transient latent inhibitory process that prevented the immediate but not the delayed expression of reconditioning.  The second series of experiments studied the impact of spontaneous recovery of extinguished fear responses on their additional extinction. These experiments demonstrated that a CS that had time to show spontaneous recovery underwent greater response loss across additional extinction than one lacking recovery. They also showed that an excitor extinguished in compound with a CS showing recovery suffered greater response loss than an excitor extinguished in compound with a CS lacking recovery. Further, extinction of a compound composed of two CSs, one showing recovery and a second lacking recovery, produced greater extinction to the CS that showed recovery. These results show that spontaneous recovery of extinguished responses deepens their extinction through an error-correction mechanism regulated by both common and individual error terms.  The third series of experiments studied the spontaneous recovery of latently inhibited and extinguished fear responses in within-subject designs. Using a compound test procedure, a CS that had received extensive preexposure or extensive extinction was found to have undergone greater spontaneous recovery relative to a CS just moderately preexposed or moderately extinguished. A CS given a mixed history of preexposure and extinction also underwent greater recovery relative to a CS just preexposed or just extinguished. These results suggest that both latent inhibition and extinction share a transient depressive process, and that the resulting recovery of responding is proportional to the amount of this depression.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spontaneous recovery</field><field name="subject">extinction</field><field name="subject">latent inhibition</field><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">conditioning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43701</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of iron chelators as anti-proliferative agents against cancer : molecular mechanisms behind the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Le, Nghia Trung Van, School of Women???s &amp; Children???s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">Iron (Fe) is a fundamental requirement for life since it is involved in many cellular processes critical for growth and proliferation. Indeed, studies which deplete Fe from neoplastic cells using specific chelating agents result in G1/S arrest and apoptosis. However, the precise role of Fe in the control of the cell cycle remains unclear. Chapter one of this thesis, discusses the potential mechanism(s) by which Fe chelators cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that this process involves multiple molecules and is highly complex. Thus, the studies presented in this thesis assess the effects of specific high affinity Fe chelators on the expression of molecules that may play important roles in cellular arrest and apoptosis. The general methodology used in these studies is summarized in chapter 2. In previous investigations Fe chelators such as 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311) were shown to be far more potent anti-tumor agents than the clinically used ligand, desferrioxamine (DFO). Studies detailed in chapter 3, examined the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the universal cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 following Fe-deprivation. To further characterize the effects of chelators on cell cycle arrest, experiments compared their activity to the DNA-damaging agents, actinomycin D (Act D) and cisplatin (CP). The latter two compounds increase the expression of p53 and its target gene p21CIP1/WAF1. Incubation of normal and neoplastic cells with all agents resulted in increased accumulation of nuclear p53, with the effect being more pronounced for Act D and CP. As expected, both Act D and CP markedly increased nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels, while DFO and 311 caused a significant (p &amp;lt 0.0004) decrease. This result was surprising, since the WAF1 gene which encodes the universal cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 was markedly up-regulated at the mRNA level following Fe chelation. Proteasomal inhibition studies demonstrated the partial involvement of proteasomes in decreasing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 levels following DFO treatment. In contrast, the incubation of 311-treated cells with proteasomal inhibitors did not reverse the down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 when compared to the control. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that only DNA-damaging agents and not Fe chelators increased the nuclear translocation of p21CIP1/WAF1. Collectively, this suggests that the chelators prevented translation of WAF1. Moreover, this decrease in nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein expression did not appear to be due to a general effect in which Fe chelators inhibited mRNA translation since the transferrin receptor 1 was markedly up-regulated (15-21- fold) by DFO or 311. The combination of 311 with Act D or CP prevented the marked p21CIP1/WAF1 nuclear accumulation normally observed in response to these DNAdamaging agents. Significantly, the effect of chelation on reducing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 expression was reversed by the Fe-donor, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), indicating that WAF1 translation was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. This study is the first to demonstrate that Fe chelators markedly up-regulate the mRNA expression of WAF1 but paradoxically inhibit its translation. The down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 protein by chelators may be a novel mechanism by which these ligands cause G1/S arrest through cell cycle dysregulation. In chapter 4, gene arrays were used to assess the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle control and the p53 pathway following the incubation of cells with DFO, 311 or Act D. The N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) was the only molecule identified that was specifically up-regulated by Fe chelation and not DNA-damage. Although the exact function of the Ndrg1 protein is unclear, previous studies have shown that this molecule markedly slows down tumor growth (Kurdistani et al. Cancer Res. 1998:58;4439-44) and acts as a potent metastasis suppressor protein (Bandyopadhyay et al. Cancer Res. 2003:63;1731-6). Subsequent experiments examined the mRNA and protein expression of Ndrg1 using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. Incubation of cells with DFO or 311 resulted in a marked increase in the expression of Ndrg1 mRNA and protein within 3 h and 6 h, respectively. This increase in Ndrg1 after incubation with chelators was not found with their Fe complexes nor when the Fe-binding site had been synthetically inactivated. In addition, the induction of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was correlated with the ligands??? permeability and anti-proliferative activity. Indeed, the up-regulation of Ndrg1 by Fe chelators can be readily reversed by Fe-repletion. Collectively, this indicates that the induction of Ndrg1 was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. Previous studies demonstrated for the first time that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was dependent on HIF-1?? and p53 stabilization. In contrast, investigations using fibroblasts derived from a HIF-1?? knockout (HIF-1??-KO) mouse demonstrated that the transcriptional upregulation of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was mediated by a HIF-1??-dependent and - independent mechanism. In addition, subsequent experiments using the p53-deficient H1299 lung carcinoma cell line revealed that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was not dependent on p53 status after Fe-depletion. Collectively, the presented studies suggest that Ndrg1 may be a novel link between Fe metabolism and the control of proliferation. The up-regulation of Ndrg1 by potent Fe chelators is significant and may be beneficial in the prevention of tumor metastasis. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that the molecular mechanisms behind the G1/S arrest and apoptosis involved multiple molecules following Fe chelation. Indeed, this study shows a potential mechanism by which Fe chelators may cause cell cycle dysregulation through the down-regulation of nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels. In addition, the work presented identifies the up-regulation of the metastasis suppressor protein, Ndrg1, following Fe-deprivation. Collectively, the results indicate that potent Fe chelators can not only be used as anti-proliferative agents, but may also be beneficial at inhibiting tumor cell metastasis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Iron chelates</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20524</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Racism, pluralism and democracy in Australia : re-conceptualising racial vilification legislation</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Tamsin, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australian debates about racial vilification legislation have been dominated by mainstream American First Amendment jurisprudence and popular American notions of 'free speech' to the exclusion of alternative Europeans models. This can be seen from notions of Australian racial vilification legislation as inconsistent with 'free speech' rights as well as the influence of some of the basic assumptions of First Amendment jurisprudence on political speech cases in the Australian High Court. Despite the widespread existence of legislation that penalises racial vilification at State and Federal levels, there has been a rise in Australia over the past 10 years of divisive 'race' politics. Against that background, this thesis considers the scope and limits of racial vilification legislation in Australia. It is argued that First Amendment jurisprudence is inadequate in the Australian context, because it is heavily dependent upon economic metaphors, individualistic notions of identity and outdated theories of communication. It assumes that 'free speech' in terms of lack of government intervention is essential to 'democracy'. It ignores the content, context and effect of harmful speech, except in extreme cases, with the result that socially harmful speech is protected in the name of 'free speech'. This has narrowed the parameters within which racial vilification is understood and hindered the development of a broader discourse on the realities of racist harms, and the mechanisms necessary for their redress. The author calls for the development of an Australian jurisprudence of harmful speech. Failing an Australian Bill of Rights, that jurisprudence would be grounded upon the implied constitutional right of free political speech, informed by an awareness that modern structures of public speech favour a very limited range of speech and speakers. The jurisprudence would take advantage of the insights of Critical Race Theory into the connections between racial vilification and racist behaviour, as well as the personal and social harms of racial vilification. Finally, it is argued that the concepts of human dignity and equality, which underpin European discrimination legislation and notions of justice, provide a way forward for Australian jurisprudence in this area.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Race discrimination</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Freedom of speech</field><field name="subject">Racism in language</field><field name="subject">Racism</field><field name="subject">Civil rights</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20530</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composing women and feminism at the turn of the twentieth century in England, France and Germany</field><field name="creator">Harris, Amanda Jane, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The turn from the nineteenth century into the twentieth saw an increase in the number of composing European women attaining prominence in the music world. This period of history is also now recognised as one of the key phases of the first wave of feminism. Feminists and musical women moved in a similar stratum of society. Although women of this era have increasingly been the subject of scholarly research, music historians have rarely investigated the links between the turn of the century??s wave of composing women and feminists.  This dissertation uses the feminist and musical press as a means to investigate composing women??s engagement with feminism. I examine feminists?? regard for women musicians and conversely composing women??s views on feminism. The thesis also reframes the privatelives of composing women through an analysis of primary sources. The composers who form the focus of this biographical investigation include Lili Boulanger (1893-1918), Ethel Smyth (1858-1944), Luise Adolpha Le Beau (1850-1927), Louise H??ritte-Viardot (1841-1918) and Armande de Polignac (1876-1962). Using a large body of newly analysed, unpublished correspondence and private papers, this research offers fresh insights into the biographies of composing women as well as their own self-portrayal, revealing the complex nature of Ethel Smyth??s sexuality and reassessing the fatalistic portrait of Lili Boulanger which has been drawn in some previous studies. These biographical insights background the contentions of the thesis that composing women and feminists shared common ground.  Through investigating the presence of musicians in the feminist press and of feminism in the musical press, the thesis reveals an ambivalent relationship between feminists and musicians. The disappointed expectations of feminists are contrasted with the reasons composing women had for retaining a distance from feminism. The exploration of composing women??s political and personal context enables an understanding not only of their contribution to music history, but also of their place within the greater history of women??s development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nineteenth century</field><field name="subject">Wwomen</field><field name="subject">Feminism</field><field name="subject">Twentieth century</field><field name="subject">Composers</field><field name="subject">England</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">Smyth</field><field name="subject">Boulanger</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43745</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformations of the oriental in the architectural work of Juraj Neidhardt and Dusan Grabrijan</field><field name="creator">Alic, Dijana, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the correlation between architectural expression and political ideology in the work of two prominent post-World War Two Yugoslav architects, Dusan Grabrijan and Juraj Neidhardt. It focuses on their collaborative architectural writings, namely 'Sarajevo and Its Satellites' (1942), published during the pro-Nazi government of the Independent State of Croatia, and Architecture of Bosnia and the Way Towards Modernity (1957), produced at the peak of Yugoslav socialism. Both publications explored the relevance of the Ottoman/Islamic built heritage to the creation of a modern city but only in the latter did the authors identify this legacy as a suitable catalyst for the creation of a Bosnian modern architectural expression. This change in position, the thesis argues, developed in relation to the 1950s nationalist discourse in Yugoslavia and, more specifically, the socialist led validation of the Bosnian Muslim community through the latter's official re-presentation from a religious to a national group. Grabrijan and Neidhardt's conception of the Bosnian Oriental expression as a 'synthesis of old experiences and new ways', similarly offered to resolve the long-standing problematic relationship between the architecture of Ottoman origin and an architecture deemed appropriate for a socialist society. Architectural historians of Yugoslav modernism have recognised Grabrijan and Neidhardt's contribution to modernity and praised their capacity to connect Yugoslav modernism with the international agenda. However, the specifics of Grabrijan and Neidhardt's vision and the ideological connotations embedded in it have not been acknowledged. This thesis addresses that omission and shows that while there had been earlier attempts to integrate the Bosnian Islamic past into architectural debates, Grabrijan and Neidhardt's model of Bosnian Oriental offered a place for the Ottoman fabric within the new socialist architectural aspirations. The thesis foregrounds the important role that architecture plays in the process of construction, as well as destruction, of national identities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Socialism</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Ideology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proposing a cultural landscape paradigm: a case study: Prospect reservoir at Western Sydney</field><field name="creator">Zambre, Pallavi, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study sets out to investigate and question the Burra Charter, its Interpretations and approaches for protection of cultural landscape in Australia. While achieving the preservation of state and national icons, the Charter has overlooked the meanings and values of heritage landscape. Drawing on the field of landscape theory, my research seeks to extend the theoretical approach to study of the cultural landscape. Thus, this thesis proposes the cultural landscape paradigm (CLP) which provides a framework to interpret the inherent values of cultural landscape based on ecological, experiential and narrative approaches.  Towards this goal, the research attempts to demonstrate and apply the CLP by conducting a case study of the culturally significant landscape of Prospect Reservoir in western Sydney. The study is undertaken with the help of a detailed analysis of landscape elements, historic documents, narrative references, personal observations and photographs. I found that although the site has been conserved on the principles of the Burra Charter, the regional identity and sense of place has not been taken into account. Over time, degradation of the ecosystem has changed the ecological, narrative and experiential quality of the place. Thus the landscape reflects the Burra Charter's values of national, state significance, and dominance in portraying a story of European past, with limited concern for aboriginal cultural landscape.  A current issue at the site is the increasing urban pressure of western Sydney. How can we interpret, protect the regional identity and cope with the ecological changes so as to maintain the continuity with the past landscape? Similarly to what extent does the Burra Charter address these issues? I respond to these questions by developing and applying the CLP. This results in expanding the values and meaning of the cultural landscape of Prospect Reservoir, and provides guidance for cultural landscape planning in general. Hence, the thesis also demonstrates the need for the Burra Charter practitioners to rethink their actions for the future of cultural landscapes, where the landscape is a continuously changing, naturally and socially driven phenomenon.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44903</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation and 21st century projections of global climate models at a regional scale over Australia</field><field name="creator">Perkins, Sarah Elizabeth, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the ability of global climate models (GCMs) to simulate observed conditions at regional scales by examining probability density functions (PDFs) of daily minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax) and precipitation (P). Two new measures of model skill are proposed using PDFs of observed and modelled data. The first metric (Sscore) compares the amount of overlap between the two PDFs. The second metric (Tailskill) is the weighted difference between the PDF tails, where extreme events are represented. The resulting measures of skill are used to differentiate, at a regional scale, between weaker and stronger models. It is investigated whether the weaker models bias future projections given by multi-model ensembles, increasing the uncertainty in the range of projected values and the change from the 20th Century.  The Sscore is demonstrated to be robust against inhomogenities found in highdensity Australian datasets, and is a simple and quantitative measure of how well each GCM can simulate all observed events. This methodology is executed for twelve Australian regions of varying climates for all Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment Report models for which daily data was available for 1961-2000. Across Tmin, Tmax and P some GCMs perform well, demonstrating that some GCMs provide credible simulations of climate at sub-continental scales.  Projections of the annual and seasonal mean and yearly return values over the A2 and B1 emission scenarios are investigated. Models are omitted from an ensemble based on their ability to simulate the observed PDF at regional scales. The stronger models are generally in agreement with the change in mean values, particularly for Tmin and Tmax, though it is shown that they vary in their projections of the yearly return value at least twice as much as projections in the mean values.  Lastly, a means-based evaluation method, the Sscore and the Tailskill are employed to differentiate between weaker and stronger models for projections in the 20-year return value of Tmin and Tmax. Weaker-skilled ensembles project larger increases in 20-year return values than stronger-skilled ensembles, such that in some regions for maximum temperature the ensembles are statistically significantly different. Demonstrably weaker models bias projections given by an all-model ensemble and should be excluded so the most reliable estimates of future climate can be obtained.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Projection</field><field name="subject">Climate</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44906</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Existence and uniqueness of solutions to non-linear first order dynamic equations on time scales</field><field name="creator">Zaidi, Atiya-tul-Hussain, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The theory of dynamic equations on time scales provides an important bridge between the fields of differential and difference equations. It is particularly useful in describing phenomena that possess a hybrid continuous-discrete behaviour in their growth, like many temperate--2one insect populations and crops. A dynamic equation on a time scale is a generalised. 'two-in-one' model, it serves as a differential equation for purely continuous domains and as a difference equation for purely discrete ones.  The field of "dynamic equations on time scales" is about 20 years old. As such, much of the basic (yet very important) linear theory has been established, however the non-linear extensions are yet to be fully developed. This thesis aims to fill this gap by providing the foundational framework of non-linear results from which further lines of inquiry can be launched.  This thesis answers several important questions regarding the qualitative and quantitative properties of solutions to non-linear dynamic equations on time scales.  Namely, (i) When do solutions exist? (ii) If solutions exist, then are they unique? (iii) How can such solutions be closely approximated? (iv) How can we explicitly solve certain problems to extract their solutions?  The methods employed to address the above questions include: dynamic inequalities; iterative techniques and the method of successive approximations; and the fixed point approaches of Banach and Schauder.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44908</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A competency based theory of business partnering : an empirical study of Australian business-to-business partnerships</field><field name="creator">Gray, David Michael, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research, conceptualizes, operationalises and empirically tests a competency-based theory of business-partnering performance within an Australian business-partnering context. Drawing on theory from social psychology and marketing, the research integrates a number of theoretical approaches including resource-based theory, competency based theory, relational factors view, relational interaction theory, and competitive advantage theory to explain why some business partnerships are more successful than others are. The results use a ???process model of business-partnering??? performance to explain the interaction process through which business partners exploit the available partnering related ???operant resources??? and how these resources influence the performance of business partnerships and their ability to achieve a competitive advantage. Specifically, this research investigates a number of important internal resources, which facilitate the building, and maintaining of external businesspartner relations including ???joint alliance competence???, ???joint alliance structure???, ???interpersonal relational competence??? and ???market orientation???. This research shows that an adequate understanding of how these ???operant resources??? are deployed/accessed and co-created by the business partners to achieve a competitive advantage requires integration of ???relational interaction theory??? into ???resource-based theory??? and ???competency-based theory???. The results of this research show that those firms that pursue business partnerships as a competitive strategy can improve performance by engaging in a range of activities, which facilitate the building of ???relational capital??? of the partnership. The results provide support for conclusion that ???communication behaviour??? is a central and important mediating variable in the performance of business partnerships. Overall, the findings are consistent with the literature in finding support for the notion that ???joint alliance competence??? is a direct antecedent of businesspartnering performance. There is support for the notion that the partnership???s ability to govern and manage itself is an important determinant of ???communication behaviour??? and ???co-ordination behaviour???. The results identified ???market orientation???, ???co-ordination behaviour??? and ???relational capital??? as all having a direct influence on business-partnership profitability. Finally, given the relatively high failure rates of business partnerships this research provides greater opportunity for a discussion of the kinds of intervention strategies that could be used to minimise the risk of failure and/or to improve partnership performance.

These networks have broad applications spanning wide ar- eas, such as environmental monitoring, infrastructure maintenance, traffic manage- ment, energy management, disaster mitigation, personal medical monitoring, smart building, as well as military and defence. While these applications require high per- formance from the network, they suffer from resource constraints (such as limited battery power, processing capability, buffer space, etc.) that do not appear in tra- ditional wired networks. The inherent infrastructure-less characteristic of the sensor and ad hoc networks creates significant challenges. This dissertation addresses these challenges with two protocol designs. The main contributions of this dissertation are the design and evaluation of CS- MAC (stands for CDMA Sensor MAC), a novel multi-channel media access control (MAC) protocol for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) wire- less sensor networks. Our protocol design uses combination of DS-CDMA and fre- quency division to reduce the channel interference and consequently improves system capacity and network throughput. We provide theoretical characterisation of the mean multiple access interference (MAI) at a given node in relation to the number of frequency channels. We show that by using only a small number of frequency chan- nels, the mean MAI can be reduced significantly. Through discrete event simulation (using UC Berkerly NS-2 simulator), we provide comparison of our proposed system to a pure DS-CDMA system as well as a contention based system. Simulation results reveal that our proposed system can achieve significant improvement in system efi ciency (measured in packet/second/channel) of a contention based system. When the same number of packets are transmitted in the network, our system consumes much less communication energy compared to the contention based system. A distributed channel allocation protocol is also proposed for the network forma- tion phase. We prove that our algorithm converges with correct channel assignments. Simulation results reveal that a much smaller number of channels is required than theoretical value when nodes are uniformly randomly deployed. The second contribution of this dissertation involves the design and evaluation of two location-aware select optimal neighbour (SON) algorithms for CSMA/CA based MAC protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. Both algorithms concentrate on the improvement of energy eficiency of the whole network through the optimisation of the number of neighbours of each node. Our algorithms not only consider radio electronic energy consumption (e.g., coding, decoding) and radio transmission energy consumption (e.g., power amplifier), but also the electronic energy consumption at those irrelevant receivers (those who are not addressed by the transmission) that are located within the transmission range. Through simulations, we show that our algorithms can achieve signi??cant energy savings compared to the standard IEEE 802.11.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">sensor networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23387</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic ocular surface medium: clinical and in vitro studies</field><field name="creator">Watson, Stephanie Louise, Prince of Wale Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Therapeutic Ocular Surface Medium (TOSM) is a potential new treatment for patients with ocular surface disorders such as dry eye and persistent epithelial defect (PED). New therapies are needed as many patients with dry eye and PED continue to suffer despite maximal standard therapy, and while efficacious autologous serum therapy is not routinely available. Like serum, TOSM contains tear components and was expected to have some of the physiological effects of tears. Clinical and in vitro studies were used to evaluate two similar formulations of TOSM. To comply with local pharmacy manufacturing policies, components were omitted from TOSM v1 to produce TOSM v2. In pilot studies, conducted over 1 month, TOSM v1 improved dry eye signs and symptoms and healed over a quarter of PED. In a 2 month randomised double-masked trial, TOSM v2 improved the signs and symptoms of dry eye but was not superior to saline (placebo). No serious or irreversible side-effects occurred. The altered composition of TOSM v2 may have reduced its efficacy. However, a significant improvement in blepharitis (eyelid margin disease) and conjunctival impression cytology (an objective measure of ocular surface health) was found with TOSM v2. Improvement in blepharitis is an encouraging finding as it has not been reported in other dry eye trials. It was hypothesised that TOSM would benefit ocular surface disorders by improving ocular surface health. In vitro, primary and cell line human corneal epithelial cells were supported by TOSM v1 and TOSM v2. Outgrowth from limbal explants and corneal reepithelialisation following wounding occurred with TOSM v2. This and the impression cytology findings support our hypothesis. Further, ocular surface damage with dry eye and PED may activate the corneal wound healing response. For wound healing, compared to human serum, TOSM v1 and TOSM v2 had beneficial effects in vitro on epithelial cells and human corneal fibroblasts. This may translate into a reduction in potentially vision-threatening corneal scarring in vivo with TOSM. However, ocular surface disorders are a heterogenous group and wound healing is a complex process such that different preparations of TOSM may be needed for use in different disorders and at different stages of the disease process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Therapeutics, Ophthalmological</field><field name="subject">Eye - Diseases</field><field name="subject">Ocular Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24283</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards prevention - a population health approach to child abuse and neglect : health indicators and the identification of antecedent causal pathways</field><field name="creator">O'Donnell, Melissa</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The primary aims of this thesis were to investigate health indicators of child maltreatment, as well as pathways into the child protection system using routinely collected government databases, enabling a preventative health approach to child abuse and neglect. This thesis aims to improve understanding of the trends in child maltreatment and the factors, at the child and family level, which increase or reduce vulnerability to child maltreatment so more effective prevention policies and practices can be developed. This project uses longitudinal de-identified population data from the Western Australian Government Departments of Child Protection, Health and Disability Services. These data contained information on demographic, clinical, social and child protection outcomes of children and their families. Record linkage of administrative data was undertaken to: investigate health indicators of abuse and neglect using Hospital Morbidity data to enable the monitoring of population trends in abuse and neglect; compare proportion of cases obtained using health indicators with the Department of Child Protection data, and describe the physical, psychological and social characteristics of abused and/or neglected children and families. Statistical techniques utilised include logistic and Cox regression to investigate risk of adverse child outcomes, taking into account potential confounding and time to event. The main findings include:  There has been an increase in assault and maltreatment related hospital admissions over the last 25 years.  ...  There has been a marked increase in the birth prevalence of Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome (NWS) in Western Australia over the last 25 years, from 1 per 10,000 live births in 1980, to 31 per 10,000 live births in 2005. Specific maternal characteristics associated with having a child with NWS are identified and these children have an increased risk of child protection involvement.  A population level analysis of child and parental factors determined the estimated increase in risk of substantiated child maltreatment for child intellectual disability, parental admissions for mental health, substance use, and assault, as well as greater socio-economic disadvantage. Conclusions This is the first body of research which has extensively used longitudinal, population level linked health and child protection data to investigate health indicators of child abuse and neglect and antecedent causal pathways. Monitoring injuries and conditions associated with child abuse and neglect in routinely collected data and using multiple sources of ascertainment are important initiatives in child maltreatment surveillance. Health indicators of child abuse and neglect are not subject to the same definitional and policy issues as child protection data and therefore provide a more valid comparison over time and between jurisdictions. The identification of factors which increase vulnerability for children and families to child maltreatment is essential in the implementation of prevention strategies including universal public health approaches as well as the identification of at-risk families for targeted intervention.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child abuse -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Child abuse -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Child welfare -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Health status indicators</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Child abuse and neglect</field><field name="subject">Data linkage</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0029</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pixel and patch based texture synthesis using image segmentation</field><field name="creator">Tran, Minh Tue</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Texture exists all around us and serves as an important visual cue for the human visual system. Captured within an image, we identify texture by its recognisable visual pattern. It carries extensive information and plays an important role in our interpretation of a visual scene. The subject of this thesis is texture synthesis, which is de ned as the creation of a new texture that shares the fundamental visual characteristics of an existing texture such that the new image and the original are perceptually similar. Textures are used in computer graphics, computer-aided design, image processing and visualisation to produce realistic recreations of what we see in the world. For example, the texture on an object communicates its shape and surface properties in a 3D scene. Humans can discriminate between two textures and decide on their similarity in an instant, yet, achieving this algorithmically is not a simple process. Textures range in complexity and developing an approach that consistently synthe- sises this immense range is a dfficult problem to solve and motivates this research. Typically, texture synthesis methods aim to replicate texture by transferring the recognisable repeated patterns from the sample texture to synthesised output. Feature transferal can be achieved by matching pixels or patches from the sample to the output. As a result, two main approaches, pixel-based and patch-based, have es- tablished themselves in the active  eld of texture synthesis. This thesis contributes to the present knowledge by introducing two novel texture synthesis methods. Both methods use image segmentation to improve synthesis results.  ... The sample is segmented and the boundaries of the middle patch are confined to follow segment boundaries. This prevents texture features from being cut o  prematurely, a common artifact of patch-based results, and eliminates the need for patch boundary comparisons that most other patch- based synthesis methods employ. Since no user input is required, this method is simple and straight-forward to run. The tiling of pre-computed tile pairs allows outputs that are relatively large to the sample size to be generated quickly. Output results show great success for textures with stochastic and semi-stochastic clustered features but future work is needed to suit more highly structured textures. Lastly these two texture synthesis methods are applied to the areas of image restoration and image replacement. These two areas of image processing involve replacing parts of an image with synthesised texture and are often referred to as constrained texture synthesis. Images can contain a large amount of complex information, therefore replacing parts of an image while maintaining image fidelity is a difficult problem to solve. The texture synthesis approaches and constrained synthesis implementations proposed in this thesis achieve successful results comparable with present methods.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer vision</field><field name="subject">Computer-aided design</field><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Optical pattern recognition</field><field name="subject">Visual perception</field><field name="subject">Texture synthesis</field><field name="subject">Image segmentation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0030</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The incidence of venous thromboembolism : a prospective, community-based study</field><field name="creator">Ho, Wai Khoon</field><field name="description">Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common and preventable cause of morbidity among individuals and hospital in-patient mortality. Further, it imposes a substantial burden upon the community and its health care system and economy. Studies performed in Western societies suggest that the annual incidence of DVT is about 0.8 to 1.2 per 1,000, PE about 0.3 to 0.6 per 1,000, and VTE about 1.0 to 1.8 per 1,000. However, it is not known if these estimates can be generalised to the Australian population because of differences in ethnic composition and other risk factors for VTE among the different populations. In this thesis, I undertook a prospective, community-based cohort study over a 13-month period in 2003 &#150; 2004 to determine the incidence and crude event rate of symptomatic, objectively verified VTE in north-east metropolitan Perth. The study population was broadly representative of the national Australian population in terms of age, sex and ethnic distribution. Cases were identified through multiple overlapping sources. The incidence of DVT, PE and VTE in the community were 0.52 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.41 &#150; 0.63), 0.31 (95% CI: 0.22 &#150; 0.40) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.69 &#150; 0.97) per 1000 per year, respectively. The annual incidence of DVT, adjusted to the World Standard population, was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.26 &#150; 0.44) per 1000, PE 0.21 (95% CI: 0.14 &#150; 0.28) per 1000 and VTE 0.57 (95% CI: 0.47 &#150; 0.67) per 1000. The crude event rate for VTE was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.71 &#150; 0.99) per 1000 per year. These findings suggest that the incidence of DVT, PE and VTE are lower than in other Western societies studied. Possible reasons include a lower prevalence of exposure to causal risk factors (genetic and environmental) and incomplete case ascertainment. Knowledge of the local incidence and event rate allows health planners to allocate appropriate resources and evaluate cost-effective preventive measures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pulmonary embolism</field><field name="subject">Thromboembolism</field><field name="subject">Thrombophlebitis</field><field name="subject">Perth (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Community incidence</field><field name="subject">North-east metropolitan Perth</field><field name="subject">Venous thromboembolism</field><field name="subject">Prospective study</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0031</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathology of rotator cuff tendonopathy</field><field name="creator">Wu, Bing</field><field name="description">Tendonopathy, resulting in the loss of mechanical strength of a tendon, is a serious health problem affecting many people. The common symptom of tendonopathy is pain &#150; patients' daily activities, their participation in sport and exercise, and their ability to work are greatly compromised. Tendonopathy is considered to be a degenerative disorder caused by repetitive injury of the tendon. The most common tendon lesions are Achilles tendon rupture, lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) and rotator cuff tear. However, in spite of its clinical significance, our knowledge about tendonopathy is still very poor. This research was undertaken to investigate the pathology of tendonopathy. It is proposed that apoptosis, autophagic cell death and myofibroblasts play a role in the progression of tendonopathy in the rotator cuff; the aim of this study was therefore to determine if this was indeed the case. Tendon tissues were collected from 30 patients suffering from rotator cuff tears. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL assay) was performed to detect apoptosis. Autophagic cell death of the tenocytes in the ruptured rotator cuff tendon was detected by immunohistochemical staining for ubiquitin. Myofibroblasts were identified immunohistochemically with anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin (anti--SMA) antibody. The distribution of apoptosis, autophagic cell death and myofibroblasts, as well as the total cell density, were assessed respectively and were correlated using a four-category (i.e. graded from 0-3) degeneration of collagen matrix. &#150; 6 &#150; The results showed that apoptosis, autophagic cell death and myofibroblasts were observed in all of the samples. The highest percentage of autophagic cell death was evidenced in the Grade 2 matrix, while the percentage of apoptosis increased significantly with the increase of matrix degeneration from Grade 0-3; a similar pattern was found for myofibroblasts. The total cell numbers varied among the matrix grades, with the maximum and minimum percentages occurring in Grades 1 and 3, respectively. It can be concluded that apoptosis, autophagic cell death and myofibroblasts might be closely related to the damage of the extracellular matrix (ECM) structure.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Cell death</field><field name="subject">Extracellular matrix</field><field name="subject">Myofibroblasts</field><field name="subject">Shoulder joint -- Rotator cuff -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Tendons -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Autophagy</field><field name="subject">Myofibroblast</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Tendonopathy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0032</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fetal programming of sheep for production on saltbush</field><field name="creator">Chadwick, Megan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Saltbush is one of the few types of forage that will grow on salt affected land but, sheep struggle to maintain weight when grazing saltbush mainly because of its high salt content. Therefore, a strategy to improve salt tolerance of sheep would be beneficial to the profitable use of revegetated saline land. This could be done by manipulating the dietary salt load of pregnant or lactating ewes which could 'program', or permanently alter the physiology of their offspring to allow them to cope better with a high-salt diet as adults. When rat dams consume a high amount of salt during pregnancy, the salt balance mechanisms of their offspring are 'programmed' due to suppression of the offspring's renin-angiotensin system in early development. If this occurs in offspring from ewes grazing saltbush, beneficial adaptations may be programmed in these offspring which could allow them to better cope with the high-salt content of saltbush. I tested the general hypothesis that offspring born to ewes that consumed a high-salt or saltbush diet from mid-pregnancy to early lactation would have an increased capacity to cope with salt that would allow them gain weight when grazing saltbush in later life. To test this hypothesis, I pair-fed ewes either a high-salt diet (14% NaCl) or control diet (2% NaCl) in an animal house from day 60 of gestation until day 21 of lactation. During the same period, I also conducted a field experiment where ewes grazed on saltbush (supplemented with barley) or on pasture (supplemented with lupins).  ...  This led to the high-salt offspring retaining more salt than control animals. In contrast, the renin activity of saltbush was consistently lower than pasture offspring which allowed them to excrete salt more rapidly. In experiment three, the saltbush offspring gained tissue weight after grazing saltbush for 8 weeks, whereas the offspring in the other three treatments lost weight. High-salt and saltbush offspring also had higher greasy fleece weights at 22 months of age than their respective control groups. Feeding saltbush to ewes from mid-pregnancy to early lactation induces physiological adaptations in their offspring that allow them to cope better with salt and gain weight when grazing saltbush as adults, supporting my hypothesis. However, contrary to expectations, the high-salt offspring did not gain weight when grazing saltbush because their physiological adaptations, such as salt retention, did not allow them to cope better with a salt load. The reason that saltbush offspring showed different adaptations to highsalt offspring is likely to be because saltbush contains not only NaCl but also high amounts of other minerals such as potassium, and other plant compounds, which may influence the adaptive responses of the offspring. This research has direct implications for farmers because it shows they could utilize otherwise unproductive saltland by grazing pregnant ewes on saltbush to 'program' their offspring to gain weight when they graze saltbush later in life.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Halophytes as feed</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Feed utilization efficiency</field><field name="subject">Fetal programming</field><field name="subject">Saltbush</field><field name="subject">High-salt diet</field><field name="subject">Renin angiotensin system</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0033</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From conduits to communities : plant water use strategies and evapotranspiration in a semi-arid ecosystem in south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Patrick John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Understanding the ecohydrological dynamics of native vegetation can provide a benchmark for future efforts to restore landscape hydrology and allow predictions of potential landscape responses to climate uncertainty and associated changes in vegetation cover. The key drivers of evapotranspiration (Et) involved in maintaining a hydrological balance that minimises deep drainage in semi-arid ecosystems operate at a range of scales, and in this thesis I assessed the water relations of functionally and taxonomically diverse plant communities in south-western Australia from the leaf-level to ecosystem scale. For three key communities; heath shrubland, mallee (small multistemmed eucalypt) -heath, and open eucalypt woodland, populating a typical catenary sequence of soil types along a slope, I addressed the following questions: 1) What are the predominant water use strategies of wheatbelt native plant communities and what underlying trade-offs determine the distribution of plant water use strategies along the topographical gradient? 2) What are the roles of soil water and hydraulic limitation in controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of transpiration in different functional types? 3) What is the magnitude and partitioning of total Et in the woodland community and what processes determine Et fluxes on a seasonal and annual basis? 4) What are the seasonal differences in Et among contrasting community-types and how do these patterns relate to canopy attributes and transpiration capacity along the topographical gradient? A key philosophical step in working with species-rich communities was to develop the concept of 'hydraulic functional types' (HFTs) to identify groupings of species using associations of physiological and morphological traits that define their hydrological functioning.  .... However, as shallow soils dried during spring and summer, Et fluxes were significantly lower at the heath site (0.35 versus 0.66 mm day-1 for the woodland in February), demonstrating that the seasonality of Et fluxes differentiates communityscale contributions to regional water balance. Land-surface exchange of water over native vegetation is by no means uniform, but varies according to the spatial and temporal availability of water along topographical gradients. In general, shallow soils present fewer opportunities for water use partitioning and favour drought hardiness and a transpiration response that tracks recent rainfall patterns, whereas deeper soils promote greater differentiation in water use strategy and support canopies responsive to atmospheric demand. This thesis provides a unique description of ecosystem water balance in a global biodiversity hotspot by viewing complex vegetation mosaics in terms of their relevant hydrological units. This information is fundamental to sustainable agroforestry and revegetation efforts and our ability to gauge possible changes in vegetation structure and function under a changing climate.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arid regions -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Ecohydrology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Evapotranspiration -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Transpiration</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Water requirements</field><field name="subject">Plant water use</field><field name="subject">Semi-arid ecosystems</field><field name="subject">Ecohydrology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0034</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fictional Savonarola and the creation of modern Italy</field><field name="creator">Hogan, Marina</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with Girolamo Savonarola and with his place in the imagination and collective memory of Italians from the early nineteenth century to the present. It examines the works of a variety of Italian fictional authors who turned to Savonarola in the belief that he could help them pursue objectives which, in their opinion, Italy and Italians should strive to achieve. At first, he was called upon by nationalist writers of the Risorgimento to inspire a people and convince it of the need for a free, united Italy. Later, as the new nation began to consolidate and Italians came to realize that unification had not delivered all that it had promised, Savonarola was employed in a negative way to show that military action and force were necessary to ensure Italy's progress to the status of great power. As Italians became more aware of the grave social issues facing their nation, he was called upon, once again, to help change social policy and to remind the people of its civic responsibility to the less fortunate members of society. The extent of Savonarola's adaptability is also explored through the analysis of his manipulation by the writers of Fascist Italy. Remarkably, he was used to highlight to Italians their duty to stand by Mussolini and the Fascist Regime during their struggle with the Catholic Church and the Pope. At the same time, however, one writer daringly used Savonarola's apostolate to condemn the Regime and the people's blind adherence to its philosophies. As Fascism fell and Italy began to rebuild after the Second World War, there was no longer a need for Savonarola to be used for political or militaristic ends. In recent times, emphasis has been placed on the human side of the Friar and he has been employed solely to guide Italians in a civic, moral and spiritual sense. From the Risorgimento to the present, the various changes in Italian history have been foreshadowed in the treatment of Savonarola by Italian fictional authors who turned to him in difficult times to help define what it is to be Italian.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fictional Savonarola</field><field name="subject">Creation modern Italy</field><field name="subject">Savonarola, Girolamo, -- 1452-1498</field><field name="subject">Savonarola, Girolamo, -- 1452-1498 -- Fiction</field><field name="subject">Savonarola, Girolamo, -- 1452-1498 -- Influence</field><field name="subject">Italy -- Politics and government -- 1870-1914</field><field name="subject">Italy -- Politics and government -- 1914-1945</field><field name="subject">Fascism -- Italy -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Risorgimento</field><field name="subject">Religion in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0035</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing systems to identify and deploy saline and waterlogging tolerant lines of Eucalyptus occidentalis Endl</field><field name="creator">Hendrati, Rina Laksmi</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Eucalyptus occidentalis, a timber species from south Western Australia, is highly salt and waterlogging tolerant. Screening identified genotypes tolerant of high salt concentrations and waterlogging. Tolerance at provenance, family and individual level, and how phenotypic performance under salt and waterlogging was inherited was explored to provide a breeding population. Salt and/or waterlogged screening was carried out under controlled conditions up to extreme salt levels to determine tolerance between genotypes. This tank method was shown to produce repeatable results. Seedlings of 30 families from 9 provenances were used for screening. At low salt concentration (up to 300 mM NaCl), differentiation occurred for some traits but in general there was only a slight reduction in growth under salt, and waterlogging alone was not detrimental. At high salt concentration (550 mM) differentiation occurred among genotypes for all traits. Equivalent genotypes were also planted in field trials at three sites, two with medium (583 - 847 mm) and one with low rainfall (372 - 469 mm), in southern Western Australia. Survival was low (&lt;53%) after 9 months due to an exceptional dry season followed by 3 months waterlogging in Kirkwood (38 - 1360 mSm-1), but was high &gt;89% after 33 months in saline fields in Sandalwindy (96 - 976 mSm-1) and Roberts (88 - 1424 mSm-1). Some families were similarly in high rank for height under saline conditions in controlled and field trials. Height had the highest narrow-sense heritability value, especially under controlled saltwaterlogging (0.85) treatment and 20% selection enabled a gain of 8-14% under controlled conditions and in the field. Leaf production under salt was not an inherited trait. Systems were developed to hasten deployment of selected material. Extended daylength (16 h) and paclobutrazol (1 mg a.i/mm stem circumference) stimulated flowering in 2 year-old plants. Clonal propagation was possible. Grafting success varied from 0-100% depending on scion/rootstock provenances.  ... There was only a slight reduction in heterozygosity from species level to provenance and family levels, and two superior genotypes maintained high diversity. v Crossing was possible using one stop pollination of cut immature styles and capsule retention varied from 0-34% and germination rate from 2-96%. Genetic distance between parents was correlated with seed set and offspring fitness. Wider genetic distances increased capsule retention, seed germination and seedling survival. Under 500 mM salt-waterlogging, offspring heights were similar when parental genetic distances were similar. High heritability value for height from ANOVA-REML parental screening was confirmed using parent-offspring regression. Screened superior genotypes, which withstood very high salt concentration, provide a breeding population for further breeding and for plantations under saline regions in low-medium rainfall areas in Western Australia and other parts of the world. These trees provide an economic return in areas where no other plants may survive and an environmental service in potentially reducing waterlogging, salinity and its spread.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Effect of salt on</field><field name="subject">Soils, Salts in</field><field name="subject">Waterlogging (Soils)</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus occidentalis</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Waterlogging</field><field name="subject">Screening</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0036</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of the recovery of the microbial community in jarrah forest soils after bauxite mining and prescription burning</field><field name="creator">Lalor, Briony Maree</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Recovery of soil nutrients, microbial populations and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes are critical to the success of rehabilitation following major ecosystem disturbance. Bauxite mining represents a major ecosystem disturbance to the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in the south-west of Western Australia. Mining has created a mosaic of mined areas in various stages of succession surrounded by non-mined forest areas. Initial site preparations within rehabilitation areas such as contour ripping alter soil structure (creation of mound and furrows) and over time also influence the distribution of vegetation and litter. Current performance criteria developed by industry, government and other stakeholders have determined that before post-bauxite mined areas of jarrah forest can be integrated back into normal forest management practises they should be functional and demonstrate resilience to normal forest disturbances such as fire. Furthermore, resilience should be of a manner comparable to non-mined analogue forest sites. Currently little is known of the resilience of microbial communities and C and N cycling in rehabilitation sites to normal forest disturbances such as prescription burning. As such, before rehabilitated jarrah forests can be successfully integrated into broad scale forest management regimes, a more thorough knowledge of the potential impacts of burning practises on the soil microbial community and C and N cycling processes in these systems is required.  ... While there are similar rates of C and N cycling the underlying microbial community structure was distinctly different; implying a high degree of functional redundancy with respect to C and N cycling. Differences in the C and N cycling and structure of the microbial communities were likely to be due to differences in soil environmental conditions (i.e. soil alkalinity/acidity, soil moisture) and C substrate availability which influence the physiological status of the microbial community and in turn are related to successional age of the forests. Results also suggest that the measurement of CLPP can be a useful approach for assessment of changes in the functional ability of microbial communities. However, the interpretation of how well these rehabilitation forests have recovered heterotrophic abilities was greatly affected by the methodological approach used (e.g. MicroRespTM or Degens and Harris, 1997). Importantly, results from Chapter 4 and 5 suggested that the effects of a moderate prescription fire on C and N processes, CLPP and microbial community structure of 18 year old rehabilitation forests are likely to be short-lived (&lt; 2 years). Furthermore, the effects of the moderate spring prescription fire were not large enough to decouple C and N cycling processes over the short-term (&lt; 1 years) which suggests that by 18 years of age rehabilitation forests demonstrate comparable functional resilience to a moderate prescription burn.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminum mines and mining -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Fire ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Forest ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Jarrah -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">Prescribed burning -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soil microbiology</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Nitrogen content -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">Community level physiological profiles</field><field name="subject">Microbial community structure</field><field name="subject">Mine rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Jarrah forest</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen cycling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0037</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breast cancer and pregnancy : how does a concurrent or subsequent pregnancy affect breast cancer diagnosis, management and outcomes?</field><field name="creator">Ives, Angela Denise</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  A diagnosis of breast cancer is a life-changing event for any woman. For young women and their families it can be devastating. Women aged less than 45 years make up 20% of new cases of breast cancer diagnosed annually in Australia. With the trend for women to delay pregnancy, young women diagnosed with breast cancer may want at least the option to become pregnant after diagnosis and treatment but little is known about how pregnancy affects breast cancer or how breast cancer affects pregnancy. The aims of this thesis were to investigate how concurrent and subsequent pregnancy affects the development and outcomes of breast cancer and how breast cancer affects a concurrent or subsequent pregnancy. This study describes two groups of women identified from the entire Western Australian population less than 45 years of age when diagnosed with: 1. Gestational breast cancer, defined as breast cancer diagnosed while a woman is pregnant or in the first twelve months after completion of a pregnancy; and 2. Breast cancer who subsequently conceive. This study focused on three main areas; patterns of care and outcomes for women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer and those women diagnosed with breast cancer who subsequently conceived; the imaging and pathological characteristics of gestational breast cancer; and lastly the psychosocial issues associated with gestational breast cancer.  ...  This result was statistically significant.  In an age and staged matched case control study lymph node negativity did not purvey a survival advantage for women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer as it did for the non- gestational breast cancer controls. Women diagnosed with breast cancer who have good prognosis tumours need not necessarily wait two years to become pregnant. In an age matched case control study women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer were more likely to have extensive insitu carcinoma, higher mitotic rates and tumours with medullary like features than their age matched controls. In a Cox's proportional hazards regression model which included pathological characteristics, there was no significant difference in survival for women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer were compared to women diagnosed with non-gestational breast cancers. The psychosocial issues for women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer are similar to other young women diagnosed with breast cancer but the effect on the 9 lives of women dealing with pregnancy and breast cancer simultaneously was much greater. The issues of breast cancer and pregnancy are complex at both a physical and psychological level. Much more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of how pregnancy affects breast cancer and its spread. Women who are pregnant when diagnosed with breast cancer or who consider pregnancy after their diagnosis need unbiased support from those around them. Survival is important but other survivorship issues may be just as important. To translate these findings into clinical practice and offer directions for future research eleven recommendations are proposed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Fertility</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Young women -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Fertility</field><field name="subject">Young women</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0038</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributing team leadership : a grounded theory study of how followers exercise leadership</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Grant</field><field name="description">The complex social phenomenon of leadership has been of interest for thousands of years and the subject of formal scientific research for over a century. The individual (sole) leader has been the focus of majority of the studies and leader-follower dyads have featured prominently in the identification of leader behaviours The paradigm has shifted, from the early quantitative approach to the most recent 'new leadership' perspectives which include theories such as transformational, charismatic and visionary leadership. Non-leaders (labelled followers and sometimes subordinates) have received little research attention despite being in the majority in teams. This study examined the research question, 'How do followers exercise leadership?' Approaching the question using grounded theory research methodology, leadership behaviours were studied in 48 seven- to nine-person teams of Year 11 male students attending an outdoor leadership program in one of two consecutive years in South Africa. The qualitative research was based on (1) data collected and analysed from observations in the field, including an extensive video record; (2) semi-structured interviews with course participants and staff; and (3) in-course leadership review documents. This research extends the existing theory of distributed leadership by defining and clarifying particular processes and skills of how followers in this study exercised leadership. Influence is central to leadership and also the core category in this study. In the context of the substantive field, theoretical propositions generated by the research include that team members are generally concerned about contributing and belonging and, when leading, focus on initiating or taking charge of influencing. Instead of being limited to a single leader, the leading role is distributed amongst team members, though not necessarily in equal proportion. In all teams, more than one member exercised leadership, and in most teams every member exercised some leadership behaviour during the four day program. Depending on context, followers exercised leadership by employing one or more of eight influencing behaviours and switching from following to leading roles. Communicating and listening emerged as core leadership behaviours, vital to team processes and most frequently used. Coordinating and motivating were identified as key influencing behaviours, regularly used and important to team processes. Risking, anchoring, mediating and channelling were categorised as situational influencing behaviours, used less frequently, based on context. This research articulates the mechanism whereby team members switch between leading, following and sometimes nominal member roles. Insights are provided of how individuals in a team may, for a period of time, occupy a leading role and then, at other times, occupy a following role. Occupying these roles is not related to formal assignment of roles. This study not only shows that followers play a greater role in leadership than existing literature on research indicates, but it also defines eight influencing behaviours used to exercise leadership. The study has important implications which can help managers and leaders in formal roles maximise the contributions of their followers. This study can also contribute to the design of leadership training and help build more effective teams and organisations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Organizational sociology</field><field name="subject">Self-directed work teams</field><field name="subject">Teams in the workplace</field><field name="subject">Followership</field><field name="subject">Distributed leadership</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0039</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conflict management in consumer behaviour : examining the effect of preferred conflict management style on propensity to bargain</field><field name="creator">Daly, Timothy Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on two under-researched areas of consumer behaviour: conflict handling styles and consumer bargaining. As illustrated in this thesis, consumer bargaining is a substantial and important behaviour that has rarely been studied from a consumer perspective. Further, conflict handling, which is considered an important and wellresearched phenomenon in an organisational context, has been rarely applied to consumer behaviour, despite the potential for conflict in many areas. The aims of this thesis were to a) examine consumer bargaining behaviour across a variety of culturally diverse nations; b) develop and validate a new instrument to measure conflict handling styles; and c) examine the relationships between the likelihood of consumer bargaining, preferred conflict handling styles, and personal values. Consumer bargaining was found to be common in both developed and developing nations. Respondents from Australia and Germany reported bargaining for a broad range of products that vary in their prices, including cars, electronics, appliances, clothing, and computers. Bargaining in South Korea was even more common, including everyday purchases like clothing, and food and drink. Finally, bargaining in Brazil was almost as common as in South Korea, and also included expensive consumer durable purchases, such as electronic products and cars, in addition to everyday purchases, such as clothing, and food and drink. The conflict handling style instrument developed in this project had convergent validity with existing ratings scales, reproduced the theorised structure of the dual-concerns model of conflict handling, and had predictive validity in a service recovery context. The benefits iii of the new scale over existing ratings scales include: a) capturing relative preference for the conflict handling styles; b) reduction of sources of common method variance; c) reduction of ratings scale response biases; and d) reduction of numerical effect biases, such as different perceived distances between response categories. The newly developed scale was also used to assess the hypothesised relationships between personal values, conflict handling styles, and consumer bargaining intensity in a developed Western country (Germany). As expected, the dominate conflict handling style was positively related, while the avoid conflict handling style was negatively related to consumer bargaining intensity. Although no relationship was found between personal values and consumer bargaining intensity, personal values were found to be an antecedent of conflict handling styles. Specifically, the power value type was found to be a positive predictor of the dominate conflict handling style, while benevolence and social universalism were found to be positive predictors of the integrate conflict handling style.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Conflict management</field><field name="subject">Negotiation</field><field name="subject">Consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">Conflict handling style</field><field name="subject">Dual-concerns model</field><field name="subject">Bargaining</field><field name="subject">Best-worst scaling</field><field name="subject">Personal values</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0040</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wrist guards as a public health intervention to reduce the risk of wrist fracture in snowboarders</field><field name="creator">Slaney, Graham</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The aim of the research was to explore the association between wrist guard use and wrist fracture risk in snowboarders in Australia. During the study, the opportunity was also taken to examine the relationship between wearing wrist guards and the severity of wrist and elbow injury. A case-control study was conducted at the Mount Buller Medical Centre, Victoria, Australia. A total of 494 participants was recruited during the 2004 and 2005 ski seasons. Cases were defined as any snowboarder seen at the Clinic with a fractured wrist (N = 119), and controls as any snowboarder seen at the clinic for any reasons other than a fractured wrist (N = 375). Severity of forearm injuries were defined and analysed separately. Study participants completed a questionnaire consisting of: basic demographics (age and sex only); wrist guard use on the day of presentation; normal use of protective equipment; the number of days spent snowboarding that season; the ability of the snowboarder; and ski run difficulty. Risk taking behaviour was assessed by a history of any previous fracture or joint injury and psychometric questions. Clinic medical staff recorded site and severity of fractures and soft tissue injuries. Logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted odds ratios for these risk factors against the main outcome measure. Presence of wrist fracture and injury in snowboarders with and without wrist guards.  ... There was a significant association between wrist guard use and soft tissue elbow injuries (adjusted odds ratio = 17.6, p = 0.011, 95% CI: 1.93 &#150; 160.2), but no significant association with elbow fractures (adjusted odds ratio = 1.84, p = 0.385, 95% CI: 0.46 &#150; 7.30). There was thus no evidence in this study that wrist guards increase the occurrence of other severe injuries in the forearm by transferring the impact force away from the protected wrist up the arm. No evidence was found for compensatory risk taking behaviour in participants wearing protective equipment. A local injury prevention strategy was implemented in schools in the Mt Buller district during the course of this study. Education about the protective effects of wrist guards enabled a policy change in the local secondary college so that wrist guard use is now mandatory for all snowboarders in the school ski programme: That policy states:</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Snowboarding injuries -- Victoria</field><field name="subject">Snowboarding -- Safety measures -- Victoria</field><field name="subject">Wrist -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Wrist guards</field><field name="subject">Wrist fracture</field><field name="subject">Snowboard</field><field name="subject">Injury prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0041</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of maternal-fetal interactions on the aetiology of allergic disease</field><field name="creator">Breckler, Liza Anne</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The dramatic increase in the expression of allergic diseases such as asthma and allergy over the last 20-30 years has highlighted the urgent need to identify causative factors. It was hypothesised that direct immune interactions between mother and fetus contribute to the cytokine milieu of pregnancy, thus influencing immune maturation after birth. Further it was speculated that the cytokine responses produced as a result of maternalfetal interactions are Th-2 skewed in women allergic disease, which programmes their offspring towards developing an allergic phenotype after birth. To test this hypothesis a cohort of 169 pregnant women were recruited at 20 weeks gestation and defined as allergic or non-allergic based on both clinical history and skin prick test sensitisation. These women and their infants were followed up throughout pregnancy (20 weeks, 30 weeks, 36 weeks gestation and 6 weeks post-partum) and up to 2.5 years of age. Mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) were used to measure maternal cytokine (IL-6, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-) and lymphoproliferative responses to fetal alloantigens at each pregnancy time-point. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of mothers and infants were performed to assess the effect of HLA mismatch on maternal MLR responses to their fetus. After delivery, mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from cord blood (CB) and stimulated with allergens, mitogen and toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.  .... As IL-6 also participates in adaptive immunity by promoting Th-2 differentiation it is proposed that the production of IL-6 as a results of maternal encounters with paternal antigens during pregnancy, contribute to the Th-2 skewed responses observed universally in most infants at birth. Associations between maternal-fetal interaction and clinical outcomes in infancy: Although clinical signs of allergy in infancy were not the main outcome measure of this thesis, there were interesting, yet complex relationships between the production of these maternal cytokines towards the fetus and allergic disease at infant follow-ups. Increased maternal IFN-&#191; to fetal alloantigen was associated with asthma at 2.5 years and a trend towards recurrent wheeze at 12 months. In contrast decreased maternal IL-13 production was associated with IgE mediated food allergy at 12 months. Adjusting for maternal allergy and other potential confounders including infant gender, method of delivery, HLA mismatch, and paternal allergy did not account for these relationships. Further follow-ups of these infants are required to determine if these relationship last in to early childhood. In conclusion, the findings of this thesis provides further support for the hypothesis that immune responses at birth are programmed prenatally, and that this programming has implications later in life. Importantly, the placenta is the immunologically active interface between mother and fetus during pregnancy. Therefore it is emphasised that there is a crucial need for future research to focus on early immune programming at the placental level before the aetiological pathways of immune mediated diseases can be fully elucidated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Allergy -- Etiology</field><field name="subject">Maternal-fetal exchange</field><field name="subject">Cytokines -- Immunology</field><field name="subject">Fetus -- Immunology</field><field name="subject">Fetus</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Allergic Disease</field><field name="subject">Immunity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0042</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterisation of cranio-facial form in young West Australians of different population affinity</field><field name="creator">Ruddenklau, Kate Johanna</field><field name="description">One major area of forensic science is to provide identifications of previously unidentifiable individuals. Many of these techniques rely on the accurate interpretation of the morphology of the facial form. An individual's facial form is the result of a complex interaction of their genetic ancestry and the many environmental factors they are exposed to throughout their lives. Facial studies to date have primarily focused on single populations, or on comparing different populations residing in different areas. Very few have looked at the relationships between the facial forms of different populations living in the same area of individuals of mixed population ancestry. In this study the facial morphology of 431 West Australian young adults was analysed, and the relationship between their self reported population affinity and their facial form investigated. The impact of factors such as sexual dimorphism and body mass on facial form were also considered. The relationship between the facial morphology of individuals of mixed population heritage and their parent populations was studied, as was the effect that migration can have on facial form. Strong relationships between self-reported population affinity and facial form were demonstrated over the range of populations in the study. Sex and body mass were seen to have an impact on the morphology of the face; but they did not eclipse the influence of the genetic population affinity. Individuals with ancestry derived from more than one population were seen to resemble one population over another in different areas of the face rather than demonstrating an equal combination of both parent populations. A migration effect was seen in the facial forms of even the first generation offspring of migrants.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">3D stereophotogrametry</field><field name="subject">Face</field><field name="subject">Morphometric</field><field name="subject">Migration effect</field><field name="subject">Age</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">BMI</field><field name="subject">Population affinity</field><field name="subject">Human identification</field><field name="subject">Human beings -- Anthropometry</field><field name="subject">Phenetic affinity</field><field name="subject">Photogrammetry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0043</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family holiday decision making in Thailand : projecting preference and influence</field><field name="creator">Praditsuwan, Nattaya</field><field name="description">One major policy of the Tourism Authority of Thailand is to promote domestic tourism. In Thailand, the family is considered to be the main social group, and as such is the main target for domestic tourism marketers. However, relatively little is known about family decision making, especially in Thailand. This thesis addresses this gap in knowledge by employing a two-staged conjoint study to examine the preferences and the influence of family members in a destination choice decision. At the first stage (an in-home interview), family members were asked to provide their holiday destination preferences and their estimation of the other family members' preferences. At the second stage (an in-home interview two weeks later), they are asked to provide their estimation of the joint family preferences, after being provided with a table listing the individual family members' preferences. Finally, they were asked to make the holiday destination decision as a family. This design allowed three thesis aims to be addressed: 1) to examine individual family members and the family group preferences; 2) to examine the ability of family members to predict other family members' preferences and their influence on the family decision; and 3) to examine family members actual influence of family members on the family decision. The findings revealed considerable similarities in the importance of attributes, with price and destination being more important, as well as the levels, with the majority preferring a lower rather than higher price and a beach rather than mountain destination. Further, there was reasonable accuracy in the prediction of each others' preferences, although parents were more accurate than children. However, there was a considerable amount of inaccuracy in the prediction of each others' influence. Family members systematically overestimated their own influence, and underestimated the influence of other family members.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family vacations -- Thailand</field><field name="subject">Families -- Thailand -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Families -- Thailand -- Decision making</field><field name="subject">Thailand -- Family relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0044</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superalgebras and brane actions</field><field name="creator">Reimers, D. T.</field><field name="description">The Noether charge algebra of brane actions is typically modified by a topological anomalous term. The underlying cohomology of this anomalous term is investigated, and it is shown that the anomalous term possesses a gauge freedom. The result is that the anomalous term generates a parameterized family of topological charge algebras. When fermionic charges are taken to be nonvanishing, the known algebras underlying extended superspace formulations of the action appear in these families. This phenomena is investigated for minimal p-branes, Dp-branes and (p, q)-strings. The algebras resulting from the D-brane actions are shown to allow the construction of extended superspace actions without worldvolume gauge fields. It is shown that the actions are !-symmetric, and that the symmetry is generated by a right action. The global and local symmetry transformations of the Born-Infeld gauge field are thus shown to be described geometrically by left/right actions of the underlying extended supertranslation group. An equivalence class construction is proposed for the description of compact fermionic dimensions. In this construction, open strings in extended superspace translate to closed strings in compact superspace, and fermionic topological charges may be realized by closed strings. The differential underlying the descent construction for Noether charge algebras is shown to be naturally described as a dual of the de Rham differential. The ghost fields used in the construction are shown to be described geometrically as a vielbein with respect to this differential.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Superalgebras</field><field name="subject">Branes</field><field name="subject">String Theory</field><field name="subject">Branes</field><field name="subject">Superalgebras</field><field name="subject">Supersymmetry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0045</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses of Posidonia australis Hook.f. and Posidonia sinuosa Cambridge et Kuo transplants to nitrogen, phosphorus and iron additions in Oyster Harbour, Western Australia, with focus on root development</field><field name="creator">Hovey, Renae Kathleen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] There is a well-documented global decline of seagrass meadows in response to anthropogenic pressures. Transplantation of rhizome fragments into denuded areas has been used to enhance natural recovery but nutrient limitation and poor root growth may contribute to low success rates. Addition of nutrients to sediments has been proposed as a means of enhancing growth and survival of seagrass transplants by alleviating nutrient limitation but there is limited information of the effects of nutrient additions to seagrass transplants, particularly root development and morphology. In addition to nutrient limitation, sulphide accumulation in sediments with high organic matter has been shown to reduce seagrass growth and experimental iron additions have been shown to enhance seagrass growth by buffering the development of reduced conditions in organic rich sediments. This thesis examines responses (growth, morphology and nutrient status) of Posidonia australis and Posidonia sinuosa transplants to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and chelated iron (Fe EDTA) additions, and includes a detailed investigation of root growth and morphology in response to these additions. Experiments were carried out in underwater plots in Oyster Harbour, a sheltered estuarine inlet with seasonal river flow, located on the southern coast of Western Australia. In the first experiment, nutrients (N, P and N+P) and Fe EDTA were added to sediment underlying transplants at the end of summer (March 2005).  ... Nitrogen (both N and N+P) addition also reduced overall biomass allocation to roots. Nitrogen concentrations increased with N addition in P. sinuosa only but both species had more negative d15N values with N and N+P addition indicating that added N had been taken up. In contrast, P addition had little effect on root growth, and P concentrations only increased in P. australis. However, tissue concentrations of Zn, Co, and Mo in both species increased with P addition. Roots showed limited morphological variation (total root length, mean root diameter, root fineness, specific root length, surface area) in response to nutrient addition. Combined N and P addition increased lateral root density (branches m-1) but had no effect on other morphological parameters of the root compartment. Iron addition had no effect on P. sinuosa but P. australis transplants significantly reduced root growth and productivity, particularly in spring/summer growth period, due to lower primary and lateral growth rates. Overall, N or P additions did not enhance growth although these nutrients were taken up. Iron additions also had little effect on transplant growth. Seagrass transplants had significant root growth although they appeared not to respond to nutrient or iron addition. Both species produced extensive root systems capable of taking up sediment nutrients, which suggests that root development was not a limiting factor in establishment and growth of transplants in the temperate estuary, Oyster Harbour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Posidonia australis -- Western Australia -- Oyster Harbour -- Roots -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Posidonia australis -- Effect of minerals on -- Western Australia -- Oyster Harbour</field><field name="subject">Posidoniaceae -- Western Australia -- Oyster Harbour -- Roots -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Posidoniaceae -- Effect of minerals on -- Western Australia -- Oyster Harbour</field><field name="subject">Seagrass transplants</field><field name="subject">Root growth</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen, phosphorus, iron additions</field><field name="subject">Growth and morphology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0046</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analysis of the promoter regions of alternative oxidase genes from Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="creator">Ho, Lois H. M.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles found in almost all eukaryotic cells to contain more than 1000 different proteins. The majority of these proteins are encoded in the nucleus, translated in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. The overall aim of this study was to characterise the regulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (NEMP). This was carried out in the plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, using the alternative oxidase (AOX) as a model. Specifically, the aims were to i) determine how regulation of NEMP interact with known regulatory pathways/mechanisms; ii) determine if the pattern of coexpression observed for NEMP are due to co-regulation, and iii) to determine whether mitochondrial retrograde regulatory pathways interact with known chloroplast regulatory pathways. AOX1c is one of five genes encoding AOX in Arabidopsis. It is expressed in a variety of organs and is not induced by stress. Thus, its regulation was characterised in order to gain insight into the regulation of NEMP under normal growth conditions. Analysis of the promoter of AOX1c revealed cis-acting regulatory elements (CAREs) common to both AOX1c from Arabidopsis and AOX2b from soybean. Additionally, Site II elements, previously shown to be involved in the regulation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, are present in the upstream promoter region of AtAOX1c and were shown to be strong negative regulators of AtAOX1c expression. AOX1a is a gene encoding AOX that is induced at a transcript level, by many stress treatments.  BA signalling and provide evidence of at least one common factor between chloroplastic and mitochondrial retrograde regulatory pathways, i.e. ABI4. ... The above results reveal that the regulation of NEMP are integrated with the mainstream regulatory pathways that control gene expression for a variety of proteins in various locations. Although this is not unexpected, it does raise the question of how mitochondrial function impacts, or feeds back, to alter these pathways, i.e. how mitochondrial retrograde signals affects the regulation of genes encoding proteins in a variety of locations. The observed interaction of mitochondrial and plastid retrograde regulatory pathways at the level of ABI4, suggests that mitochondrial signals have the potential to act as a powerful regulators of many cellular functions. Although interaction between mitochondrial and other organelles at a cellular level has been known for some time, there is still much work left to be done to define the network of molecular interactions that exists to regulate and integrate the expression of NEMP with all other proteins in the cell. This study reveals that interactions also occur at regulatory steps that have to potential to regulate many function in organelles, even if no direct metabolic link exists. However, this study has only begun to uncover these interactions at a molecular level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana -- Cytogenetics</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana -- Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Mitochondrial pathology</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Respiratory chain</field><field name="subject">Oxidative stress</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0047</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetries in unimanual and bimanual coordination : evidence from behavioural and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies</field><field name="creator">Faulkner, Deborah</field><field name="description">The issue of the laterality of control during unimanual and bimanual coordination was addressed in this thesis. Two tasks were used throughout: a repetitive discrete response task (finger tapping) and a continuous task (circle-drawing). Different mechanisms have been implicated in the temporal control of repetitive discrete movements and continuous movements. The tasks also differ in the degree of spatiotemporal coordination required which might have important implications in the question of laterality of control. The first section of the thesis examined between-hand differences in the dynamics of performance during unimanual and bimanual coordination. During tapping, the dominant hand was faster and less temporally variable than the nondominant hand. During circle drawing the dominant hand was faster, more accurate, less temporally and spatially variable, and produced smoother trajectories than the nondominant hand. During bimanual coordination, several of these asymmetries were attenuated: the rate of movement of the two hands became equivalent (the hands became temporally coupled), the asymmetry in temporal variability during tapping was reduced, and the asymmetry in trajectory smoothness during circle drawing was reduced. The second section of the thesis examined the effects of disrupting motor processes with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left or right primary motor cortex (M1) on the ongoing performance of the hands. In the first study, TMS over left or right M1 during unimanual tapping caused large disruptions to tapping with the contralateral hand but had little effect on the ipsilateral hand. In contrast, for a subset of trials during bimanual tapping, two lateralized effects of stimulation were seen: the effect of TMS on the contralateral hand was greater after stimulation over left M1 than after stimulation over right M1, and prolonged changes in inter-tap interval were observed in the left hand regardless of the side of stimulation. In the second study, TMS over left M1 during circle drawing decreased the accuracy of drawing with both the contralateral and ipsilateral hand, whereas TMS over right M1 decreased accuracy of drawing only with the contralateral hand. This lateralized effect was not limited to the bimanual case, but was also apparent during unimanual drawing. The final chapter addressed issues in bimanual motor control after unilateral stroke. Performance of the affected limb was examined during unimanual and bimanual coordination in a group of stroke patients with varying levels of impairment. The results indicated an improvement in the performance of the affected limb for some patients with mild to moderate, but not severe upper limb motor deficits during bimanual movement. The improvements were limited to the patients who showed evidence of temporal coupling between the hands. These findings support the hypothesis that the dominant motor cortex has a role in the control of both hands during bimanual coordination. In addition, the dominant hemisphere appears to play a role in controlling both hands during unimanual movements which require a greater degree of spatiotemporal coordination. The final study suggests that temporal coupling between the limbs is crucial for the facilitation of performance of the affected limb during bimanual coordination, which has both theoretical and practical implications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laterality</field><field name="subject">Motor ability -- Psychophysiology</field><field name="subject">Motor cortex -- Effect of magnetism on</field><field name="subject">Bimanual</field><field name="subject">Motor control</field><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Laterality</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0048</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A therapeutic approach for the skeletal muscle a-actin based congenital myopathies</field><field name="creator">Ravenscroft, Gianina</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Mutations in the skeletal muscle -actin gene (ACTA1) have been shown to be one cause of a broad group of muscle disorders all termed the congenital myopathies. Over 170 different mutations have now been identified across all 6 coding exons of ACTA1 in patients presenting with muscle weakness and any one or more of the following histopathological features: nemaline rods, intranuclear rods, fibre-type disproportion, excess of thin filaments and central cores. While the identification of the causative gene has been of great comfort for affected patients and their families, with pre-natal genetic testing becoming available, the ultimate aim is to develop a therapy for these disorders. Of the therapies currently being explored for the muscular dystrophies, up-regulation of an alternative gene seemed to be one of the most promising avenues for treatment of the ACTA1 diseases. Up-regulation of utrophin, the foetal homologue of dystrophin, has been shown to be a promising therapy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The main aim of my research was to determine whether up-regulation of cardiac -actin, the predominant -actin expressed in foetal skeletal muscle and in the adult heart, could be used as a therapy for the ACTA1 diseases. A proof-of-concept experiment was performed whereby skeletal muscle -actin knock-out (KO) mice (all of which die by postnatal day 9) were crossed with transgenic mice over-expressing cardiac -actin (known as Coco mice) in postnatal skeletal muscle. ... While patients that are ACTA1 nulls have been identified in a number of mainly consanguineous populations, the majority of ACTA1 mutations result in dominant disease in which the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type skeletal muscle -actin. Research described in this thesis also focuses on characterizing two transgenic mouse models of dominant ACTA1 disease at the ultra-structural, cellular and functional level; this is the first step towards a proof-of-concept experiment to determine whether cardiac -actin up-regulation can dilute out the pathogenesis of dominant ACTA1 disease. It has long been noted that patients with ACTA1 disease do not have ophthalmoplegia, even in the most-severely affected individuals. Protein analysis performed on extraocular muscle (EOM) biopsies obtained from humans, sheep and pigs showed that the EOMs co-express cardiac and skeletal muscle -actin, with cardiac -actin comprising  70 % of the striated -actin pool. Thus we propose that sparing of the EOMs in ACTA1 disease is at least in part due to cardiac -actin diluting out the pathogenesis associated with expression of the mutant skeletal muscle -actin. This finding provides further support for the hypothesis that dilution of mutant skeletal muscle -actin in dominant ACTA1 disease by up-regulation of cardiac -actin may be a viable therapy for this group of devastating muscle diseases. The research contained herein has advanced the understanding of the pathobiology of skeletal muscle -actin diseases and provides strong evidence in support of cardiac -actin up-regulation as a promising therapy for these diseases.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Muscles -- Abnormalities</field><field name="subject">Muscles -- Diseases -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Congenital myopathies</field><field name="subject">Skeletal muscle alpha-actin</field><field name="subject">Up-regulation therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0049</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patient compliance and spontaneous movements while following an early active motion protocol after a flexor tendon repair</field><field name="creator">Saleeba, Elizabeth Constance</field><field name="description">Compliance to strict home exercise programs is understood to be a mainstay of post-surgical flexor tendon rehabilitation. Therapists recognise the potential of poor compliance (overuse or under-use of prescribed exercise) and spontaneous movements during rehabilitation. Some therapists may suggest that compliance to specific exercise regimens and control of spontaneous or general movements are fundamentally important in optimising the rehabilitation outcomes and minimising the potential of adverse events. Yet there is little objective data to document the actual levels of exercise or spontaneous finger movement performed outside the clinical setting. The purpose of this study was to document both diary and instrumented methods of reporting finger movement during a 48hr period. Following surgical repair of the flexor tendon, subjects attending a private hand therapy clinic provided consent and reported subjective diary (n=16) data of sets and repetitions of exercise for up to 6 weeks post-operatively. Nine subjects also had instrumented data logged on 3 occasions during the first 6 weeks of rehabilitation and were not fully aware of the purpose of the instrumentation. All subjects were instructed to perform 10 passive followed by 10 active exercises every waking hour, for the first 6 weeks and were assessed on range of motion, DASH, pain and strength. Results demonstrated that patients reported, via their diaries, that they are on average 80% compliant. Parallel data logger information suggests that this figure is more likely to reflect 50% compliance. A significant (p&lt; .05) increase in spontaneous movements in the last 2 weeks of the 6 week assessment period was detected. No significant correlation between patient's level of compliance or spontaneous movement and their outcome were detected.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hand -- Surgery -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Patient compliance</field><field name="subject">Patient monitoring</field><field name="subject">Postoperative care</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Tendons -- Surgery</field><field name="subject">Flexor tendon rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Compliance</field><field name="subject">Hand therapy</field><field name="subject">Data logger</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0050</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovations in health for older people in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Loh, Poh Kooi</field><field name="description">Australia and many other developed communities are ageing rapidly, placing a strain on the delivery of health services. This thesis examines the use of innovative health services management coupled with information and communication technology (ICT) to more efficiently deliver services to disabled older people in the hospital, community and residential care. The hypothesis explored is that ICT can provide clinical services to older people in poorly serviced communities and groups, thus extending the influence and capabilities of specialist health care professionals. The relevance of these studies is predominantly for those people who live outside the metropolitan regions, particularly in remote and rural communities, and also for those frail older people, who because of disability, are unable to travel to specialist health services. There are a series of studies presented in this thesis which have all been published. They have demonstrated that in a community and rural setting, ICT use in the assessment and management of geriatric syndromes such as dementia is valid and practical. This included the validation of commonly used assessment tools via Telehealth. A Telehealth protocol for assessment of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) was developed and published. The use of ICT to link health services clinical and administrative data for determining stroke outcomes and disability has been evaluated and a resource utilization prediction model developed. Finally, in residential care a survey and a qualitative study of poor uptake of ICT services in hostels and nursing homes revealed insights into ICT perception by the older people in care facilities and their professional staff. The implications and future development of these studies have been discussed, especially barriers to increased uptake of ICT, cost comparisons and the potential of future technologies such as video conferencing mobile phones.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">Older people -- Care -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Older people -- Health and hygiene -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Older people -- Services for -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Rural health services -- Western Australia -- Communication systems</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication in medicine -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Telehealth</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">Demnetia</field><field name="subject">Aged care</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0051</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novel parametrized controller reduction technique based on different closed-loop configurations</field><field name="creator">Houlis, Pantazis Constantine</field><field name="description">This Thesis is concerned with the approximation of high order controllers or the controller reduction problem.

The formulas for the input and output weights are derived using three closed-loop system configurations: (i) by placing a controller in cascade with the plant, (ii) by placing a controller in the feedback path, and (iii) by using the linear fractional transformation (LFT) representation. One of the weights will be a function of a free parameter which can be varied in the resultant frequency weighted model reduction problem. We show that by using standard frequency weighted model reduction techniques, the approximation error can be easily reduced by varying the free parameter to give more accurate low order controllers. A method for choosing the free parameter to get optimal results is being suggested. A number of practical examples are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller reduction method. We have then considered the relationships between the closed-loop system con gurations which can be expressed using a classical control block diagram or a modern control block diagram (LFT). Formulas are derived to convert a closed-loop system represented by a classical control block diagram to a closed-loop system represented by a modern control block diagram and vice versa.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Control theory</field><field name="subject">Digital control systems</field><field name="subject">Discrete-time systems</field><field name="subject">Feedback control systems</field><field name="subject">Linear systems</field><field name="subject">Linear time invariant systems</field><field name="subject">Model reduction</field><field name="subject">Closed loop systems</field><field name="subject">Controller reduction</field><field name="subject">Double controller</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0052</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of genetic diversity in human sexual selection : is the MHC special?</field><field name="creator">Lie, Hanne Cathrine</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The assumption that facial attractiveness signals mate quality is central to current evolutionary theories of human sexual selection. Evidence for direct links between attractiveness and mate quality is, however, scarce, and the exact nature of mate quality remains the subject of debate. Mate quality may include genetic diversity, because genome-wide diversity has been linked to individual fitness, and diversity within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) has been associated with immunocompetence and health in many species. This thesis investigates whether individual genetic diversity plays a role in human sexual selection. The main aim is to examine whether MHC diversity, compared to genetic diversity in general, is especially important for mate preferences, health and mating success. The four studies herein are based on data collected from a large sample of heterosexual, Caucasian males and females. Participants were photographed, provided a DNA sample, and completed questionnaires regarding sexual history and health. Genetic diversity was calculated as both mean heterozygosity (H) and standardised mean-d2 (d2), separately for 12 MHC microsatellite loci and 11 nonMHC loci. The photographs were rated for various attractive features by opposite-sex raters. The first study investigated whether MHC diversity influences preferences for facial appearance in a potential mate, and if so, are they specific to the MHC and are they mediated by specific facial characteristics? I found that MHC-H, but not nonMHCH, positively predicted male facial attractiveness, and that this relationship was mediated by facial averageness. For females, nonMHC-d2 predicted facial symmetry, and potentially attractiveness. These findings indicate that faces contain visual cues to mate quality in both males and females, providing support for evolutionary theories that our preferences are adaptations for identifying mates of high quality.  ... Measuring them both allowed me to tease apart their effects on mate preferences, and on health and mating success. Indeed, the MHC appears to be especially important in sexual selection as MHC diversity predicted female mate preferences after controlling for nonMHC diversity, and MHC dissimilarity predicted male mate preferences after controlling for nonMHC dissimilarity. Moreover, although MHC diversity did not appear to influence males&#146; preference for females, it did predict female mating success, suggesting that males also attend to MHC-related cues, although perhaps non-facial cues, when seeking mates. Additionally, nonMHC diversity predicted both male preferences for female faces and health, suggesting that such preferences are adaptive. Importantly, by providing direct links between facial attractiveness and biological markers of individual quality, genetic diversity, these results support the commonly held assumption that facial attractiveness signals mate quality.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mate selection</field><field name="subject">Sexual attraction -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">HLA histocompatibility antigens</field><field name="subject">Human genetics</field><field name="subject">Sexual selection</field><field name="subject">Humans</field><field name="subject">Facial attractiveness</field><field name="subject">MHC</field><field name="subject">HLA</field><field name="subject">Major histocompatibility complex</field><field name="subject">Mate choice</field><field name="subject">Mate preferences</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Beauty</field><field name="subject">Genetic quality</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0053</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and interpretation of clusters of seismic events in mines</field><field name="creator">Hudyma, Martin Raymond</field><field name="description">Spatial clustering of seismic events in mines has been widely reported in literature.

A linkage between spatial seismic event clusters and discrete rockmass failure mechanisms is tenuous and not well established using current seismic analysis techniques. A seismic event clustering methodology is proposed.

LPCs can differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes and thus are capable of replenishing the damaged liver. Due to their plasticity and robust nature in culture systems, they are promising candidates for use in cell therapy. However, to be able to use LPCs as tissue regenerating stem cell-like cells in the clinic, we need to fully understand how they are controlled. Although a strong association between LPCs and inflammation has been shown in many chronic liver diseases, the role of the immune system in LPC-mediated hepatic regeneration is poorly understood. We hypothesise that specific immune cells and mediators are needed to induce the LPC compartment, and that these are common to the LPC response in different injury settings. Therefore, the present study focused on the characterisation of the inflammatory environment in the LPC response, which generates this niche. The aims of this study were (i) to identify the immune cells that are important for the LPC response, (ii) to define the cytokine profile and (iii) to determine the role of the cytokine producing cells during liver regeneration. To study hepatic inflammation following liver injury, a diet-induced model of liver injury (choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet, CDE diet) was compared to two transgenic mouse models of immune-mediated hepatitis (Met-Kb, 178.3). Although all three models are characterised by hepatitis, histological analysis revealed that LPCs were only detectable in the CDE and Met-Kb livers. In the 178.3 model, livers regenerated from proliferating hepatocytes. An LPC response could not be induced in these mice even when liver damage was made more severe. In the other two models, LPC numbers increased over time showing the highest numbers one week after the peak of liver injury. LPCs were often found in close proximity to inflammatory cells, in particular macrophages.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemokines</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Liver cells -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Stem cells</field><field name="subject">Liver progenitor cells/liver stem cells</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Liver regeneration</field><field name="subject">Cytokines and chemokines</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0055</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hematocrit, implications for bloodstain pattern analysis</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Natasha</field><field name="description">Blood is one of the most common and important types of physical evidence present at a crime scene.  When liquid blood is acted upon by external physical forces, that blood is often distributed through the air in the form of droplets, with bloodstains and bloodstain patterns deposited on adjacent surfaces.  Using the mathematical relationship that exists between the blood droplet and resultant bloodstain&#146;s length and width ratio, the angle at which the blood droplet impacted the receiving surface can be determined.  Using this relationship, it becomes possible for Bloodstain Pattern Analysts to determine the three dimensional Region of Origin for the blood source from which the bloodstains under examination have originated.  A Bloodstain Pattern Analyst performs angle of impact calculations from bloodstains for the purpose of making a three dimensional determination of blood source Region of Origin. The reliability of that determination is based on an assumption that one of the most important biological properties of blood; the amount of red blood cells or hematocrit value, has no influence over the length to width ratio of a bloodstain.  As a consequence the Impact angle = arcsine [width/length] calculation has been assumed accurate regardless of the 'unknown' hematrocrit value.  This thesis investigated the effect of the hematocrit value on the angle of impact calculation and thus the ability to determine the three dimensional blood source Region of Origin.     Bloodstains were created by releasing a series of 18&#181;L droplets, with ten different hematocrit values, onto a ceramic tile at four different angles.  The resultant bloodstain length and width was measured and impact angle calculated.  Evaluation of the research data shows that the hematocrit value significantly affects the bloodstains length and width.  However, it is apparent that there is close agreement between the known and calculated impact angles irrespective of the hematocrit value.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hematocrit -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Forensic hematology</field><field name="subject">Bloodstain pattern analysis</field><field name="subject">Bloodstain pattern analysis</field><field name="subject">Hematocrit</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0056</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sulphur transformation during pyrolysis of an Australian lignite</field><field name="creator">Yani, Setyawati</field><field name="description">Australia has the largest economical lignite resources in the world. However, the utilisation of lignite is faced with a number of technical, economical and environmental problems due to its high moisture content and some of the deposits containing high sulphur and high inorganic matter. During pyrolysis, the first step of any thermochemical conversion processes of coal, some of the sulphur in lignite evolves as sulphur-bearing volatiles while others are retained in the solid phase of the lignite char. The present research aims to study the sulphur transformation during pyrolysis of Australian lignite. The specific objectives of this research include a study on the transformation of pyrite, sulphate and organic sulphur during lignite pyrolysis as well as an investigation of the effect of inorganic matter on the sulphur transformation during lignite pyrolysis. To help the interpretation of sulphur transformation, the lignite samples were characterised using a combination of analytical techniques, i.e. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescent (XRF), ion chromatography (IC), Scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Fourier transform infra red (FTIR), solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and petrographic analysis. Pyrolysis was carried out in a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) and fixed bed reactor. The lignites and their chars were analysed for sulphur forms using a carbon sulphur (CS) analyser. To study the volatiles released during pyrolysis, experiments were also performed using a TGA coupled to a mass spectrometer (TGA-MS). Eleven (11) Australian lignite samples, denoted as L1 to L11, respectively, from the same lignite deposit but with different sulphur and inorganic matter concentrations were employed in this study. They are categorised as of low quality since they contain high Executive Summary Sulphur Transformation during Pyrolysis of an Australian Lignite v moisture, very high ash, low fixed carbon and thus they have low calorific value, except for L1. The lignites contain considerable amount of total sulphur, except for L1. Mineralogy of the lignites showed that the lignites contain extremely high sodium and chlorine. FTIR and solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy confirmed that oxygenated functional structures are significantly present in the lignites.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sulphur</field><field name="subject">Lignite -- Desulphurization -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Lignite -- Sulphur content -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Pyrolysis</field><field name="subject">Sulphur transformation</field><field name="subject">Pyrolysis</field><field name="subject">Sulphate</field><field name="subject">Australian lignite</field><field name="subject">Pyrite</field><field name="subject">Organic sulphur</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0057</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Root morphology, photosynthesis, water relations and development of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) in response to soil constraints at restores bauxite mines in south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Szota, Christopher</field><field name="description">Bauxite mining is a major activity in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) forest of south-western Australia.

The observation of geographical variation in CRC incidence and increased CRC risks in populations consuming high levels of meat prompted researchers to hypothesise a link between meat and CRC. An area of particular interest in CRC pathogenesis is the meat-derived compounds such are heterocyclic amines (HCAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and meatderived mutagenic activity. Australia is among the countries with high incidence of CRC and also high levels of per capita meat consumption. Hence, clarifying the possible link between meat consumption and the risk of CRC in order that this can be translated into preventive dietary recommendations for the public is important. The objective of this thesis was to examine whether meat consumption is related to risk of CRC in an Australian population. The term meat consumption in this thesis means meaures of consumption of red and white meat that incorporate frequency and cooking method. The following hypotheses were investigated: 1. Increasing intake of meat prepared by methods that involve higher cooking temperature and time is positively associated with the risk of CRC; 2. Increasing exposure to meat-derived heterocyclic amines (HCAs) is positively associated with the risk of CRC; 3. Higher levels of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from meat consumption is a risk factor for CRC; 4. Exposure to meat-derived mutagens increases the risk of CRC.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Benzopyrene</field><field name="subject">Chemical mutagenesis</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) -- Cancer -- Nutritional aspects</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) -- Cancer -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Heterocyclic compounds -- Carcinogenicity</field><field name="subject">Mutagenicity testing</field><field name="subject">Rectum -- Cancer -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Meat consumption</field><field name="subject">Colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Heterocyclic amines</field><field name="subject">Benzo[a]pyrene</field><field name="subject">Meat mutageniaity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0059</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative audiology and the development of a seeding model for affordable and sustainable audiology education</field><field name="creator">Goulios, Helen</field><field name="description">The recognition by societies of the problems caused by deafness and hearing impairment has led to a significant increase in the need for audiologists. Additionally, the rapid development of audiology in the last few decades, a wide diversity of audiology education programs, and increased globalisation highlighted the need to evaluate current audiology education and practice from an international perspective. A major aim of this thesis was therefore to study comparative audiology, to allow systematic analysis of what hearing health care is needed worldwide, and the strategies required to achieve future improvements. Rather than remaining theoretical, this thesis also aimed to develop an affordable and sustainable seeding model for audiology education, which would build capacity in countries with inadequate audiology education. An international study surveyed major audiology organisations, and completed surveys were received from 62 countries (representing 78% of the world population). Eighty-six percent of countries needed more audiologists, and cited a lack of government funding, low public awareness of deafness and inadequate audiology education as major reasons for the shortages. There was a wide range of professionals providing hearing health care and a large overlap in their scope of practices. To discuss these complex issues, a conceptual model for hearing health care was developed which formalised the interacting issues, and highlighted the feedback loops between them. The conceptual model presented a framework that was used to discuss individual countries in more detail, and provided a basis for the design of strategies aimed at improving hearing health care and education for groups of countries. Although five distinct groups were described, in practice, most countries may benefit to some extent from hearing health care systems that range from decentralised community-based models (providing basic care), to more institutionally-based models (offering advanced services and technologies). Evolution of hearing health care systems from basic community-based, to more advanced institutionally-based services, would presumably come with strengthening economies and health and education infrastructures, and concurrent growth in audiology education and private and public hearing health care markets. The rate at which this occurs depends in part on the strength of a country&#146;s economy, but also on its other health priorities, the equality of its wealth distribution, the diversity and geographic spread of its population, and the adequacy and efficiency of its hearing health care education programs.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative audiology</field><field name="subject">International audiology</field><field name="subject">Audiology education models</field><field name="subject">Hearing health care services</field><field name="subject">Hearing health care indices</field><field name="subject">Audiology workforce planning</field><field name="subject">Audiology</field><field name="subject">Audiology -- Study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0060</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rehabilitation of unilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss with a bone anchored hearing aid</field><field name="creator">Eager, Katrise Mary</field><field name="description">The long-term outcomes of subjects fitted with a bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) for a unilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss (UPSHL) are still evolving. Previous studies have focused on the comparison between shortterm outcomes obtained with hard-wired contralateral routing of signal (CROS) hearing aids and those obtained with BAHA devices. Published results on subjects who have worn their BAHA devices for UPSHL for more than twelve months are limited. This study explored the long-term outcomes of adults fitted with a BAHA for UPSHL. The aims were firstly to examine subjects' pre-operative and postoperative speech perception in quiet and noise, as well as administer two standardised questionnaires, the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Benefit (APHAB) and the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP). The second aim was to evaluate the responses of implanted subjects following the preoperative test protocols using a supplementary questionnaire, the Single Sided Deafness Questionnaire (SSDQ). The third aim was to monitor the subjects' implant or repair issues. In addition, questionnaire results were compared to subjects who underwent pre-operative assessment but were not implanted. All subjects had a UPSHL resulting from various aetiologies including vestibular schwannoma or other skull base tumour removal, viral infections, cochlear trauma, idiopathic sudden hearing loss, and Meniere's disease. There was a significant difference between the implanted groups' pre- and post-operative outcomes measures, indicating a treatment effect from the fitting of the BAHA device. No significant changes were found with the non-implanted groups' longterm outcome measures in regards to their perceived hearing difficulties. No significant correlations were found between outcome measures and gender, age of fitting, length of deafness, or ear affected for either group.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audiology</field><field name="subject">Bone-anchored hearing aids</field><field name="subject">Deafness</field><field name="subject">Hearing aids</field><field name="subject">Hearing disorders</field><field name="subject">&lt;bone anchored hearing aid&gt;</field><field name="subject">&lt;audiology&gt;</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0061</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The condition at settlement of the western rock lobster, Panulirus cygnus George : spatial and temporal fluctuations</field><field name="creator">Limbourn, Andrew John</field><field name="description">The condition at settlement of the western rock lobster pueruli presumably reflects both their energetic condition in reaching the near shore and subsequent recruitment into adult populations. In recruiting to the near shore the pueruli swim across the continental shelf where oceanographic conditions are complex and likely influence the success of recruitment. The results from the biochemical studies are interpreted in light of the oceanography off the coast of Western Australia. I investigated the nutritional condition of larval phyllosomata, post-larval puerulus and first instar post-pueruli juveniles of the spiny lobster, Panulirus cygnus, to determine energy use during the non-feeding transitional puerulus stage. Biochemical analyses of lipid, fatty acid (FA) and protein revealed that lipid, in particular phospholipids, is primarily used for energy during the nonfeeding puerulus stage. Monounsaturated FA showed the greatest decline with development, whereas the polyunsaturated FA showed a high degree of sparing, suggesting these FA are not used as a substrate for energy production. The knowledge gained on the biochemistry of energy use in P. cygnus was then used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability in the nutritional condition, in particular lipid condition, of puerulus collected at three near shore locations (Alkimos, Jurien Bay and Dongara) along the Western Australia coast, and one offshore location (Houtman Abrolhos Islands). The one offshore location was chosen as I hypothesised that arriving pueruli are likely to be in a better state of nutrition than those arriving at more coastal locations where the potential journey from offshore larval feeding grounds to the near shore is considerably greater. This element of my research showed lipid levels to be inversely related, generally, to shelf width but were variable, suggesting pueruli may travel complex trajectories to reach nearshore settlement. The lipid and FA composition of pueruli was also consistent with spatial and seasonal variation in Leeuwin Current and coastal productivity regimes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decapoda (Crustacea) -- Larvae</field><field name="subject">Lipids</field><field name="subject">Lobsters -- Larvae</field><field name="subject">Western rock lobster -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">El Ni&#241;o Current</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin Current</field><field name="subject">Puerulus</field><field name="subject">Decapod larvae</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin Current</field><field name="subject">ENSO</field><field name="subject">Lipid biochemistry</field><field name="subject">Western rock lobster</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0062</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ownership structure, corporate goverance and financial performance of public listed companies in Singapore</field><field name="creator">Koh, Charlie Tai-Joo</field><field name="description">The object of this empirical study is to clarify, consolidate and build on various conflicting research findings on the relationships among ownership structure, corporate governance, and corporate performance using data from 149 Singapore public listed companies.

Specifically, arachidonic acid is metabolised by cytochrome P450 -hydroxylase to produce vasoactive 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), and by 5-lipoxygenase to produce proinflammatory leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which can further be metabolised by -hydroxylase to from 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4. F2-Isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) are produced through free radical attack on arachidonic acid and have been recognised as the most reliable markers of lipid peroxidation in vivo. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterised by abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia. It is associated with low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress and an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Dietary weight loss is strongly recommended for the management of the MetS and can potentially minimise the risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in individuals with the MetS. Little is known regarding the role of these arachidonic acid metabolites in the MetS and the effect of weight loss on their metabolism. Chapter three comprised of three in vitro studies aimed to examine 20-HETE synthesis in human blood cells. 20-HETE acts as a second messenger for vasoconstrictor actions of angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in renal and mesenteric beds. Human neutrophils and platelets are integral to the inflammatory process.  ... Production of LTB4 and 20-OH-LTB4 was significantly lower compared with controls (P&lt;0.005) and remained so after adjustment for neutrophil count (P&lt;0.05).The weight loss intervention resulted in a 4.6kg reduction in body weight and a 6.6cm decrease in waist circumference and a significant increase in LTB4 and 20-OH- LTB4 in the weight loss group. Chapter Five continued to investigate the role of other arachidonic acid metabolites, 20-HETE and F2-IsoPs in the MetS and the effect of weight loss. In the case-control study (Human study 1), plasma and urinary 20-HETE and F2-IsoPs were significantly elevated in the MetS group, but no significant difference was found in stimulated-neutrophil 20-HETE. A significant gender x group interaction was observed in that women with the MetS had higher urinary 20-HETE and F2-IsoPs compared to controls (P&lt;0.0001). In a randomised controlled trial (Human study 2), relative to the weight-    maintenance group, a 4.6 kg loss in weight resulted in a 2 mmHg fall in blood pressure but did not alter the production of 20-HETE or F2-IsoPs. No significant differences were shown in 20-HETE released from stimulated-neutrophils before and after weight loss. 20-HETE and oxidative stress may be important mediators of cardiovascular disease risk in the MetS. Although a 4% reduction in body weight reduced BP, there were no changes in plasma or urinary 20-HETE or F2-IsoPs. In summary, in vitro studies show that human neutrophils and platelets can produce 20-HETE in response to Ang II and ET-1, and human studies demonstrate that the presence of MetS has a significant impact on arachidonic acid metabolism and effective weight loss can restore leukocyte synthesis of LTB4.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arachidonic acid -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome</field><field name="subject">Metabolism -- Regulation</field><field name="subject">Weight loss</field><field name="subject">Arachidonic acid metabolism</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome</field><field name="subject">20-HETE</field><field name="subject">Weight loss</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0065</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuromuscular-biomechanical outcomes of different types of resistance training on people with knee osteoarthritis</field><field name="creator">Heiden, Tamika Louise</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients have high levels of pain, functional and strength deficits of the quadriceps, decreased proprioceptive acuity, and increased co-contraction and knee joint loading in gait, compared to age matched controls. The increased knee joint loading in this population occurs most commonly in the medial tibio-femoral compartment, due to increased external adduction moments, and with increasing disease severity there is a concomitant increase in the knee adduction moments. A key finding within the knee OA literature is that dynamic loading in gait, due to increased external adduction moments, strongly predicts pain and radiographic disease progression. Current research has shown that exercise interventions reduce pain and time to complete functional activities; however, the effect of these interventions on knee joint loading and muscular activation in gait is still unclear. In addition, the need for specific knee joint strengthening to cause these alterations has not been investigated and it remains unknown if improvements occur due to specific muscle strengthening or due to some general effect of exercise. Therefore, the primary aim of this research study was to examine the effects of general (upper body) and specific (lower body) resistance training interventions on self-perceived outcomes, neuromuscular function and kinematic, kinetic and muscle activation during gait of OA patients compared with asymptomatic controls. ... The examination of gait data following exercise (Study 4) showed trends for changes in the muscle co-contraction ratios. Specifically, the medial/lateral co-contraction ratio (MLCCR) displayed a trend in early stance where the upper body exercise group increased their lateral muscle activity and the lower body group reduced their lateral muscle activity, and the medial/lateral hamstring co-contraction ratio (HAMCCR) displayed this same trend during loading. The trend toward reduced lateral muscle activation, following lower body resistance training, suggests that specific muscle strengthening may have the ability to alter the load distribution. The kinematic and kinetic variables of gait were unchanged by the exercise interventions, highlighting the sensitivity of muscle activation pattern changes due to muscle strengthening. This thesis provides new insights into the co-contraction strategies utilised by knee OA patients. The directed co-contraction strategy employed by knee OA patients and its relationship to the external adduction moment in gait suggest an attempt to redistribute the loading within the knee joint, most likely in response to pain. Further, we have separated the effects of exercise and found differences in self-perceived outcomes based on exercise specificity. This first examination into muscle co-contraction following resistance training of knee OA patients has highlighted the possibility of alterations to the co-contraction patterns following lower body exercise. However, the implications of altering this muscle activation strategy and the consequent effect on distribution of load within the knee joint requires further consideration.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Gait in humans</field><field name="subject">Human mechanics</field><field name="subject">Knee -- Diseases -- Exercise therapy</field><field name="subject">Knee -- Diseases -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis -- Exercise therapy</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Knee osteoarthritis</field><field name="subject">Gait</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0066</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeing and measuring the 2D face</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Susan</field><field name="description">This is a study of the factors that affect face shapes, and the techniques that can be used to measure variations in two dimensional representations of faces. The materials included thirty photographs of people in natural poses and thirty portraits that were based on the pose photographs. Visual assessors were asked to score the photographs and portraits in terms of pose (cant, turn and pitch) and also to compare the portraits to the photographs and score them in terms of likeness in the depiction of the face and its component features. Anthropometric indices were derived and used to score the images for the pose variables as well as for aspects of individual variation in external face shape and the spatial arrangement of the features. Geometric morphometric analysis was also used to determine the shape variation occurring in the photographs, the variation within the portraits, and to specifically discern where the portraits differ from the photographs in the depiction of head pose and individual differences in facial morphology. For the analysis of pose it was found that visual assessors were best at discerning the extent of head turning and poorest at discerning head pitch. These tendencies occurred in the visual assessments of both the photographs and the portrait drawings. For the analysis of the individual variation in face shapes it was found that external face shape varies according to upper face dimensions and the shape of the chin, and that vertical featural configurations are strongly linked to external face shape. When the portrait and photograph data were placed in the same geometric morphometric analysis the inaccuracies in the portrait drawings became evident. When these findings were compared to the visual assessments it transpired that, on average, visual assessment was generally congruent with the geometric morphometric analysis, but were possibly confounded by patterns of dysmorphology in the portraits that were contrary to what this study suggests are normal patterns of face shape variation. Overall this study has demonstrated that while anthropometric and visual assessments of facial differences are quite good, both were comparatively poor at assessing head pitch and tended to be confounded by the dysmorphologies arising in the portrait drawings. Geometric morphometric analysis was found to be very powerful in discerning complex shape variations associated with head pose and individual differences in facial morphology, both within and between the photographs and portraits.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropometry</field><field name="subject">Face -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Face perception</field><field name="subject">Morphology -- Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">Visual assessment</field><field name="subject">Geometric morphometrics</field><field name="subject">Anthropometry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0067</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation on the risk of viral infection in musculoskeletal grafts</field><field name="creator">Yao, Felix Caspar</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Around 50,000 hip and knee replacements are performed every year in Australia and this number has been increasing by around 13% annually since 1998 (Transplantation Society 2006). The incidence and number of revision surgery has increased by a similar proportion. Autogenous bone or allograft is still the gold standard grafting material and is currently used in a variety of reconstructive surgical procedures. The use of any allograft material carries with it the risk of transfer of disease from donor to recipient. These tissues can transmit the same viral and bacterial infections as blood, and the products of a single donation may be transplanted to several recipients. In contrast to blood, musculoskeletal tissues may come from surgical and cadaveric donation. Overall, the prevention of infection relies on the maintenance of rigid protocols for procurement, donor and allograft testing, secondary sterilisation, and the adherence to internal safety standards within the tissue banks. This thesis aims to determine the risk of viral infection among musculoskeletal tissue donors in Australia. We retrieved and analysed data retrospectively from three large tissue banks in Australia (Perth, Queensland, Victoria). This includes 12,415 musculoskeletal tissue donors, 10,937 of which are surgical donors and 1,478 of which are deceased donors, for the period of 1993 -2004. This data was analysed to determine the prevalence and incidence of viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) in musculoskeletal allografts. The results indicate that the risk of viral infection from musculoskeletal tissue transplantation in Australia is low. ... The results indicate that the overall prevalence of screened transfusion-transmitted viral infections did not vary significantly for musculoskeletal donors over the study period, despite falling in the general population and first-time blood donors. In tissue donors, HIV incidence significantly decreased over time, and HBV decreased significantly during 1999-2001; however, there was an apparent increase in the estimated incidence of HCV in 2002-2004 compared with earlier years. Furthermore the residual risk estimate of HIV in the period 2002-2004 has declined 5-fold compared to estimates in the period 1993-1995. This is perhaps due to greater awareness of high risk behaviours among donors, improvement in donor recruitment and an overall decrease in infection levels in the general population. Musculoskeletal tissue is second only to blood as the most frequent transplanted human tissue. Viral infection is a potential complication of tissue transplantation. In this thesis the rates of HIV, HBV, HCV and HTV infection in musculoskeletal donors in Australia were identified and then compared with results in published data from Canada, Scotland and the United States. The study also compared that result with first-time blood donors because they have satisfied similar donor selection criteria (Galea et al. 2006). The results indicate that prevalence and incidence estimates for viral infection in Australian tissue donors are higher than those in blood donors. This was also reported in studies from other countries. Accordingly, it is crucial that viral prevalence and incidence be monitored to evaluate the safety of tissue supply and to improve donor selection processes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bone transplantation</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus</field><field name="subject">HIV (Viruses)</field><field name="subject">HIV infections</field><field name="subject">Homografts</field><field name="subject">HTLV (Viruses)</field><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal system -- Surgery</field><field name="subject">HIV - Human Immunodeficiency Virus</field><field name="subject">HBV - Hepatitis B Virus</field><field name="subject">HCV - Hepatitis C Virus</field><field name="subject">HTLV - Human T Lymphotrophic Virus</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0068</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic-based sedentary behaviour among children within the family home environment : a descriptive study</field><field name="creator">Granich, Joanna</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This descriptive study identified correlates of electronic media use among pre-adolescent children (10-12 year olds). It specifically focused on the potential influence of individual factors and the social and physical environment within the family home setting. The prevalence of overweight/obesity in children is escalating. Sedentary behaviour in the form of electronic media use (comprised of television (TV) and video/DVD viewing, video and computer gaming, and computer use) is a contributing and a modifiable risk factor for overweight/obesity. To date, research focused on sedentary behaviour has been largely derived from physical (in)activity data where the absence or observed low levels of physical activity participation or TV viewing only has been used as a proxy for sedentariness. Little is known about the specificities of children's electronic media use; its impact on children's overall leisure and screen-time; and, the potential influencing factors that may operate at the home level. The family home is a context-specific setting where electronic media use is a daily practice for most children. To better understand electronic-based sedentary behaviour among children the following specific aims were addressed; 1) To describe children's leisure time, particularly time spent with electronic media. 2) To explore children and parents' perceptions about electronic-based sedentary behaviour. 3) To determine the prevalence of children's electronic-media use at home. 4) To examine the influence of individual, family social and home physical factors associated with different levels of electronic media use by children.  ...  The availability and accessibility of a variety of electronic equipment at home, especially in the child's bedroom (particularly among boys), was also associated with children's screen behaviour. Physical aspects of the family home (i.e., lay-out and yard size) had a mixed effect on children's electronic media use. Overall, the nature of electronic media use among children is complex and is influenced by dimensions that present at children's individual, family social and physical home level. The knowledge generated from this study about specific correlates of electronic media use has extended the understanding about its impact on children's discretionary time. Future prospective longitudinal research is warranted given that most studies investigating electronic media and sedentary behaviour are of cross-sectional design. Including other forms of sedentary behaviour such as sitting and talking with friends and family, reading and/or using telephones may provide a more comprehensive measure of sedentariness in the future. Further studies should use multivariate statistical analyses (i.e., modelling) to improve clarity of relationships between multiple variables and gauge mediating factors. This study also calls for future intervention research. Findings on gender-specific correlates of electronic media use provide superior information for the development of tailored behaviour modification strategies aimed at girls and boys respectively. Active involvement of household members in the intervention is also warranted. Utilising this study's findings may strengthen intervention outcomes towards a more directed and sustained behaviour change</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children -- Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Computers and children</field><field name="subject">Obesity in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Obesity in children</field><field name="subject">Television and children</field><field name="subject">Video games and children</field><field name="subject">Electronic media use</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Descriptive study</field><field name="subject">Sedentary behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0069</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of a long span bridge response to blast loading</field><field name="creator">Tang, Edmond Kai Cheong</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] As a consequence of the increase in terrorist incidents, many comprehensive researches, both experimental and numerical modelling of structure and blast interaction, have been conducted to examine the behaviour of civilian structures under dynamic explosion and its impact. Nevertheless most of the works in literature are limited to response of simple structures such as masonry walls, reinforced concrete beams, columns and slabs. Although these studies can provide researchers and structural engineers a good fundamental knowledge regarding blast load effect, it is more likely for blast load to act upon entire structures in actual explosion events. The interaction between blast load and structures, as well as the interaction among structural members may well affect the structural response and damage. Therefore it is necessary to analyse more realistic reinforced concrete structures in order to gain an extensive knowledge on the possible structural response under blast load effect. Among all the civilian structures, bridges are considered to be the most vulnerable to terrorist threat and hence detailed investigation in the dynamic response of these structures is essential. This thesis focuses on the study of the response of a modern cable-stayed bridge under blast loadings. ... Firstly, analysis is conducted to examine the failure of four main components namely pier, tower, concrete back span and steel composite main span under close proximity dynamic impact of a 1000 kg TNT equivalent blast load. Secondly, based on such results, the remainder of the bridge structure is then tested by utilizing the loading condition specified in the US Department of Defence (DoD) guideline with the aim to investigate the possibility of bridge collapse after the damage of these components. It is found that failure of the vertical load bearing elements (i.e. pier and tower) will lead to catastrophic collapse of the bridge. Assuming that terrorist threat cannot be avoided, hence protective measures must be implemented into the bridge structure to reduce the damage induced by explosive blast impact and to prevent bridge from collapse. As such, a safe standoff distance is determined for both the pier and tower under the blast impact of 10000 kg TNT equivalent. This information would allow the bridge designer to identify the critical location for placing blast barriers for protection purpose. For the case of bridge deck explosion, carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) is employed to examine in respect of its effectiveness in strengthening the concrete structure against blast load. In this research, appropriate contact is employed for the numerical model to account for the epoxy resin layer between the CFRP and concrete. In addition, to ensure that the CFRP can perform to its full capacity, anchors are also considered in the numerical study to minimize the chance of debonding due to the weakening of the epoxy. The results reveal that although severe damage can still be seen for locations in close proximity to the explosive charge, the use of CFRP did reduce the dynamic response of the bridge deck as compared to the unprotected case scenario. Further investigation is also carried out to examine the change in damaged zone and global response through variation in CFRP thickness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Long span bridges -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Blast effect -- Simulation methods</field><field name="subject">Cable stayed bridges -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Blast loads</field><field name="subject">Progressive collapse</field><field name="subject">Bridge damage</field><field name="subject">Protection</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0070</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is shaping the practice of health professionals and the understanding of the public in relation to increasing intervention in childbirth?</field><field name="creator">McAra-Couper, Judith P</field><field name="description">The increasing rates of intervention in childbirth are an issue for women, their families, health professionals, and society across much of the Western World. This study is a response to these increasing rates of intervention, as reflected in the research question: 'What is shaping the practice of health professionals and the understanding of the public in relation to increasing intervention in childbirth?'  The participants in the study were nine health professionals: midwives and obstetricians, who were interviewed individually, and thirty-three members of the public who took part in six focus groups.  The research was carried out under the umbrella of critical hermeneutics, and the particular approach used was that of critical interpretation as formulated by Hans Kogler.  This approach enabled a hermeneutical thematic analysis of that which is shaped (worldviews) and a critical structural analysis (discursive orders, social practices, relationships of power and structures of domination) of the shaping and shapers of practice and understanding. The research process facilitated by critical interpretation in identifying and describing the shaping and shapers of practice and understanding adds an important dimension to the statistical picture of increasing intervention that is of concern, both to health professionals and the public.  The research revealed that the everyday world and its associated processes of socialisation in the 21st century - in particular pain, choice, and technology - shape the practice of health professionals and the understanding of the public in relation to increasing intervention.  The study's findings were supported by the revelation that many of the social and cultural values, such as convenience, ease, and control, that underpin Western society in the 21st century, correlate with what intervention has to offer, which results in intervention being increasingly sought after and utilised.  This milieu of intervention, which increasingly surrounds childbirth, is shown to be calling into question those things that have traditionally been at the heart of childbirth: the ability of the woman to birth and the clinical skills of the health professional. This research provides insight and awareness of those things that are shaping understanding and practice and birth itself and creating a milieu in which intervention is increasingly normalised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intervention</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Caesarean</field><field name="subject">C-section</field><field name="subject">Epidural</field><field name="subject">Critical hermeneutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/323</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protecting management information systems: Virtual Private Network competitive advantage</field><field name="creator">Sirisukha, Sid</field><field name="description">Information security technologists and business scholars are motivated by a desire to understand how and to what extent the application of IT within enterprise systems leads to improved and secured organizational performance. An effective relationship between business and IT professionals is a primary determinant of success in gaining business advantage through the enterprise system. As business innovation has relied increasingly on partnerships between business and IT professional, a different perspective of how IT professionals view their organizational contributions was needed for organizations to remain competitive. Business knowledge is essential if IT professionals are to create linkages with other organizational units and have a wider perspective about business objectives, thus achieving fit between IT and organizational strategies. Organizations have started responding to this challenge by demanding more business acumen in their IT staff. The focus of this study is on the knowledge that is beyond that of independent business and IT only domain knowledge of information security. Therefore, technical areas of knowledge, such as hardware and software, all of which are closely associated with IT skills, are not discussed in this thesis. This is not to declare that such knowledge is not important. Clearly technical knowledge is part of the IT professional's overall information security technology expertise, but this study is about the organization proficiency of business and the IT professional, and is therefore interested in what enables business and IT professionals to apply their business domain and technical knowledge in ways that are beneficial to the organization and to act cooperatively with their customers and business partners. The purpose of this study is to employ the triangulation method to identify the theoretical links and empirically examine the association between business and IT perspective of information security. An important contribution of this study is the identification of business and IT perspectives on information security technology. By establishing the link between business and IT, the study focuses and evaluates Virtual Private Network (VPN) as an information security technology to find out if VPN can secure and gain competitive advantage by partisan business process and organization performance. This study articulates distinctive characteristics of Virtual Private Network and management processes that extend the range of applicability across diverse business segments. It distinguishes between business and IT and explains why the exploitation of a complementary set of related information security entities (such as VPN) across multiple functions create competitive vi advantages even across a diverse set of businesses that have limited opportunity to exploit business process and organization performance. The most important direct predictor of this study is a high level of communication between business and IT. However, one cannot mandate meaningful communication between individuals. IT people have to earn the right to play a meaningful role in management forums. Based on the findings from this study, one important way for an IT person to be heard is for him/her to devote the time necessary to create competitive advantage and develop shared domain knowledge, the most influential construct in the research model. An IT person needs to understand the leverage points of the industry, the history and current issues of the business units, and to learn to apply business oriented objectives in the application of technology to business problems. This change in view would help focus their attention on security technology and ideas that could produce the most benefit and create competitive advantage, rather than those that offer the most technical promise.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virtual Private Network</field><field name="subject">VPN</field><field name="subject">Competitive advantages</field><field name="subject">Management information system</field><field name="subject">Empirical methods</field><field name="subject">Descriptive methods</field><field name="subject">Interpretive methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/324</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preexercise strategies: the effects of warm-up, stretching, and massage on symptoms of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage and performance</field><field name="creator">Weerapong, Pornratshanee</field><field name="description">This thesis uncovers the rational and Romantic assumptions about the relationship between objects and identity that are embedded in occupational therapy, and critiques current practice from that perspective. It is based on an initial assumption that there is in fact a relationship between people's identity and the objects they make, have, use and are associated with. This assumption is explored through an interpretive examination of the fields of literature that are commonly identified as informing occupational therapy, supplemented by selected popular literature. The exploration takes a philosophical approach, guided by notions from philosophical hermeneutics, including pre-understandings, the hermeneutic circle and fusion of horizons. The conclusion reached is that people informed by Western philosophies interpret the identity meanings of objects in both rational and Romantic ways. To inform the study, the nature of rationalism and Romanticism are then explained, and the implications of these philosophical traditions in relation to objects and identity are teased out. This interpretation is guided by a history of ideas methodology, which entails approaching historical texts from a new perspective, in this case the identity meanings of objects. Thus informed, occupational therapy literature, primarily that published in Britain between 1938 and 1962 is examined from the perspective of objects and identity. What is revealed is that rational and Romantic understandings of objects, and of patients' and their own identity are clearly discernible. Such understandings afforded early occupational therapists both ways to organise their growing knowledge of the therapeutic application of crafts and the transformative outcomes of occupational therapy intervention. Gradually however, factors both internal and external to the profession served to undermine therapists' Romanticism. Primary amongst these were World War II, which saw a redeployment of occupational therapists from mental health to physical rehabilitation settings; advances in rehabilitative medicine, which brought a reduction in secondary complications and the adoption of teamwork; and the development of new practice areas including domestic rehabilitation using gadgets to enhance function and pre-vocational rehabilitation. As a result, tensions between rational and Romantic understandings crystallised around two long-standing controversies. These were whether or not craft equipment such as weaving looms should be adapted to serve specific remedial purposes, and whether it was the process of making a crafted object or the quality of the finished product that was more important. In the event, these contested ideologies became largely irrelevant as craftwork was sidelined from mainstream practice. With it, occupational therapists' Romantic vision of transforming people's lives through creative activity also slipped away. Several reasons for this loss of one of the profession's founding philosophies are proposed. They include the substantial absence of the professions' philosophical foundations from its education, and the paucity of theory and research methodologies that might have informed the nature and process of transformative change that earlier occupational therapists had observed and reported. The thesis concludes by arguing for the importance of recovering a balance between rationalism and Romanticism. A call to action is issued, addressing change in educational practice, concerted research effort to identify and articulate transformative processes within occupational therapy, and political action focusing on the inclusion of Romantic perspectives within policy and strategic documents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stretching exercises</field><field name="subject">Massage</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Sports injuries</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="subject">Injuries prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' motivation to learn, academic achievement, and academic advising</field><field name="creator">Henning, Marcus A</field><field name="description">Numerous models of academic advising address the complex nature of student retention and attrition. Most tend to ignore the subtleties of implementing motivational and self-regulatory changes associated with academic advising. This present study investigates the learning experiences of university students and their use of academic advising. The research incorporates an educational model as its primary investigative lens, namely Hirsch's (2001) multiple intervention model. The study further examined critical areas of learning and advising, specifically motivation, self-regulation, academic difficulty, and academic achievement.This research was conducted at a New Zealand university and comprised of three studies. In the first study, 14 participants were interviewed about their academic problems, readiness for study and use of learning and study strategies. In the second, a total of 317 participants completed a demographic survey and two questionnaires measuring aspects of motivation and self-regulation. In the third study, 147 participants completed follow-up self-report questionnaires. The mixed-paradigm analyses were twofold. Study 1 utilised a meaning-centred approach to classifying and understanding the interview responses. Studies 2 and 3 incorporated multivariate and categorical statistical procedures.Interview narratives from Study 1 suggested that students experiencing academic difficulty tended to voice more problems, to be less ready for study and to be more avoidance oriented than students not experiencing academic difficulty. In Study 2 students indicating low motivation levels for study had more self-perceived problems in the areas of concentration, self-monitoring, use of educational materials and developing time management than students with higher motivation levels. In addition, students with academic difficulty appeared to have more problems with motivation and use of study material than students with no evidence of academic difficulty. Students' motivation levels tended to vary over time indicating that students may perceive their rationale for study as an unfixed or malleable entity. Student attitude at the beginning of the academic semester significantly predicted grade outcome. Motivation and self-regulation response measures obtained immediately prior to the examination period, however, were unable to predict end-of-semester grade averages. In Study 3 completion of short group-based study skills programmes appears to have a link with end of semester grade average, but there were no significant shifts in measures of motivation and self-regulation. Students accessing one-to-one academic advising services were usually students with higher levels of motivation for study. The use of one-to-one academic counselling, however, was not determined by academic difficulty.Overall, the studies contribute a systematic and integrative process of investigating the area of academic advising. The research highlights the importance of goal orientations and students' initial perceptions about the value of their course of study in relation to academic achievement and in reference to the seeking of academic assistance from academic advising services. The findings suggest that although Hirsch's (2001) model provides a valuable framework to investigate ways students study and learn, it requires additional refinement especially in areas of categorisation and application before it can be confidently endorsed. The findings also indicate that academic advisory services provide a valuable service for students in terms of academic achievement, but further research is required in the areas of cultivating motivation and self-regulation changes, and especially in the area of affect development. Finally, the study confirms the worth of mixed-paradigm research and the need for more in depth research in the multifaceted world of academic advising.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">Self-regulation</field><field name="subject">Academic advising</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/326</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soft systems analysis of ecosystems</field><field name="creator">Shanmuganathan, Subana</field><field name="description">This research is a case study evaluation of the use of self-organising map (SOM) techniques for ecosystem modelling to overcome the perceived inadequacies with conventional ecological data analysis methods. SOMs provide an analytical method within the connectionist paradigms of artificial neural networks (ANNs), developed from concepts that evolved from late twentieth century neuro-physiological experiments on the cortex cells of the human brain.  The rate and extent at which humans influence environmental deterioration with commensurate biodiversity loss is a cause for major concern and to prevent further degradation by human impact, parsimonious models are urgently needed.  Indeed, the need for better modelling techniques has never been so great.  Ecologists and many national and international bodies see the situation as 'significantly critical' for the conservation of our global ecosystem to foster the continued wellbeing of humanity on this earth.The thesis investigates and further refines SOM based exploratory data analysis methods for modelling naturally evolving, highly diverse and extremely complex ecosystems. Earlier studies provide evidence on SOM ability to analyse complex forest and freshwater biological community structures at limited scales.  On the other hand, growing concerns over conventional methods, their soundness and ability to model large volumes of data are seen as of little use, leading to arguments on the results derived from them. Case study chapters illustrate how SOM methods could be best applied to analyse often 'cryptic' ecosystems in a manner similar to that applied in modelling highly complex and diverse industrial system dynamics.  Furthermore, SOM based data clustering methods, used for financial data analysis are investigated for integrated analysis of ecological and economic system data to study the effects of urbanisation on natural habitats.SOM approaches prove to be an excellent tool for analysing the changes within physical system variables and their effects on the biological systems analysed.  The Long Bay-Okura Marine Reserve case study elaborates on how SOM based approaches could be best applied to model the reserve's intertidal zone with available numeric data.  SOM maps depicted the characteristic microclimate within this zone from ecological monitoring data of physical attributes, without any geographical data being added.  This kind of feature extraction from raw data is found to be useful and is applied to two more case studies to study the slow variables of ecosystems, such as population dynamics, and to establish their correlation with environmental variations.   SOM maps are found to be capable of distinguishing the human induced variations from that of natural/ global variations, at different scales (site, regional and global) and levels using regional and global data.  Hence, SOM approaches prove to be capable of modelling complex natural systems incorporating their spatial and temporal variations using the available monitoring data, this is a major advantage observed with SOM analyses.In the third case study, potential use of SOM techniques to analyse global trends on the effects of urbanisation in environmental and biological systems are explored using the World Bank's statistical data for different countries.  Many state and international institutions, concerned over global environmental issues, have made attempts to develop indicators to assess the conditions of different ecosystems.  The enhancements with SOM approaches against the currently recommended indicator system based on information pyramid and pressure-state-response (PSR) models are elaborated upon.The research results of SOM methods for ecosystem modelling, similar to that applied to industrial process modelling and financial system analysis show potential. SOM approaches (i.e. cluster, dependent component, decision system and trajectories/ time series analyses) provide a means for feature extraction from the available numeric data at different levels and scales, fulfilling the urgent need for modelling tools to conserve our global ecosystem.  They can be used to bridge the gap in converting raw data into knowledge to inform sustainable ecosystem management.  Increasingly, traditional methods based on Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) designs and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) are seen to be unsuitable for ecological data analysis, as they are unable to detect human induced environmental impacts from that of a natural cause.  This thesis proves that SOM techniques could be applied to modelling not only a natural systems complexity but also its functioning and dynamics, incorporating spatial as well as temporal variations, to overcome the constraints with conventional methods as applied in other stated disciplines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biotic communities</field><field name="subject">Ecosystem management</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/327</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand travel agents in the internet era: impacts, responses, and relationships</field><field name="creator">Garkavenko, Vladimir</field><field name="description">The impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is a significant issue in today's tourism industry. The development of the internet has made information easily accessible to consumers, and has therefore established a direct link between consumers and suppliers. As a result, traditional travel distribution channels are changing rapidly. A major feature of this change is "disintermediation", with principals such as airlines, hotels and rental car chains bypassing intermediaries and sell directly to consumers. Travel agents (TAs) are considered to be particularly vulnerable to this process. ICTs have the potential to replace their core competencies, which include transaction processing (ticketing and settlement) and information provision (raw product information provided by suppliers).This thesis focuses on the impact of ICTs on the TA sector, and specifically on the New Zealand TA case. A theoretical approach based on regulation theory  combined with a mixed method approach was used to investigate the main issues in New Zealand. The research included a case study to identify the principal issues and trends in the TA sector, in-depth interviews with TAs and industry specialists to refine the main issues and allow the formulation of some theoretical assumptions, in-depth interviews with consumers regarding the role of TAs in the internet era and the quality of service they provide, and a fully-structured, national on-line survey of TAs to verify the assumptions made in the earlier interviews and test the applicability of the post-Fordism model for the New Zealand TA sector.Based on the findings, it is argued that disintermediation is particularly pronounced in the relationship between airlines and travel agents. To minimise the risk of disintermediation and improve business performance, TAs need to reposition themselves and review their core strategies to compete efficiently in the changing business environment. The thesis reveals that consumers perceive TAs as mainly "transaction facilitators". Nevertheless the thesis show that process of "reintermediation" is a reality for some New Zealand TAs.An application of regulation theory to the New Zealand TA case reveals that in its traditional form, the regulation theory cannot explain the complexities found in the modern TA environment. The thesis reveals several distinct modes in TA perceptions of their business environment and their survival strategies, which indicates a heterogeneous, clustered population. A "formula for success" is developed for TAs in New Zealand. In this respect, TAs that perceive ICT as a strategic tool and are orientated towards consumers appear to have a business advantage.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Travel agency</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Information and communication technology (ICT)</field><field name="subject">Tourist bookings</field><field name="subject">Direct sales</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/328</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">There's no meaning in chocolate: a narrative study of women's journeys beyond the disruption of depression</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Jan D</field><field name="description">Professional treatment, mainly medical and psychological, dominates research and clinical practice concerning women and their recovery from depression. This thesis challenges the assumption that women cannot be 'experts' actively involved in their own recovery. This study explored the narratives of eighteen women in Aotearoa New Zealand whose lives had been seriously disrupted by depression. They had found ways other than, or in addition to, professional solutions that helped them to live undisrupted meaningful lives. 	The research used a narrative inquiry approach informed by authors from across the social sciences including Arthur Frank, Jerome Bruner and Rivka Tuval-Mashiach. The underpinning social constructionist understanding of depression is informed by the work of Jane Ussher and Janet Stoppard. The women whose individual narratives provide the core data for the study ranged in age from 32 to 70 years at the time they told their stories. Their lives had been disrupted by depression at different times during the last 50 years of the twentieth century. Five of the women met as a group with the researcher as the analysis began, and their ideas informed significant aspects of the conclusions.	The women had all experienced major depressive disorder, although this was not always formally diagnosed. Their recovery had involved a range of responses from outside the professional mainstream including physical, mental, social and spiritual aspects. Each woman had sought and found a 'formula' that was 'right' for her. The narratives showed all the women talked of their experience with depression and recovery in an holistic and contextualised way. They all talked about 'chocolate' solutions which provided symptom relief, and 'deeper' and often more complex sets of solutions which enabled them to discover or re-discover meaningful ways to live. Meaning-making often involved growing spiritual or transpersonal awareness in the broadest sense. A surprising finding was that the patterns of recovery were not related to the severity of the depression at the worst time. Rather, it emerged that the ways the women talked about their recovery journeys mirrored their stories of the 'jolly good reasons' why they were depressed; the more complex and lengthy the story leading up to the worst times, the more complex the formulae required for recovery. 	The implications of the research for clinical practice and for policy makers are that depression and recovery need to be seen as gendered, contextualised, and holistic. Women need opportunities to discover and take advantage of a range of 'things' so that they can find their own 'right formula' for recovery. This formula may involve professional treatment including anti-depressant medication and psychological therapy, but it is likely to involve many other things as well. This study challenges the notion that recovery needs to be guided by a professional expert, and creates hope for women being able to learn from each other's experiences.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative inquiry</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Women's recovery</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Lay solutions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/329</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of brief-intermittent hypoxic exposure on high-intensity kayaking and cycling performance</field><field name="creator">Bonetti, Darrell</field><field name="description">Adaptation to the shortage of oxygen at altitude (hypoxia) promotes physiological changes which could enhance endurance performance.  Consequently, altitude training has become a popular practice among competitive endurance athletes. Since its inception, the live-high train-low paradigm (LHTL) has been widely regarded as the most effective approach to altitude training. Over the past decade, brief intermittent simulation of LHTL via the use of hypoxic inhalers and re-breathing devices has gained increased popularity, but the evidence supporting their use is limited and conflicting. The experimental studies in this thesis investigated the response of sea level exercise performance and related physiological measures following adaptation to the usual and a novel protocol of brief intermittent hypoxia.  I intended to perform all experimental studies on flat-water kayakers.  Therefore, an initial requirement of this thesis was to establish the smallest worthwhile effect in performance for this sport. The final study utilising a meta-analytic approach was conducted to compare the effectiveness of brief intermittent hypoxia to other natural and simulated protocols, and to investigate the topical issue of what physiological responses mediate performance changes following hypoxic exposure.  In Study 1, the typical variation in competitive performance of elite flat-water canoeists was investigated using a repeated-measures analysis of race times.  For individual flat-water canoeing events, the smallest worthwhile change in performance time was ~0.5%. In two separate experimental studies, adaptation to 60 min per day of brief intermittent hypoxia consisting of alternating 5 min intervals of hypoxia and normoxia for 3 weeks (5 days per week) using a nitrogen filtration device resulted in clear enhancement of endurance performance (~5%) for kayakers (Study 2) and cyclists (Study 3). Clear enhancements in repeat sprint performance were observed for kayaking only. The physiological mechanisms underlying performance changes were unclear.  Modification of the hypoxic and normoxic intervals (Study 3) did not result in any clear alterations in performance or physiological mechanisms.  The meta-analysis (Study 4) revealed clear enhancements in endurance power output of 1-3%  in sub-elites following adaptation to hypoxia with the natural altitude protocols, and with two of the artificial-altitude protocols (LHTL-long and LHTL-brief-intermittent). In elite athletes the enhancements tended to be smaller and were clear only for the natural protocols.

Hermeneutics methodology is used to guide the research design and the interpretation of evidence.The findings of this study suggest that Uganda's community-led HIV/AIDS initiatives operate within a "bottom-up" accountability framework, characterized by the community taking a role in budgeting, program implementation, reporting, project-oversight, and audit activities. In regard to accounting practices, this study reveals that Ugandan community projects use basic and simple accounting procedures. The findings suggest that simple communal accountability mechanisms can compensate for the types of formal control mechanisms typically promoted within NPM-style reforms. The findings also suggest that multiple accountability relationships can operate in the form of both hierarchical and lateral accountability practices and that these multiple accountability relationships lead to tighter control and accurate accountability, even though formal accountability mechanisms may be weak.This study identified some challenges for community-led service delivery initiatives, including the potential for corrupt practices in some community groups and variations in the level of participation of group members in the execution of various tasks. Further, several areas for further research have been identified. These include the measurement of social capital within community groups and the establishment of measures of group capacities.This study has revealed the latent accountability technology of a "bottom-up" communitarian accountability framework and demonstrated its potential as a complement to NPM models of service delivery and accountability. As an accountability innovation, it needs to be keenly watched as further field experiences emerge over time and reveal more of its potential in developing countries, and perhaps beyond.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uganda</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">Social capital</field><field name="subject">Accounting practice</field><field name="subject">Pubic sector reform</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/331</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uncovering "regimes of truth": locating and defining discourses associated with hydro-electric development in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wells, Philippa Katherine</field><field name="description">This thesis reveals and explores a history of the New Zealand present, providing insight into myths through which New Zealanders shape their perceptions and relationships with the world that surrounds them, and interrogating the concepts that support those myths. This myth referred to is a regime of truth based on perceptions of environmental responsibility, embodied in language, policy, actions, and incorporated into official discourse through imagery, an international government-driven advertising campaign portraying a "100% Pure New Zealand" and institutionalisation. There is a Department of Conservation, a Ministry for the Environment, National Parks and Reserves and a Resource Management Act based on a fundamental principle of sustainable management. Popular discourse also recognises environmental values - hence the appearance of concerted public and media campaigns against proposed development of coastal and timbered areas and the survival of lobby and pressure groups based on environmental causes such as opposition to genetic modification and the alienation of areas considered of natural significance. However, a study of relevant strains of discourse in the New Zealand environmental context reveals ruptures and reversals, inconsistencies and contradictions. The focus and meanings within discourse have changed; the position and power of the environment has been both affected by, and has affected, power relationships. At certain times and in particular social conditions, an environmental voice has been compelled to occupy a space on the outskirts of a dominant discourse and to comply with its discursive practices, as a way of gaining legitimisation. At others, an environmental discourse has gained a fleeting triumph, to be privileged as truth. From the official outset of European colonisation in 1840, a discourse grounded in such modernist values as technological optimism, economic progress and capitalism both framed and legitimised utterances of the colonists and grounded decisions that were to fundamentally and permanently affect the New Zealand physical environment. Themes that were to echo through the years in such discursive enunciations as acclimatisation and engineering were justified on the basis of "progress". Such themes included the presumption that "man" and fulfilment of "his" needs was the ultimate dictate, and that this could and would be achieved through scientific discovery and its application through engineering and arts. Only through such a pursuit could civilisation advance onwards and upwards along a never-ending path. Within such a discourse, Nature had no distinct or valid domain outside that of man, but was merely a storehouse of raw materials, to be dipped into by Man when and where desired. One of the most significant manifestations for New Zealand in the twentieth century of this modernist discourse has been the development of hydro-electricity. The availability of the necessary technology in a country boasting plentiful rainfall, numerous fast-flowing rivers, pockets of population and a tradition of socialist, centralist political philosophy shaped hydro-electricity as a metaphor for New Zealand-style civilisation - enabled and controlled through government decision-making. Consequently, a genealogical study of the discourses relating to hydro-electricity policy and debate can provide valuable insight into the power relations between those exercising power through a modernist discourse and an environmental resistance, and into strategies that were adopted or developed as part of such discourses in the exercise of power. In particular, a detailed study of specific examples permits the interplay of socio-temporal factors and practices to be appreciated. Hydro-electricity is thus the contextual focus selected in this thesis, a focus reflected in the title. The genealogical method involves uncovering and contextualising primary and secondary materials within their historical setting. Through the interrogation of such materials this approach contributes to a critical understanding of power relations and how those relations influence strategies that might be utilised in the exercise of power. Such a method was therefore selected to analyse the tensions implicit in discourse within three historically and contextually specific case studies. These case studies involved in chronological order the proposal to harness the waters of the Bowen Falls in Fiordland during the 1920s, the proposal to raise the level of Lake Manapouri (together with that of the neighbouring Lake Te Anau) in the 1960s, and finally the proposal to divert a large proportion of the mean water-flow of the Lower Waitaki river during the first part of the twenty-first century. A principal conclusion that is reached through the analysis is that the present environmental discourse in New Zealand is not the inevitable outcome of progressive and logical history. Nor can it be explained as chance or as a consequence of world changes, but is a function of power/knowledge. Changes in the regime of truth are therefore the outcome of a successful power strategy exercised by a resistance in challenging that regime of truth. In addition, what might be defined as "environmental discourse" in the New Zealand context is narrowly defined, limited by environmental cause, a cause shaped in turn by the language of conservation. The lesson from history is that the regime of truth of such a discourse is not an end, stable and unchanging for the future, but must be seen rather as brittle, uncertain and vulnerable to attack. A third conclusion that emerges from the hydro-electricity focus is that this particular discursive enunciation of a New Zealand-style modernist discourse was a metaphor for social and economic progress, thereby occupying a privileged position as truth. Finally, one of the important contributions to methodological debate made by the thesis lies in its application of the Foucauldian genealogical method in exploring the general history of a socio-temporal context, thereby uncovering power strategies effected through discourse. This in turn reveals the hidden events, the silent voices and the games played in establishing and challenging a regime of truth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydroelectric power plants</field><field name="subject">Environmentalism</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/332</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The poetics of making</field><field name="creator">Ho, King Tong</field><field name="description">This is a practice-led research project that seeks to explore the cross-cultural aesthetics and conceptual ideas of an art project. I position myself as an art practitioner who intends to apply the Western modes of technological advancement of digital imaging and ink jet technologies to the substrates used by traditional Chinese artists for ink painting and calligraphy, usually called Xuan Zhi [&#23459;&#32025;]. Through this process, the aesthetics and conceptual ideas of both cultures will be explored, examined, analysed and interrogated for the potential development of a new aesthetics in the context of digital art. There are three major components in this research project; a creative document in the form of a collection of artwork, an exegesis and a collection of documentation. The creative document will be a body of visual image-based artwork that includes a series of collateral works from the ongoing research and practice of the project. It is the negotiated output of a potentially new aesthetics in digital art, specifically in the context of digital still imaging and digital printmaking. The exegesis is an analytical and critical commentary that places the creative document in relevant theoretical, philosophical, cultural and historical contexts. The documentation is a collection of the ongoing empirical practice of ink jet technology on Xuan Zhi. The visual physical form of both the exegesis and the documentation are also included as part of the creative document.

The potential for improvement in human health by the use of internet-based sources of information is potentially huge, as knowledge becomes more widely available, at much lower cost. Medical information has traditionally formed a large part of academic publishing. However, the increasing volume of available information, along with the demand for evidence based medicine makes Internet sources of information appear to be the only practical source of comprehensive and up-to date information. The aim of this work is to develop a system allowing groups of users to identify information that they find useful, and using those particular sources as examples develop an intelligent system that can classify new information sources in terms of their likely usefulness to such groups. Medical information sources are particularly interesting because they cover a very wide range of specialties, they require very strict quality control, and the consequence of error may be extremely serious, in addition, medical information sources are of increasing interest to the general public. This work covers the design, construction and testing of such a system and introduces two new concepts - document structure identification via information entropy and fuzzy ontology for knowledge representation. A mapping between query terms and members of ontology is usually a key part of any ontology enhanced searching tool. However many terms used in queries may be overloaded in terms of the ontology, which limits the potential use of automatic query expansion and refinement. In particular this problem affects information systems where different users are likely to expect different meanings for the same term. This thesis describes the derivation and use of a "Fuzzy Ontology" which uses fuzzy relations between components of the ontology in order to preserve a common structure. The concept is presented in the medical domain. Kolmogorov distance calculations are used to identify similarity between documents in terms of authorship, origin and topic. In addition structural measures such as paragraph tags were examined but found not to be effective in clustering documents. The thesis describes some theoretical and practical evaluation of these approaches in the context of a medical information retrieval system, designed to support ontology-based search refinement, relevance feedback and preference sharing between professional groups.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicine</field><field name="subject">Computer network resources</field><field name="subject">Medical telematics</field><field name="subject">Medical informatics</field><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/334</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The efficacy and microstructure effects of insider trading regulations</field><field name="creator">Gilbert, Aaron</field><field name="description">The competition for external capital amongst small and developing financial markets has resulted in a growing awareness of the importance of investor protection laws if markets are to be competitive. One particularly important aspect of such laws is the need to control the behaviour of insiders. Insider trading, widely perceived as trading by investors who have an unfair advantage by virtue of access to confidential information, represents a significant threat to market confidence and investors' willingness to invest in the market. For small markets therefore, not controlling such behaviour represents a significant cost in terms of the development of the market and the economy as a whole. However, while insider trading can do significant harm to the market, it also has the potential to be beneficial to the market as a signal of incorrectly priced information. The question becomes therefore how best to balance the advantages and disadvantages of insider trading. Most markets have relied on regulations to control insiders, however, little research has been done to establish if this is effective.This thesis seeks to provide additional evidence with respect to the role of regulation in controlling insider trading. The issue is explored within the context of the New Zealand market where recent legislation, the Securities Market Amendment Act 2002, offers a prime opportunity to seek further understanding on the issue. In particular, four studies focussed on the role of regulation with respect to insider trading are undertaken within this thesis. In the first the impact of the law change on the profitability and informational base of insiders is examined. A significant decline in profitability is observed in addition to evidence of a change in the informational basis of insiders' trades from knowledge of upcoming announcements to short-term market mispricing. The impact of the new law on four aspects of the market is then examined. A significant increase in liquidity is found following the introduction of the new law, as well as significant reductions in the cost of equity, bid-ask spread and return volatility. The law therefore appears to have improved these aspects of the market. The bid-ask spreads were then examined in more depth by observing the impact of the laws on the cost of informed trading. Strong evidence of a decline in the cost of informed trading was observed, along with significant decreases in the proportion of the spread composed of information asymmetry costs. The declines were largest for those firms most prone to insider trading.Lastly, the elements of an effective insider trading regime were investigated by examining the impact of various legal variables on the cost of informed trading and the total spread. The results indicated that stronger laws have resulted in lower spreads and less informed trading costs, and that effective regimes should prevent insiders passing on their information, should rely on financial penalties over criminal sanctions, and should be both enforceable and policed by a strong public regulator. Overall this thesis finds strong evidence that insider trading laws can be effective in controlling the behaviour of insiders, and that well drafted statutory regulations can be of significant benefit to the market.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Securities Market Amendment Act 2002</field><field name="subject">Insider traders</field><field name="subject">Securities</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/335</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A philosophical critique of the best interests test as a criterion for decision making in law and clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Godbold, Rosemary P</field><field name="description">The best interest test is the legal mechanism which governs decision making on behalf of adults who lack the capacity to make their own health care treatment decisions. The test has attracted considerable criticism from health professionals, academics, judges and lawyers for being ill-defined and non-specific. The question of what is meant by 'best interests' remains largely unanswered. As a consequence, the test gives medical and legal decision makers considerable discretion to apply their personal value judgements within supposedly value-free philosophical frameworks - unreasoned and opaque decision making processes are the inevitable result. Because of the dominance of supposedly value-free philosophical frameworks, the place of values in decision making is not always fully understood. Reasoning is not possible without values, which stem from our emotions and passions, our upbringing, our religion, our cultures, our processes of socialisation and from our life experiences. Values help us make sense of our daily lives.  I argue that law - like any other social institution - is essentially a human, values based construct. I put forward a theory of values-based law which argues for the recognition that laws, rules and conventions are based on, and contain, individual values. Currently, medical and legal decision makers justify grave decisions on behalf of society's most vulnerable citizens without revealing, or even acknowledging the values which drive and inform their decisions. Any opportunities to scrutinise or debate the values driving decisions are lost. Ultimately, values-based law argues that values underlying best interest determinations must be exposed to facilitate honest, transparent and fulsome decision making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. By applying the theory of values-based law, supposedly value-free decision making processes are exposed as insufficient to facilitate fulsome, honest and transparent legal reasoning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophical analysis</field><field name="subject">Bad faith</field><field name="subject">Kuhn</field><field name="subject">Scientific revolutions</field><field name="subject">Objectivism</field><field name="subject">State of nature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/336</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibration of branched circular cylindrical shells as applied to airway walls</field><field name="creator">Au, Pui Ming</field><field name="description">This research focuses on investigating the vibration characteristics of branched circular cylindrical shells with applications to airway passages.

It focussed specifically on the concept of user satisfaction, the construct of cognitive style as applied to users and systems analysts, and their interrelationships. Prior studies were found rarely to investigate the changes in user satisfaction during system usage. Further, any reference to cognitive style in the IS literature proved to be sparse, open to question and discouraging in terms of its value. By developing and using a new instrument, the System Satisfaction Schedule, or SSS, the present study was able empirically to demonstrate clear patterns of changing user satisfaction during system usage. These were demonstrated, both as a general trend and in terms of its relationship to the cognitive styles of the key players (analyst and user) involved in system development and maintenance. Cognitive style was measured using Kirton's Adaption-innovation Inventory, or KAI. This study was thus able to suggest new rules for system development based on the assessments of the cognitive styles of both users and systems analysts. These rules focussed primarily on simple team choice: which analyst to put with which user. However, inferences for larger system development teams were drawn and suggestions for further research duly made. The present study thus also contributes to the successful practice of system development. To give effect to the above, this study set out to investigate empirically the way user satisfaction changes over 1&#189; to 2 years of system usage and, as mentioned above, the way user satisfaction is impacted by the cognitive styles of the user and the systems analyst. Most significantly, relationships were studied between user satisfaction and the difference in cognitive style between the analyst and user. It was found that user satisfaction generally rises linearly with usage, and that while the size of the analyst user cognitive differential does negatively impact user satisfaction over most of the time of system use, this effect is only particularly strong for two short periods; one within the first four months of usage and the other in the last three. From these results the new rules for system development mentioned above, followed. In terms of the decline of users' mean perceived severities of individual problems, the exponential decay and reciprocal models were found to fit the data the best. This study developed a new model for the motivation to use, develop or maintain a system (the Mechanical Model), based on its own results and Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation. In this, Herzberg's hygiene factors have been replaced with the concept of dissatisfiers. These are measured as expressions of dissatisfaction as and when they occur. Their use removes the researcher's need, when designing user satisfaction instruments, to speculate on complete lists of factors which may satisfy users, and which may date as technology and other contextual factors change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">User interfaces (Computer systems)</field><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">Information technology - Management</field><field name="subject">Information Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/338</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing, contesting and consuming New Zealand's tourism landscape: a history of Te Wairoa</field><field name="creator">Bremner, Hamish</field><field name="description">The thesis focuses on documentation regarding the historical growth of tourism at Te Wairoa, Rotorua, New Zealand. Te Wairoa acted as a gateway to Otukapuarangi and Te Tarata of Rotomahana which represented an iconic tourism landscape in the nineteenth century. A theoretical engagement with tourism studies and the utilisation of history as an analytical device reveals that the consumption of the tourism landscape is an ongoing, contested, and negotiated cultural construction of place.The history of tourism development at Te Wairoa exhibits the entrenchment of European colonial power in New Zealand. However, within the structures of colonial authority, strategies of survival for the colonised are employed. In this particular case, the strategies include the engagement with Western ethics of capitalism, the manipulation and appropriation of symbols of the 'other', and the control of access through land ownership. The economic and social development of Te Wairoa, based on a tourism economy, also highlights the existent tensions in both a colonial and post-colonial relationship in New Zealand.The research further argues that individual tourism sites reflect culturally ascribed values associated with place. As the combination of exogenous and endogenous social, cultural, political and economic forces evolve so to does the production and consumption of the tourism landscape. Evidence for these considerations is provided by publicly available historical material including archival documents, historical literature, contemporary accounts, newspapers, and government records. The result is an in-depth study which provides an original and thematic interpretation of the history of Te Wairoa as well as supporting a model for investigating change in the cultural construction of place.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/339</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling of an electroactive polymer hydrogel for optical applications</field><field name="creator">Paxton, Robert Alan</field><field name="description">In this work a finite element model is proposed to describe the swelling of poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels under the influence of an external electric field. The specific application of this model is for optical applications, but the design could be used equally well for other applications such as sensors and actuators.The model is proposed as five individual modules, which work in conjunction with each other but which can also function independently. This independence allows the model to provide intermediate results to the user, and also permits each module to be improved or adjusted individually without affecting the operation of the overall model. The first module is the Electrical module, which calculates the external electric field present in the hydrogel by solving Laplace's equation. The second module is the Chemical module, which uses the electric field to calculate the diffusion and migration of ions through the hydrogel/solvent regions. The third module is the Force module, which uses the change in ion concentrations to calculate the resulting change in osmotic pressure (force). This force is then used in the Mechanical module to calculate the deformation of the hydrogel, based on the assumption of linear elasticity. Finally, the fifth module is the Optical module, which uses the deformation to calculate the theoretical change in focal length.To verify the operation of the model, numerous experiments were conducted with the deformation of a poly(acrylic acid) hydrogel being measured under various external voltages with different electrode configurations. Overall, the model agrees quite well with the experimental results, but also highlights some interesting discrepancies that will need to be considered in future work. There is also some scope for improvement in the experimental method used, but again this is left for future work.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="subject">Polymer colloids</field><field name="subject">Ophthalmic lenses</field><field name="subject">Colloids</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/340</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Within the web: the family/practitioner relationship in the context of chronic childhood illness</field><field name="creator">Dickinson, Annette R</field><field name="description">This study explores the phenomenon of the relationships between practitioners and families who have a child with a chronic illness.  Using a heremeneutic phenomenological method informed by the writings of Martin Heidegger [1889-1976] and Hans-Georg Gadamer [1900-2002], this study provides an understanding of the meaning of 'being in relationship' from the perspective of both families and practitioners.Study participants include ten family groups who have a child with a chronic illness and twelve practitioners from the disciplines of nursing, medicine, dietetics, physiotherapy and speech therapy who work with children with chronic illness.  Narrative audiotaped interviewing was the means by which the participants told their stories about times that relationships worked well and when they did not.  These stories uncover the every day realities of 'being in relationship' and provide another understanding of the relationship between family and practitioner.The findings of this thesis suggest that chronic childhood illness 'throws' families and practitioners together into a web of relationships that must work for the sake of the child.  The relationship is primarily conducted between adults.  Children are usually excluded.  In order to understand and manage the child's illness, practitioners and families 'go around' and act 'in-between' relationships.  While the quality of the relationship from the family perspective is not essential to the chronic illness journey, relationships are more successful when practitioners recognise the uniqueness of each family web.  The nature of the relationship is often simple, yet it co-exists with complexity.  This thesis proposes that a 'companion relationship' between practitioners and family may offer a more effective and satisfying way of working.  It also challenges practitioners to consider the voice of children within health care relationships.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chronic diseases in children</field><field name="subject">Parent and child</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Professional-Family Relations</field><field name="subject">Chronic Disease</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/341</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acid hydrolysis of neutral glycosphingolipids</field><field name="creator">Nardan, Denise</field><field name="description">Blood group glycolipids are important tools in the study of microbial receptor interactions and other biological phenomena. Presently blood group glycolipids of interest are isolated from biological samples. However, all glycolipids are not readily available due to the low frequency of some phenotypes in the general population. The ability to acquire the rare glycolipids from the degradation of common glycolipids would be a useful alternative to trying to obtain the molecules from biological sources.This research set out to establish the ability of blood group glycolipids to be degraded into useful glycolipids in a controlled manner by acid hydrolysis and possibly metal catalysis. The initial experiments investigated the degradation/hydrolysis of the more readily available glycolipid globoside with a range of salts and acids to establish degradation concepts such as; temperature, type of acid, acid concentration, and the role of metal ions in glycolipid degradation. These concepts then led to a series of degradation experiments with the blood group glycolipids Leb and ALeb. These glycolipids were incubated with a range of acid concentrations and varying temperatures. Thin layer chromatography separation and chemical and immunochemical staining were the main methods used to identify the products of degradation.It was established that metal ions were not directly involved in the catalysis of glycolipids in the short-term, however some metal ions were indirectly implicated in their degradation due to their ability to form acid solutions. Acid hydrolysis was established as the principle mechanism for glycan chain degradation. In general it was found that the glycan chain primarily lost its fucose groups (in no particular order) and was then followed by sequential degradation of the remaining glycan chain. The glycan chain also appeared to have a protective function on the ceramide moiety.  Degradation of globoside established a simple sequential pathway of glycan chain reduction from the non-reducing end. Blood group glycolipids ALeb and Leb first lost their fucose side groups followed by sequential reduction of the glycan chain. Although not fully controllable, degradation of Leb was able to produce Lea, Led and Lec. In contrast degradation of ALeb did not produce any Lea or Led. Instead A-type 1 and two novel A-like structures, 'linear A' and 'GalNAc-Lea' were generated. Lec was only produced from ALeb in extremely acidic conditions. This research established the ability to generate, by acid hydrolysis, a range of rare and "unnatural" novel glycolipids from more commonly available structures. It is of interest that the so-called unnatural glycolipids obtained from the acid hydrolysis of ALeb may, in theory, occur naturally in the acid environment of the stomach, and as such could have the potential to be implicated in disease. It is probable that by applying the principles learned here, a range of novel and natural structures suitable for use in the study of biological interactions can be obtained.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acid hydrolysis</field><field name="subject">Glycosidic bonds</field><field name="subject">Lewis blood groups</field><field name="subject">Fucose</field><field name="subject">glycolipids</field><field name="subject">A Lewis b</field><field name="subject">Lewis b</field><field name="subject">Lewis c</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/342</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Balancing recognition and disrespect: recovery as the process of identity formation: a New Zealand study of how services shape recovery from sexual abuse</field><field name="creator">Frerichs, Gudrun</field><field name="description">This study explored how the recovery of victims of sexual abuse is shaped by services available. Using the philosophical underpinnings of critical theory within the framework of Honneth's recognition theory this study provides an understanding of participants' experiences and views of recovery from sexual abuse. The study was conducted with ten adult survivors of sexual abuse using semi-structured individual interviews and two focus groups with eight service providers. The analysis identified that the recovery from sexual abuse is the development of a positive sense of identity reflected by participants' self-confidence, self-respect, and self-esteem. In this study this is described as the process of identity formation. Services shaped recovery from sexual abuse by providing experiences of recognition and disrespect. Recognition was given in the form of emotional support and care, cognitive respect, and social esteem that led to an improvement of participants' functioning. Disrespect was perceived by participants as they struggled with the invisibility of sexual abuse, with inequality, and with the lack of understanding, through which their overall functioning deteriorated. Recovery emerged as a dynamic process that, most of all, required from services that they provide experiences of recognition and from survivors that they accurately perceive that recognition was given to them. For recovery to occur, participants needed to balance experiences of recognition and disrespect, a process in which they needed to surrender the longing for the entirely good and benign caregiver and accept that both 'good' and 'bad' qualities reside in each caregiver, agency, therapist, or generally the 'other'.  This balancing resulted in the development of self-confidence, self-respect, and self-esteem. Recovery was experienced by participants when they were able to resist disrespect and either engaged in fighting for their rights or removing themselves from situations in which their rights could be violated. Only by having a practical experience of being able to protect their physical and psychological integrity did participants become aware that they had recovered from the legacies of sexual abuse and could proceed with their lives without professional assistance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical theory</field><field name="subject">Service provision, Treatment, Psychotherapy, Mental health</field><field name="subject">Recognition theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/344</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talking pictures: a creative utilization of structural and aesthetic profiles from narrative music videos and television commercials in a non-spoken film text</field><field name="creator">Ings, Welby</field><field name="description">This thesis is about storytelling. It is presented in three parts, a major output with two supporting components. The first and primary section is the short film. The second is an exhibition of images, props, and environments created for the work. The third is the exegesis. Situated as creative practice, the project tests and develops structural and aesthetic hypotheses in the creation of a non-spoken film text. These hypotheses are shaped by considerations from two areas.The first is design for narrative music video. An analysis of selected texts leads to a creative reconsideration of the role and profile of imagery, space, time, sound, enigma, closure, and narrative voice. The second area is typography. Reflecting on the anti-language, bogspeak, and the culture that has given rise to its development, the thesis develops inaudible typographical voices that operate as narrative contributions to the film.These two areas of consideration support a unique way of telling stories. This is significant because emerging uses of short film now take these texts beyond the theatre. They are marketed as commercially available stories in their own right. As distribution companies are formatting them on DVDs, viewers are seeing these stories not once, but many times. It is useful therefore, for the design of such texts to consider alternative methods of narration that might work to preserve the durability and complexity of their stories as they unravel over repeated screenings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Storytelling</field><field name="subject">Graphic arts</field><field name="subject">Short films</field><field name="subject">Homosexuality, Male</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/346</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power relationships within a corporate finance department: a Foucauldian approach to corporate hierarchies and resistance</field><field name="creator">Garland, Angela M</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis investigates power relationships within a corporate Finance Department employing a Foucauldian approach to explaining corporate hierarchies and resistance and the implications.Research was conducted in the form of a case study and observation of a corporate finance department, referred to as the 'Finance Department', at the 'Company', referred to as such for confidentiality purposes. The Company is a large Dutch based mail and logistics entity that operates internationally across over 200 countries and has its corporate head office just outside of Amsterdam. The Company's Finance Department was in the throws of change, particularly around hierarchies as a result of the reengineering process with the purpose of creating efficiencies. The aim of the research was to evaluate the power relationships that existed within the hierarchies between management and workers who worked either for the Finance Department or closely with it, and to analyse the outcomes of these power relationships in terms of resistance.The case study is a Foucauldian insight into the different individuals who worked either within the Finance Department or closely with it, with an evaluation of their roles and how their differing power structures impacted upon the workflow within the Finance Department.The outcome of this research is an evaluation of those individuals and their relationships at a particular point in time, which was impacted by so many different factors. The research could give readers an understanding of power relationships and framework for contextual Foucauldian evaluation.The significance of the contribution arising from this particular piece of research is that it involves the combination of a case study method with a Foucauldian perspective. The combination of these two elements allows the research to be done both from the top down and also from the bottom up. Increasing in use as a research tool (Hamel, 1992), the case study contributes uniquely to our body of knowledge of individual, organisational, social and political phenomena (Yin, 1994). The Foucauldian perspective plays an important part in terms of an understanding of power, despite the fact that it is often difficult to fully comprehend the meanings behind Foucault's work (McHoul &amp; Grace, 1993).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glass ceiling</field><field name="subject">Business hierarchy</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured interviews</field><field name="subject">Interpretive approach</field><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/347</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of trade liberalisation on economic structure and performance: case of the OECS</field><field name="creator">Samuel, Thomas</field><field name="description">In keeping with global liberalisation trends and impelled by external liberalisation in terms of eroding preferential treatment in their principal export markets, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)1 together with the wider Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) region, has since 1993 embraced a policy of trade liberalisation as a strategy for growth and development. In large measure this was done through the phased implementation of a Common External Tariff (CET) involving a progressive lowering of tariff rates over the period, 1993-1998. The theoretical arguments in support of this policy change are based on the assumption of a positive link between trade liberalisation and economic growth. They contend that trade reforms that increase the outward-orientation/openness of trade regimes would result in structural change that reallocate resources in line with comparative advantage leading to exportled growth. This will then be followed by faster economic growth as countries benefit from efficiency gains, technology spillovers and other positive externalities.The thesis empirically assesses these claims against the nature of the impact of trade liberalisation on: (i) the export structure of the OECS and (ii) its economic growth performance. Using a comparative analysis in a dichotomous framework of ten-years before and after the policy reforms we find that in general the predictions of the underlying neo-classical trade model are not supported by the empirical evidence. There were indications of structural changes in exports in terms of reduced specialisation and competitiveness of traditional sectors and a steady shift of the macro-economy away from commodity production both agriculture and manufacturing towards services. Meanwhile the evidence suggests a revenue-neutral fiscal impact and no indication of systematic increase in technology transfer over the post-reform period.Using alternative estimation specifications in a single or simultaneous framework with and without fixed effects in a panel data setting, trade liberalisation was repeatedly found to be negatively associated with growth. In contrast openness was found to be positively correlated with both growth and export performance. At best a J-curve type impact of trade reforms on economic growth is deduced suggesting a long period of adjustment. However prospects for sustained growth seem remote on current indications suggesting the need for a reform of the international trade rules to cater to the special needs of LDCs and SIDS. In this pursuit a plausible alternative approach to the mode of implementation of trade liberalisation in is presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/348</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intellectual capital reporting in New Zealand: refining content analysis as a research method</field><field name="creator">Steenkamp, Natasja</field><field name="description">This study examines voluntary intellectual capital reporting (ICR) in New Zealand firms' annual reports, with a view to contributing to understanding ICR practice. This study also reflects on content analysis with a view to refining the methodology when applied to investigating ICR.The literature includes widespread claims that intellectual capital (IC) resources are important value drivers and assets, and that IC information should be reported externally. However, complexities relating to identifying IC prevent it from being recognised as an asset under current accounting regulations. Consequently, the traditional financial reporting system is being criticised as out-of-date, giving deficient and irrelevant information, and having lost its value relevance. Numerous scholars have investigated voluntary ICR in several countries, but have presented different results and findings. The literature argues that the results of many ICR studies cannot be meaningfully compared because inconsistent data collection instruments have been applied. To advance ICR research, further refining and developing of the methodology is advocated; problems relating to applying methodological issues need to be resolved. Moreover, to establish consensus about ICR, more research and evidence is needed concerning exactly what and how IC is reported.The 2004 annual reports of the 30 largest (by market capitalisation) New Zealand firms listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange were analysed. Content analysis was applied to determine what and how IC is reported. Inferences about what IC is communicated were made based on an analysis of the content of texts and visual representations. To determine how IC is reported, voluntary reporting was categorised according to the form, nature and location of the disclosure. Frequencies of mention were recorded. Hence, each incidence of occurrence was coded and counted.This study reflected on content analysis methodology by searching the literature for guidance on how to apply this approach and how to deal with the challenges and problems it poses. The thesis discusses methodological issues that could be applied differently, and hence hinder the replicability and comparability of ICR studies. Moreover, the ICR literature provided limited guidance about how to deal with methodological challenges and problems, and revealed an absence of explicit recording instructions. Therefore, explicating this study's recording instructions should enhance replicability and comparability of future ICR research and hence further refine the methodology.Some results of this content analysis study disconfirm those of prior research: New Zealand firms show high levels of ICR, the most reported IC category is human capital, and the most reported IC item is employees. In line with prior research, this study showed that most ICR is presented in declarative terms. Moreover, more than one-third of New Zealand firms' ICR is disclosed as pictures. This indicates the importance of pictorial information as a means of reporting IC and the need to include graphics when conducting ICR research. This study's findings also indicate a narrative approach, similar to the European notion of story telling, to voluntarily report IC information. This approach suggests that narratives have possible potential for voluntary ICR, as an approach that departs from a measurement and quantification approach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual capital reporting</field><field name="subject">ICR studies</field><field name="subject">Voluntary reporting</field><field name="subject">Accounting regulations - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Content analysis methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/349</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transport-related physical activity, health outcomes, and urban design: descriptive evidence</field><field name="creator">Badland, Hannah M</field><field name="description">Environments that support physical activity (PA) engagement are now seen as an important part of the solution for accumulating daily physical activity which confers health benefits, particularly transport-related PA (TPA). Despite this recognition, understanding the determinants of health-related PA has traditionally focused on identifying associations between the social environment and non-specific PA domains. As such, prior to commencing this thesis little was known about the relationships between the built environment and overall PA engagement within the New Zealand context. Little was also known about associations between TPA attitudes and behaviours, and urban design. This research sought to overcome this paucity of knowledge by investigating associations between overall PA and TPA engagement and perceptions, health outcomes, urban design, and socio-demographic variables from a public health perspective. The body of research was initiated with two literature reviews that formed the context for the following six empirical chapters. Data in the empirical chapters were drawn from three self-report surveys using adult samples. The research commenced by examining associations between urban design and overall PA engagement, and then narrowed towards TPA-specific relationships. TPA relationships were identified through the development and implementation of a reliable survey that captured associated behaviours and attitudes. Several new findings were drawn from this body of work. Overall, 21% of adults recognised they could replace automobile journeys on at least two days per week, and walking was deemed an acceptable travel alternative. Adult TPA engagement levels were low; 7% commuted to place of work/study and 32% travelled to the convenience shop by TPA modes. Furthermore, when compared with those who commuted to an occupation by TPA, respondents who used motorised travel were less likely to be classified as active (odds ratio (OR)=0.5) and be of normal body mass index (OR=0.5). No significant health relationships existed for convenience shop travel. As well, 4% of adults reported no automobile availability. When this group was compared with those with unrestricted automobile availability, they were less likely to be classified as active (OR=0.3), but were more likely to engage in TPA modes to access destinations (occupation, OR=6.3; convenience shop, OR=9.8). Occupation-related commute distances also revealed interesting findings. Overall, 50% of respondents perceived they could, and 10% of the sample actually did, commute by TPA modes for distances less than five kilometres, and relationships were strongly mediated by distance. Other urban design variables were objectively assessed with TPA engagement for occupation-related commute distances less than five kilometres. Those who travelled along the most connected street networks were more likely to engage in TPA modes (OR=6.9) when compared with respondents travelling along the least connected networks. No relationships were found with other urban design variables and TPA engagement.This research substantially contributes to this research area by identifying associations between overall PA and TPA engagement and perceptions with urban design. It is likely that shifting the perceptions of adults who recognise they can employ TPA modes, into actual TPA engagement will result in promising population health gains. Future PA initiatives with adults should consider promoting walking for transport as a sustainable solution. A lack of TPA interventions is evident; however, methodological issues need to be resolved before developing such initiatives. Although strategies aimed towards changing perceptions may be valuable for future TPA interventions, it is likely macro-scale urban design modifications (e.g., improved job-housing balance, highly-grained street networks) and legislation (e.g., automobile restrictions) will have the greatest success for increasing TPA engagement in the adult population.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">adults</field><field name="subject">built environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/350</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family factors in bilingual children's code-switching and language maintenance: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">Yu, Shanjiang</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to investigate family factors in relation to young Chinese immigrants' code-switching and language maintenance. Specific attention is given to children's code-switching behaviour and how parents respond and the effect of parental response upon children's language choice in any subsequent utterance. Attempts are also made to identify the family factors that might have an effect on making language choice. Data were collected monthly through naturalistic tape-recording of families' conversations for one calendar year. Recordings of every other month were transcribed and coded for analysis. A questionnaire was used with the children's parents to obtain general family background information as well as to compare the parents' language beliefs and their actual language behaviour in real life.Results indicated that within an average of 28.1 months of stay in New Zealand, the use of Mandarin Chinese, their ethnic language, was dramatically reduced. In typical family conversations, the parents were using Mandarin Chinese in only 75.6% of their conversational turns and that figure for the children was 65.1%. If the amount of mother tongue use at home is an indicator, then the speed of shift in these families investigated appears to be relatively fast. Few parents, however, felt that their children were using too much English or ever attempted to stop them doing this, despite the fact that all the parents claimed that they very much wanted their children to maintain the ethnic language and were fully aware of the importance of their role as the main input source of their ethnic language. This seems to suggest that the marketplace value of the mainstream language is overtaking the core value of their ethnic language.Results also showed that parental use of English caused a substantially increased use of English from their children. There tended to be an "upgrading" towards English in the children's language choice suggesting that code-switching could be a temporary stage for the children along the gradual process of language shift. On the other hand, the parents were also found using more English after their children's code-switching. One of the reasons for this might be that the parents want to improve their English and regard their children as an ideal person to practise English with.With regard to daily communication functions, results showed that children often resorted to English for daily speech acts indicating that language function replacement has occurred for many daily communicative functions resulting from a gradually reduced use of the ethnic language.Many family factors were found to be affecting language use in the families: the presence of grandparents and the decision to return to their birth country for residence in the future were clearly correlated with increased use of the ethnic language; the parents' level of English language, on the other hand, was found to be related to the amount of English used, though with exceptions.These results strongly suggest that English is taking over the family domains that used to belong to the ethnic language. Parents who want their children to maintain their ethnic language need to put daily effort into action. Without painstaking daily effort, language shift will and probably is happening no matter how strong their theoretical beliefs might be.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language maintenance</field><field name="subject">Chinese language</field><field name="subject">Bilingualism in children</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Foreign Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/351</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of simulated altitude exposure on sea level performance</field><field name="creator">Hinckson, Erica</field><field name="description">Exposure to natural altitude using the "live high-train low" method improves athletic endurance performance at sea level by 1-2%. This method can also be employed with hypoxic devices that simulate altitude, but there is limited and conflicting research on their efficacy. Consequently, three studies were undertaken to investigate changes in sea level performance of endurance runners following exposure to altitude simulated with hypoxic tents. The device was chosen because of its potential for incorporation into the athlete's routine. In Study 1, 10 runners received altitude simulated with hypoxic tents (~9 h overnight at 2500-3500 m) and trained at sea level, while 10 runners in the control group performed usual training. Athletes in both groups performed a lactate-threshold test, but only the altitude group performed a run to exhaustion. The effect on  4-mM lactate speed was unclear, owing to poor reliability of this measure. There was a 16% increase in time to exhaustion in the hypoxic conditioning group, equivalent to a 1.9% (90% likely limits, &#177;1.4%) increase in speed in a time trial. Effects on performance were not apparent four and eight weeks after use of the tents. To improve precision of the effect of the tents and to determine the effects on performance of different durations, a further controlled trial was performed. A reliability study (Study 2) was first conducted to investigate the potential for runs to exhaustion to provide reliable measures of performance. Eight runners performed a test consisting of three runs to exhaustion lasting ~2, ~4 and ~8 min on six occasions over 14 wk. The critical power and log-log models were used to provide factors for converting variability in time to exhaustion into variability in equivalent time-trial time. Variabilities in time to exhaustion expressed as coefficients of variation for predicted 800-3000 m timetrial times were ~1-3%. A crossover study (Study 3) was then conducted in which 11 athletes performed usual (control) training and usual training with altitude exposure by using tents for 25 &#177; 3 days (mean &#177; SD) for 8.1 &#177; 0.6 h.d-1, progressing from a simulated altitude of 2500 m to 3500 m above sea level. Washout period between control and altitude treatments was four weeks. Performance was assessed with treadmill runs to exhaustion as in Study 2. Improvements in mean predicted times (altitude-control) for standard competition distances of 800, 1500 and 3000 m derived from the runs to exhaustion were 1.0% (&#177;1.3%), 1.4% (&#177;1.2%) and 1.9% (&#177;1.5%) respectively. There was some evidence that hypoxic exposure favoured those athletes carrying the I allele for angiotensin converting enzyme. In summary, the main finding from the series of studies is that hypoxic tents are likely to enhance sea level endurance running performance by ~1-2%.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Altitude, Influence of</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/352</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethical issues and workplace problems in commercial hospitality: a New Zealand study</field><field name="creator">Poulston, Jill Mabel</field><field name="description">This study explores a world of pretence and glamour, uncovering and explaining the causes of workplace problems and dubious practices lying behind the cheerful facade of commercial hospitality. Such an exploration necessarily extends into unethical, unsafe and unfair practices, eight of which are selected for detailed analysis. These are: working in smoke, sexual harassment, constructive dismissal, staffing levels, training, illegal alcohol service, poor food hygiene, and theft. Some of these problems or practices are deliberately destructive (and are therefore considered as ethical issues), some can cause harm (so are health and safety issues), and some concern the way staff are managed (and are therefore labour issues). The persistent focus however, is the avoidable harm and wrongdoing that can occur where groups of people are controlled by a few. Several themes are explored, in particular the causes of poor ethical standards and management's influence on these standards. The hypotheses address the behaviour of hospitality workers generally, but managers in particular, as they are ultimately responsible for workplace conduct, and are therefore best placed to make change. Ethical standards are investigated by measuring the actual and perceived incidence, tolerance and management acceptance of problems according to individuals' demographic attributes. The combination of quantitative and qualitative data enables a thorough and scientific analysis of practices in a domain well known for persistent social problems, with the specific intention of identifying causes, and therefore solutions. The following hypotheses are examined: H1) Unethical behaviour is common in hospitality; H2) Management is aware of unethical behaviour in hospitality; H3) Management actively or passively supports unethical behaviour in hospitality, and H4) Management's support is a cause of unethical behaviour. Although unethical practices are found to be common, many managers are unaware of this, while some are significant causes of sexual harassment, constructive dismissals and poor standards of training. Observations include the influence of codes of ethics on undesirable behaviours such as sexual harassment, the influence of social consensus on workplace behaviour, and the profound unhappiness of many hospitality employees. The causes of workplace problems and unethical behaviour are found to be low pay and poor training. A principle of reciprocated loyalty is proposed, based on the relationships identified between employer commitment and employee behaviour, and informed by mechanism theory, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This is the first major analysis of workplace issues in New Zealand hospitality, and offers solutions to problems such as theft, sexual harassment and understaffing, that significantly undermine the industry's credibility and potential for success.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/353</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate social responsibility in Islam</field><field name="creator">Mohammed, Jawed  A</field><field name="description">Notions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have been suggested to be consistent with an Islamic view of society. Indeed, values and principles that have been central to Islam since the time of the holy Prophet Mohammed (Peace and Blessings be upon him) may serve as a foundation for notions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) similar to those in the West. Much contemporary discussion of CSR, however, has not recognized this. These discussions have largely been based on a Western orientation informed by Western religious values. Moreover, CSR has evolved literally in response to particular issues or problems that are specific to businesses in a Western context. This led to a lack of a comprehensive global context within which a wider perspective of CSR should be positioned. On the other hand, the notion of social responsibility and justice has been an integral part of Islamic society for nearly 14 centuries. However, the Islamic literature remains scattered, fragmented and lacks a coherent framework that would allow such a concept in Islam to be systematized. While Islamic philosophy is rich in precepts pertinent to CSR, these precepts have not yet been formally synthesized to present a systematic model with an explicit notion of CSR in Islam. Thus, there exists a gap in both the Western and Islamic literature. This was fruitfully exploited in this study to advance the understanding of the concept of CSR in a wider cultural and religious setting. This study explored this new territory and presented a conceptual framework of CSR in Islam based on Shariah (the Islamic legal and social system) derived from the holy Qur'an and Hadith. It provided both, a counterpart and a comparable base in the study of various issues relevant to CSR and international business from a much wider global perspective. It also provided significant insights into Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh) regarding business practice. The consistency of the conceptual framework of CSR in Islam with contemporary business practices was explored using a survey of Islamic banks located in different parts of the world. The survey revealed that many current practices of Islamic banks mirror the expected behaviours or practices generated in the Islamic framework. In fact, it was possible to discern that the organizations surveyed implement the Islamic code of conduct rather extensively. Against this background, a consistency with the framework of CSR in Islam presented in this study was identified. Such consistency, however, was driven by legal requirements in adherence to Shariah rather than an explicit understanding or pursuit of CSR. The lack of a systematic framework with explicit notions of CSR from an Islamic perspective caused hindrance in implementing CSR practices in Islamic organizations. It follows that this study was a modest step towards filling this lacuna by presenting a systematic and coherent framework of CSR in Islam.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic ethics</field><field name="subject">Islamic banking</field><field name="subject">Empirical survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/354</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te hau ora o naga kaumatau o Tuhoe: a study of Tuhoe kaumatau mental wellness</field><field name="creator">McNeill, Hinematau</field><field name="description">Tuhoe is considered to be one of the last bastions of 'traditional' Maori language and culture. The main purpose of the research was to examine the mental health status of Tuhoe kaumatua (elderly). Even before the research was undertaken anecdotal evidence indicated that a significant feature of the Tuhoe aging population was the apparent absence of mental health problems. Kaumatua are however particularly susceptible to physical diseases that afflict modern Maori, regardless of geography or tribal origin. To explore the health status of Tuhoe kaumatua, the study needed to take into account external cultural influences and, in particular, the colonial experience. This justifies a comprehensive theoretical approach that includes European philosophical influences which, it will be argued, have impacted on Maori lifeways.  Notwithstanding, the study draws principally on Maori conceptualisations of the world, mainly because kaumatua mental wellness was considered to be inextricable to Tuhoe language and culture. The research attempted to isolate those factors that sustain kaumatua mental wellness. In determining the causal factors of wellness it soon became apparent that the practice of traditional Maori healing, embedded in ancient esoteric knowledge, was of considerable significance. This feature is apparent from the outset. The opening karakia of the Tuhoe tohunga (specialist/healer), Hohepa Kereopa invokes ancient Maori atua (Gods) and endows the work with an aura of spiritual protection. He has stipulated that both the karakia (prayer) and mihi (greeting) remain in Maori (Tuhoe dialect) because he believes that the essence of these rituals are best preserved in the Maori language.  Throughout this entire body of work Hohepa Kereopa maintains a discernible and enduring presence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Tuhoe (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kupu</field><field name="subject">Kaumatua</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/355</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accruals: signalling or misleading? Evidence from New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Koerniadi, Hardjo</field><field name="description">Studies on earnings management usually hypothesise that managers manage accruals opportunistically. Few studies however, argue that managers can also use accruals to improve the value relevance of reported earnings to help investors better assess the firm's operating performance. While substantial evidence on managers' opportunistic behaviour on accruals has been documented in the literature, empirical evidence on the informativeness of accruals is scarce and inconclusive. The purpose of this thesis is to examine whether managers use accruals to communicate private information regarding the firm's operating performance, or as reported in the literature, use them for their own benefit.  This thesis finds that on average, firms reporting high earnings accompanied by high accruals have significantly negative subsequent period stock returns suggesting that these firms manage their accounting earnings. Focusing on stock dividend issues as an incentive to opportunistically increase accruals, the results are found to be consistent with the earnings management hypothesis. Stock dividend issuing firms are reported to significantly increase accruals in the issue year followed by poor earnings and stock price performances in the subsequent year. Moreover, discretionary accruals of the issuing firms are negatively correlated with both future earnings and abnormal stock returns. This evidence attempts to complement the earnings management literature. The analysis on the incentive to decrease accruals related to share repurchases, however, does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that managers use their discretion to decrease accruals. To investigate the hypothesis that managers use accruals to convey information regarding their firm's future profitability, this thesis employs the contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements as the research setting. This choice was made to increase the likelihood of detecting the use of accruals as private information communication while simultaneously mitigating the likelihood of the opportunistic income smoothing hypothesis to explain the results. The evidence strongly indicates that managers use both accruals and dividend increases as their private information communication regarding their firm's future profitability. Dividend increasing firms report positive accruals which are positively correlated with future profitability. This finding contributes to the literature by providing evidence on the accrual signalling hypothesis. Overall, the results of this thesis suggest that, depending on the incentives, managers can use the discretion accorded under the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in estimating accounting accrual, either to manage accruals opportunistically or to help investors better assess the firms' operating performance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accruals</field><field name="subject">Earnings management</field><field name="subject">Signalling</field><field name="subject">Business finance</field><field name="subject">Market performance</field><field name="subject">Cross sectional Jones model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/360</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The philosophy and practice of holistic health care</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Deborah Ann</field><field name="description">For almost three decades 'holistic health care' has been a widely invoked term. It is called upon as an antidote to mechanistic science, as justification for the use of alternative therapies, as instruction to good practice and even as a boundary marker in establishing professional identity. In the service of these intentions it has assumed various meanings. The first aim of this study is to identify from the literature, the illusion of shared meaning that saturates this term and to expose the implications of this lack of clarity. The elusive nature of the meanings attributed to holism and the problem of determining an appropriate method of pursuing these meanings is addressed. A particular understanding of conceptual analysis and practical reasoning are defended as adequate tools. The group of ideas from which the term holism can be distinguished, individualism, dualism and reductionism, form the context of the examination of understandings of wholeness. Eight distinctions of wholeness are examined and the common conceptual feature of 'purpose' is suggested. This requires considerable justification which is provided by an exploration of the notion of 'partness'. Recourse to the seminal work of Smuts (1926) is sought and the derivation of the idea of holism from evolution theory is explored. A key understanding explored is the nature of emergent properties and their role in the holistic doctrine, 'the whole is more than the sum of the parts'. Employment of the word holism in social science, philosophy, and biology is examined and a number of fallacies about holism exposed. With a somewhat clearer understanding of holism, and a working notion of wholeness, theories of health are discussed as contenders for a philosophical basis for 'holistic health care'. While several show some congruence, it is argued that the Foundations Theory of Health can be shown to demonstrate the characteristics of work for wholeness identified in this work. The conclusion that holistic health care is in essence working creatively with incipient wholes, is explained and justified by a discussion about how a health worker might become more holistic in her practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holistic medicine</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/361</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inclusive education a decade after democratisation: the educational needs of children with disabilities in KwaZulu-Natal</field><field name="creator">Maher, Marguerite</field><field name="description">Commitment to a single, inclusive education system has been the aspiration of reform in education in a democratic South Africa. The dilemma facing the democratically elected government was to write educational policy which, when translated into practice, would improve the educational standards offered to students in impoverished schools while at the same time allow the maintenance of the high standards achieved in schools which had been privileged under the apartheid system. There was, furthermore, the challenge of providing a curriculum that would be meaningful to students from diverse backgrounds bearing in mind the socio-historical moment within which education found itself.Research on inclusive education in the developed world has been extensive. There has been less research completed in developing world countries. Situated in the Pietermaritzburg area of KwaZulu&#8208;Natal (KZN), South Africa, a developing world country, participants in the current study were parents of children with disabilities, aide workers, regular and special educators, managers who made decisions affecting the education of these children, and the children themselves. The research is positioned in the theory of interpretivism which provided the opportunity to give a voice to the participants, to interpret how they made sense of their world. The methodology used was qualitative description with an evaluation component. Qualitative description allowed the discovery and understanding of "a phenomenon, a process, or the perspectives and worldviews of the people involved" (Merriam, 1998, p. 11). Data are presented so that the participants' point of view could be understood and made explicit (Artinian, 1988). Using qualitative description, this current study explored the beliefs about disability and inclusive education specifically of stakeholders in the education of disabled children. The evaluation component provided the means of ascertaining the extent to which disabled students were having their educational needs met, and the extent to which the policy ideals of inclusive education, as articulated in White Paper 6 (Department of Education, 2001), were being achieved.Inclusive education in this present study is viewed as a multifaceted construct which shares a reciprocal relationship with various theoretical determinants. The determinants considered in the present study are (a) concept of other, (b) disability discourse, (c) equity, (d) reconceptualist/incrementalist approaches to inclusive education, and (e) prerequisites for regular and special educator buy-in.Findings revealed that there was evidence of inclusive education beginning to be implemented in KZN in that barriers to learning for many students were being addressed and removed. The specific provision in policy documents directed towards children with disabilities was behind schedule, however, and there was little evidence of full inclusion of students with disabilities in regular education. Reasons for this were multiple and were explored in relation to criteria at a macro- and micro-level, distilled from the literature, which seem to be necessary for the successful inclusion of students with disabilities.The most significant macro-level factors were (i) the legacy of apartheid and the democratic process, moving towards a liberal democracy, still being in progress; (ii) the discourse around disability espoused by the majority of the population resulting in high levels of ostracism of the disabled; and (iii) the disabled becoming lost in the wide definition of need in the barriers to learning approach to inclusive education.The most significant micro-level factors were (i) regular educators being reluctant to embrace the inclusive education initiative because of problems they had encountered with another recent initiative, the implementation of Outcomes Based Education; (ii) special educators fearing for their students if they were to be included without the requisite preparation and support; and (iii) some parents lacking the efficacy to access education of any sort for their disabled children.These macro- and micro-level findings exist within a multifaceted array of factors, an intricate web of nuances and complexity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inclusive education</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">Democratisation</field><field name="subject">Disability discourse</field><field name="subject">Interpretive paradigm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/362</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between objects and identity in occupational therapy: a dynamic balance of rationalism and romanticism</field><field name="creator">Hocking, Clare</field><field name="description">This thesis uncovers the rational and Romantic assumptions about the relationship between objects and identity that are embedded in occupational therapy, and critiques current practice from that perspective. It is based on an initial assumption that there is in fact a relationship between people's identity and the objects they make, have, use and are associated with. This assumption is explored through an interpretive examination of the fields of literature that are commonly identified as informing occupational therapy, supplemented by selected popular literature. The exploration takes a philosophical approach, guided by notions from philosophical hermeneutics, including pre-understandings, the hermeneutic circle and fusion of horizons. The conclusion reached is that people informed by Western philosophies interpret the identity meanings of objects in both rational and Romantic ways. To inform the study, the nature of rationalism and Romanticism are then explained, and the implications of these philosophical traditions in relation to objects and identity are teased out. This interpretation is guided by a history of ideas methodology, which entails approaching historical texts from a new perspective, in this case the identity meanings of objects. Thus informed, occupational therapy literature, primarily that published in Britain between 1938 and 1962 is examined from the perspective of objects and identity. What is revealed is that rational and Romantic understandings of objects, and of patients' and their own identity are clearly discernible. Such understandings afforded early occupational therapists both ways to organise their growing knowledge of the therapeutic application of crafts and the transformative outcomes of occupational therapy intervention. Gradually however, factors both internal and external to the profession served to undermine therapists' Romanticism. Primary amongst these were World War II, which saw a redeployment of occupational therapists from mental health to physical rehabilitation settings; advances in rehabilitative medicine, which brought a reduction in secondary complications and the adoption of teamwork; and the development of new practice areas including domestic rehabilitation using gadgets to enhance function and pre-vocational rehabilitation. As a result, tensions between rational and Romantic understandings crystallised around two long-standing controversies. These were whether or not craft equipment such as weaving looms should be adapted to serve specific remedial purposes, and whether it was the process of making a crafted object or the quality of the finished product that was more important. In the event, these contested ideologies became largely irrelevant as craftwork was sidelined from mainstream practice. With it, occupational therapists' Romantic vision of transforming people's lives through creative activity also slipped away. Several reasons for this loss of one of the profession's founding philosophies are proposed. They include the substantial absence of the professions' philosophical foundations from its education, and the paucity of theory and research methodologies that might have informed the nature and process of transformative change that earlier occupational therapists had observed and reported. The thesis concludes by arguing for the importance of recovering a balance between rationalism and Romanticism. A call to action is issued, addressing change in educational practice, concerted research effort to identify and articulate transformative processes within occupational therapy, and political action focusing on the inclusion of Romantic perspectives within policy and strategic documents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Identity (Philosophical concept)</field><field name="subject">Rationalism</field><field name="subject">Romanticism</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/363</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Somatic and cognitive stress management techniques: their effect on measures of stress and competency in managers</field><field name="creator">Le Fevre, Mark</field><field name="description">Stress management interventions (SMIs) are increasingly used by organisations across both private and public settings. Such interventions are employed with the expectation that they will be effective in reducing levels of stress in participants and in turn, will provide a return to the organisation by way of increased productivity through performance improvements of those employees whose stress has been reduced. Despite the increasing popularity of SMIs, there exists a lack of evidence on whether they have any effect on the performance of users, and on the relative effectiveness of the components that often make up SMIs. Although the literature addressing SMIs and their effects is increasing, relatively few studies directly compare different techniques, and even fewer employ randomised controlled designs or follow-up measures. The assumed relationship between the reduction of stress and improvement of managerial performance does not appear to have been tested with a randomised controlled trial. The term &#8220;stress&#8221; as used in this study specifically denotes the concept of &#8220;distress&#8221; as defined by Selye (1956; 1987).  To support this use of the term, the evolution of current terminology in the field of occupational stress is briefly discussed with specific reference to the development and influence in the wider literature of the Yerkes Dodson Law (Yerkes, 1909). The aims of this thesis were to (1) compare the relative effectiveness of two component techniques often used in SMIs (somatic and cognitive techniques) in the reduction of stress, and (2) to examine the effect of the use of these techniques on the performance of managers in their workplace. Study One was a randomised controlled trial assessing the effect of the use of somatic and cognitive stress management interventions on stress and performance in managers. Participants were 112 corporate managers who were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups (somatic or cognitive technique training) or to a wait list control group. The intervention groups were trained in their respective techniques over a 4 week period in brief (20-30 minute) face-to-face workshop sessions. Participants were provided with recordings of the techniques to assist practice between training sessions. At baseline, stress was assessed using the Occupational Stress Inventory &#8211; Revised Edition (OSI-R, Osipow, 1998), and managerial performance was assessed with the Personal Qualities Competency from the Inventory of Management Competencies (IMC, Saville Holdsworth Ltd., 1993). In the case of the IMC, self, colleague, and subordinate assessments were used. On completion of the 4 week intervention, the OSI-R was readministered, and then at week 12 and week 24, follow-up assessments of stress and managerial performance took place. At the week 12 follow-up, MANOVA for the OSI-R showed no significant difference between the somatic and cognitive interventions in their effect on stress, although both interventions did reduce stress relative to the wait list control group, as measured by the OSI-R. A significant intervention effect was also shown (&#951;p2  =  0.089, p =  0.002) for the combined intervention groups (cognitive and somatic). MANOVA for the Personal Qualities Competency showed a significant intervention effect for the self (&#951;p2  =  0.077, p  =  0.008) and colleague (&#951;p2  =  0.064, p  = 0.013) assessments, and a no significant effect (&#951;p2  =  0.032, p  =  0.063) for the subordinate assessment at the week 12 follow-up point. Unfortunately, withdrawal and attrition reduced the sample size below that required for analysis at the week 24 follow-up point. Study Two was designed as a follow-up qualitative study that aimed to gather information on participants&#8217; perceptions of the effects of the interventions on their stress and performance, and of their reasons for completion or no completion of the SMI. In this study, 14 participants from Study One took part in semi-structured interviews after the final follow-up assessment (week 24) for that study. The interviews were structured to elicit responses concerning participants&#8217; perceptions of the demands of their workplace and their stress, their experience of using the stress management techniques (including perceived benefits or behavioural changes from that use), their reasons for completion or no completion of the intervention, and their own definitions of stress. Several important findings emerged from this study. First, participants described their workplace as characterised by high pressure and demand with rapid change and a perceived lack of personal control. Second, participants who continued to use the techniques they had learned after the formal intervention was completed did so because they perceived personal benefits in terms of their ability to relax and in terms of their perceptions of workload and demand. For those who did not complete the intervention, the predominant reasons reported for no completion were workplace task demands, lack of top management commitment to an intervention of this nature, and lack of personal gain once the techniques had been learned. In relation to defining stress, participants did not have agreement, but rather reported definitions reflecting a multifaceted complex amalgam of physiological, psychological, and emotional aspects. Research such as this is important in terms of its contribution to the general field of occupational stress and its alleviation. It addresses a long-standing need to assess the relative effectiveness of some of the subcomponents commonly employed as part of more complex multifaceted approaches to SMIs, and the effect of the techniques on both stress and performance. This thesis makes several contributions to existing knowledge. First, this thesis clarifies the origin of the Yerkes Dodson Law and its relevance to current stress management thinking. In management texts distress has come to be regarded as too much stress or pressure. This is coupled with the idea that some stress has a positive impact on performance due to an earlier and erroneous interpretation of the Yerkes Dodson Law. Second, Study One provides evidence of the relative effectiveness of two different SMI components in the reduction of individuals&#8217; occupational stress, as well as evidence for the effectiveness of individual focussed SMIs in the reduction of stress in corporate managers. Third, Study One provides evidence for a positive effect on managers&#8217; performance consequent to their use of stress management techniques. This thesis also sheds light on managers&#8217; definitions of stress, and their reasons for completion or no completion of SMIs. In summary, individual focussed (or secondary) SMIs have the potential to reduce stress and to improve performance in corporate managers as perceived by both the individual and others in the workplace.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Occupational stress</field><field name="subject">Management performance</field><field name="subject">Stress management</field><field name="subject">Randomised controlled trial</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/374</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Board characteristics and firm performance: evidence from New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bathula, Hanoku</field><field name="description">Due to various corporate scandals and failures, there has been a renewed interest on the role of boards in the performance of firms.  This thesis examines the relationship between the key board characteristics and firm performance.  Unlike most studies on boards which predominantly use only financial variables affecting governance, I take a different approach by combining them with non-financial variables.  This combined set of variables is used for theoretical and empirical modelling. Based on the extant literature, I develop a conceptual framework and a set of hypotheses to examine the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance.  Board characteristics considered in this research include board size, director ownership, CEO duality, gender diversity, educational qualification of board members and number of board meetings.  Additionally, I use board size as a moderating variable to examine how the effect of other board characteristics is contingent on board size.  Firm performance is measured by return on assets. I test my hypotheses on a longitudinal sample of 156 firms over a four year period from 2004 to 2007.  My sample includes all firms listed on New Zealand stock exchange as on November 2007.  Empirical analysis is undertaken using Generalised Least Squares analyses. The findings of the study show that board characteristics such as board size, CEO duality and gender diversity were positively related with firm performance, where as director ownership, board meetings and the number of board members with PhD level education was found to be negatively related.  Board size was found to be moderating some of these relationships, indicating the critical role being played by board size in the design and role of corporate boards.  The findings also provide partial evidence to different governance theories, further indicating the need for theoretical pluralism to gain insights into boards&#8217; functioning. The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link by examining both the traditional variables such as board size, CEO duality, and number of board meetings as well as other organisational attributes such as gender diversity and competence variables represented by women and PhD holders, respectively.  The theoretical framework and the findings of my thesis are expected to stimulate scholars for further research to identify the contingency conditions upon which the board characteristics and firm performance may be dependent.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate boards</field><field name="subject">Board characteristics and meetings</field><field name="subject">Top management teams</field><field name="subject">CEO duality</field><field name="subject">Women on boards</field><field name="subject">Director ownership</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/376</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying sustainability for industry: a New Zealand electricity power sector case study</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Bernard Cho Ming</field><field name="description">Sustainable development is now being recognised as a vital component of our society in the environmental, ethical, social, technological, economic, and institutional aspects, or dimensions, so, this thesis develops a framework to quantitatively measure sustainability. This thesis is distinctive in that it focuses on quantitative methods encapsulated in a formal assessment procedure and includes sustainability concepts that have rarely been put into practical use in sustainability reports.  The framework is designed along the strategy that the methodology needs to be scale invariant and recursive, meaning the procedure is the same irrespective of the scale the user is interested in, and that different people can focus at different levels of sustainability by following a similar procedure. While the quantification process is aimed to be as unbiased as possible, a configuration of the tools from Total Quality Management (TQM) is adapted to identify sustainability indicators which are then mapped onto a scalar with mathematical functions. The sustainability indices are presented according to the amount of details needed by different users &#9472; some may need just one overall figure while others may need sustainability indices broken down by the six sustainability dimensions and presented on a spider diagram, while others may need all the details for analysis. This methodology also caters for sustainability analysis by different stakeholders. To fully demonstrate the potential of the methodology, the author has chosen to test it on a large-size industry sector so that it can have the capacity to be scaled up to a country or down to a small business, and on an industry sector that is important on its own right. Furthermore, this sector needs to be illustrative and has nontrivial complex problems. Under these criteria, the electricity sector of New Zealand was selected. The robustness of the methodology was investigated with inputs from three evaluators with different views: a standard view from the author that was made after much research in the sector and in the concepts of sustainability, a view with an environmental bias and one that focuses on commercial interests.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">Electricity sector</field><field name="subject">Sustainability index</field><field name="subject">Sustainability indicators</field><field name="subject">Quantify sustainability</field><field name="subject">Electricity spot price</field><field name="subject">Chaos</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/381</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-stakeholder organising for sustainability</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Aarti</field><field name="description">Multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaborations have been considered as &#8216;panacea&#8217; for complex local to global problems confronting governments, businesses and society. And for over a decade now, they have also been increasingly promoted as mechanisms to achieve sustainability. There is, however, a dearth of empirical studies that give deeper insights into the practical dimensions and various implications of such processes for sustainability. This dissertation explores how multi-stakeholder organising processes for sustainability occur in local settings. It relies on a theoretical framework that combines institutional and social movements theoretical perspectives. Such a theoretical cross-fertilisation has been helpful in explaining: (a) how the macro institutional context of sustainable development influences micro interactions of individuals during collaborations; and (b) how those micro interactions may influence the sustainability movement organised at macro societal levels. The dissertation is philosophically based on the principles of critical hermeneutics. It draws on the works of Hans-Georg Gadamer and J&#252;rgen Habermas to understand the nature of reality, society and human relationships. The study also uses literature on sustainable development, organising, dialogue, collaboration, stakeholder engagement, emotions and time. Three cases of multi-stakeholder dialogic collaborations organised to address sustainability of two regions in New Zealand were investigated through observations, interviews with participants and documentary research. These processes were developed in response to a regulatory change in New Zealand &#8211; the new Local Government Act (2002) which emphasises sustainable development of communities. The data across the three cases was analysed using principles of grounded theory and critical hermeneutics. Analysis reveals how various kinds of institutional pressures (engulfing cultural-cognitive, regulative and normative institutions connected with sustainable development) confront different stakeholders with varying intensities. Those pressures influence stakeholders to become involved in and commit to such collaborations. And as stakeholders participate in such processes, they are shown to engage with one another rationally and emotionally, and with different conceptions of time. The collaborations thus can be characterised by a complex fusion of rationality, emotionality and temporality. On the one hand, multi-stakeholder dialogic collaborations stimulate learning, facilitate relationship building and build social capital for implementing sustainable development. They thus prove themselves as potent governance mechanisms that can help to institutionalise sustainable development. On the other hand, multi-stakeholder dialogic collaborations for sustainability are highly messy, unpredictable, paradoxical and conflict-ridden processes of stakeholder engagement. They are shown to suffer from three major problematics: problematic of misunderstandings; problematic of stakeholders&#8217; emotions; and problematic of stakeholders&#8217; time. They thus, ironically and paradoxically, are also problematic solutions for sustainability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stakeholder theory</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Dialogue</field><field name="subject">Institutional change</field><field name="subject">Critical hermeneutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/431</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving spiking neural networks for adaptive audiovisual pattern recognition</field><field name="creator">Wysoski, Simei Gomes</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents new modular and integrative information methods and systems inspired by the way the brain performs information processing, in particular, pattern recognition. The proposed artificial systems use spiking neurons as basic elements, which are the key components of spiking neural networks. Of particular interest to this research are various spiking neural network architectures and learning procedures that permit different pattern recognition problems to be solved in an evolvable and adaptive way. Spiking neural networks are used to model human visual and auditory pathways and are trained to perform the specific task of person authentication. The systems are individually tuned and trained to recognize facial information and to analyze sound signals from spoken sentences. The modelling of the integration of different sources of information (multisensory integration) using spiking neural networks is also a subject of investigation. A network architecture is proposed and a model for audiovisual pattern recognition is designed as an example. The main original contributions of this thesis are: a) Evaluation and further extension of adaptive learning procedures to perform visual pattern recognition. A new learning procedure that enables the system to change its structure, creating/merging neuronal maps of spiking neurons is presented and evaluated on a face recognition problem. b) Design of two new spiking neural network architectures to perform person authentication through the processing of speech signals. c) Design and evaluation of a new architecture that integrates sensory modalities based on spiking neurons. The integrative architecture combines opinions from individual modalities within a supramodal layer, which contains neurons sensitive to multiple sensory information. An additional feature that increases biological relevance is the crossmodal coupling of modalities, which effectively enables a given sensory modality to exert direct influence upon the processing areas typically related to other modalities. The contributions were published in one journal paper and in four refereed international conference proceedings. The proposed system designs were implemented and, through computer simulations, demonstrated comparable performance with traditional benchmarking methods. The systems have some promising features: they can be naturally optimized in respect to different criteria: accuracy (when very accurate results are expected), energy efficiency (when management of resources play an important role), and speed (when a decision needs to be made within a limited time). In this thesis, most of the parameters have been exhaustively optimized by hand or by using simple heuristics. As a direction for future work, there is an opportunity to include automated, specially tailored parameters optimization procedures or even general-purpose optimization algorithms, e.g., Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization. Overall, the results obtained in this thesis clearly indicate that it is indeed possible to have fast and accurate adaptive pattern recognition systems scalable for multiple modalities computing with simple models of spiking neurons. However, it is important to advance the theory of spiking neurons to take advantage of its biological relevance to reach similar or better performance when compared to the human brain, for instance, exploring new neuron models, information coding schemes and network connectivity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Visual pattern recognition</field><field name="subject">Auditory pattern recognition</field><field name="subject">Experimentation and quantitative evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/390</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ashes without reserve</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Maria Th&#233;r&#232;se</field><field name="description">This thesis is centrally concerned with the texts of Jacques Derrida that have addressed directly the theme of sexual difference. Yet to say the thesis is centrally concerned with a philosophy that positions itself clearly as one that deconstructs centrality and its trajectory of return, is to face the crisis or chiasmus of my concern. The thesis is not returned to Derrida. If the question of feminism for Derrida is a question from the margins, from interruptions, of the trace and of la cendre, ashes, the question of sexual difference is primordially and originarily that of the undecidability of the name, signatory, and textual border. She would not have appeared here. Therefore she cannot return. There are two frames to this research that can be recognized in the chapter sequence of the thesis. Initially I develop a preparatory engagement to a questioning of the ontology of sexual difference, with Chapters 2 and 3, with a questioning that broaches the metaphysics of the feminine with respect to the texts of Derrida, Heidegger and Cixous in particular and further engages with &#201;criture F&#233;minine, Levinas and feminist responses to Heidegger and Levinas. However, this broader questioning is undertaken in order to develop a sharper focus on the writings of Derrida that address Heidegger&#8217;s ontological difference, Levinas&#8217;s ethics before being, and a more originary questioning of sexual difference. The second frame and predominant focus of the thesis is on Derrida&#8217;s approach to the metaphysics of the feminine with four pivotal texts by Derrida from the late 1970s and early 1980s examined in Chapters 4 to 7. Each addresses a questioning of difference and the metaphysical tradition, under difference&#8217;s many names: ontological difference, sexual difference, diff&#233;rance, and engages deconstruction&#8217;s encounters with Nietzsche &amp; Heidegger (Spurs); the psychoanalysts Abraham &amp; Torok (&#8220;Fors&#8221;); Levinas (&#8220;At This Very Moment in This Work Here I Am&#8221;) and Hegel (Glas). In bringing together these four texts, my aim is to emphasize the significance of a double deconstructive movement of transgression and restoration, as this research&#8217;s politico-ethical acts of writing and reading for an otherwise discourse on sexual difference. This otherwise discourse has always already been produced with phallogocentrism and remains critical for the inventing of thresholds across philosophy, literature and their others. The ashen Preface enkindles a paradigmatic figure as deconstructive trace of sexual difference in writing and reading practices. A Postscript questions the binding to institutional laws constitutive of disciplinary practice while the fiery trace in Derrida&#8217;s writing on Kafka&#8217;s law concludes on the ash-laden edges of Blanchot&#8217;s unavowable work.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deconstruction</field><field name="subject">Jacques Derrida</field><field name="subject">Sexual difference</field><field name="subject">Politico-ethical poetics</field><field name="subject">&#201;criture F&#233;minine</field><field name="subject">Diff&#233;rance difference</field><field name="subject">Grammatology</field><field name="subject">General economy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/393</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetics and kinematics of strength and power development</field><field name="creator">Harris, Nigel</field><field name="description">The use of the squat exercise (and its derivatives) in gym-based settings is widespread owing to perceived functional performance enhancing effects.  In particular, there has been preponderance amongst practitioners with loads that maximise power outputs (Pmax) based on a perception that mechanical peak power is directly related to explosive functional performance such as sprinting ability.  The optimal muscular quality associated with squats remains elusive though, mostly due to methodological limitations in the research.  The four experimental studies in this thesis sought to quantify the kinetic and kinematic outputs of a machine squat-jump and their relationship to sprinting ability, both descriptively and across a training period.  First, an analysis of the kinetic and kinematic outputs of a machine squat-jump across a spectrum of loads was performed, with an emphasis on power output.  Then, the relationship of these outputs with sprint ability was investigated.  Correlations do not imply cause and effect, thus a training intervention was undertaken to quantify the relationships of the change in performance measures over time, and allow a comparison of different training protocols.  Specifically, one training group was prescribed training loads based on individually determined peak power outputs, and the other based on traditional maximal strength training loads.  Because the intention of this thesis was to enhance our knowledge of best strength training practice for elite sporting performance, highly trained athletes were specifically chosen as subjects, cognizant of the population specific nature of training adaptation. In study one, it was determined that the point on the power-load spectrum where peak and mean power occurred in the machine squat-jump was 21.6 &#177; 7.1 %1RM (mean &#177; SD) and 39.0 &#177; 8.6 %1RM respectively although there was considerable individual variation in these points.  A broad plateau in power outputs was evident for most subjects with at most a 9.9% (90% confidence limits &#177;2.4%) difference in peak or means power at loads up to 20 %1RM either side of the peak.  Studies two and three established that, of the multiple kinetic and kinematic measures investigated, only 1RM strength, work and impulse (all relative to body mass) provided any indication of useful kinetic / kinematic outputs that were potentially worthwhile developing for enhancing sprint performance, albeit with only moderate correlations (r = ~ -0.3).  Additionally, the intercorrelations between maximal strength and explosive kinetic and kinematic measures were only moderate (r = ~0.3), casting doubt on the common practice of pursuing high 1RM strength with the intention of improving explosive muscle performance.

The review of the literature suggests that early writers from the time of the Bible identified that occupation is not &#8216;wide open&#8217;, there are many factors that shape how and when a person engages in an occupation, which in turn shapes the meaning of occupation. Within the occupational therapy literature, discussion of the meaning of occupation is overshadowed by describing and defending practice. In occupational science scholars and researchers have focused largely on understanding occupation from a conceptual perspective rather than the ontological meaning of occupation. The exploration of the meaning of occupation is being advanced by only a few. In this study participants told their stories about their occupations. Data were analysed by indentifying key themes and engaging in a hermeneutic thinking process of going back to the work of Heidegger and Gadamer. Writing and re-writing was the method used to bring new understandings to the data. The findings of this thesis suggest that the meaning of occupation is complex, and tends to remain hidden. Analysis focuses on the call, Being-with, and possibilities. The call to occupation seems to be in response to what it is we care about or what concerns us. Being-with others while engaging in an occupation creates a bond and mood; the meaning of occupation changes depending on who the occupation is done with or without. The meaning of occupation is also revealed in the possibilities that are opened up or closed down. Occupation shows both ourselves and others what it is we are capable of in the journey of who it is we are becoming. Each of these facets of meaning work in unison and can be likened to three cogs in a wheel, each interconnected with the others. The thesis concludes by recognising that not all voices have been heard and argues for uncovering more about the meaning of occupation from the perspective of lived experience. A challenge is made to consider the meaning of occupation not as something that is individually derived but as something that is connected to the broader context of the world and others in the world.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupation</field><field name="subject">Meaning</field><field name="subject">Occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Occupational science</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/398</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The meaning of being in dilemma in paediatric practice: a phenomenological study</field><field name="creator">Water, Tineke</field><field name="description">This study explores the phenomenon of dilemma in paediatric practice. Using a hermeneutic phenomenological method informed by the writings of Heidegger [1889-1976] and Gadamer [1900 -2002] this study provides an understanding of the meaning of &#8216;being in dilemma&#8217; from the perspective of predominantly paediatric health care professionals but also families in New Zealand. Study participants include four families who had a child requiring health care and fifteen health care practitioners from the disciplines of medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, play specialist and occupational therapy who work with families and children requiring health care. Participants&#8217; narratives of their experiences of &#8216;being in dilemma&#8217; were captured via audio taped interviewing. These stories uncover the everyday realities facing health professionals and families and provide an ontological understanding for the notion of dilemma. The findings of this study suggest that experience of dilemma for health professionals reveals a world that is uncertain and questionable where they are thrown into having to make uncomfortable choices and must live with the painful consequences of their actions. The consequences of being in such dilemma have to find ways of living with the angst, or risk becoming too sensitive or desensitizing. For families the experience of dilemma reveals a similar phenomenon most evident in circumstances where they feel totalized by the impact of heath care encounters. This study has uncovered that the perspectives that health professionals and families bring to the experience of dilemma reveal different concerns and commitments and may be hidden from each other. This thesis proposes that health professionals and families need support in living with their own personal encounters of enduring experiences of dilemma.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child health</field><field name="subject">Healthcare practice</field><field name="subject">Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Medical choices</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/405</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neoliberalism and discourse: case studies of knowledge policies in the Asia-Pacific</field><field name="creator">Grewal, Baljit</field><field name="description">This thesis examines policy documents relating to the knowledge society of six Asia-Pacific countries (India, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Fiji and New Zealand). I employ Norman Fairclough&#8217;s version of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to explore the discursive construction of knowledge-related policies within a comparative case study methodology. Leximancer &#8211; a computer software for text analysis is used to assist in operationalising parts of the CDA. The general conclusions drawn from the study indicate that the evolving knowledge policy discourse in the Asia-Pacific is not based on any robust theoretical framework but on international and country-specific paradigms of the knowledge society. In the policy discourses, the knowledge society is posited as a desired outcome in light of external (global) imperatives - economic globalisation, technological knowledge and innovation flows, and ICT revolution &#8211; which are married to context-specific developmental imperatives arising from geography, culture, history and polity. This hybridisation process gives shape to unique knowledge society paradigms of each country. My CDA analysis shows that the ideology of neoliberalism is a key discursive influence on the knowledge society paradigms and is mutated by differences in contexts across different countries. In the discourses, neoliberalism operates via an emphasis on policy restructuring (privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation), and streamlining of governance mechanisms relating to key knowledge and information policy sectors. The resulting knowledge society constructions are context and time-dependent frameworks and exhibit two core arguments of convergence in all the case studies:  (1) ICT and Science &amp; Technology as vehicles for knowledge-based development need to grow in an enabling policy environment and; (2) the twin imperatives of globalisation and technological revolution mean that knowledge policy should have a competitive and innovation orientation, and should be continuously readjusted in tune with global economic changes. In addition to convergence, there are two major issues of divergence, namely: (1) emphasis on affirmative action in knowledge-related policies of India, Malaysia, and Fiji; (2) the promotion of cultural production and creative industries in Singapore, New Zealand, and more recently in Korea. The original contribution of this thesis is that it provides a reassessment of the role of neoliberalism in knowledge society. The study is novel both in the selection of the problem and the methodology. Comparative case studies using CDA have not been attempted at the regional scale and not with this level of documentary data. The use of Leximancer improves the management of textual data and increases the validity of the interpretations. A study of this magnitude has not been attempted for the Asia-Pacific region previously. Finally, the conclusions drawn from applying the CDA are both persuasive and creative in terms of analysing policy discourses of the knowledge society.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge society</field><field name="subject">Knowledge economy</field><field name="subject">Neoliberalism</field><field name="subject">Critical Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">Asia Pacific</field><field name="subject">Knowledge policy</field><field name="subject">Leximancer</field><field name="subject">Information society</field><field name="subject">Policy Analysis</field><field name="subject">Sociology of knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/407</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate reputation: Ontology and measurement</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Stephen</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is on the development of ontology and on a more effective way to measure corporate reputation that takes into consideration the orientations of a company&#8217;s various stakeholders. The focus by researchers and by practitioners on corporate reputation and on its management attests to an expanding interest. Yet there remains disparate knowledge about how corporate reputation should be defined; about what are its key components; about the relationships between those components and about how corporate reputation should be measured. This point to a need for clarification: to develop a methodology based on ontology of corporate reputation that has relevance for a company&#8217;s various stakeholder groups.  This research builds on a review of the academic literature and employs text analysis, the nominal group technique and a quantitative survey among stakeholders about the reputation of a high profile company. Theory-driven analysis provides insights into the corporate reputation construct and into a tool for measurement that takes into consideration stakeholder perceptions of a company&#8217;s reputation. The results of the study indicate that, in the eyes of its stakeholders, a company&#8217;s reputation is driven by nine factors: image, identity, management leadership, performance, corporate brand, products and services, financial performance, ethical management and leadership, and corporate leadership. Not all nine components share the same degree of relevance for stakeholders: different stakeholder groups rank the importance of the components of corporate reputation differently; they evaluate the reputation of the same company differently. The drivers of stakeholders&#8217; overall evaluations of a company&#8217;s reputation vary by stakeholder segment. Stakeholder groups are seen to display the characteristics of segments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate reputation</field><field name="subject">Reputation measurement</field><field name="subject">Reputation ontology</field><field name="subject">Stakeholders</field><field name="subject">C-OAR-SE procedure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/409</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics of the Onychoteuthidae Gray, 1847 (Cephalopoda: Oegopsida)</field><field name="creator">Bolstad, Kathrin S.</field><field name="description">Squids in the family Onychoteuthidae Gray, 1847 have been reported from every ocean but the Arctic, are taken frequently in deep-sea fisheries by catch, and are ecologically important in the diets of many marine predators including cetaceans, pinnipeds, sharks, and seabirds. However, the diversity and systematic of the family have remained poorly understood. Of the 60+ nominal species, 12&#8211;14 have generally been accepted in recent studies. Challenges to clarity include insufficient species descriptions, original descriptions published in eight languages and often based solely on early life stages, non-designation or subsequent loss of type material, and the existence of several unresolved species complexes. In light of the general systematic disarray of the Onychoteuthidae, a global revision of the family follows, based on ~1500 specimens examined from 19 repositories. Type material has been examined wherever possible; for some species, photographs of type specimens, original illustrations, and/or the original descriptions have provided the only information available. It has not been possible to fully disambiguate taxa in some cases (e.g. Gen. nov. 2), given the limited material and information available, but for all species treated in this revision (25 out of 26 species; no material was available for Kondakovia nigmatullini), descriptions and illustrations are provided to a consistent standard that will enable their reidentification. External and internal morphological characters and states are described for sub adult to adult stages of most species, with external characters reported through ontogeny as permitted by available material. Historically important characters are treated (general external morphology, body proportions, tentacle clubs, photophores, gladius, lower beak, radula), augmented by several more recently recognised characters (palatine teeth, detailed morphology of the tentacular hooks in adults, tentacular suckers in paralarvae, chromatophore patterns). The systematic value of both historical and new morphological characters at the generic and species levels are discussed; at all ontogenetic stages, tentacular club and hook morphology are considered the most valuable characters, although body proportions and gladius also prove useful. Partial disambiguation of the Onychoteuthis banksii complex has been possible in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, resulting in the resurrection of Onychoteuthis bergii Lichtenstein, 1818 and Onychoteuthis aequimanus Gabb, 1868, the description of two new species, Onychoteuthis lacrima and Onychoteuthis prolata (in press), and the expansion of one species&#8217; recognised distribution (Onychoteuthis compacta) to include the Atlantic Ocean. The genus Moroteuthis Verrill, 1881 is considered a junior synonym of Onykia Lesueur, 1821, in accordance with the findings of several earlier authors. However, morphological differences in the species &#8216;Moroteuthis&#8217; ingens necessitate the resurrection of the subgenus Moroteuthopsis Pfeffer, 1908b, with all other Onykia species placed into a new subgenus, Onykia (Onykia). Sexual dimorphism is reported in the beaks of Onykia (Moroteuthopsis) ingens (new comb.), and revised sex-specific equations are given for estimating this species&#8217; biomass based on LRL. Morphological and historical genetic data suggest a more distant relationship between Onykia and the species &#8216;Moroteuthis&#8217; knipovitchi Filippova, 1972 than was suggested by earlier classifications. This species is therefore considered to represent an undescribed genus, herein referred to as Gen. Nov. 1, which cannot be more fully diagnosed and described at present due to limited material. The generic position of &#8216;Onykia&#8217; rancureli (Okutani, 1981) is also uncertain; it may be allied to Walvisteuthis virilis Nesis &amp; Nikitina, 1986 (family Walvisteuthidae Nesis &amp; Nikitina, 1986), but confirmation is impossible without examining type material of W. virilis. A second new genus, Gen. Nov. 2, is therefore described for &#8216;Onykia&#8217; rancureli and several morphological variants reported from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Given that the majority of available onychoteuthid material was collected after 1950, resulting in the descriptions of over half of the generally accepted genera and species since 1960, ongoing collection programmes are necessary to further resolve onychoteuthid systematic.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systematics</field><field name="subject">Taxonomy</field><field name="subject">Cephalopoda</field><field name="subject">Onychoteuthidae</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/414</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneurs and organisations: a case study of the Gisborne aquaculture cluster</field><field name="creator">Johnstone, Bruce Alexander</field><field name="description">This research contributes to the discussion surrounding New Zealand&#8217;s entrepreneurial environment and Innovation Framework and addresses the research problem of whether the New Zealand government should seek to support entrepreneurship and innovation through the various knowledge-based or regulatory organisations it owns or funds, and if so, how it should go about accomplishing this. The approach taken was to use qualitative methods to examine how the government&#8217;s support for entrepreneurship and innovation was delivered to an emerging cluster of entrepreneurs from the point of view of those entrepreneurs.  The entrepreneurs were involved in the innovative industry of land-based aquaculture and fieldwork was carried out in the Gisborne Region, on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. This study began by reviewing relevant literature from academic, industry and government sources to identify relevant sub-themes and create a framework for analysis. Fieldwork was undertaken using ethnographic methods to explore how the entrepreneurs experienced the New Zealand entrepreneurial environment and innovation framework in their interactions with knowledge-based and regulatory organisations. Data was gathered primarily by participant observation and semi-structured interviews and transcripts were coded and analysed using NVivo&#174; software. An ethnographic narrative was produced and the interview transcripts analysed for relevance to the sub-themes from literature and to identify patterns that emerged from the data. This research reports that four of the entrepreneurs failed in their ventures due to a combination of factors both within their operations and within the entrepreneurial environment. These factors included technical difficulties maintaining livestock health and growth within an artificial marine environment, an inability to obtain assistance from knowledge-based organisations, problems in dealing with regulatory organisations, difficulty retaining trained staff, uncertainty about the market, and high energy costs. The M&#257;ori training organisation, Turanga Ararau, formed the Gisborne Aquaculture Society in an effort to establish a Gisborne aquaculture cluster however, this initiative proved unsuccessful primarily because the society failed to attract the 12 involvement of key stakeholders. This research contributes to the policy and practice of cluster facilitation by examining the extent to which best practice was followed in this attempt to establish a cluster and presents conclusions as to how the process of establishing the cluster could have been improved. This study also reports that the entrepreneurs were cut off from access to knowledge and research resources and received little advice or support from the knowledge based organisations that might have played a role in the development of their cluster. It examines how and why New Zealand&#8217;s Innovation Framework might be failing to recognise and support the vital role of entrepreneurs in economic development and suggests how this might be improved. The methodology chapters of this thesis contribute to literature regarding the use of ethnographic methods in entrepreneurship research and a further by-product of this thesis is an ethnographic account of the participant observation and semi structured interviews with the entrepreneurs. This research also provides an insight into the obstacles and challenges faced by entrepreneurs in New Zealand, in particular those involved in the emerging recirculating aquaculture industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entrepreneur</field><field name="subject">Ethnography</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Fish farming</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/418</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ICT in community-based lifelong learning center: model for northeast Thailand</field><field name="creator">Wech-O-sotsakda, Chanthana</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how rural and remote communities in northeast Thailand harness information and communication technologies (ICTs) for community development and develops a new model of ICT-based lifelong learning centre for local communities. The main research questions are: 1. How to adapt ICTs to fit rural communities? 2. How to integrate ICTs into their lifestyle? 3. How to use ICTs to forge stronger ties within and between local communities? 4. How to develop ICTs in community-based lifelong learning centre? The objective of this research is to develop a model of ICT in community-based lifelong learning centers (CLC) that is suitable for northeast Thailand, and to propose policies for implementing ICTs in CLCs. This study used qualitative methodologies to explore the problem. Data collection took place in Thailand between April, 2005 to March, 2006. The fieldwork covered two communities in Krainun Village, Katharawichai District and Khok Yai Community Forest, Wapi Pathum District, Mahasarakham Province. The data collection procedures included using surveys and questionnaires to develop the research agenda with the target groups while focus group techniques were used as the main data-gathering instrument to further investigate their needs and develop the CLC model. Interviews, observations, workshops and study trips were needed for additional data. A triangulation approach was used to analyse the data from surveys, interviews, observations and discussions. The basic data from the surveys were categorised into four aspects: geographical data, public utilities, social data, and economic data. Using the issues-based analysis methodology, the qualitative data from the focus groups were analysed and interpreted and triangulation was applied to difference data sources. The recorded materials were transcribed and issues related to the research questions were identified. The next step focused on developing the CLC model which applied Knowles&#8217; program development model for adult education and training. This focus on process is a distinguishing feature of this research and comprises the &#8216;new&#8217; characteristic in the model presented. The study showed that the rural communities grasped the benefits of ICTs and through concrete situations, realised that ICTs could meet their needs. ICT learning activities using a hands-on practical approach motivated them to adapt and integrate ICT in their daily life. They applied their experiences to acquire new knowledge and technology. Their CLCs were developed based on a similar model of their understanding of, and motivation to use, ICT. The model of CLC in both communities is based on their needs, including the concept of establishing a CLC, CLC objectives, CLC management, implementation and evaluation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community learning centre</field><field name="subject">Thai public policy</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Computer training</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/424</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive inspired mapping by an autonomous mobile robot</field><field name="creator">Wong, Chee Kit</field><field name="description">When animals explore a new environment, they do not acquire a precise map of the places visited. In fact, research has shown that learning is a recurring process. Over time, new information helps the animal to update their perception of the locations it has visited. Yet, they are still able to use the fuzzy and often incomplete representation to find their way home. This process has been termed the cognitive mapping process. The work presented in this thesis uses a mobile robot equipped with sonar sensors to investigate the nature of such a process. Specifically, what is the information that is fundamental and prevalent in spatial navigation? Initially, the robot is instructed to compute a &#8220;cognitive map&#8221; of its environment. Since a robot is not a cognitive agent, it cannot, by definition, compute a cognitive map. Hence the robot is used as a test bed for understanding the cognitive mapping process. Yeap&#8217;s (1988) theory of cognitive mapping forms the foundation for computing the robot&#8217;s representation of the places it has visited. He argued that a network of local spaces is computed early in the cognitive mapping process. Yeap coined these local spaces as Absolute Space Representations (ASRs). However, ASR is not just a process of partitioning the environment into smaller local regions. The ASRs describe the bounded space that one is in, how one could leave that space (exits) and how the exits serves to link the ASRs to form a network that serves as the cognitive map (see Jefferies (1999)). Like the animal&#8217;s cognitive map, ASRs are not precise geometrical maps of the environment but rather, provide a rough shape or feel of the space the robot is currently in. Once the robot computes its &#8220;cognitive map&#8221;, it is then, like foraging and hoarding animals, instructed to find its way home. To do so, the robot uses two crucial pieces of information: distance between exits of ASRs and relative orientation of adjacent ASRs. A simple animal-like strategy was implemented for the robot to locate home. Results from the experiments demonstrated the robot&#8217;s ability to determine its location within the visited environment along its journey. This task was performed without the use of an accurate map. From these results and reviews of various findings related to cognitive mapping for various animals, we deduce that: Different animals have different sensing capabilities. They live in different environments and therefore face unique challenges. Consequently, they evolve to have different navigational strategies. However, we believe two crucial pieces of information are inherent in all animals and form the fundamentals of navigation: distance and orientation. Higher level animals may encode and may even prefer richer information to enhance the animal&#8217;s cognitive map. Nonetheless, distance and orientation will always be computed as a core process of cognitive mapping. We believe this insight will help future research to better understand the complex nature of cognitive mapping.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive mapping</field><field name="subject">Spatial reasoning</field><field name="subject">Inaccurate mapping</field><field name="subject">Mobile robot</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/427</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity and obesity in children: measurement, associations, and recommendations</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Scott</field><field name="description">Widespread increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity have raised the prospect of serious public health consequences in many countries. New Zealand is no exception; according to the most recent national estimates, approximately one in three children is overweight or obese. As a consequence, an understanding of the specific risk factors that predict this condition in children is becoming increasingly important. It is generally accepted that the promotion of physical activity is a key strategy for reducing the risk of childhood obesity. However, there is limited information describing physical activity and its relationship with body fatness in young New Zealanders. The overall aim of this thesis was to gain insight into the associations between excess fatness and physical activity in New Zealand children from a diverse range of socio-demographic groups. Three related studies were conducted to achieve this aim: a large descriptive survey of obesity and physical activity patterns in primary-aged children, and two preceding studies which develop the methodology for objective assessment of physical activity in this population. The first study provided the only validation data for the NL-2000 multiday memory (MDM) pedometer in children. In a sample of 85 participants aged 5-7 and 9-11 years, the NL-2000 offered similar accuracy and better precision than the widely used SW-200 pedometer (NL-2000: mean bias = -8.5 &#177; 13.3%; SW-200: mean bias = -8.6 &#177; 14.7%). The second study investigated reactivity to wearing pedometers over four 24-hour testing periods in 62 children aged 5-11 years. The sample was divided into two groups: one was given a full explanation of the function of the pedometer, while the other received no information prior to testing. The absence of significant differences in step counts between the first and last test periods indicated that there was no evidence of reactivity to this device for either preparation procedure. The central study presented in this thesis was the measurement of physical activity, body composition, and dietary patterns in 1,226 children aged 5-12 years, from which four chapters (4-7) were derived. The sample was ethnically diverse, with 46.8% European, 33.1% Polynesian, 15.9% Asian, and 4.1% from other ethnicities. Physical activity levels over three weekdays and two weekend days were assessed using NL 2000 pedometers. Percentage body fat (%BF) was determined using hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analysis with a prediction equation previously developed for New Zealand children. Waist and hip girths, height, and weight were measured using standard anthropometric techniques. Parent proxy questionnaires were used to assess demographic and lifestyle factors and pedometer compliance. The first reported analyses of this dataset (Chapter 4) examined the effect of weather conditions on children&#8217;s activity levels. In boys, a 10&#186;C rise in ambient temperature was associated with a 10.5% increase in weekday steps and a 26.4% increase in weekend steps. Equivalent temperature changes affected girls&#8217; step counts on weekdays only (16.2% increase). Precipitation also had a substantial impact, with decreases in weekday and weekend step counts during moderate rainfall ranging from 8.3% to 16.3% across all sex, age, and socioeconomic (SES) groups. The aim of Chapter 5 was to understand the relationship between children&#8217;s step counts and their body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and %BF. Mean step counts for this sample were 16,133 &#177; 3,864 (boys) and 14,124 &#177; 3,286 (girls) on weekdays, and 12,702 &#177; 5,048 (boys) and 11,158 &#177; 4,309 (girls) on weekends. Significant associations were detected between steps.day-1 and both WC and %BF, but not between steps.day-1 and BMI. The findings in Chapter 6 extended these results by estimating the number of steps required to reduce the risk of excess adiposity in children (16,000 and 13,000 steps.day-1 for boys and girls, respectively). Finally, the study described in Chapter 7 examined the associations between excess adiposity and a series of demographic and lifestyle variables, providing the first assessment of body fat correlates in young New Zealanders. Our results indicated that children aged 11-12 years were 15.4 times more likely to be overfat (boys, %BF &#8805; 25%; girls, %BF &#8805; 30%) than those aged 5-6 years. In addition, the odds of overfat were 1.8 times greater in Asian children than in European children, and 2.7 times greater in the low SES group when compared with the high SES group. Three modifiable behaviours related to fat status were also identified: low physical activity, skipping breakfast, and insufficient sleep on weekdays. Clustering of these risk factors resulted in a cumulative increase in the prevalence of overfat.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Body composition</field><field name="subject">Pedometers</field><field name="subject">Bioelectrical impedance analysis</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Step counts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/429</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of yeast species as the biocomponent for priority environmental contaminants biosensor devices</field><field name="creator">Gurazada, Saroja</field><field name="description">Along with an increasing understanding of the harmful effects on the environment of a wide range of pollutants has come the need for more sensitive, faster and less expensive detection methods of identification and quantitation. Many environmental pollutants occur in low levels and often in complex matrices thus analysis can be difficult, time consuming and costly. Because of the availability and easy cultivation of the microorganisms with potentially high specificity, there is considerable interest in the use of living microorganisms as the analytical component (the biocomponent) of sensors for pollutants. While a number of biosensors using bacteria have been developed, yeast has been comparatively rarely used as the biocomponent. Yeast are attractive because they are easy to culture and they are eukaryotes which means their biochemistry is in many respects closer to that of higher organisms. This thesis describes the development of whole cell bioassays that use yeast cells as a sensing element and redox mediators to probe the intracellular redox reactions to monitor the catabolic activity of the yeast resulting from the external substrate, steady-state voltammetry is utilised as the electrochemical detection technique.  The isogenic differential enzyme analysis (IDEA) concept of Lincoln Ventures Limited, lead NERF funded research consortium uses bacteria that have been cultured using specific organic pollutants as the carbon source which are the biocomponent in sensors. The use of wild type yeast Arxula adeninivorans that has the ability to use a very wide variety of substrates as sources of carbon and nitrogen was used as an alternative to bacteria to validate the &#8220;IDEA&#8221; concept. Naphthalene and di-butyl phthalate were chosen as model target contaminant molecules. The performance, detection limits and the usefulness of yeast based biosensor applications for environmental analysis are discussed. This thesis also describes the development and optimisation of a simple, cost effective in vivo estrogens bioassay for the detection of estrogens using either genetically modified or a wild type yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, catabolic repression by glucose was exploited to achieve specificity to estrogens in complex environmental samples that eliminates the requirement for conventional sample preparation. This is the first time that the use of wild type yeast to quantify estrogens has been reported. The attractive features of the bioassay are its use of a non-GMO organism, its speed, its high specificity and sensitivity with a detection limit of 10-15 M. The similarity of binding affinities for major estrogens to those of human estrogens receptors makes this in vivo estrogen bioassay very useful for analytical/screening procedures. The electrochemical detection method also makes it easy to interface with a variety of electronic devices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yeast</field><field name="subject">Biosensors</field><field name="subject">Environmental contaminants</field><field name="subject">Estrogen bioassay</field><field name="subject">Electrochemical deduction</field><field name="subject">Redox mediators</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/430</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prevalence, perceptions, and correlates of physical activity among youth in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hohepa, Maea</field><field name="description">Sufficient physical activity, a key prerequisite for health, is lacking in many teenagers. Limited knowledge, however, exists about who, when, why, and if New Zealand teenagers are getting their daily dose of health-related physical activity. At conception of this thesis, available information was predominantly survey-derived with no New Zealand data and few international studies that had assessed adolescent physical activity levels objectively. Data were collected from three projects. Convenience sampling was used across all projects to recruit students from low-decile high schools located in the Auckland region. For Project 1, 236 Year 9 to Year 13 students each wore a pedometer for five days (three weekdays and two weekend days) and reported their mode of transportation to and from school. To explore ethnic and sex-specific perceptions of physical activity among youth (i.e., barriers, benefits, potential physical activity enhancing strategies), Project 2 involved nine focus group discussions with 44 Year 9 and Year 10 students who identified as M&#257;ori or European. Project 3 was a large cross-sectional study of 3,451 high school students (Years 9 - 13) from seven low-decile schools. Through this project the following self-reported data were collected: demographics, physical activity levels during four school-day physical activity opportunities (i.e., active travel, lunchtime physical activity, recess physical activity, after-school physical activity), sedentary behaviour (i.e., school-day television (TV) watching), level of perceived encouragement to be active, and the presence of home policies regarding TV use. Analyses revealed low physical activity participation and high TV use behaviours. Pedometer data showed that only 14.5% of participants achieved a conservative criterion of 10,000 steps daily. Also, daily steps varied by age group (junior students: 11,079 &#177; 330; senior students: 9,422 &#177; 334), sex (males: 10,849 &#177; 381; females: 9,652 &#177; 289), time of week (weekday: 12,259 &#177; 287; weekend day: 8,241 &#177; 329), and transportation mode to/from school (walkers: 13,308 &#177; 483; car transit users: 10,986 &#177; 435).  Low school-day physical activity levels emerged, especially during school hours (i.e., during recess and lunchtime). Based on dichotomised grouping (less active versus more active), the proportion of students in the &#8216;more active&#8217; group during morning recess and lunchtime, after school, and as part of active travel to/from school were 26%, 32.4%, 56.3%, 58.1% respectively. Only 11.1% of participants were in the &#8216;more active&#8217; group across all four physical activity opportunities.  The focus group data revealed primarily social benefits of physical activity (e.g., meeting new people, fun). Barriers were mainly environment-related and included lack of peer support, low accessibility to and availability of physical activity opportunities, alternative sedentary activities, structure of physical education classes (females only), and distance between home and school (in terms of active transportation). Potential strategies to increase physical activity reflected the articulated barriers and benefits (e.g., increase peer support, parents to turn off the TV, organised activities at school, restructure physical education classes to allow student involvement in the decision-making process of class content). No ethnic and few sex differences in perceptions were found. Focusing on the verbalised importance of social support from the focus groups, Project 3 data showed that the strength of association between perceived encouragement from different support sources (i.e., parents, older siblings/cousins, peers, school) and physical activity participation varied by the physical activity opportunity examined. In particular, multivariate logistical regression showed reduced odds of being in the &#8216;more active&#8217; group was associated with low parental encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.38-0.58; Seniors, OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.29-0.60) and low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51-0.74; Seniors, OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.35-0.69) for after-school physical activity, low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.32-0.48; Seniors, OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.29-0.57) for lunchtime activity, and low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66-0.92) for active transportation (junior students only).  No significant difference in physical activity was found between students who received high encouragement from two parents than students who reported high encouragement from their sole parent in a single parent family. Concentrating on the after-school period, Project 3 data were analysed to examined the relevance of the displacement hypothesis during this school-day period. The association between parental strategies (i.e., encouragement to be active and having TV limits) and youth after-school activity behaviours (i.e., hours spent viewing TV, physical activity participation) was also examined.  Support for the displacement hypothesis emerged. In particular, compared to students who watched less than one hour of TV, those who watched greater than four hours of TV were half as likely to be in the more active group for after-school physical activity participation (adjusted OR:  0.51; 95% CI: 0.40-0.65). Comparing activity profile groups (i.e., based on combined TV use and after-school activity levels), compared to the participants in the &#8216;low TV/active&#8217; group, participants in the other three activity groups (e.g., &#8216;high TV/low active&#8217;) were at least 1.28 times more likely to have parents that executed only one parental strategy and up to 4.77 times more likely to have parents that did not carry out either strategy. Substantive opportunities exist for youth to be active every day, and in different contexts and environments, yet a large proportion of young people are not maximising these opportunities to be active. If the health issue of inactivity is to be tackled in a comprehensive and efficient manner, a multi-strategy, multi-environment, coordinated approach among local authorities, government agencies, schools, families, and neighbourhoods is required to address the noted policy, physical, and social-related associates of an active lifestyle for youth. Future effort, whether in the form of strategy development, intervention work, or research, needs to be founded upon ecological theory, where both individual and a range of familial, social, and physical environmental factors (and there potential interactions) are considered. Lastly, equal research attention should be directed at improved physical activity levels, and just as importantly, reducing time youth spend in a sedentary state.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Television watching</field><field name="subject">Questionnaire</field><field name="subject">Focus groups</field><field name="subject">Youth-centred approach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/434</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity in New Zealand preschoolers: amount, associations, and accounts</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Melody</field><field name="description">Improving physical activity (PA) participation is a public health priority in developed and developing countries to curb the substantial and growing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases. Early childhood may be an especially important time to encourage PA; however, there is a paucity of research in this area. The aim of this research was to contribute to the limited body of work in PA in early childhood by investigating PA measurement approaches in young children and applying this knowledge to determine socio-environmental associations of preschool PA. An initial literature review provided the background for the thesis and determined the approaches taken in the ensuing chapters. A second literature review provided a detailed critique of research specific to PA measurement in early childhood to further inform the empirical studies. Information for the empirical chapters was drawn from three research projects: two studies were completed that assessed tools for objectively measuring PA in young children (pedometers and accelerometers), and these studies informed a final project to quantify associates of PA in a sample of preschool-aged children. Novel and important findings from the preliminary studies were that pedometer accuracy for measuring free-living PA and walking in children aged 3-5 years was poor, especially for pedometers worn at the back of the child, or during slow walking. Furthermore, when investigating the utility of accelerometers (more complex and frequently adopted tools) to quantify PA intensity in preschoolers, their application and use of commonly employed thresholds resulted in systematic underestimation of PA intensity and poor agreement (&#61547;=0.09) when compared with a direct observation criterion measure. Application of existing accelerometer thresholds to classify PA intensity in preschoolers was therefore likely to yield biased estimates.  Given the dearth of robust alternatives, a novel approach was developed to calculate individual activity rates from the raw accelerometer data. To account for over-dispersion in accelerometer counts, daily average activity rates per second were derived for each participant using negative binomial generalised estimating equation (GEE) models with a first-order autoregressive (AR1) correlation structure. These rates were assumed to be exchangeable between days and normally distributed. Potential socio-environmental associates of children&#8217;s activity rates and body size were thus assessed using normal GEE models with exchangeable correlation structures. Parental PA and child age were independently and significantly associated with child activity rates (P&#8804;0.04). No relationships between child body size and PA or television (TV) exposure were found. Common approaches to PA measurement and data consideration were challenged in this research and novel robust methods devised utilising contemporary statistical methods. Accelerometer data can be successfully reduced to individual activity rates to mitigate current issues related to objective PA quantification with preschoolers. Parental involvement in preschool PA interventions is worthy of further investigation, and younger children may stand to benefit more from increased activity. Further exploration of the complex interactions between PA, exposure to media, and health outcomes in preschool-aged children is warranted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical Activity</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Accelerometer</field><field name="subject">Pedometer</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Measure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/433</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrative approaches to modelling and knowledge discovery of molecular interactions in bioinformatics</field><field name="creator">Jain, Vishal</field><field name="description">The core focus of this research lies in developing and using intelligent methods to solve biological problems and integrating the knowledge for understanding the complex gene regulatory phenomenon. We have developed an integrative framework and used it to: model molecular interactions from separate case studies on time-series gene expression microarray datasets, molecular sequences and structure data including the functional role of microRNAs; to extract knowledge; and to build reusable models for the central dogma theme. Knowledge was integrated with the use of ontology and it can be reused to facilitate new discoveries as demonstrated on one of our systems &#8211; the Brain Gene Ontology (BGO). The central dogma theme states that proteins are produced from the DNA (gene) via an intermediate transcript called RNA. Later these proteins play the role of enzymes to perform the checkpoints as a gene expression control. Also, according to the recently emerged paradigm, sometimes genes do not code for proteins but results in small molecules of microRNAs which in turn controls the gene regulation. The idea is that such a very complicated molecular biology process (central dogma) results in production of a wide variety of data that can be used by computer scientists for modelling and to enable discoveries. We have suggested that this range of data should actually be taken into account for analysis to understand the concept of gene regulation instead of just taking one source of data and applying some standard methods to reveal facts in the system biology. The problem is very complex and, currently, computational algorithms have not been really successful because either existing methods have certain problems or the proven results were obtained for only one domain of the central dogma of molecular biology, so there has always been a lack of knowledge integration. Proper maintenance of diverse sources of data, structures and, in particular, their adaptation to new knowledge is one of the most challenging problems and one of the crucial tasks towards the knowledge integration vision is the efficient encoding of human knowledge in ontologies. More specifically this work has contributed towards the development of novel computational and information science methods and we have promoted the vision of knowledge integration by developing brain gene ontology (BGO) system. With the integrative use of several bioinformatics methods, this research has indeed resulted in modelling of such knowledge that has not been revealed in system biology so far. There are many discoveries made during my study and some of the findings are briefly mentioned as follows: (1) in relation to leukaemia disease we have discovered a new gene &#8220;TCF-1&#8221; that interacts with the &#8220;telomerase&#8221; gene. (2) With respect to yeast cell cycle analysis, we hypothesize that exoglucanase gene &#8220;exg1&#8221; is now implicated to be tied with &#8220;MCB cluster regulation&#8221; and a &#8220;mannosidase&#8221; with &#8220;histone linked mannoses&#8221;. A new quantitative prediction is that the time delay of the interaction between two genes seems to be approximately 30 minutes, or 0.17 cell cycles. Next, Cdc22, Suc22 and Mrc1 genes were discovered that interacts with each other as the potential candidates in controlling the Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity. (3) Upon studying the phenomenon of Long Term Potentiation (LTP) it was found that the transcription factors, responsible for regulation of gene expression, begin to be elevated as soon as 30 min after induction of LTP, and remain elevated up to 2 hours. (4) Human microRNA data investigation resulted in the successful identification of two miRNA families i.e. let-7 and mir-30. (5) When we analysed the CNS cancer data, a set of 10 genes (HMG-I(Y), NBL1, UBPY, Dynein, APC, TARBP2, hPGT, LTC4S, NTRK3, and Gps2) was found to give 85% correct prediction on drug response. (6) Upon studying the AMPA, GABRA and NMDA receptors we hypothesize that phenylalanine (F at position 269) and leucine (L at position 353) in these receptors play the role of a binding centre for their interaction with several other genes/proteins such as c-jun, mGluR3, Jerky, BDNF, FGF-2, IGF-1, GALR1, NOS and S100beta. All the developed methods that we have used to discover above mentioned findings are very generic and can be easily applied on any dataset with some constraints. We believe that this research has established the significant fact that integrative use of various computational intelligence methods is critical to reveal new aspects of the problem and finally knowledge integration is also a must. During this coursework, I have significantly published this research in reputed international journals, presented results in several conferences and also produced book chapters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">Gene regulatory networks (GRNs)</field><field name="subject">Interaction</field><field name="subject">Computational</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Integration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/439</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The artist will be present: performing partial objects and subjects</field><field name="creator">Braddock, Christopher Gregory</field><field name="description">'The Artist Will Be Present' explores objects as traces that stem from performed actions, and my body in performance. Part-sculptural objects, video and sound act as performance documents that expand on notions of the &#8216;live&#8217; encounter. Interest lies in how we get to objects: process in variance to product or closure. And the question of how the body/s of the audience becomes participatory is at the forefront of these operations. From this viewpoint the exegesis aims to broaden existing scholarship on performativity, liveness and the part-sculptural object, exploring the manners in which various cultural practices act to animate objects. I reconsider the Euro-American genealogies of performance/body art (Bruce Nauman, Lygia Clark, Ann Hamilton et al.) in relationship to contemporary art practices in Australia and New Zealand (Alicia Frankvich, Carolyn Eskdale et al.) through the lens of late 19th-and early 20th-century writing on sympathetic magical action. A legacy of cultural anthropology dealing with magic (that was privileged in establishing grounding aspects of structural linguistics) circulates around the British anthropologist Stanley J. Tambiah whose thinking on persuasive analogy in ritual performance draws a crucial link between J. L. Austin&#8217;s performative utterance and James George Frazer&#8217;s notion of sympathetic magic. From such a perspective the operations of sympathetic mimesis&#8212;involving ambivalent similitude and contagion&#8212;are discussed in terms of performative and persuasive illocutionary force. This offers another model for articulating an authentic performative document as an encounter with the &#8216;live.&#8217; A phenomenological method of enquiry, including Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#8217;s concept of the chiasm,&#8212;along with notions of mimetic incongruence&#8212;crucially tease out relationships between the live and the performance document and aim at resisting subject/object dichotomies whereby concepts of embodiment and indeterminate play between artist, objects and audiences are activated.  Applied to contemporary debates on performance and &#8216;objects out of action,&#8217; part objects and images are transformed as partial &#8216;subjects&#8217;: metonymically part of larger wholes as trace (substitution) and contagious contact (liveness). What is lacking in the operations of sympathetic mimesis is precisely what &#8216;draws out&#8217; the body/s of the audience as they desire closure in object and duration. As these questions turn on the body of the artist/self and the audience/participant in performative installation practice, I offer an analysis of bodies in ritual exchange (donor/donee); subjects and objects as transformers: relations of force over form&#8212;liminal, reversible and redolent of lack&#8212;that emphasise encounter in difference to recognition. This is to speak of, in the words of Lygia Clark: &#8220;Tactile shocks to liberate the body.&#8221;</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Part objects</field><field name="subject">Donor</field><field name="subject">Objects out of action</field><field name="subject">Performance documents</field><field name="subject">Sympathetic magic</field><field name="subject">Artist's body</field><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Mimesis</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Performative installation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/441</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inter-organisational cooperation and network influences in destination marketing: the case of www.purenz.com</field><field name="creator">Bhat, Sushma Seth</field><field name="description">Individual businesses from a variety of sectors network and work together to create a successful tourist experience. The interdependencies of organisations producing this experience make cooperation a necessity in destination marketing. Despite the centrality of cooperation and networking in tourism marketing relatively little empirical research has been conducted in this area. This thesis uses the case of the development of the official NZ website www.purenz.com (purenz) to examine the role, form and process of inter-organisational cooperation in destination marketing.  Drawing on in-depth interviews with thirty- five industry members involved in establishing and managing www.purenz.com between 1999 and 2006 this thesis makes a number of contributions to both the marketing and tourism literature. The thesis confirms that there are considerable difficulties in broadening the marketing role of the national tourism organisation (NTO) beyond destination promotion.  The study also finds that destination marketing and destination management are still perceived as separate processes in the NZ tourism industry. In addition, the results of this study provide support for the view that the social networks in which firms are embedded have a considerable influence on inter-organisational alliance formation. This thesis contributes to the development of theoretical approaches to the study of cooperation in destination marketing by identifying five levels of cooperation in destination marketing: passive acceptance, support, alignment, contribution and pooling.  The levels are based on the different types of input that may be required from stakeholders by the NTO.  The level of cooperation desired in a particular context is a strategic choice to be made by the destination marketing management.  This choice is affected by the existing characteristics of the tourism network; the NTO leaders&#8217; perception of the need for and value of cooperation in destination marketing and also by the extent of shared understanding of the scope of destination marketing management among tourism stakeholders. The research points to the need to develop further the network characteristics affecting cooperation in destination marketing.  Further work is also needed to develop a more complete profile of the five levels of cooperation identified by this study and the investment required to achieve each level of cooperation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Destination marketing</field><field name="subject">Strategic alliances</field><field name="subject">Network</field><field name="subject">Tourism marketing</field><field name="subject">Inter-organisational cooperation</field><field name="subject">Case study methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/448</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextual information retrieval from the WWW</field><field name="creator">Limbu, Dilip Kumar</field><field name="description">Contextual information retrieval (CIR) is a critical technique for today&#8217;s search engines in terms of facilitating queries and returning relevant information. Despite its importance, little progress has been made in its application, due to the difficulty of capturing and representing contextual information about users. This thesis details the development and evaluation of the contextual SERL search, designed to tackle some of the challenges associated with CIR from the World Wide Web. The contextual SERL search utilises a rich contextual model that exploits implicit and explicit data to modify queries to more accurately reflect the user&#8217;s interests as well as to continually build the user&#8217;s contextual profile and a shared contextual knowledge base. These profiles are used to filter results from a standard search engine to improve the relevance of the pages displayed to the user. The contextual SERL search has been tested in an observational study that has captured both qualitative and quantitative data about the ability of the framework to improve the user&#8217;s web search experience. A total of 30 subjects, with different levels of search experience, participated in the observational study experiment. The results demonstrate that when the contextual profile and the shared contextual knowledge base are used, the contextual SERL search improves search effectiveness, efficiency and subjective satisfaction. The effectiveness improves as subjects have actually entered fewer queries to reach the target information in comparison to the contemporary search engine. In the case of a particularly complex search task, the efficiency improves as subjects have browsed fewer hits, visited fewer URLs, made fewer clicks and have taken less time to reach the target information when compared to the contemporary search engine. Finally, subjects have expressed a higher degree of satisfaction on the quality of contextual support when using the shared contextual knowledge base in comparison to using their contextual profile. These results suggest that integration of a user&#8217;s contextual factors and information seeking behaviours are very important for successful development of the CIR framework. It is believed that this framework and other similar projects will help provide the basis for the next generation of contextual information retrieval from the Web.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retrieval models</field><field name="subject">Personalized Web search</field><field name="subject">Contextual search</field><field name="subject">User profile</field><field name="subject">Relevance feedback</field><field name="subject">Query formulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/450</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The making of a journalist: the New Zealand way</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Ruth</field><field name="description">This study is a first of its kind for New Zealand journalism education, following 20 students at two different schools throughout a year-long training programme. It used two methods to gain a deeper understanding: a discourse analysis of their news stories written at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the year, and retrospective protocol analysis, to provide insight into their thinking processes, through their taped reflections. The research found that journalism education controlled by the New Zealand Journalists Training Organisation still resembles that of 20 years ago, despite increasing numbers of students learning journalism as part of degree programmes. Students are trained for the media industry through learning by doing. They receive basic instruction and then are expected to perfect their skills by practising their writing and to learn the conventions and routines of the media industry through socialisation and work experience. In the first half of the year, the students developed some skills in writing the traditional inverted-pyramid news stories. However, by the end of the year, their news writing showed technical signs of regression. Firstly, they were not writing in a succinct, clear fashion, emphasising news values. Secondly, they had been inadequately trained to write outside of the inverted-pyramid news story or to use popular &#8220;soft&#8221; lead sentences, so that their writing tended towards being promotional. Thirdly, journalism institutions strongly favour subediting by tutors and this detracted from the students gaining understanding of their own writing and being able to self-monitor and evaluate it. Lastly, they failed to show the critical thinking skills and independence necessary for a professional journalist so that they could research thoroughly, reflect deeply and write entertaining, informative and important news stories with flair. Their reflections confirmed these findings, suggesting some stress and disillusionment. The students could &#8220;declare&#8221; what they knew about writing a news story but could not put it into practice. They blamed their failure to write high quality news stories on the pressures of the course, the deadlines and high volumes of stories. The gaps in their journalism education were also revealed through what was not mentioned in their taped reflections: in particular, they failed to mention the importance of news values in making their stories more appealing. The major influence at first was the students&#8217; tutors, followed by work experience and the &#8220;real world&#8221; of the media industry. The concentration on job skills and gaining a job coupled with a lack of knowledge and discussion provided the students with an incomplete understanding of the pressures of the media industry they were entering.  The study recommends more debate about journalism education and more research, as well as a change away from &#8220;learning by doing&#8221; to a more critical, reflective approach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Journalism education</field><field name="subject">Skills-based training</field><field name="subject">Advantages of reflective practice</field><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Thinking-aloud</field><field name="subject">Learning by doing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/466</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Obesity and its determinants in girls from five ethnic groups</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In light of alarming rises in the prevalence of obesity worldwide, tackling the obesity &#8216;epidemic&#8217; is now a national health priority in many countries. Increasingly, population measures that provide accurate estimates of body fatness in children are required. Body mass index (BMI), or weight standardised for height, remains the most cost-effective and practical tool in this regard. However, there is evidence that the association between BMI and body fatness is variable in children from different ethnic backgrounds. The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate the appropriateness of BMI thresholds for defining overweight and obesity in female children and adolescents from five diverse ethnic groups. Secondary objectives were to examine the associations between weight control practices and perceptions, and to compare objectively-measured physical activity levels with participation in active transport (AT). In order to achieve the primary aim stated above, it was necessary to obtain valid and reliable measures of body fat percentage (%BF) in a large sample of children. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is well suited for this purpose, providing a portable and cost-effective means to estimate fat-free mass (and subsequently %BF). While equations exist for European, Maori, and Pacific Island children, findings from the preliminary study described in Chapter 2 demonstrate that there are no BIA equations appropriate for Chinese and Indian children. Given that these two groups are two of the fastest growing ethnicities in New Zealand, a new equation was developed that enables Asian girls to be included in future BIA research. The main study of this thesis involved a large-scale investigation of body composition in New Zealand&#8217;s five major ethnic groups (European, Maori, Pacific Island, East Asian, and South Asian). A total of 1,081 adolescent girls aged 11-16 years participated in the Girls&#8217; Activity and Body Composition (ABC) Study. To extend the age range, data were combined with another study of 5-11-year-old New Zealand children (595 girls), coined the Body-Size and Steps in Children (BASIC) Study. Both studies measured BMI from height and weight, %BF from bio impedance measurements, and physical activity using sealed multiday memory pedometers over five consecutive days. A questionnaire was also administered to the adolescent-aged girls to gather data related to weight perceptions and practices. Initial analyses of the main dataset demonstrated that existing BMI definitions of overweight were relatively insensitive for predicting excess %BF in South and East Asian girls. Conversely, low specificity was observed for Pacific Island and Maori children. These findings provided the rationale for the second set of analyses: the development of BMI cut-off points that correspond to an equivalent level of %BF across all ethnicities. The adjusted BMI curves for overweight and obesity ranged from an average of 3.3 and 3.8 kg.m-2 (respectively) lower than international standards in South Asian girls to 1.5 and 1.9 kg.m-2 higher in Pacific Island girls. Clearly, the proposed changes will have significant effect on our estimates of overweight and obesity in this population group. Subsequent investigation revealed that many adolescent girls misclassify their weight status. However, the number of girls trying to lose weight exceeded those who perceived themselves as being overweight, with the magnitude of the difference dependent on ethnicity. It was concluded that interventions and educational campaigns that assist girls in recognising a state of excess body fat are a priority for all ethnic groups to ensure that behavioural changes necessary to combat widespread overweight and obesity are adopted. Finally, it was observed that the physical activity levels of the participants were significantly lower on weekends (9,528 &#61617; 4,407) than on weekdays (12,597 &#61617; 3,630). Furthermore, a consistent decline in daily step counts was observed with age: after adjustment for ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES), girls in school years 9-10 achieved 2,469 (weekday) and 4,011 (weekend) fewer steps than girls in years 1-2. Daily step counts also varied by ethnicity, with Maori girls the most active and South Asian girls the least active. Overall, girls who used AT to and from school averaged 1,052 more weekday steps than those who did not use AT. These data suggest that adolescent-aged girls and girls of Asian descent are priority groups for future physical activity interventions, and that the promotion of AT in girls appears to be worthwhile.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Body mass index</field><field name="subject">Body fat</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/463</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gendered embodiment and critical tourism - exploring Italian women's sensuality</field><field name="creator">Abramovici, Martine</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of Italian women&#8217;s sensual embodiment in leisure and tourism experiences (involving beautifying in the city and tanning at the beach) in, and around, the city of Rome. The central link in this thesis connects the field of tourism studies with social cultural theories of the &#8216;body&#8217;, placing this research within the most recent theoretical debates on the body. It is argued that in everyday life people take their bodies for granted, yet the body is absolutely crucial to the way we engage with the world and the people around us. Through analysing Italian women&#8217;s embodiment, this thesis seeks to gain in-depth understanding of Italian society and more particularly women&#8217;s position in society, thereby positioning the field of tourism studies as a means for analysing people&#8217;s quotidian cultural habits. Embracing the critical paradigm, this thesis takes a reflexive and embodied approach to research, challenging the all-pervasive hegemonic dominance of positivist, masculinist Western academic approaches. Through post feminist lenses, auto ethnography, in-depth interviewing and document analysis were used to carry out the field work, with the central aim of capturing and contextualising Italian women&#8217;s voices and embodiment. This research shows Italian society to be strongly patriarchal, reflecting gender inequity and inequality. Women are dominated in discourse (politics, senior management and television shows being predominantly male), pressured into family roles, and objectified in society through the media and the male gaze. Paradoxically, women are empowered through choosing to reproduce patriarchal values of beauty and objectification (the power of the agency), and to embody these in a sensual and sensuous way, thereby reversing power relations in their favour. Aiming to understand Italian society through exploring women&#8217;s sensual embodiment, this thesis contributes to a broader understanding of the gendered construction of social identity, and of patriarchy and power relations, from a woman&#8217;s perspective. It contributes to gender and body studies in the tourism field through bringing these separate fields together, through exploring the power of agency in embodiment, and through the critical research approach to the body.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical tourism</field><field name="subject">Reflexivity</field><field name="subject">Embodiment</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Patriarchy</field><field name="subject">Tanning</field><field name="subject">Italy</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/465</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Patterns in a world in slippage": playback theatre as professional development in three primary healthcare centres in Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Day, Fe</field><field name="description">This thesis is an account of praxis: it examines Playback conceptually, and portrays a programme of practical work exploring the experience of workplace audiences of five Playback Theatre performances, delivered from 2002-2005. The aim of the performances was to assist multi-disciplinary teams of staff in community health centres in Auckland New Zealand to communicate and work together with more understanding of each other. The thesis describes Playback as a way not only to elicit complex narratives which allow for diverse points of view to be expressed, but also as an aesthetic reworking of these narratives using action, music, dance, gesture and speech, in ways which have been influenced by 20th century avant-garde forms such as surrealism, dada, collage, jazz and poetry. Unlike some forms of theatre, Playback calls on elements of ritual and group method, in that it relies on audience members taking an active part in the performance by contributing narratives from their own lives. The thesis interrogates the notion of audience in theatre, using the words audience, spectator, spectactor, participant, public and polis, and specifically investigates two moments of the theatre as polis, in the French and Russian revolutions, when the potential of theatre to engage with the widest cross-section of the nation led to influential experiments and innovations in theatrical practice, each of which influenced the succeeding century. Some Playback discourse and practice is found to contain simplistic, even nostalgic, concepts of personal narrative, and the potential for performers&#8217; interpretations in Playback to reinscribe social privilege is noted. In spite of its simple structure, Playback demands extremely complex skills from all the performers, not only the facilitator. In addition, the complex setting of the practical work encompasses both local NZ health initiatives and developments in global health. The work in each Healthcare Centre is described in a complete chapter: each containing details of the Centre and the Playback, seen through the findings of the patient focus groups, through comments made in interviews by the staff and through the researcher&#8217;s observation and experience. In all three Centres, existential and emancipatory metanarratives surfaced in the performances and in interviews. Professionalism was seen as meaning different things: at Ng&#257;kau it was a measure by which people were found to be unsatisfactory; at Oranga, it referred to applying the lessons of the Playback to one&#8217;s own practice; while at P&#257;taka, professionalism was evident in narratives of self care, dedication and seeking clarification and support from peers. While the study revealed limitations of Playback, it also pointed to some unique contributions this form of improvisational theatre can make to a programme of staff or group development. In particular, Playback can open up spaces, people and topics, for non-dogmatic, pluralistic, embodied thinking and reflection, leading people to more nuanced understandings of themselves and each other, and can even affect attitudes and behaviours.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="subject">Audience</field><field name="subject">Playback theatre</field><field name="subject">Staff development</field><field name="subject">Radical hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Primary healthcare</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/474</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial reports</field><field name="creator">Chiang, Christina</field><field name="description">There has been a dearth of research on &#8216;auditors and environmental matters&#8217; since Collison (1996) and Collison and Gray (1997) completed their study on the views of UK auditors about whether auditing is changing, or should be changing, in relation to environmental concerns. It is now more than ten years since the publication of that study. Growing international concern for environmental matters has since led to the issue of International Auditing Practice Statement (IAPS) -1010: The consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial report in 1998 and, in New Zealand, Audit Guidance Statement (AGS) -1010: The consideration of environmental matters in the audit of a financial statement in 2001. Yet, to date, there has been no examination of the impact of IAPS-1010 or AGS-1010 on either current audit practice, or the issues raised by Collison (1996) and Collison and Gray (1997). This doctoral thesis has attempted to address the environmental impact gap in the auditing research literature. In particular, it has investigated the consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial reports in the light of AGS-1010, with a view to understanding better the following issues: (1) how auditors generally perceive the consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial reports; (2) the common approaches and practices auditors undertake when auditing environmental matters; (3) the challenges (if any) that auditors face in the audit of environmental matters (4) the impact (if any) of AGS 1010 on current audit practice and, finally, (5) how current practices in the audit of environmental matters may be improved and further developed to meet better the espoused aims of AGS-1010. Qualitative interviews with twenty-seven senior financial audit practitioners and others in New Zealand provided the basis for the findings. The interviews were taped, transcribed and managed with the use of computerised qualitative analysis software (NViVo7). Key findings from the research interviews were as follows: (1) the introduction of AGS-1010 had little impact on current audit practice in New Zealand; (2) environmental matters were treated no differently from any other audit issues, and auditors tended to apply common, familiar audit approaches in dealing with environmental matters; (3) auditors found the effective auditing of environmental matters challenging owing to their inability to identify such matters, and their lack of relevant expert knowledge. The most significant finding from this study is that, in general, common audit practices were riddled with issues of concern. These issues point to a broader and more significant problem. It would seem that current audit practices fail to consider many potential audit issues (including environmental matters) adequately in the audit of financial reports. For auditors to be more effective in their audit practice and in protecting the public interest, not only does audit methodology need a major review, but auditors themselves need to change their attitudes and mindsets in their approach to auditing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Financial auditing</field><field name="subject">Environmental matters</field><field name="subject">Audit practice</field><field name="subject">Financial reporting</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Legitimacy theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the teacher-student relationship in teacher education: a hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry</field><field name="creator">Giles, David Laurance</field><field name="description">The relationship between teacher and student has always been a central interest of the educational process.  While the nature of this relationship can be understood from various theoretical frameworks, research that seeks to understand the &#8220;lived experience&#8221; of this relationship is less prevalent.  This research explores the phenomenological nature of the teacher-student relationship in the context of teacher education.  Stories of the lived experience of this relationship were hermeneutically interpreted against the philosophical writings of Heidegger, Gadamer, and Buber. The research answers the question: what is the meaning of the teacher-student relationship?  Relationships are essential to the educational experience whether this is recognised or not, and whether we are consciously aware of this or not.  Once established, relationships continue to exist beyond the time and space of the individuals influencing future relational experiences.  In addition, a teacher&#8217;s comportment has been found to have a communicative aspect that is felt and sensed by others. A further essential understanding opens the play of relating.  That is, the teacher and student experience their relationship as a play that is unscripted, uncertain, and lived beyond the rules of engagement.  In this play, teachers who are attuned to relationship show a phronesis, or practical wisdom, as they relate moment by moment. The outcomes of this research call into question technicist and instrumental models of teacher education which are presently underpinned by the dominant neoliberal ideology.  Consistent with critical and humanistic approaches to education, this research calls for the humanising of the educational experience through the educating and re-educating of teacher educators and teachers towards essential understandings of relationship.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutic</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Heidegger</field><field name="subject">Gadamer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I understand it well, but I cannot say it proper back: language use among older Dutch migrants in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Crezee, Ineke Hendrika Martine</field><field name="description">The purposes of this study were (a) to examine two groups of healthy older Dutch English bilingual migrants in a New Zealand setting to investigate whether they were showing signs of L2 attrition with accompanying L1 reversion post-retirement, and (b) to identify possible factors which might play a role in the incidence of any L2 attrition and concomitant L1 reversion. Previous research has focused on similar groups of migrants in the Australian context, while New Zealand based research has focused on language shift and maintenance amongst three generations of migrants. The research design involved an analysis of sociolinguistic life, using questionnaires. These included self-assessments of L1 and L2 proficiency at three key times: on arrival in New Zealand, at time of ultimate attainment and post-retirement. Further, an analysis of assessments of respondents&#8217; L1 and L2 proficiency pre-and post-retirement completed by interviewees&#8217; adult children moderated respondents&#8217; self-reports. The findings revealed a considerable overlap between participants&#8217; self-reports and assessments by their adult children. The study also revealed a relationship between participants&#8217; level of prior education and their ultimate attainment in the L2, with those who had come to New Zealand having learned English at Secondary School English very likely to have achieved a &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;very good&#8221; level of L2 proficiency. Conversely, those who had not learned the L2 at secondary school prior to arriving in New Zealand, were less likely to have achieved a &#8220;very good&#8221; level of ultimate attainment as evident both from self-reports and assessments by adult children. The design also included a linguistic analysis of elicited free speech. Data focused on key indicators of age, gender, social class, prior education, occupation and predominant linguistic environment pre- and post-retirement. Free speech was examined for code-switching, response latency and L1 structure in respondents&#8217; spoken L2. Results indicated that a majority of respondents showed minimal if any signs of L2 attrition with concomitant L1 reversion, both as evidenced by their spoken L2 and as indicated by self-reports and assessments by adult children. Any signs of L2 attrition which were found appeared linked to respondents&#8217; level of prior education and L2 proficiency on arrival in New Zealand. Being exposed to a predominantly L1 social environment post-retirement also appeared to result in a lifting of the threshold for L2 lexical items, resulting in a slightly increased response latency in the spoken L2. Three participants said they experienced some problems expressing their healthcare needs to medical professionals, to the extent that they were searching for words. All stated they &#8220;got there in the end&#8221; but needed more time to paraphrase their health needs. Two subjects avoided the use of the L2 during the interview, even when prompted in English. Three respondents engaged in significant codeswitching from L2 to L1 and vice versa, with two engaging in what Muysken (2000) terms &#8220;congruent lexicalisation&#8221;. Adult childrens&#8217; reports indicated that the respondents in question had always spoken in this manner, but to a greater extent now, post-retirement. Overall, a number of the healthy older subjects interviewed for the study were showing some signs of increased response latency and lexical retrieval problems when expressing themselves in the L2, but none to the degree that they were no longer able to communicate in that language.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">First language reversion</field><field name="subject">Second language attrition</field><field name="subject">Code switching</field><field name="subject">Bilingualism in a migrant context</field><field name="subject">Healthcare interpreting</field><field name="subject">Host society attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/547</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting the work of global virtual teams: the role of technology-use mediation</field><field name="creator">Clear, Tony</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the role of technology-use mediation in supporting the work of global virtual teams.   The work is set in the context of a longer term action research programme into collaborative computing and global virtual teams, initiated by Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand and Uppsala University in Sweden.  Over the period since 1998, global virtual collaborations involving teams of students from both universities have been conducted annually.  This thesis investigates the 2004 collaboration cycle, in which participants from St Louis University Missouri joined the collaboration.  This was the first triadic collaboration, and covered Northern, Southern and Western aspects of the globe while traversing three widely divergent time-zones.  In spite of the extensive experience in collaboration possessed by the coordinators at all three sites, the results of the global virtual trial were at best mixed.  This repeated experience of dissatisfaction in our global virtual collaborations, in spite of the technology being in place has been a primary motivator for this work.  Why is global virtual collaboration difficult?  What roles and activities are critical?  How can we do it better? These are not issues solely to do with the student actors in the global virtual teams, but more to do with the supporting cast, engaged in &#8220;activities which involve the shaping of other users activities of [technology] use&#8221; (Orlikowski et al., 1995, p.425).  Thus came about my interest in exploring the topic of technology-use mediation. This thesis applies a research framework adapted from DeSanctis &amp; Poole&#8217;s &#8220;Adaptive Structuration Theory&#8221; (1994) by the author.  Initially applied to &#8220;facilitation&#8221; in virtual teams &#8220;Extended Adaptive Structuration Theory (EAST)&#8221; (Clear, 1999a), has undergone further development.  The resulting research framework &#8220;Technology-use Mediated AST (TUMAST)&#8221; is applied here for the first time to investigate technology-use mediation activities performed during the global virtual collaborative trial.  A corpus of data based on the email communications of supporting parties to the collaboration is analysed in depth in this study, applying a combination of grounded theoretic and structurational techniques.  Thus a very rich and firmly grounded picture of the processes of technology-use mediation is built.  This thesis represents the first known in-depth longitudinal study of technology-use mediation in a real global virtual team setting.  From this exploratory study some novel theorizations have resulted.  Methodologically it demonstrates analysis of technology-use mediation applying the TUMAST framework in a manner that captures the richness and evolution over time of these complex activities.  Substantively it proposes a novel theory of &#8220;Collaborative Technology Fit (CTF)&#8221;.  It is hoped that future global virtual team coordinators and researchers may apply the theory in order to map their situation, and diagnose their degree of collaborative alignment on multiple dimensions, thus enabling corrective actions to be taken.  While the work arises in a tertiary education context, it reflects the reality of professionals at work in a global virtual team.  Its application within other domains remains to be proven, but readings from the literature, and personal experience within global virtual software development teams suggest its wider applicability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology-use mediation</field><field name="subject">Global virtual teams</field><field name="subject">International collaborative learning</field><field name="subject">Collaborative technology</field><field name="subject">Collaborative technology fit</field><field name="subject">Technology-use mediated adaptive structuration theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/650</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding IS development and acquisition: a process approach</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Laurie Carina</field><field name="description">Computer-based information systems (IS) play an increasingly pervasive and important role in contemporary organisations. Despite decades of continuing research and the development of an extensive prescriptive literature, IS development projects continue to be problematic, with many failing or being seriously challenged. In addition, the IS development environment has changed significantly in recent years, with rapid advances or shifts in technology, increasing devolution of IS responsibility and expenditure to user groups, high levels of packaged software acquisition and customisation, greater outsourcing of IS development, and an increasing emphasis on enterprise-wide and inter-organisational IS. In many cases these changes are interrelated and involve more flexible, ad hoc or non-traditional development approaches. Combined with the fact that at the same time IS have become increasingly sophisticated and integrated, the potential for unpredictable or unintended consequences has also increased. Together, the continued problematic nature of many IS projects and the changing IS development environment, suggest that there is an ongoing need for a fuller understanding of IS development processes and practices. Given the limitations of factor-based, prescriptive studies, an understanding of how contemporary IS development is enacted needs to be grounded in and built upon the cumulative body of research that attempts to understand the complexity and dynamic nature of IS development. Accordingly, this study uses a conceptualisation of IS development as a process in which an IS emerges from a dynamic and interactive relationship between the technology, its social and organisational context, and the negotiated actions of various individuals and groups. The thesis presents the results of an extensive empirical investigation into contemporary ARE development practices based on data collected from New Zealand. The study uses a range of research methods and ultimately develops a sociotechnical process model of IS development as situated action. Following Walsham&#8217;s (1993) emphasis on the content, context and process of IS-related organisational change, the methods used in this study are three-fold. First, an extensive literature review is undertaken to provide a comprehensive synthesis of contemporary empirical knowledge about the content of IS development. Second, a survey is used to collect contextual data about IS development and acquisition practices in New Zealand. Finally, these both support an in-depth longitudinal case study of the IS development process in an organisational setting. The literature review synthesises the results of recent empirical studies of the various influences that shape IS development, using a classificatory framework based around actors, project content, IS development processes, and context. The review shows that, while a number of traditional factors influencing IS development continue to be relevant, other factors have emerged as important as a result of changes to the IS development environment and to IS development practice. In particular, increasing recognition within the IS literature has been given to the relative importance of people and process and of the organisational and environmental context in which IS development takes place. The results of the literature review inform the design of a survey instrument intended to provide an updated assessment of IS development and acquisition practices in New Zealand organisations. A Web-based survey was administered to a sample of senior IS managers in 460 public and private sector organisations with 200 or more FTEs. Based on the 106 usable responses, the results of the survey confirm the ongoing relevance of a number of traditional factors identified in the IS literature as facilitating or inhibiting IS development. However, a number of factors were identified as emerging or increasing in relevance in light of changes in the IS development environment. While the survey provides a useful description of contemporary IS development and acquisition practice in New Zealand, it does not enable a detailed understanding of IS development in action. To address this, an IS project in a large New Zealand organisation was followed in action for over two years. The project involved the development of a sophisticated financial database model using a purchased commercial software package and external consultants. As such, it provides a useful exemplar of development in a contemporary IS environment. The case study illustrates how a seemingly small, well-defined project experienced delays and difficulties as might be expected in larger, more complex projects. It offers insights into the significance of external actors, the importance of full stakeholder participation, the influence of initial characterisations of the nature of the project, and the observance of project management processes. Consideration of the project outcome reveals its multi-dimensional, subjective and temporal nature. A process approach (Markus &amp; Robey, 1988) is employed to structure the analysis of the case study. A combination of temporal bracketing, narrative analysis and visual representation is used to analyse the sequence of social action and organisational processes involved in the project and to develop a process explanation of how and why the particular project outcome in this case study developed over time. Underpinning and informing this analysis is the construction and utilisation of a model of IS development as a situated, sociotechnical process. Drawing on theoretical concepts from structuration theory and the sociology of technology, the model considers the situated actions and practices of various individuals and groups involved in IS development, the ways in which these are enacted within different contextual elements, and the role of existing and new technological artefacts in this process. IS development is characterised as iterative and emergent, with change occurring dynamically from a trajectory of situated interactions (in which meanings and actions are negotiated) and intended and unintended consequences. As a whole, this PhD highlights the changing nature of the IS development environment and the way a complex ensemble of &#8216;factors&#8217; interact to influence IS project outcomes. Common themes emerge around the importance of people and process, and the context in which IS development takes place, while at the same time explicitly including a consideration of technology in the analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative data analysis</field><field name="subject">Process approach</field><field name="subject">Interpretive case study</field><field name="subject">Sociotechnical</field><field name="subject">Situated action</field><field name="subject">Project management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/644</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information technology audit: systems alignment and effectiveness measures</field><field name="creator">Nicho, Mathew</field><field name="description">Information technology audit has proven to be a relatively new, less researched and rapidly expanding field among large, medium and even small businesses (commercial and non-commercial organisations). The implementation rate has grown rapidly and presents a huge growth market for audit consultants due to the need for transparency and compliance with regulation (for example: Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the need to be competitive in the marketplace. The audit process is being conducted mainly by consultants following a traditional process but using different proprietary approaches and mostly done manually. The purpose of this study is to present a scientific method to attach a purely measurement focus to the auditing process so as to provide an auditing as well as a quantitative outcome of the performance to the various IS entities that are audited using a novel automated method that can save organisations considerable resources in terms of time, cost and effort. The nature of the topic directed the researcher to three domains of information system (IS) namely studies on IS measurement, IT governance and software engineering. These areas provided information on the nature of IS measurement and the models used; the process of auditing/measurement and the corresponding frameworks used; the principles and methodology of measurement of IS entities; and measurement models used both in the software engineering and information systems domain. The review of the literature gave rise to the research question and the COBIT-GQM (Control Objectives for Information Technology Audit) &#8211; Goal Question Metrics) model. The research question that had emerged out of the four propositions &#8220;How can an IT audit or governance framework be used to measure the effectiveness of IS entities in a scientific manner using customised and goal oriented metrics&#8221; along with the nature of data sought (positivist), guided the researcher to qualitative research using multiple case studies to test the theoretical model (grounded theory) that had emerged out of the literature review. The theoretical model was automated (with a front end interface and a back-end database) and initially tested for usability issues. Then the common COBIT control objective that was obtained through an initial survey was entered into the database along with a set of questions and metrics (developed by the researcher by following the given GQM guidelines). This application that was demonstrated, and given for evaluation in four organisations gave rise to expected and surprising results. While the respondents expressed their desire to incorporate a customised and goal oriented measurement perspective to their IT audit/performance  functions, that would save them time, effort and cost, numerous suggestions were provided that need to be incorporated into the model to make it fully functional. Notable among them are the need to embed a multiple contextual qualifying layer, incorporating benchmarking feature to the model, and the need to link this with the maturity model. These were incorporated into the model and a comprehensive model incorporating all the suggestions was created. The qualitative case study method being used here more to evaluate a theory, provided a sound base for future studies to generate hypothesis that can be evaluated using quantitative survey methods for the model to be generalised. IT auditing being a relatively new, less researched, conventional and high growth oriented field, the use of an innovative, comprehensive, automated and scientific method of audit and measurement method will satisfy the implied need for organisations to incorporate the diverse audit/measurement/ control/standards into one comprehensive method and this research is a major step in this direction. Since the new model is comprehensive and can be automated organisations can economise in terms of time, cost and effort. Irrespective of the nature of economic cycle the need for economising in terms of cost, time and effort is universal for all organisations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology governance</field><field name="subject">Information technology audit and control</field><field name="subject">Goal Question Metrics method</field><field name="subject">Information technology alignment</field><field name="subject">Information systems measurement</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research in information systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/646</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of acute and periodic stretching interventions on knee extension range of motion and hamstring muscle extensibility in individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee</field><field name="creator">Reid, Duncan</field><field name="description">Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common condition. The condition causes pain and swelling in the knee joint and as a consequence knee range of motion, particularly knee extension, can be decreased. While a number of studies have indicated increases in knee extension range of motion (ROM) can be achieved following stretching interventions, these studies have been undertaken in young healthy populations mostly. To date, there have been no investigations of stretching as a single intervention in people with OA knee.  Review of Literature: To gain an appreciation of the literature in this area, three structured literature reviews were undertaken. The first examined the efficacy of acute stretching interventions on lower limb joint ROM in young and elderly subjects, the second examined the efficacy of periodic muscle stretching interventions on lower limb joint ROM in elderly subjects and the third examined the efficacy of periodic muscle stretching interventions on ROM in subjects with OA of the knee joint. The results of the first review indicated that there is strong evidence for acute stretching interventions to increase joint ROM in the lower limb of young and elderly subjects. The results of the second review indicated that there is strong evidence for periodic stretching interventions to increase joint ROM in the lower limb of elderly subjects. The result of the third review indicated that there is limited evidence for stretching interventions alone to improve ROM in the lower limb in subjects with OA of the knee joint. As consequence of these findings two studies were designed to investigate the effects of acute and periodic stretching in people with OA of the knee joint. Study 1 Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of an acute hamstring-stretching programme on knee extension range of motion in individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and compare them to individuals of a similar age without OA of the knee. Study Design: A cross sectional study design was used. Participants: Thirty one subjects (16 male and 15 female) with OA of the knee were recruited from the local population (mean age 67.8 yrs SD: 5.0, mass 81.4 kg, SD: 15.2, height 168.5 cm, SD 11.1). Thirty one subjects of a similar age (9 male and 23 female) were also recruited who were otherwise fit and healthy and did not have OA of the knee (mean age 68.8 yrs SD: 5.2, mass 71.4 kg, SD: 13.2, height 163.8 cm, SD 8.1). Method: Hamstring extensibility was assessed by a passive knee extension test using a Kincom&#174; isokinetic dynamometer. Subjects undertook two trials of maximum knee extension. The Kincom&#174; then stretched the hamstrings to a point determined as 80% of the initial maximum knee extension test. Three sets of 60 seconds stretching were undertaken with 60 seconds rest between sets. Two further maximal knee extension tests were performed after the stretching intervention. The variables of interests were maximal knee extension, peak passive torque and stiffness. Analysis: A 2-factor repeated measures ANOVA model was utilised. The alpha level was set at 0.05. Results: There was a significant main effect by time for knee extension ROM, peak passive torque and stiffness (p&lt;0.05). There was no interaction effect between groups across time (p&gt;0.05). Knee extension range of motion (ROM) in the OA group increased significantly from 75.6 (SD: 17.2) degrees to 80.5 (SD: 22.3) degrees after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the non OA group increased significantly from 77.5 (SD: 15.5) degrees to 81.9 (SD: 18.2) degrees after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). The knee extension ROM recorded at 50% of the peak torque level pre intervention for the OA group was 60.3 (SD: 18.7) degrees and this increased significantly to 67.2 (SD 16.7) degrees post intervention (p&lt;0.05). For the non OA group, knee extension ROM at 50% of peak torque increased significantly from 60.1 (SD: 15.2) degrees to 65.8 (SD 16.0) degrees (p&lt;0.05). Peak passive torque in the OA group increased significantly from 18.1 (SD: 9.6) Nm to 22.5 (SD: 12.9) Nm after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the non OA group increased significantly from 21.05 (SD: 11.6) Nm to 22.05 (SD: 12.8) Nm after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). For stiffness, there was a significant interaction effect (p &lt;0.05) between groups across time. The OA group increased significantly from 0.70 (SD: 0.35) Nm/deg to 0.89 (SD: 0.5) Nm/deg after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the non OA group increased significantly 0.78 (SD: 0.36) Nm/deg to 0.82 (SD: 0.42) Nm/deg after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The study demonstrated that knee extension ROM, passive resistive torque and stiffness increased with a single bout of stretching. These results indicate that both elderly subjects and those with degenerative joint disease are able to demonstrate immediate tissue adaptations with acute stretching interventions. This is important as clinicians often prescribe acute stretching exercises in the preparation for other activities such as strengthening and walking programmes. Improving joint range of motion prior to other subsequent activities may be beneficial to those people with OA in particular, as management guidelines for these populations recommend regular exercise to reduce the deterioration of the condition. Study 2 Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a six week stretching intervention to the key muscles of the lower limb, in people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee joint and compare them to individuals of a similar age without OA of the knee. A 12 week follow up was undertaken to see if these effects were maintained following the intervention. This study builds on the effects of an acute stretching intervention as demonstrated in Study 1. Study Design: A randomised control trial design was used. Participants: Forty three subjects (24 OA and 19 non OA) were recruited from the local population (mean age 68.8 yrs SD: 5.0, mass 79.5 kg, SD: 14.6, height 166 cm, SD 9.8). Subjects were randomly allocated by condition to either a stretch group or a control group. Methods: Hamstring extensibility was assessed by a passive knee extension test using a Kincom&#174; isokinetic dynamometer at baseline, following the intervention and at a 12 week follow-up. Subjects in the intervention groups stretched the main lower limb muscles 3 x 60 seconds, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. The control groups did not stretch but received a placebo intervention of interferential current. The variables of interest were maximal knee extension, peak passive torque and stiffness. The following outcome measures were also used to assess activity levels: the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Lower Limb Task Questionnaire (LLTQ) and the Aggregated Locomotor Functional (ALF) score. Analysis: A 3-factor (group x condition x time) repeated measures ANOVA model was utilised. The alpha level was set at 0.05. Results: There was a significant main effect for time and a significant interaction effect for group (stretch and control) by time for knee extension ROM, peak passive torque and stiffness (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant interaction for condition (OA vs non OA) (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the stretch group had 68.9 (SD: 15.5) degrees of knee extension before the intervention and this increased significantly to 76.8 (SD: 14.4) degrees after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). At the 12 week follow up assessment, subjects had a mean of 72.5 (SD: 20.51) degrees. This difference was not significant when compared to the post intervention assessment (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the control group were not significantly different for knee extension ROM following the intervention or at the 12 week follow up (p&gt;0.05). For the knee extension ROM at 50% of the maximum torque level, there was a significant main effect for time (p&lt;0.05) but no significant interaction effect between groups across time (p &gt;0.05). The mean knee extension ROM recorded at 50% of the peak torque level for the stretch group pre intervention was 55.9 (SD: 15.0) degrees and this decreased significantly to 50.8 (SD 12.3) degrees post intervention (p&lt;0.05). The mean knee extension ROM recorded at 50% of the peak torque level pre intervention for the control group was 60.2 (SD: 11.4) degrees and this decreased significantly to 57.1 (SD 11.0) degrees post intervention (p&lt;0.05).  With respect to peak passive torque subjects in the stretch group were 13.2 (SD: 7.7) Nm before the intervention and increased significantly to 19.7 (SD: 9.5) Nm after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). At the 12 week follow up assessment, the subjects in the stretch group generated a mean peak torque of 20.2 (SD: 11.5) Nm. This difference was not significant when compared to the post intervention assessment (p&gt;0.05).   With respect to stiffness, subjects in the stretch group were 0.62 (SD: 0.3) Nm/deg before the intervention and this increased significantly to 0.84 (SD: 0.3) Nm/deg after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). At the 12 week follow up time point, the subjects in the stretch group had a mean stiffness of 0.88 (SD: 11.5) Nm/deg. This increase was not significant when compared to the post intervention assessment (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the control group were not significantly different for peak passive torque or stiffness following the intervention or at the 12 week follow up. There was no significant difference for time or condition for the WOMAC or LLTQ scores. There was a significant main effect for time for both groups for the ALF score (p&lt;0.05), however there was no significant interaction for time by condition (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the stretch group had a mean ALF score of 23.1 (SD: 3.9) seconds pre intervention and this reduced significantly to 19.8 (SD: 5.4) seconds post intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the control group had a mean AFL score of 24.8 (SD: 3.1) seconds pre intervention and this reduced significantly to 22.3 (SD: 3.0) seconds post intervention (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The study demonstrated that knee extension range of motion, peak passive torque and stiffness increased in those subjects who undertook the six week stretching programme. Knee extension ROM was not maintained at the 12 week follow up assessment, however peak passive torque and stiffness were. These results indicate that both elderly subjects and those with degenerative joint disease are able to demonstrate long term adaptations with periodic stretching interventions. Functional improvements were also observed following the intervention in the stretch groups and the control groups. As previous studies investigating exercise interventions in subjects with OA of the knee joint have combined stretching and strengthening exercises, this study has provided a clear picture of the effects of stretching alone in this population. However, to gain a more obvious change in function in subjects with OA of the knee joint, the combination of stretching with other exercises such as strengthening, may be required in future studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flexibility</field><field name="subject">Arthritis</field><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Randomisaton and blinding</field><field name="subject">Stiff joints</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/647</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic entrepreneurship in New Zealand's state-owned enterprises: underlying elements and financial implications</field><field name="creator">Luke, Belinda</field><field name="description">The concept of strategic entrepreneurship has received increased attention over the past ten years.  Viewed as the intersection of entrepreneurship and strategy, this field of research is populated by conceptual studies which focus mainly on the nature and perceived benefits of strategic entrepreneurship.  Similarly, the study of entrepreneurship in a public sector context has gained increasing support in recent years, but also remains underexplored.  To address these gaps, this thesis considers: What are the underlying elements and financial implications of strategic entrepreneurship in New Zealand&#8217;s state-owned enterprises [SOEs]? New Zealand&#8217;s SOE sector, comprising 17 government-owned, commercially focused organisations, is considered to be a prime subject for this research.  Well known for their implementation of new public management [NPM], many New Zealand SOEs have also been publicly recognised as both innovative and entrepreneurial.  The research question is addressed by first developing a preliminary framework of strategic entrepreneurship from literature on entrepreneurship and strategy.  This framework is then examined in the context of case studies on activity which is entrepreneurial and/or strategic within 12 of the 17 SOEs operating in New Zealand as at 2006.  Transcripts from a series of interviews, and publicly available documents are analysed thematically.  SOEs&#8217; financial statements over a five year period are also analysed. The thesis contributes in two broad areas.  First, much-needed empirical support is lent to the concept of strategic entrepreneurship.  Key elements of strategic entrepreneurship identified include opportunity identification, innovation, acceptance of risk, flexibility, vision, growth, and leveraging from core skills and resources such that existing knowledge and skills are transferred and applied to create new products, services, and markets.  Important supporting elements identified include an open, flexible, and progressive culture, operational excellence, and cost minimisation.  The nature of each of these elements is also investigated.  A detailed understanding of the relationship between strategic entrepreneurship and wealth creation reveals various internal and external factors which may influence the nature and strength of the relationship.  These factors include changes within the organisation, as well as changes in the economic and political environment, and are important influences on the resulting returns realised.  Second, this thesis offers valuable evidence in support of emerging change in the public sector towards the adoption of strategic entrepreneurship.  Support for the value of NPM is provided, with clear evidence of financial returns from New Zealand&#8217;s SOE sector.  Further, a key finding is the structured and systematic approach to entrepreneurial activity within the context of NPM in several New Zealand SOEs.  Such behaviour is referred to in this thesis as new public entrepreneurship. This form of activity offers the potential for competitive advantage and financial gain traditionally associated with entrepreneurial activity, but also limits the respective risks through its structured, systematic approach.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">State-owned enterprises</field><field name="subject">Business entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Government linked companies GLC</field><field name="subject">Case study approach</field><field name="subject">Interpretivist paradigm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/658</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovery as the re-fabrication of everyday life: Exploring the meaning of doing for people recovering from mental illness</field><field name="creator">Sutton, Daniel</field><field name="description">The notion of recovery from mental illness has become a significant force in mental health policy, practice and literature. As a process, recovery can been described as the lived experience of personal growth and search for meaning after the onset of mental illness. The following phenomenological inquiry seeks to understand the meaning of day-to-day activities for 13 people in recovery from mental illness. In the recovery literature there has recently been a growing interest in the everyday aspects of recovery. Routine interactions between people and the human and non-human environment have been recognised as being significant in the recovery process. Additionally, there has been a call within occupational therapy literature for research focused on exploring the experience and meaning of different forms of occupation. This study aims to address and add to these areas of interest within the current literature. Recovery narratives were collected from the participants in two phases, using an open ended conversational style of interview. The first phase focused on gathering stories that reflected the lived experience of recovery for eight participants. The recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using the hermeneutic philosophy of Martin Heidegger. In the second phase of interviewing a further five participants shared their stories. In this round the conversations were focused on some of the dynamics of activity and recovery that had emerged as broad themes in the first phase. This allowed further depth to be added to the data and subsequent analysis. The interpretation focused on descriptions of engagement in activity during different periods of the participants&#8217; recovery journeys. It was important to dwell with the stories and allow themes of experience and meaning to emerge. Particular phrases and words were highlighted and their meaning explored if they showed something of the participants&#8217; lived experience. Through a process of writing, reflecting and re-writing the findings were refined and clarified over time. Everyday activity was found to be an important medium for change as well as a recovery outcome in itself. Findings add to existing understandings about occupation as a medium for healing and transformation within the context of recovery from mental illness. In particular, the study highlights the dynamics at play in different modes of doing and the way in which carers can influence the experience and meaning of activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Recovery</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Heidegger</field><field name="subject">Occupation</field><field name="subject">Meaningful activity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/662</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imaginative travel: experiential aspects of user interactions with destination marketing websites</field><field name="creator">West-Newman, Timothy</field><field name="description">In this thesis a discursive examination of backpacker attitudes towards and use of a New Zealand tourism website, based on their own accounts of their experiences of using the web for travel, offers a contribution to existing knowledge about human computer interaction. The study enhances current understandings of the processes through which backpackers interact with travel websites by including the social and personal context of their experience.  Analysing interview data on user attitudes and behaviour, it argues the importance of taking into account the use-context of human computer interactions. Placing participants&#8217; interaction with the newzealand.com website within themes of imagination, emotional engagement, and authenticity in experience allows an exploration of such context.  It demonstrates that backpackers&#8217; engagement with websites is shaped not only by their material circumstances but by their attitudes to travel in general, their assumptions and feelings about New Zealand as a place, and as a site for their own experiences.  The research applies usability techniques and methods to observe and inquire into tourists&#8217; experiential interaction with a destination website.  The emotional, affective, reflective and behavioural aspects of tourists&#8217; decision making processes are studied in order to show how websites, as a medium of communication, evoke users&#8217; travel imaginings.  In this way the study contributes to research into tourists&#8217; web-related motivation and behaviour. In addition, by applying discursive, performative, and experiential lenses drawn from travel research to human-computer interaction, it augments current research techniques for studying the social effects of virtual technology and web related human behaviour. The thesis explores themes of representation of place and self in relation to backpacker experiences and frames them in terms of authenticity and trust. It argues that in navigating places, backpackers seek authentic experiences and that this notion of authenticity is mediated by their encounters with other travellers, locals, tourism providers, as well as books, television and the Internet. Websites as travel information sources shape how backpackers think about their tourist experiences; to do this effectively, what the site presents must resonate with the backpacker&#8217;s views on how they think those experiences should be.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experiential</field><field name="subject">User interactions</field><field name="subject">Destination marketing</field><field name="subject">Websites</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/665</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between organizational fitness and business performance: specific evidence for SMEs</field><field name="creator">Young, Stuart Ian</field><field name="description">In today&#8217;s technological environment, organizational capabilities for managing change are regarded as important for business survival and growth. In particular, dynamic organizational capabilities have attracted considerable research interest over the past decade. Recently several studies have suggested that dynamic capabilities may be associated with a concept termed organizational fitness. What is not clear in this emerging research stream is whether firms with superior organizational fitness are more likely to prosper than unfit firms. In addition, relatively little attention has been directed toward creating a systemic model of dynamic capabilities that explains organizational fitness. The nature of fitness has been intensively debated in the biological sciences over a period of several decades. A confusing variety of fitness definitions have emerged from this literature. The lack of an agreed definition of fitness has resulted in several streams of research on organizational fitness. As a result of this fragmentation, there has been little progress toward answering the question of how to measure organizational fitness. The fragmentation in organizational fitness literature is problematic, because research into the relationship between organizational fitness and firm performance is not well-advanced. In this study, organizational fitness is defined in terms of organizational capability to produce variation. By defining fitness in this way, the tautological criticisms leveled against existing concepts of fitness are avoided. The definition of fitness proposed here accommodates both an evolutionary learning perspective and a perspective of strategic management, and thus reflects an integrative approach to the concept. A notable feature of the literature exploring organizational fitness is that it has been focused on large corporations. However, a growing body of literature suggests that SMEs are different from large firms and need to be examined in their own right.  SMEs are important contributors to business in most countries throughout the world.  This study addresses that perceived gap in the literature and asks: What relationship, if any, is there between organizational fitness and business performance for SMEs? Theory is developed and tested here by means of a large sample of SMEs in New Zealand. Two distinct aspects of organizational fitness are identified for SMEs. First, survival fitness is associated with generic combinative capabilities. Second, growth fitness is associated with knowledge assimilation and transformation. SME growth fitness and survival fitness are each found to be positively related to business performance under a variety of contexts. Further, an increase of growth fitness and survival fitness provides a means of alleviating selection pressures for SMEs. That is, dynamic capabilities of knowledge assimilation and integration are found to be positively associated with SME business performance.   In contrast to studies that advocate SME development of context-dependent capabilities, the findings of this study suggest an alternative perspective: variable selection pressures can be influenced by SMEs with a high level of survival and growth fitness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SEM Structural equation modeling</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Organisational fitness</field><field name="subject">Variation</field><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">Small to medium sized enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/671</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RugbySmart: the development, delivery and evaluation of a nationwide injury prevention programme</field><field name="creator">Quarrie, Kenneth Lincoln</field><field name="description">This thesis represents my research work relating to rugby union from 2000 to 2007. During this time I was the Manager of Injury Prevention and Research for the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU). The main priorities of this role were to increase understanding of risk factors for rugby injury, to implement preventive measures, and to assess the effect of those preventive measures. The thesis is presented as a series of peer-reviewed, published papers. A key concern of the NZRU when I undertook the role was to decrease the number and severity of spinal cord injuries occurring in New Zealand rugby. The first paper is a review of literature of rugby union injuries to the cervical spine and spinal cord. This paper was published in Sports Medicine, and the knowledge derived there from formed an important element in RugbySmart, which was the nationwide injury prevention partnership between the NZRU and ACC. The second paper, which was published in the British Medical Journal, outlines the effect of RugbySmart on serious spinal injuries in New Zealand. Eight spinal injuries occurred in New Zealand in 2001-2005, whereas the predicted number based on previous incidence was 19 (relative rate 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.14). The main reason for the decline was a decrease in the number of injuries from scrums, from a predicted number of nine only one was observed (relative rate 0.11; 0.02 to 0.74). Injury prevention initiatives in New Zealand appear to have been successful in areas beyond spinal injuries. The third paper deals with the effect of RugbySmart in general. RugbySmart was associated with a decrease in injury claims per 100,000 players in most areas the programme targeted; the programme had negligible impact on non-targeted injury sites. The decrease in injury claims numbers was supported by results from player behaviour surveys pre- and post-RugbySmart. There was an increase in safe behaviour in the contact situations of tackle, scrum and ruck technique. The fourth paper, which was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, examines the effect of mandating mouth guard usage on mouth guard wearing rates and ACC dental injury claim rates. The self reported rate of mouth guard use was 67% of player-weeks in 1993 and 93% in 2003. A total of 2644 claims were reported in 1995. There was a 43% (90% confidence interval 39% to 46%) reduction in dental claims from 1995 to 2003. On the reasonable assumption that the number of players and player-matches remained constant throughout the study period, the relative rate of injury claims for non-wearers versus wearers was 4.6 (90% confidence interval 3.8 to 5.6). In New Zealand the tackle is the facet of play associated number of injuries, and over the past decade tackles have overtaken scrums as the cause of the greatest proportion of spinal injuries. To address the lack of knowledge regarding risk factors for injuries in the tackle, a large scale study of tackles in professional rugby matches was undertaken. In 434 matches, over 140,000 tackles were coded. The impact of the tackle was the most common cause of injury, and the head was the most common site, but an important mechanism of lower limb injuries was loading with the weight of another player. Rates of replacement increased with increasing player speed. The resulting paper was published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine. A commonly cited model of injury causation in sport posits that risk factors for injury can be considered as those related to the athlete (intrinsic) and those related to the activity (extrinsic). To examine the extent to which the activities comprising rugby matches at the international level has changed over time the first match in each Bledisloe Cup series from 1972 to 2004 was coded. Increases in passes, tackles, rucks, tries, and ball-in-play time were associated with the advent of professionalism, whereas there were reductions in the numbers of lineouts, mauls, kicks in play, and in mean participation time per player. Noteworthy time trends were an increase in the number of rucks and a decrease in the number of scrums. With the advent of professionalism, players have become heavier and backs have become taller.  A number of articles written to communicate injury prevention messages to rugby union coaches, players and administrators are presented as appendices, along with two peer reviewed papers that closely relate to the thesis, but which I excluded from the thesis proper.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rugby</field><field name="subject">Injuries</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Mouth guards</field><field name="subject">Accident Compensation Corporation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/672</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the development of a Creativity Support Tool for advertising</field><field name="creator">Opas, Tommi</field><field name="description">In recent years, there has been a strong interest in developing Creativity Support Tools for many exciting areas of research such as art and music. Yet few such tools have been developed to support creativity in advertising. This is unusual since advertising, like art and music, is a highly creative endeavour of the human mind. The goal of advertising is to transform a communicational objective of a product or a service into a creative idea. A tool that would enhance the development of creative ideas in advertising would be highly beneficial for the advertising industry and possibly shed light on the mystery behind creativity. In this thesis, I developed Creative Pad, a new Creativity Support Tool to assist advertising creative in generating creative ideas for advertising. In developing Creative Pad, I studied advertising creativity and human creative thinking. I developed a framework for analysing the advertising process, in which the process is viewed as having three distinct phases: a message, an idea, and an execution. A significant implication of this view is that the process for developing ideas for new advertisements and the process of executing those ideas and turning them into creative products are independent. Each step is the result of a significant creative process. Creative Pad is developed to assist in the development of creative ideas for new advertisements. To assist this creativity, relevant triggers are needed. Research has shown that individuals with high associative skills produce more creative advertising. Creative Pad supports the associative skills of the advertising creative and exploits the use of the Internet as a dynamic database. It finds words and sentences related to the original communicational objective, providing relevant triggers for the associative creative process in the minds of the advertising creative. Several experiments using Creative Pad were conducted with advertising creative and students with no advertising background. The results show that Creative Pad supports the generation of new ideas in two ways. First, and most important, all the subjects were able to develop interesting new ideas. In particular, the advertising creative were able to design a sketch of the advertisement from ideas generated using Creative Pad. Second, I was able to find a connection between the triggers, the words and sentences selected by the user during the creative process, and the ideas generated. Although the connection might be considered a weak one, it nonetheless demonstrates that a connection exists between the ideas developed by the advertising creative and those suggested by Creative Pad.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creativity support tool</field><field name="subject">Advertising</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Creativity</field><field name="subject">Idea generation</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Web 2.0</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/681</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The shaping of decision-making in governance in the New Zealand Public Healthcare Services</field><field name="creator">Mathias, Wanda Lee</field><field name="description">The study explores what shapes decision-making in governance in the New Zealand public healthcare services. It contributes to the understanding of the impact of the beliefs, perceptions and roles of the decision-makers and the tensions in public healthcare services in New Zealand. The focus was on ascertaining the characteristics of the people as individuals and as members of groups, their skills, preparation and the experience required to make governance decisions in healthcare services in New Zealand. The research analysed data from interviews with individuals in senior positions in public healthcare services in New Zealand, focus groups made up from those individuals and observations of formal District Health Board (DHB) meetings. The context for the study is the New Zealand public healthcare services within the DHB model. This study focuses on the organisational and operational aspects of governance from the socio-anthropological viewpoint of Pierre Bourdieu. Bourdieu&#8217;s methodology was chosen as it highlights the interaction of power and the management of tension between individuals and groups in different, but abutting, fields of practice. Using Bourdieu&#8217;s methodology the researcher has placed healthcare services in an economy of political power where the capital individuals and groups bring to an environment is demonstrated through their power and influence within a particular field of practice. In this study the field of practice is governance in New Zealand public healthcare services. The method involved purposive sampling of participants from three DHBs. The participants included appointed and elected members, chairmen, chief executives and senior clinicians from medical and nursing cohorts. The participants identified 22 abstracts which determined the shape of their decision-making. Through analysis and reflection these 22 determinants were organised into groups reflecting the generic principles of governance identified in the literature. The study concludes that decision-making in governance is shaped by the concepts of professional maturity, quality and safety, power and tension and fiduciary duty within the context of structure and time. The scope of governance is connected across healthcare organisations by the tension of power manifested through the capital individuals and groups bring to the interaction or field of practice. The study also found that there are two aspects to decision-making in governance which allow transferability of the concepts of governance across healthcare service organisations. Firstly, governance is decision-making in good faith with independence of mind and with the appropriate skills, diligence and care on behalf of others. Secondly, the structures of governance operationalised in audit, laws, guidelines, codes and principles support the decision-making on behalf of others. Consequently, the rules of decision-making in governance in healthcare services are the same whether the decision is being made in a clinical or corporate environment. They are enacted differently because of the different contexts. The study brings together the determinants in their concept groups into a framework in the context of structure and time. Use of the framework will enable those with governance responsibilities to shape their governance decision-making from an informed and common base which recognises the tensions in the field of healthcare services governance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Bourdieu</field><field name="subject">Health care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/720</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The theory of navigating cultural spaces</field><field name="creator">Nayar, Shoba</field><field name="description">Indian immigrant women are a growing minority group within the multicultural spaces of New Zealand society. Despite Indian immigrants being the second largest, and one of the oldest, Asian immigrant groups to this country, their experiences of settling in a new and unfamiliar environment have been largely overlooked. This grounded theory study using dimensional analysis was aimed at answering the question: &#8216;How do Indian immigrant women engage in occupations when settling in a new environment?&#8217; In-depth interviews and observations of participants performing daily occupations were conducted with 25 Indian immigrant women living in one of three cities/towns located in the North Island of New Zealand. Theoretical sampling with constant comparative analysis was used to guide both ongoing data collection and data analysis. Categories were examined for their relationships and dimensions to arrive at a substantive grounded theory which has been named &#8216;Navigating Cultural Spaces&#8217;. Performing occupations that reflected either the Indian or New Zealand cultures, or a combination of the two, were core elements in how Indian immigrant women settled in New Zealand. These ways of doing everyday tasks have been conceptualised as Working with Indian Ways, Working with New Zealand Ways and Working with the Best of Both Worlds. Working from each of these perspectives, the women sought to Create a Place in which they could &#8216;be Indian&#8217; in a &#8216;New Zealand&#8217; context. In order to achieve the purpose of Creating a Place, Indian immigrant women constantly shifted between the three ways of working; thus, performing occupations that allowed them to reveal as much of their Indian culture as they felt comfortable with at any given time and situation. Their actions were influenced by the people, objects and social spaces that constituted the environment in which they engaged in occupations. The significance of this study is that it reveals how the everyday occupations of Indian immigrant women are constantly modified through their interaction and interpretations of the environment, thus allowing them to move between and within the multicultural spaces of New Zealand society. This gives rise to Navigating Cultural Spaces which frames settlement as an ongoing and dynamic process and challenges the applicability of current models of acculturation in a New Zealand context. It is recommended that future research examines the migration process from an occupational perspective in order to assist with the development of migration policy and support services that best facilitate Indian immigrant women Creating a Place in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Acculturation</field><field name="subject">Indian</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Occupation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/733</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leiopelma hochstetteri Fitzinger 1861 (Anura: Leiopelmatidae) habitat ecology in the Waitakere Ranges, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Najera-Hillman, Eduardo</field><field name="description">Declines and extinctions of amphibian populations are a global dilemma with complex local causes, which should be viewed in the context of a much larger biodiversity crisis. As other animal groups, amphibians with restricted distributions, such as island endemics, are thought to be more vulnerable to environmental change and susceptible to population declines. In the New Zealand archipelago, the only four native species of frogs (Leiopelma hochstetteri, L. archeyi, L. hamiltoni and L. pakeka) are classified as threatened. In particular Leiopelma hochstetteri, the most widespread and abundant endemic frog species in New Zealand, now survives only in spatially fragmented populations as a result of direct or indirect human activity. Hence, it is recognised as threatened and fully protected by legislation. In the last fifty years, some L. hochstetteri populations have been studied, providing descriptive information, which may be used to assess the current status (increasing, stable or declining) of previously or never monitored populations. This thesis examines the diet and trophic level, the effects ship rats (Rattus rattus) as well as the distribution and abundance of L. hochstetteri on a habitat-use context, to provide a basis for evaluating conceivable decline-agents, and to establish a platform to design directed conservation strategies. The Waitakere Ranges are considered a Leiopelma hochstetteri conservation management unit, on which L. hochstetteri has been previously studied. This area consists of a series of hills that run roughly north&#8211;south, which are mostly covered in regenerating indigenous vegetation. Today, 60% of the Waitakere Ranges fall within a Regional Park, which together with its surrounding residential areas is afforded protection to minimise the effects of development on the region. The accessibility and conservation character of this area makes it an ideal area for the study of L. hochstetteri populations. As a first step to characterise the diet and trophic level of L. hochstetteri within streams in the Waitakere Ranges, Auckland, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were undertaken on a variety of sympatric terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal species, including adult frogs. These results showed that: 1) aquatic and terrestrial food webs were linked by terrestrial inputs into the stream; 2) invertebrate and vertebrate predators separated well into distinct trophic groups; and 3) L. hochstetteri occupied an intermediate trophic position among predators, with a diet, at least as an adult, comprising terrestrial invertebrates. Shortfin eels and banded kokopu were identified as potential predators of L. hochstetteri, but data for rats were inconclusive. The inconclusiveness of these trophic studies, with regard to the effects of ship rats on L. hochstetteri populations, lead me to evaluate the influence of a seven-year ship rat management operation on frog abundance. To achieve a reliable evaluation, the habitat characteristics that had significant influence on frog abundance were identified. Then, it was confirmed that the study areas represented similar habitats in terms of those variables, and finally the effect of the pest-management activities was evaluated. Presence/absence of pest-management operations did not have a significant effect on frog abundance. These results, together with the results of the diet and trophic level analyses, suggested that ship rats do not represent a significant threat for this frog species, at least in the Waitakere Ranges. The results of distribution and abundance investigations indicated that in the Waitakere Ranges frogs are currently widely distributed, relatively abundant and that recruitment has occurred at least in the last ten years. Additionally, in order to identify associations between habitat characteristics and frog distribution and abundance, reliable and specifically designed monitoring methodologies were developed. Although this frog is known to occur in wet areas adjacent to shaded streams in forested catchments, quantitative ecological data previously did not exist to enable characterisation of its habitat. Here, novel data were reported on the current distribution and habitat requirements of this species in the Waitakere Ranges. Statistical modelling demonstrates frogs most likely occur in small, erosive streams with coarse substrates and cold waters, surrounded by mature or undisturbed riparian vegetation, where higher abundances of frogs may be found in steep areas with stable patches of cobbles and boulders lying against larger stream bed elements within the stream channel. Anthropogenic activities, such as clearing or logging, and upstream disturbances that potentially increase silt input into streams were identified as threats to these frog species. Finally, the habitat-use information gathered during this investigation was utilised to develop a spatial decision support system (SDSS) as a tool to assess the quality and quantity of habitat available to L. hochstetteri populations associated with the Auckland Region. These results have important implications for the conservation of New Zealand native frog species and riparian stream habitat.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Habitat-use</field><field name="subject">Frogs</field><field name="subject">Leiopelma</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Diet</field><field name="subject">Decision support system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/736</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pacific business sustainability in New Zealand: a study of Tongan experiences</field><field name="creator">Prescott, Semisi Manisela</field><field name="description">Pacific business sustainability in New Zealand is important for the economic and social wellbeing of the Pacific Island people who have chosen New Zealand as their home. As with many ethnic minorities businesses overseas, Pacific businesses struggle to survive in a foreign commercial environment that is often not aligned to the value systems and customs of their country of origin. This study seeks to determine the key financial and entrepreneurial drivers of business sustainability for Tongan businesses as a specific group within the Pacific Island business sector. The study takes an ethnic specific view of business sustainability drawing on the experiences of twenty Tongan businesses, three Pacific business consultants and the wider Tongan community.  The data was captured in a series of talanoa sessions (a traditional and preferred form of communication based on face to face discussion) carried out in 2006 and 2007. Throughout the study, attention was given to Tongan protocols, cultural nuances and sensitivities to ensure the context in which these Tongan businesses operate was captured. The study concludes by making several contributions to the literature. The first includes the contribution to methodology through to use of talanoa in a business context. The second is the contribution to embeddedness theory through the analysis of specific Tongan business experiences and lastly the empirical contribution to the Pacific Island business literature. The findings have been analysed from a number of perspectives including; financial accounting, business finance, management accounting and business related challenges. The empirical findings highlight that differences in culture and traditional Tongan protocols influence business practice. The impact of Tongan culture on business sustainability is both complementary and inimical. Tongan business sustainability in New Zealand is therefore a product of business practices that incorporate embedded Tongan culture and the western commercial paradigms within which they operate.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tonga</field><field name="subject">Small business</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Talanoa</field><field name="subject">Embeddedness</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/745</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving connectionist systems for adaptive decision support with application in ecological data modelling</field><field name="creator">Soltic, Snjezana</field><field name="description">Ecological modelling problems have characteristics both featured in other modelling fields and specific ones, hence, methods developed and tested in other research areas may not be suitable for modelling ecological problems or may perform poorly when used on ecological data. This thesis identifies issues associated with the techniques typically used for solving ecological problems and develops new generic methods for decision support, especially suitable for ecological data modelling, which are characterised by: (1) adaptive learning, (2) knowledge discovery and (3) accurate prediction. These new methods have been successfully applied to challenging real world ecological problems. Despite the fact that the number of possible applications of computational intelligence methods in ecology is vast, this thesis primarily concentrates on two problems: (1) species establishment prediction and (2) environmental monitoring. Our review of recent papers suggests that multi-layer perceptron networks trained using the backpropagation algorithm are most widely used of all artificial neural networks for forecasting pest insect invasions. While the multi-layer perceptron networks are appropriate for modelling complex nonlinear relationships, they have rather limited exploratory capabilities and are difficult to adapt to dynamically changing data. In this thesis an approach that addresses these limitations is proposed. We found that environmental monitoring applications could benefit from having an intelligent taste recognition system possibly embedded in an autonomous robot. Hence, this thesis reviews the current knowledge on taste recognition and proposes a biologically inspired artificial model of taste recognition based on biologically plausible spiking neurons. The model is dynamic and is capable of learning new tastants as they become available. Furthermore, the model builds a knowledge base that can be extracted during or after the learning process in form of IF-THEN fuzzy rules. It also comprises a layer that simulates the influence of taste receptor cells on the activity of their adjacent cells. These features increase the biological relevance of the model compared to other current taste recognition models. The proposed model was implemented in software on a single personal computer and in hardware on an Altera FPGA chip. Both implementations were applied to two real-world taste datasets.In addition, for the first time the applicability of transductive reasoning for forecasting the establishment potential of pest insects into new locations was investigated. For this purpose four types of predictive models, built using inductive and transductive reasoning, were used for predicting the distributions of three pest insects. The models were evaluated in terms of their predictive accuracy and their ability to discover patterns in the modelling data. The results obtained indicate that evolving connectionist systems can be successfully used for building predictive distribution models and environmental monitoring systems. The features available in the proposed dynamic systems, such as on-line learning and knowledge discovery, are needed to improve our knowledge of the species distributions. This work laid down the foundation for a number of interesting future projects in the field of ecological modelling, robotics, pervasive computing and pattern recognition that can be undertaken separately or in sequence.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolving connectionist systems</field><field name="subject">Local modelling</field><field name="subject">Transductive reasoning</field><field name="subject">Spiking neural networks</field><field name="subject">Taste recognition systems</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/760</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The measurement of the performance of New Zealand tertiary education institutions and the demand for their services</field><field name="creator">Smart, Warren</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the measurement of performance of New Zealand tertiary education institutions (TEIs) and the demand for their services. This involved analysing the research performance of New Zealand universities, analysing the productive efficiency of New Zealand TEIs and examining the choice of provider by bachelor&#8217;s degree starters. Bibliometric data was used to measure the research productivity of New Zealand universities. This showed that following a fall during the early 2000s, the research productivity of New Zealand universities increased following the introduction of the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF). A multi-dimensional analysis of university research performance between 2000 and 2005 showed that no individual university was top in all four of the performance measures assessed. The overall performance of three universities, Massey University, Lincoln University and Auckland University of Technology, were noticeably below that of the other five universities. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was then applied to input and output data of New Zealand TEIs to analyse their productive efficiency. In 2006, polytechnics that had: low levels of bachelor&#8217;s degree provision, were not regionally based, had a high proportion of subcontracting and were larger institutions, achieved higher levels of pure technical efficiency. The analysis showed that several polytechnics could improve their technical efficiency by reducing their scale of operations. In polytechnics, higher technical efficiency was associated with better financial performance. A number of technically efficient polytechnics struggled financially, indicating that the overall efficiency of the polytechnic sector was not high, or the funding model they operate under is not appropriate. The analysis also showed that decreasing bachelor&#8217;s degree provision, poor financial performance in the previous year, an increase in provision of community education, was associated with higher growth in total factor productivity between 1996 and 2006. The application of DEA to Australasian university data between 1997 and 2005 showed that New Zealand universities performed relatively well in terms of relative pure technical efficiency, compared with their Australian counterparts. However, the total factor productivity of New Zealand universities increased at a lower rate, on average, than that of the Australian Group of Eight and newer Australian universities. The application of DEA to a dataset of the participating TEIs in the PBRF showed that polytechnics had lower technical efficiency, on average, than other TEIs. The choices of bachelor&#8217;s degree starters in 2006 were analysed for evidence of a lack of parity of esteem between university and polytechnic degrees. The results showed that a lack of parity of esteem between polytechnic and university degrees may be influencing student choices. Students from higher deciles schools, with higher secondary school qualifications, Asians, students who travel for study, were all more likely to enrol in a university to start a bachelor&#8217;s degree. There was less clear cut evidence of a lack of parity of esteem between selected groupings of New Zealand universities. However, there did appear to be a lack of parity of esteem between the four older metropolitan universities and the two newest universities, with signs the former were held in higher esteem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tertiary education institutions</field><field name="subject">Research productivity</field><field name="subject">Data envelopment analysis</field><field name="subject">Technical efficiency</field><field name="subject">Total factor productivity</field><field name="subject">Parity of esteem</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/761</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ankle sprains: an investigation into patient perceptions and performance of physical tasks following acute ankle sprains using a mixed methods approach</field><field name="creator">Larmer, Peter John</field><field name="description">Introduction: Ankle injuries are among the most prevalent acute musculoskeletal injuries, and are a significant burden on any health system. The interaction of the physiotherapist with the patient and their mutual understanding of impairments, function and recovery are important to achieving a satisfactory return to work and leisure activities.  To date, little attention has focused on this interaction.   There is a need for further exploration of differences and associations between outcome questionnaires that investigate similar domains of pain and function, and whether scores from such outcome measures are related to the patient&#8217;s perception of function and recovery.  Of further interest is whether there are relationships between impairment measures and perceived function, and how actual performance of tasks might influence the patients understanding of their capabilities. To provide a more complete picture of these relationships, a &#8216;mixed methods&#8217; approach using qualitative research methods within a quantitative study was thought to be most appropriate. The overall aim of this thesis was to utilise this research approach to investigate patients&#8217; perceptions of their recovery and elucidate factors important to both therapists and patients that ultimately might enhance their understanding of recovery from an ankle injury. Literature reviews: Three literature reviews were undertaken. Firstly a review of systematic reviews investigating ankle sprains identified a wide variety of management strategies. There was a lack of strong evidence to support any particular management strategy. Hence clinicians are likely to have difficulty setting appropriate rehabilitation plans. Secondly a critical review identified a number of different outcome questionnaires that were utilised to gauge recovery level; however, justification for their selection was often lacking. This review also identified that little emphasis was placed on understanding the patients&#8217; perception of their injury and the rehabilitation process. A final critical review investigated impairment and performance measures and identified four specific areas that were focused upon by clinicians during the treatment of ankle sprains: joint position sense, postural control, strength and performance during function. However, only weak evidence was found for there being a deficit in joint position sense, postural control and strength in the injured limb following an ankle sprain, and inconclusive evidence of deficits in physical performance of tasks related to function.  Methods: Forty participants with an acute sprained ankle were recruited along with their treating physiotherapist. The participants completed a Global questionnaire, the Lower Limb Task Questionnaire (LLTQ) and the Short Form -36 (SF-36) Questionnaire at the initial visit, at discharge and at a six week follow up visit where they also undertook impairment testing involving, joint position sense, postural control and strength along with a functional performance test and selected functional activities. Ten participants were purposefully selected to undertake semi-structured interviews. The treating physiotherapists completed global questionnaires at the initial visit and at time of discharge. An interpretive hermeneutic approach was undertaken to examine the participants&#8217; perceptions. Results: There were equal numbers of males and female participants and the average age of participants was 30.5 years. The relationship between questionnaires for the domains of pain and function varied between low and high degrees of association. The global limitations scores between the participants and physiotherapists were similar at the initial visit, whereas on discharge the participants had a significantly lower score (p&lt;0.05) compared to the physiotherapists. With respect to impairment testing, there was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between the uninjured limb compared to the injured limb for the joint position sense and performance agility hop test. All other comparisons of impairments were not significant (p&gt;0.05). There was no association between questionnaire scores and impairment measures (p&gt;0.05). Additionally there were no significant associations between previous injury and questionnaire scores and impairment measures. Finally in relation to the performance of specific functional tests there was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between the six week follow up LLTQ score and the score following actual performance of the test. The findings of the participants&#8217; interviews identified three key concerns. Firstly, that participants have a limited understanding of questionnaires, and secondly, that there is a difference in understanding of &#8216;recovery&#8217; between the therapist and the patient at time of discharge. Thirdly, there was dissociation between outcome measures and the patient&#8217;s perception of their own recovery. Conclusions: This study revealed a lack of understanding and effective communication concerning physiotherapy practice in relation to ankle sprains. It was apparent that questionnaires purporting to measure similar constructs are at times dissimilar in scores and are not related strongly. Care needs to be taken in selecting and interpreting outcome measures particularly in relation to questionnaires. It was also apparent that caution should be exercised when considering the influence of impairment measures upon function. Physiotherapists should be aware that patients may perceive a lack of confidence in their level of function at the time of discharge. As a result physiotherapists need to incorporate strategies to improve patient confidence in their management plan.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankle sprain</field><field name="subject">Outcomes</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Mixed methods</field><field name="subject">Functional measures</field><field name="subject">Questionnaires</field><field name="subject">Perceived function</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/766</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism industry responses to the rise of sustainable tourism and related environmental policy initiatives: the case of Hue City, Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Bui, Duc Tinh</field><field name="description">Tourism is promoted by the governments of many developing countries because it offers the potential for creating jobs, thus generating income for the country and revenue for the government. However, the tourism industry can also be viewed as a destructive force, associated with negative externalities such as the loss of natural landscapes, congestion, and environmental and cultural degradation. These problems are more likely to be exacerbated where there is a lack of well-designed planning and effective management of tourism development. An essential component of any management of tourism is the ability to engage with, and get a positive response from, the tourism industry. There are a wide range of enterprises involved in providing tourist products and experiences, and in many nations, both developing and developed, a large number of these businesses are small and medium in size and tend to operate at a local scale. The informal nature of tourism enterprises in the developing world can make it difficult to spread awareness of tourism policy and to measure moves towards more sustainable performance on the part of the industry. Using the case study of tourism in the city of Hue, this thesis argues that it is essential to understand both what tourism enterprises know about sustainable tourism practice and policy and also how they respond to its adoption, if we are to more fully understand tourism and its links to sustainable economic development. Located on the central northern coast of Vietnam, Hue is well known for its cultural resources and natural beauty, and the province has become a major tourism centre in Vietnam. The city of Hue itself is recognized as having international heritage value and was listed as a world cultural heritage site by UNESCO in 1993. During the last decade, tourism revenues have increased by nearly 35% per annum, and Hue has made great efforts to both stimulate and cater for increasing demand for its tourism products and services. The Vietnamese government has introduced a number of policies designed to enhance environmental quality generally and, more specifically, to improve the sustainability of enterprises in the tourism sector. This thesis examines the degree to which tourism enterprises in the city of Hue are aware of the broad concept of sustainable tourism and of the specific legislation designed to influence the sustainability of their businesses. I examine the structure and make-up of the industry and then analyse whether characteristics such as size, ownership type and sectoral focus play a role in influencing awareness of, and response to, government policy. The research triangulates data-gathering methods: secondary data, literature reviews, semi-structured interviews and an enterprise survey are all used to gain insights into the core research questions. Each method feeds into and is strengthened by the others, and their combination (including 50 interviews and 180 survey responses) provides a robust data set to work from. The findings reveal that many of the firms operating in the Hue tourism industry are characterized by weak institutional practices, low financial capacity, poor facilities and a lack of broader awareness of policies that influence sustainable tourism practice. The tourism industry&#8217;s awareness of general sustainable development issues is low, and much business practice focuses on short-term rather than long-term perspectives. This limits the use of environmentally friendly practices by firms, especially small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs), in their daily business activities.  The study reveals that there is no significant variation in the adoption of sustainable tourism practices according to the size of enterprises, especially if the practices in question are simple and can be introduced with cost savings. However, as the cost and complexity of introducing environmental measures increases, we see a greater ability on the part of larger enterprises to adopt such actions &#8211; partly because they are in a stronger position to bear the short-terms costs of implementing such approaches. There are a wide range of factors that constrain the Hue tourism industry from adopting more sustainable tourism practices. Internal constraints such as limited financial and human resources are combined with external constraints such as increasing cost-based competition, the lack of enforcement of government policies, and limited awareness of sustainable tourism pracitces. All of these factors play a crucial role in shaping the actions of enterprises in relation to sustainable tourism practices and policies. The results of this study also point to the fact that government sustainable tourism initiatives that rely on &#8216;command-and-control&#8217; approaches will have limited effect; instead, a variety of institutional economic instruments offer greater potential to overcome deficiencies in the ability of the market to drive tourism enterprises towards more sustainable business practices. The thesis also argues that it is important to develop approaches that can cope with the special challenges attached to management of sustainable tourism development in destinations that are dominated by SMEs. The thesis contributes to the growing body of theory and literature in sustainable tourism development and tourism-enterprise behaviour. It also makes an important contribution to our understanding of tourism enterprises in the developing world. In particular, the findings add an important layer of understanding to those attempting to develop a more sustainable tourism industry in Vietnam. Specifically, it provides policy-makers with important insights into the ways in which different types of tourism enterprises respond to initiatives that relate to improved business sustainability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable tourism</field><field name="subject">Triangulation</field><field name="subject">Environmentally friendly practices</field><field name="subject">Tourism industry</field><field name="subject">Responses</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/769</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local and personalised models for prediction, classification and knowledge discovery on real world data modelling problems</field><field name="creator">Hwang, Yuan-Chun</field><field name="description">This thesis presents several novel methods to address some of the real world data modelling issues through the use of local and individualised modelling approaches. A set of real world data modelling issues such as modelling evolving processes, defining unique problem subspaces, identifying and dealing with noise, outliers, missing values, imbalanced data and irrelevant features, are reviewed and their impact on the models are analysed. The thesis has made nine major contributions to information science, includes four generic modelling methods, three real world application systems that apply these methods, a comprehensive review of the real world data modelling problems and a data analysis and modelling software. Four novel methods have been developed and published in the course of this study. They are: (1) DyNFIS &#8211; Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System, (2) MUFIS &#8211; A Fuzzy Inference System That Uses Multiple Types of Fuzzy Rules, (3) Integrated Temporal and Spatial Multi-Model System, (4) Personalised Regression Model. DyNFIS addresses the issue of unique problem subspaces by identifying them through a clustering process, creating a fuzzy inference system based on the clusters and applies supervised learning to update the fuzzy rules, both antecedent and consequent part. This puts strong emphasis on the unique problem subspaces and allows easy to understand rules to be extracted from the model, which adds knowledge to the problem. MUFIS takes DyNFIS a step further by integrating a mixture of different types of fuzzy rules together in a single fuzzy inference system. In many real world problems, some problem subspaces were found to be more suitable for one type of fuzzy rule than others and, therefore, by integrating multiple types of fuzzy rules together, a better prediction can be made. The type of fuzzy rule assigned to each unique problem subspace also provides additional understanding of its characteristics.  The Integrated Temporal and Spatial Multi-Model System is a different approach to integrating two contrasting views of the problem for better results. The temporal model uses recent data and the spatial model uses historical data to make the prediction. By combining the two through a dynamic contribution adjustment function, the system is able to provide stable yet accurate prediction on real world data modelling problems that have intermittently changing patterns. The personalised regression model is designed for classification problems. With the understanding that real world data modelling problems often involve noisy or irrelevant variables and the number of input vectors in each class may be highly imbalanced, these issues make the definition of unique problem subspaces less accurate. The proposed method uses a model selection system based on an incremental feature selection method to select the best set of features. A global model is then created based on this set of features and then optimised using training input vectors in the test input vector&#8217;s vicinity. This approach focus on the definition of the problem space and put emphasis the test input vector&#8217;s residing problem subspace. The novel generic prediction methods listed above have been applied to the following three real world data modelling problems: 1.	Renal function evaluation which achieved higher accuracy than all other existing methods while allowing easy to understand rules to be extracted from the model for future studies. 2.	Milk volume prediction system for Fonterra achieved a 20% improvement over the method currently used by Fonterra. 3.	Prognoses system for pregnancy outcome prediction (SCOPE), achieved a more stable and slightly better accuracy than traditional statistical methods. These solutions constitute a contribution to the area of applied information science. In addition to the above contributions, a data analysis software package, NeuCom, was primarily developed by the author prior and during the PhD study to facilitate some of the standard experiments and analysis on various case studies. This is a full featured data analysis and modelling software that is freely available for non-commercial purposes (see Appendix A for more details). In summary, many real world problems consist of many smaller problems. It was found beneficial to acknowledge the existence of these sub-problems and address them through the use of local or personalised models. The rules extracted from the local models also brought about the availability of new knowledge for the researchers and allowed more in-depth study of the sub-problems to be carried out in future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Local model</field><field name="subject">Personalised model</field><field name="subject">Predictive systems</field><field name="subject">Real world</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy inference system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/776</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the effectiveness of online groups: an investigation of storytelling in the facilitation of online groups</field><field name="creator">Thorpe, Stephen John</field><field name="description">Building relationships in the world of online groups is a recent, exciting and challenging area for the field of group facilitation. Evidence has shown that online groups with strong relationship links are more effective and more resilient than those with without them. Yet, the processes and techniques to effectively facilitate the building of these online relationships are not yet understood and there is scant empirical knowledge to assist practicing group facilitators in this important task. Challenges arise when many of the embodied aspects of inter-personal communication, such as body language, tone of voice, emotions, energy levels and context are not easily readable by group members and facilitators. Many of the well established group processes and interventions that facilitators rely upon in face-to-face situations do not translate effectively or are simply not available in an online group situation. Storytelling, however, presented one approach from the domain of face-to-face group facilitation that might translate well online. Storytelling is well known as an enabler for people to connect at a deeper and an embodied level. It can be highly effective at building strong social ties and group resilience &#8211; right across a wide range of settings. This thesis inquired into storytelling&#8217;s potential for online facilitation practice with the question of how is storytelling beneficial in building relationships in a facilitated online group? Starting with the premise that storytelling will be an effective approach, eighteen facilitators from the International Association of Facilitators (IAF) came together to collectively research the area using a participative approach. The intent of the approach was to involve online facilitation practitioners in the research so that their motivations, ways of looking at things, and questions could have value and that their experiences would be at the heart of the data generated. A variety of online software tools were used including: email, Skype&#8482; conferencing, telephone conferencing, video and web conferencing, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), blogging, online surveys and within the 3-D interactive world of Second Life&#8482;.  The study affirmed that storytelling assisted relationship development across a range of online settings. As anticipated, storytelling aided identity creation; scenario description; describing conflict and to articulate learning edges. The availability of an extra text channel during a primarily oral communication is seen as a potentially valuable contribution to the art of storytelling. In addition, the study offers a challenge to the storytelling field in proposing that direct contact between teller and listener is not always a priori requirement. The blending of roles raises some ethical challenges for online facilitation practice. The also inquiry confirmed that software tool selection was critical for ensuring full participation and buy-in to online group decisions. The 3-D, avatar-based medium of Second Life&#8482; assisted with emotional connections. A range of new opportunities emerged through co-researchers engaging with the research process that inform the practice of group facilitation. They expand the role and horizons of the online facilitator in relation to the wider profession of group facilitation.

Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity have high prevalence and develop over the course of life due to a number of interrelated factors including genetic predisposition, nutrition and lifestyle. With the development and completion of human genome sequencing, we are able to trace genes responsible for proteins and metabolites that are linked with these diseases. A computerized model focused on organizing knowledge related to genes, nutrition and the three chronic diseases, namely, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity has been developed for the Ontology-Based Personalized Risk Evaluation for Chronic Disease Project. This model is a Prot&#233;g&#233;-based ontological representation which has been developed for entering and linking concepts and data for these three chronic diseases. This model facilitates to identify interrelationships between concepts. The ontological representation provides the framework into which information on individual patients, disease symptoms, gene maps, diet and life history can be input, and risks, profiles, and recommendations derived. Personal genome and health data could provide a guide for designing and building a medical health administration system for taking relevant annual medical tests, e.g. gene expression level changes for health surveillance. One method, called transductive neuro-fuzzy inference system with weighted data normalization is used to evaluate personalized risk of chronic disease. This personalized approach has been used for two different chronic diseases, predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease and predicting the risk of type 2 diabetes. For predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease, the National Nutrition Health Survey 97 data from New Zealand population has been used. This data contains clinical, anthropometric and nutritional variables. For predicting risk of type 2 diabetes, data from the Italian population with clinical and genetic variables has been used. It has been discovered that genes responsible for causing type 2 diabetes are different in male and female samples. A framework to integrate the personalized model and the chronic disease ontology is also developed with the aim of providing support for further discovery through the integration of the ontological representation in order to build an expert system in genes of interest and relevant dietary components.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Knowledge discovery</field><field name="subject">Chronic disease risk evaluation</field><field name="subject">Personalized modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/784</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audio segmentation, classification and visualization</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xin</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new approach to the visualization of audio files that simultaneously illustrates general audio properties and the component sounds that comprise a given input file. New audio segmentation and classification methods are reported that outperform existing methods. In order to visualize audio files, the audio is segmented (separated into component sounds) and then classified in order to select matching archetypal images or video that represent each audio segment and are used as templates for the visualization. Each segment's template image or video is then subjected to image processing filters that are driven by audio features. One visualization method reported represents heterogeneous audio files as a seamless image mosaic along a time axis where each component image in the mosaic maps directly to a discovered component sound. The second visualization method, video texture mosaics, builds on the ideas developed in time mosaics. A novel adaptive video texture generation method was created by using acoustic similarity detection to produce a resultant video texture that more accurately represents an audio file. Compared with existing visualization methods such as oscilloscopes and spectrograms, both approaches yield more accessible illustrations of audio files and are more suitable for casual and non expert users.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audio</field><field name="subject">Segmentation</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Visualization</field><field name="subject">Time mosaics</field><field name="subject">Video textures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/802</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mana W&#257;hine in Information Technology: Ng&#257; Kaiwhatu K&#257;kahu Me Te K&#257;kahu</field><field name="creator">Hamilton-Pearce, Janette</field><field name="description">This thesis argues for an Indigenous women&#8217;s cultural construction of information technology (IT).  In Aotearoa New Zealand, M&#257;ori women have established Mana W&#257;hine discourses, principles, theories and practices (Evans, 1994; Hutchings, 2002b, 2005; Irwin, 1990, 1992b; Jahnke, 1997b; Pihama, 2001; Smith, 1992; Te Awekotuku, 1991).  Mana W&#257;hine is the power, legitimacy, authority and spirituality of M&#257;ori women as determined by m&#257;tauranga w&#257;hine [M&#257;ori women&#8217;s knowledge and epistemology] (Jenkins &amp; Pihama, 2001).  Mana W&#257;hine is about theorising, analysing and conducting research for, by, and with, M&#257;ori women (Pihama, 2001). M&#257;ori women have always been IT professionals through Ng&#257; Kaiwhatu K&#257;kahu Me Te K&#257;kahu [The Cloak Weavers and the Cloak].  The overall intent of this research is to develop a Mana W&#257;hine in IT conceptual framework.  The research aim is to identify the key discourses, principles and theories of Mana W&#257;hine for an Indigenous M&#257;ori women&#8217;s cultural construction of IT? IT has the cultural constructs of the dominant society, which design and shape it (Dirksen, 2001; Stewart, 1993).  The herstories of twenty-four Indigenous M&#257;ori women in IT provide lived experiences of colonising, decolonising and indigenising of IT.  The colonial oppression within IT education and the workplace underpin the hegemonic &#8216;geek neo-colonial male&#8217; culture.  Indigenous M&#257;ori women&#8217;s culture is constructed as the &#8216;Other&#8217;.  The Indigenous peoples&#8217; literature disregards gender and white women in IT literature disregard ethnicity, race and colonisation.  The joint effects of being Indigenous M&#257;ori women are fraught with complexity.  For Indigenous women to participate in IT means assimilating into geek neo-colonial and male beliefs maintaining culture-neutral ideology, as a new form of cultural imperialism.  Through such power relations, cultural identity is left at the door when entering IT where M&#257;ori women define themselves as the only lonely, the only Indigenous M&#257;ori woman. The decolonising and indigenising of IT is where M&#257;ori women assert their cultural rights to participate as Mana W&#257;hine in IT &#8211; Ng&#257; Kaiwhatu K&#257;kahu Me Te K&#257;kahu.  In future, research needs to assert that Indigenous women be first beneficiaries of IT (Kamira, 2000b).  Mana W&#257;hine deconstructs colonising and culture-neutral ideologies forming a localised view to indigenise IT for women.  IT cannot be at the expense of Mana W&#257;hine.  For the benefit of our people, children and ourselves, Mana W&#257;hine in IT will always fight for cultural survival.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous M&#257;ori Women</field><field name="subject">Mana W&#257;hine</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Colonising IT</field><field name="subject">Decolonising IT</field><field name="subject">Indigenising IT</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/816</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of bank lending in sustaining income/ wealth inequality in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Saliya, Candauda Arachchige</field><field name="description">The purpose of this PhD thesis is to make a contribution to existing knowledge in the field of critical accounting by studying credit mechanisms and their link to income/wealth inequality in Sri Lankan society and the role of accounting technology in facilitating such mechanisms. The literature review revealed that: a) Global inequality is aggravated by the disparity of economic development which is possible only through state intervention; b) Unemployment is considered as a dilemma for economic development in developing countries by most politicians/administrators/researchers; c) In any country, around 60-70 percent of employment is generated by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and; d) Their major problem is access to credit. This research was designed to find out how the credit system works and why certain SMEs do not have adequate access to credit to develop their businesses; to provide employment; to increase the share of national income to the lower income groups; to narrow down the gap between the rich and poor within and between countries. A case study research approach was followed to extract data on real-life experiences of the research participants. Reliability of data was ensured by using various verification techniques and maximum efforts were made to balance the two extremes of validity of the research; internal and external. The extent of representation by the cases and the bank was tested, and judged as high, with 12-14 characteristics common to the Sri Lankan credit culture and banking industry respectively. Marxian critical theories were used for theoretical guidance throughout the research. The three case studies provide empirical evidence for the existence of the discriminatory nature of credit decision-making where two credit applicants were successful but a third credit applicant failed in obtaining credit. It is contended that the two successful applicants were powerful enough to approach a more powerful bank Chairperson and to obtain credit outside the normal credit rules with the support of accounting technology and using masks such as patriotism and social responsibility. The other applicant, who was initially accommodated with credit at the lower level, could not convince the credit decision-makers at the higher level with expensive professionally prepared accounting reports. This applicant was not from an influential social network and could not reach the powerful credit decision-makers informally was rejected through strict application of credit rules. Deep analysis of these facts supports the Marxian claim that credit and exploitation mechanisms work towards concentration of wealth and sustaining income inequality. Credit decisions supply money to influential individuals and it is argued that such economic power enhances the social powerbase of those individuals, which in turn reinforces the propensity to make preferential credit decisions, thereby making them richer. In contrast, a lack of money translates into powerlessness, deprivation and exclusion from social activities for the majority of the poor. In this process opportunities are lost to disadvantaged social groups and this necessarily results in poor people&#8217;s economic status remaining stagnant. These power-driven, discriminatory decision-making systems not only restrict the availability of financial capital for feasible projects, but also deny credit to potential enterprises. Further, wasting resources on unfeasible projects, while ignoring the need for nurturing potentially viable projects, are a double blow to efforts towards employment generation and economic development and therefore, are detrimental to the economic well-being of the general population. These findings provide insight for policy formulators for more productive financial capital mobility systems in Sri Lanka. It is suggested that suitable State intervention in regulating SME financing could remove such credit-related obstacles to economic development, and work towards a fair distribution of economic benefits to the people in Sri Lanka and beyond.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Credit mechanism</field><field name="subject">Employment</field><field name="subject">Income Inequality</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Marxism</field><field name="subject">SMEs</field><field name="subject">Case-studies</field><field name="subject">Credit decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/824</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of accounting and accountants: an investigation into how and why these perceptions were formed</field><field name="creator">Wells, Paul K.</field><field name="description">There is growing concern that a widespread perception of accounting and accountants is discouraging individuals with the required skills and capabilities from entering the accounting profession. At the same time, an inappropriate perception may be attracting those who lack the required skills and capabilities. Research suggests that not only are perceptions of accounting and accountants very negative but that they may also be inaccurate and difficult to change. This thesis applies social psychology theory on stereotyping to assist in identifying why these perceptions are resistant to change. Stereotype theory suggests that strategies for changing perceptions are dependent on how and why the perceptions were formed. Through a questionnaire, this study sought to identify the perceptions and through interviews and focus groups, how and why they were formed. A questionnaire, interviews and focus groups were used to collect data from sixty-five people from four distinct groups. These groups included the general public, users of accounting services, young people making career decisions, and accountants themselves. Additional data was collected from a further three accounting educators. The application of stereotype theory has assisted in explaining why common perceptions of accounting and accountants have been so resistant to change and in identifying suitable intervention strategies. This study found that the perceptions people have of accounting and accountants are inaccurate. They are either too specific and hence unnecessarily restrictive and limiting, or alternatively the perceptions are so abstract and lacking in specificity that they are absorbed into a broader level category. In the first instance, a single experience is overgeneralised to represent a participant&#8223;s understanding of accounting. In the second instance, accounting is overgeneralised to represent all activity of the broader category label. That the accounting profession, in general, has appeared to make little effort to correct these inaccurate perceptions and has failed to disseminate more widely the findings from academic research is of concern. Overgeneralised perceptions of accounting and accountants were found to be resistant to change for a number of reasons. Participants who created a very broad category label to represent their abstract understanding of accounting usually lacked the motivation and/or cognitive capacity to add specificity to their understanding. On the other hand, participants who based their perceptions of accounting on single exemplar models lacked an understanding of the skills and capabilities that accountants possessed and how these competencies could serve them. The influence of the high school curriculum was a further reason that perceptions were resistant to change. When members of the wider community had studied accounting at high school, their understanding of accounting was narrowly focused on the scorekeeping role of accounting. The perceptions of people who had studied accounting at high school, both currently and in the past, were the most resistant to change. The following interventions to change the perceptions people have of accounting and accountants are proposed. First it is necessary for the professional associations to articulate clearly the advice from the academic community on how the role of accountants and the nature of accounting have changed and to increase the awareness of these changes among their members. It is then necessary to communicate this information to the public by aligning the diverse range of accounting outputs with individual goals while explaining how accountants&#8223; training has changed to accommodate these more diverse roles. Finally, it is necessary to reconsider how accounting should be taught at high school, providing less emphasis on the scorekeeping role of accountants and increasing the emphasis on how accounting impacts everyday life.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Perceptions</field><field name="subject">Stereotypes</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="subject">Accountants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/830</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unilateral conversations: the role of marked sentence initial elements in skilled senior secondary academic writing</field><field name="creator">Meyer, Heather</field><field name="description">This research is a practical attempt to develop academic writing pedagogy at secondary level in New Zealand because from interviews with teachers, personal experience and literature in the professional journal for teachers of English in New Zealand, English in Aotearoa, it appears that this would be a useful enterprise. Literature relating to this, and extending to the related contexts of the UK and Australia has been reviewed. The approach taken is an investigation of top-rated senior secondary writing in subject English, using elements of Hallidayan Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG). The concepts of SFG chiefly drawn upon, namely, Theme and linguistic metafunctions, and their application to the data are presented and explained. This grammatical model was chosen because it allows the interface of grammatical structure and linguistic function to be explored, which in turn permits insight into how the qualities of top-rated writing may be formulated grammatically. This insight may then become part of teaching resources in academic writing by way of both pre- and in-service training material for teachers. Over 100 top-rated English literature essays (graded by teachers) were collected from students, via their schools, so that the data obtained were authentic. Two samples were collected: timed and untimed writing. Each sentence of each essay was typed into one of nine Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, representing locations within the essay. The nine locations were: three introduction locations: initial sentence, medial sentences, terminal sentence; three paragraph locations (all paragraphs in the body of the essays, not introductions or conclusions): initial sentence, medial sentences, terminal sentence; and, three conclusion locations: initial sentence, medial sentences and terminal sentence. The initial grammatical elements and their metafunction(s) for each sentence were categorised. Percentages in each category for each location were calculated so that individual locations could be compared for grammatical and metafunctional characteristics. Grouped locations were also considered where this seemed felicitous; for instance, introductions were compared to conclusions or medial sentences compared to boundary sentences (initial and terminal). Comparisons were also made between the timed and untimed samples. The results showed that some grammatical structures could be associated with particular grouped locations and metafunctional characteristics were not independent of location. The research was also able to suggest grammatical means to achieve metafunctional effects that align with descriptors for writing given by examination boards. For example, clear, logical organisation of writing is highly valued by examination boards. This is achieved by means of elements that perform the textual linguistic metafunction. A variety of grammatical elements to perform this function and their most prominent locations were identified. It is intended that the findings may be a highly directed way to help teachers address some of the writing challenges faced by their students at secondary level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Secondary writing</field><field name="subject">Formal writing</field><field name="subject">Systemic functional grammar</field><field name="subject">Theme</field><field name="subject">Sentence initial elements</field><field name="subject">Linguistic metafunctions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/831</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk and resilience: the role of risk and protective factors in the lives of young people over time</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Peter Gordon</field><field name="description">In 1998, 12 students, aged 11-12 years, were identified by primary schools in a socially disadvantaged area of New Zealand as being at risk of negative life outcomes, as a consequence of known adversities in their lives. The students were interviewed, as were their parents and teachers, and they also completed learning assessments and measures of personal and social concerns. The purpose of these evaluations was to identify risk and protective factors in the young people&#8217;s lives, and to make estimations of personal resilience. In 2008, nine of the original study participants, who were now aged 21-22 years and in emerging adulthood, were located and were interviewed again. The assessments addressed the participant&#8217;s current circumstances, and what had happened for them over the last ten years. The interviews also asked the participants to reflect about 12 resilience dimensions that have been identified in the literature (Masten &amp; Coatsworth, 1998) and whether they considered that they were personally resilient. The recent interview data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (Smith &amp; Osborn, 2008). The individual analyses show a rich diversity of life paths and, as well, three sets of themes were identified across the case studies; and they are personal relationships, contexts of development (schooling and education, culture, religion, and jobs and careers), and personhood and identity. A resilience model was derived from the integration of the data from the first and second assessments with contemporary resilience studies and theorising. The central idea of the model is that resilient functioning is determined by the nature and quality of relationships within, and across, developmental settings. As a corollary, it is hypothesised that interpersonal relationships influence individual executive functioning, and emotional regulation in particular; and that these cognitive and affective capacities can translate into goal seeking and other constructive actions. The explanation of the resilience model leads onto recommendations for further research on relationships that enhance personal functioning. There are also suggestions for social policy that follow from the exposition, and some guidelines for professional practice with children and families.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Longitudinal study</field><field name="subject">Risk</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/837</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapists' experience of working with suicidal clients</field><field name="creator">Rossouw, Gabriel Johannes</field><field name="description">This study explores therapists' experience of working with suicidal clients. Using a Hermeneutic-phenomenological method informed by Heidegger [1889 &#8211; 1976] this study provides an understanding of the meaning of therapists' experiences from their perspective as mental health professionals in New Zealand. Study participants include thirteen therapists working as mental health professionals in District Health Boards from the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology and psychiatric nursing. Participants' narratives of their experiences of working with suicidal clients were captured via audio taped interviewing. These stories uncover the everyday realities facing therapists and provide an ontological understanding of their experiences working with suicidal clients in District Health Boards. The findings of this study identified three themes. All the participants experienced shock and surprise upon hearing their clients had committed suicide without presenting with signs and symptoms associated with suicidality in their assessment. All the participants experienced the responsibility of assessing suicidal clients and intervening to be a burden. Further, they suffered from guilt and fear of punishment in the aftermath of a client's suicide. They also found themselves in a professional and personal crisis as a result of their experiences and struggled to come to terms with events. This study has shown how these experiences could be understood by uncovering the perspectives therapists bring to working with suicidal clients. I have shown how mainstream prevention and intervention strategies follow on from the misrepresentation and misinterpretation of our traditional way of knowing what it means to be human. I show when therapists discover that phenomena are not necessarily what they appear to be they feel unsettled and confused about their responsibilities and what it means to live and die as a human being. The experience of being a therapist to a person who commits suicide has been revealed in this thesis to leave a profound legacy of guilt, doubt and fear. This thesis proposes that it may be time for the profession to care for its own that therapists in turn may not shy back from caring for and about the vulnerable other.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heideggerian Hermeneutic Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Therapists'</field><field name="subject">Work with suicide</field><field name="subject">Effect of client suicide on therapists</field><field name="subject">Suicide and supervision</field><field name="subject">Institutionalised care and suicide</field><field name="subject">Therapists'</field><field name="subject">Sense of responsibilty and suicide</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/841</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakapiri t&#257;tou, hei manaaki tangata, hei manaaki whenua. Effective governance for urban sustainability</field><field name="creator">Webster, Karen Lesley</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of local government elected members to progress urban sustainability, and the views of M&#257;ori leaders&#8217; on governance and sustainability. It is set within a wider context of local government reform and changing expectations of governance and captures a point in time in the evolution of P&#257;keh&#257; and M&#257;ori governance structures in Aotearoa New Zealand. The thesis contributes to the paucity of scholarship in these fields.  Local government has evolved from the early provincial legislatures, to acknowledge Te Tiriti o Waitangi and recognise the importance of sustainable development. The Local Government Act 2002 fundamentally changed the role and purpose of New Zealand local government. At the heart of both Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the LGA was the aspiration for community and M&#257;ori participation in local governance and progress towards sustainable development.  The &#8216;three-house concept&#8217; described in the Raukawa Trustees partnership-two cultures development model (Winiata 2005) and the Community Sector Taskforce (2006) model is reflected in the structure of this thesis. It provides for a P&#257;keh&#257; House, a Tikanga M&#257;ori House and a Treaty House &#8211; a conceptual space where M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; values and practices can come together in mutual respect. The P&#257;keh&#257; House of the thesis establishes a broader role for New Zealand elected members to promote urban sustainability by focusing on cross-sector collaboration and multi-level governance. While multi-level governing was found to be widespread across urban territorial authorities, an elected member focus on collaboration was notably absent. Aotearoa New Zealand&#8217;s urban local authorities had begun mainstreaming sustainable development practices. Environmental management and restoration activity was widespread. Initiatives progressing social and cultural well-being were gaining prominence. The Tikanga M&#257;ori House recognises that the LGA 2002 had failed to bring about transformation of M&#257;ori participation in local government. Where the M&#257;ori voice struggled to be heard, the Act&#8217;s discretionary provisions had tended to preserve the status quo. Two paths to the future are offered: firstly, constitutional change - a new system of local government that recognises the validity of tino rangatiratanga as an equal authority, which could be modeled on the working examples of Treaty-based governance presented in this thesis.  Secondly, improvements to the current system of local government are recommended. They are: - Hui and whanaungatanga, as a path to consensus decision-making. - Iwi authorities be recognised as local authorities, to provide opportunities for urban M&#257;ori to participate in local government. - The status of iwi management plans be lifted, and they be mandatory in the way that a district plan is mandatory. - The mana whenua relationship be strengthened to increase the capacity of mana whenua to consult with tauiwi in their rohe, and exercise kaitiakitanga and manaakitanga. These improvements need to be based on an effective parallel model of M&#257;ori representation, or M&#257;ori wards and seats. The Treaty House presents a case for strengthening a partnerships approach to governance. The effective inclusion of both P&#257;keh&#257; and M&#257;ori communities alike is identified as a prerequisite for further progress towards urban sustainability in Aotearoa New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Urban sustainability</field><field name="subject">Sutainable development</field><field name="subject">Elected member role</field><field name="subject">M&#257;ori</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology, mixed methods</field><field name="subject">Local government</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/854</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The motivations and investment preferences of Chinese investors who migrate to New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Su, Roger</field><field name="description">Chinese migrants play a serious role in their destination countries, and through demand, support high values in destination property and financial markets. Therefore, Chinese investors&#8217; investment motivations, preferences and behaviours have a significant impact on the New Zealand economy. The objectives of this research are: to investigate the preferences (what kind of investment assets they prefer) and the motivations (why they chose New Zealand as their investment destination) of Chinese migrant investors. The findings will be a useful element in explaining New Zealand&#8217;s economic development, and in making financial decisions. It also will be important for the development of New Zealand&#8217;s growing finance industry and equity market. The researcher collected data from 20 respondents who are Chinese migrant investors who have made New Zealand their home. The collected data examines investors&#8217; preferences and motivations, such as what kind of investment assets they prefer and the motivations which drive them to invest in New Zealand or elsewhere. Using a grounded theory methodology, the researcher draws some findings from the data analysis. Furthermore, using a constant comparative method, the researcher develops some preferred choices which explain Chinese migrant investors&#8217; investment preferences and motivations. The core findings (called phenomena or categories) of Chinese migrant investors&#8217; preferences and motivations in this study are listed below: &#61656; Home-bias investment behaviour &#8211; that is mainly China and New Zealand &#61656; Following past performance / herding behaviour &#61656; Seeking speculative opportunities &#8211; high return, high risk &#61656; Over confidence &#61656; Taxation evasion &#61656; Financial privacy Considering these core categories, the researcher re-tested and re-analysed all interview data. Two refined themes are drawn: 1. Chinese investors don&#8217;t understand investment; they seek speculative investment opportunities exemplifying non-professional opportunistic behaviours. 2. Chinese investors don&#8217;t take New Zealand as their preferred investment destination until they arrive in New Zealand. Finally, the researcher reconsiders both themes and other inferences, to develop a theory from the ground &#8211; exaggerated Chinese financial investment experiences are relayed to other Chinese, and influence investment preferences and motivations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese investors</field><field name="subject">Motivations</field><field name="subject">Preferences</field><field name="subject">Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/869</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Keep Sunday free: social engineering through shop trading hours in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Ann-Marie</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore Social Engineering and how marketing communications may be able to affect it. This research takes a step back from other research in the area and considers the decision makers behind Social Engineering, instead of Social Engineering interventions. One way for stakeholders to influence Social Engineering is through influencing the initial decision of which Social Engineering intervention to use. The influence of marketing communications is considered using diffusion theory, which uncovers how marketing communications diffuse through and influence a decision making group. First, the research uncovers the Social Engineering Decision Making Process. This is the decision making process of Governments for Social Engineering Decisions. The Social Engineering Decision Making Process is the combination of Podg&#243;recki&#8217;s Sociotechnical Paradigm (1990) and Roger&#8217;s Innovation Diffusion Process (2003). The research then explores this framework through its illustration in a retailing context. The Social Engineering intervention chosen for this research is the shop trading hour legislation in New Zealand. The Social Engineering decision studied is the decision to introduce Sunday trading through the Shop Trading Hours Act Repeal Act (1990). An historical analysis explores the Social Engineering of shop trading hours, in line with an Historical methodology and Constructivist and Hermeneutic viewpoint. This narrative is created through document analysis and semi-structured in-depth interviews with five different stakeholder groups from the decision to introduce Sunday trading. The historical narrative also illustrates the Social Engineering Decision Making Process. Lastly, to uncover the influence of marketing communications and the media on the Social Engineering Decision Making Process, a content analysis of marketing communications and media over the time of the decision to introduce Sunday trading occurs. Government discussions and reports regarding the decision are also analysed. If the communications influence the Government discussions, then their themes would be present in Government documents directly following the communications. The results lend support to the Social Engineering Decision Making Process.

Tequila is a spirit distilled from a fermented agave, dry adapted lily. Agave is in the family Agavaceae, a notable New Zealand member of which is the common cabbage tree or ti k&#333;uka (Cordyline australis). Similarly, to the agave having a fermentable core, ti k&#333;uka has carbohydrate (inulin) content in its young stems and roots that can be hydrolysed in acidic suspensions or by enzyme hydrolysis to yield fructose. The main objective of this thesis was to systematically research the feasibility of the production of a tequila-like spirit from ti k&#333;uka stem, profiling the chemical properties of the spirit with a view of future commercial production of an iconic New Zealand spirit. The initial stage of the thesis focused on extracting inulin from the ti k&#333;uka stem and hydrolysing (by both acid and enzyme) it to yield reducing sugar. The sugar concentration yielded was too low (~ 10 to 15%) to be fermented and distilled economically. Rather, the ti k&#333;uka extract was evaporated to produce flavoured products by the Maillard reaction, a reaction between amino acids and sugars. The flavoured compounds were then infused with potable ethanol. In outline, the dried stem was hydrolysed with an inulinase at 60&#176;C for 1 hour. The pH was adjusted to 10 with sodium hydroxide and evaporated at 60&#176;C for 65 hours. The dried extract was reconstituted with water, centrifuged and the supernatant infused with portable ethanol to yield final different concentrations of 80, 67, 57 and 50%. The ethanol treatments simultaneously extracted flavour and colour to varying degrees. Next, sugars and amino acids were analysed in the ti k&#333;uka stems by liquid chromatography. The most abundant sugar present in the ti k&#333;uka after inulinase hydrolysis was fructose and the dominant amino acids were arginine, leucine, lysine, and aspartic acid/aspargine and glutamic acid/glutamine. Amino acids and reducing sugar were also analysed at different stages of the spirit production. The reducing sugar content decreased during each step of the process. The relative concentrations of arginine, leucine and lysine decreased while that of aspartic and glutamic acids increased during the whole process of making the spirit. Model systems were then used to simulate the reactions taking place between the amino acids and reducing sugar present in the ti k&#333;uka extract. The colour of the models became darker as a function of time, accumulating more brown pigment containing the flavoured compounds. Increasing the pH and concentration of the amino acids in the reaction mixture also increased the browning pigment formation. Dichloromethane and n-pentane and diethyl ether solvent extraction of the spirits and analysis of volatiles by gas chromatography- mass spectrometry revealed that the chemical profiles of the spirits were different from those of the commercial spirits, gin, tequila and whisky. Sensory evaluation was performed on four variations of the spirit, and demonstrated that the creations were consumer-acceptable. The costs and other issues involved in producing and marketing such a spirit were identified, the major selling point being geographical exclusivity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cordyline australis</field><field name="subject">Maillard reaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/894</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The alchemy of love: recent graduates' lived experiences of psychotherapy training: a hermeneutic study</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Marilyn</field><field name="description">Most of the research related to psychotherapy is about modality, treatments and therapeutic outcomes. There is little research on the psychotherapists themselves; their subjective experiences, their preparation or personal development. Personal growth, which leads to a developmental level permitting self-reflection and relational ability, is considered by the psychotherapy profession to be an important aspect of the psychotherapist's education. This hermeneutic study focuses on students' experience of personal growth during a formal psychotherapy educational programme. The core of the thesis is the presentation of the students' lived experience during training. Recent graduates of psychotherapy programmes were interviewed and their accounts include the process of personal growth, in what ways the developmental journey was felt to be supportive and containing, ways graduates feel changed, the impact on their lives during and after the training, and the meanings they ascribe to the experience. The particular growth experiences of Maori graduates are to some degree explored, as are the experiences of psychotherapy teachers who facilitate personal development. Themes emerged from data analysis; personal growth did happen, was felt to be positive, and took place as a journey. The growth process was turbulent, painful, yet resulted in positive outcomes for the graduates. Love and relationship were experienced as the most significant catalyst in promoting growth towards key outcomes. It was felt that bicultural learning activities enhanced and supported growth for Maori and non-Maori. The nature and complexity of love is discussed; including the place of love in personal change, psychotherapy and psychotherapy training. The discomfort commonly experienced in the profession around describing the therapeutic relationship as one involving love is highlighted. Possible reasons are given for this, for not using the word love in psychotherapy. Implications for psychotherapy education arising from the research are presented; with questions about, and recommendations for, facilitating personal growth, and the utilisation of love in a more open and conscious manner as a part of psychotherapy training. Currently most preparation of psychotherapists occurs in mainstream academic institutions, with a movement in the profession towards more formal qualifications. It is a challenge for educators and students alike to continue to include in traditional academic structures and processes what is felt to be the essence of psychotherapy; love and relationship, the practice of which requires high levels of personal development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapists - personal development</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapists' training</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapy students</field><field name="subject">Bicultural</field><field name="subject">Love</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/10</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Obtaining business benefits from IT: factors that influence the adoption of benefit realisation methodologies in New Zealand organisations</field><field name="creator">Kodthuguli, Saritha</field><field name="description">Almost without exception organisations have become reliant on Information Systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT) applications. Although competitive advantage, task efficiency and effective information management are considered to be among the major drivers for investing in IS/IT, recognising, valuing and realising these expected business benefits from their investments has proved to be a complex task for organisations. The track record of the IS/IT industry shows that there are high rates of project failures, budget overruns and cancellations, resulting in the so-called IT productivity paradox. Researchers argue that the current evaluation techniques (primarily financial) are insufficient to identify, track and evaluate benefits obtained through IS/IT projects. Therefore they encourage organisations to employ non-financial techniques that are apparently more suitable for IS/IT investments. There is still much debate, however, concerning the efficiency and effectiveness of the current evaluation techniques in terms of satisfying the IS/IT investment evaluation criteria.Benefit realisation (BR) approaches are among the non-financial techniques suggested by some in order to facilitate organisations to track, identify, measure and optimise business benefits from IS/IT projects. It appears, however, that most organisations worldwide have failed to change their practices, in part due to managerial perspectives and uncertainty of the effectiveness of BR models.The situation in New Zealand in relation to BR is unknown. This research therefore focuses on analysing the perspectives of IT and business/finance managers' towards their current IS/IT practices. Thereby to investigate the influence of three key factors, awareness, use and effectiveness of BR models those were identified from past studies, in New Zealand business context.In order to assess these factors, this exploratory study employed a positivist cross-sectional survey approach and selected five hundred IT-enabled New Zealand organisations across a variety of industry sectors, sizes and localities as the main sample. The results describe local perspectives on current IS/IT evaluation practices and on formal BR models in use. The report further compares and contrasts IT and finance managers' views towards organisations' current IS/IT practices and BR approaches. Finally concludes with recommendations for practice and implications for further research.Although the survey received relatively low levels of response, some preliminary outcomes are evident. The main insight obtained through this study is that among the responding organisations, awareness of formal benefit realisation and use of formal BR models are fairly low. In spite of this low awareness, there is some evidence of the presence of BR practice among nearly one-third of IT respondents and almost half of finance respondents, who indicated the use of in-house developed models. Some of the in-house models encompass important aspects of formal BR approaches. However the extent of their use varies significantly.Many of the responding organisations, in acknowledging their limited awareness of BR, indicated a desire to know more about the formal methods available. Moreover this research's findings are consistent with the similar studies conducted in Australia and UK. Therefore this study emphasises the need for improvement of NZ organisations' current IS/IT practice by incorporating a BR approach in order to better optimise business benefits from IS/IT. This study recommends that organisations identify the missing links in their current practices through a conceptual framework suggested here and to improve their awareness (and likely adoption) of BR in order to better optimise their business benefits and justify their investments in IS/IT.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/12</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tax avoidance: causes and solutions</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Ling (Becky)</field><field name="description">Tax avoidance is attracting more and more attention from the public.

In discussing of legislative rules, the thesis reviews the various applicable sections in the New Zealand Income Tax Act 2004, taking into account of leading cases, discusses the development in other jurisdictions, and in particular examines the development of Generally Anti-avoidance Rules in three jurisdictions. The thesis recommends the key elements for design a good tax system which will help to restrict the conditions that make tax avoidance possible for the future development.

As an orthopaedic nurse I had concerns that the validity of orthopaedic nursing as a unique scope of practice was being questioned. In this thesis, the case for orthopaedic nursing is argued, by showing it as a specialty in its own right.A qualitative approach informed by my interpretation of philosophical hermeneutics as articulated by Heidegger (1927/1962) and Gadamer (1976; 1989) was undertaken. Phenomenology seeks to uncover 'taken-forgranted' meanings in everyday experience and hermeneutic research recognises that the historical and cultural horizons of participants and researcher influence the interpretation.Eight nurses working in various orthopaedic settings were interviewed. Data was analysed using the interpretive thematic approach described by van Manen (1990). The nurses' stories from practice yielded two essential themes, 'being part', and 'gaining and maintaining integrity'. These themes interrelate and together reveal meanings and insights about being an orthopaedic nurse. 'Being part', shows the essential nature of relationships between orthopaedic nurses and others. 'Gaining and maintaining integrity' describes the embodied nature of the phenomenon.The overall thematic finding 'seeing the world through orthopaedic eyes' reveals the nature of orthopaedic nursing as a unique scope of practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/14</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the supervision of occupational therapists in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Herkt, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to explore the nature and process of supervision of occupational therapists as it occurs in New Zealand. There has recently been an increased focus on supervision by the profession. This study is therefore timely in seeking to describe the phenomenon of supervision. The study had eleven participants with some of the participants agreeing to be interviewed in both capacities those of supervisee and supervisor; this resulted in interviews with eight supervisees and five supervisors. Grounded theory was chosen as the methodology for the study. This methodology ensures that the voices of the participants are heard and that the study remains focused on their understandings and the meanings that they make of the process of supervision. Grounded theory allows for the generation of a conceptual model of the experience. By using the constant comparative method of data analysis a core concept of participating in supervision emerged.Participating in supervision describes a process that is heavily dependent on the quality of the supervisory relationship. It identifies the factors that bring supervisees to supervision and places emphasis on supervisory relationships that allow supervisees to explore the concept of me as a therapist. It highlights the benefits in therapists gaining an understanding of the wider picture in which they practice. It emphasises the significance of contextual factors such as supervision contracts and training, and highlights the issues raised by the type of power the supervisor holds. Positional power was seen by participants to be detrimental to the outcome of supervision whereas social power was seen to empower supervisees and allow a deeper relationship to develop. The trust in such relationships enabled issues to be raised without fear of consequence, or threat to competence. Supervisors were tasked to build on supervisees' strengths but to also challenge supervisees' actions and plans.Supervisees entered supervision believing that they would grow as therapists. For some this was possible and they were able to make the most of supervision. Supervision gave them a safe place to go and to explore what was happening, it was affirming. It empowered them to integrate knowledge, skills and behaviours such that they came away with insights. Importantly supervisees felt inspired. For others, poor relationships and structures resulted in guarding. They felt the need to protect themselves and they began fighting shy of supervision. There was obvious avoidance and frustration with supervision. This study takes us a step closer to understanding the place and value of supervision in occupational therapy in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupational therapists</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/15</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of modernisation theory to phases in Maori development since 1800</field><field name="creator">Moon, Paul</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore the relationship between certain descriptive and prescriptive elements in Modernisation theory, and selected phases in Maori development in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This analysis also extends to consideration of the significance of intentional development, as defined by Michael Cowen and Robert Shenton (Cowen &amp; Shenton, 1996), as the emerging basis for such development.The particular focus within the theoretical framework is on the characteristics and implications of social transformation that are said to accompany rapid economic development - particularly for non-Western peoples living within an emerging Western economic environment. As a corollary of this, consideration is given to the evident conversion from such transitions being unplanned consequences of the forces of economic development, to the increasingly conscious, planned bases for the processes of modernisation being applied to Maori development.This thesis concludes that there has been a discernable intensification in the forces of modernisation impacting on Maori, and that this has been complemented by more deliberate efforts - at a governmental level - to advance this process. One consequence of this trend has been that the alternative models for Maori development have been virtually excluded, even from consideration by successive Governments, and that a singular theoretical model has become the near-universal standard for governmental discourse about this area of indigenous development in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Economic conditions</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Dependency</field><field name="subject">Maori Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/17</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tensions in the toolbox: the meaning of Western acupuncture for New Zealand physiotherapists</field><field name="creator">Kohut, Susan</field><field name="description">Physiotherapists in New Zealand are increasingly learning and practicing Western acupuncture. Western acupuncture as a new and different tool is enhancing and yet challenging physiotherapists practice. This study explores the meaning behind Western acupuncture practice to further understand the implications of its development and possible future direction.Hermeneutic methodology was used because it facilitates the exploration between that which is familiar and that which is unfamiliar. Seven New Zealand physiotherapists qualified to practise Western acupuncture were interviewed about their practice experiences. The data in relation to the phenomenon of inquiry was analysed thematically.The findings revealed a complex array of tensions within physiotherapy because of the differences Western acupuncture brings to physiotherapists' practice. Western acupuncture is a new and useful tool in the physiotherapists 'toolbox'. It is congruent with other physiotherapy practices in that it shares the same scientific neurophysiological foundation. However, the association of Western acupuncture with traditional Chinese acupuncture causes it to be viewed as a complementary medical practice and thus, not completely legitimate as a part of physiotherapy. These tensions are further confounded because the technical rationalist paradigm, upon which physiotherapy is based, values evidence-based practices. The best evidence is perceived to be that gained from the randomised controlled trial. I argue that the randomised controlled trial is poorly suited to the evaluation of complex practices such as Western acupuncture. Such insights also challenge physiotherapy, as a whole, because the available 'evidence' does not acknowledge the complexities of practice involving individual practitioners, their colleagues, the profession, other healthcare professions, patients and the public.The tensions encountered in physiotherapy and Western acupuncture practice have led to a number of recommendations in education, practice, research and legislation. Overall, they suggest a need to develop a more inclusive model of practice development. Western acupuncture is a potentially valuable tool. In order to maximise use of this tool physiotherapy practice understandings need to be extended. This in turn, will assist development of the profession as a whole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture.</field><field name="subject">Physical therapists - New Zealand.</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/18</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silence speaks volumes</field><field name="creator">Jeurissen, Maree  Jayne</field><field name="description">The continuing failure of our education system to meet the needs of minority group students, who continue to walk through classroom doors in increasing numbers, provided the initial impetus for this research project. Researchers, academics, and school practitioners need to examine carefully 'taken for granted' patterns of talk and behaviour that occur in schools every day, because for many children, these are not effective. This study is situated in a mainstream primary school classroom where children from diverse language and cultural backgrounds work and learn together. The importance of the interaction that occurs between teachers and children is discussed and numerous studies which focus on the role of discourse in students' language learning are critiqued. The fact that students in mainstream primary schools must learn language while using language for content learning, is considered to be of paramount importance, and so discourse that occurred during small group mathematics lessons provided the major source of data for the project. An aspect of this discourse, language functions of student initiated interactions, was examined in depth. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to look beyond the surface level of classroom discourse in an attempt to better understand why children interact as they do, or why they remain silent, appearing to be on the periphery of the learning opportunities which are designed to help them to succeed. Classroom observations and individual interviews provided insights into the complex and competing forces which shape the talk that occurs between students and their teachers. It was revealed that successful students have effective relationships with teachers, regardless of whether or not they share the same cultural background. These successful students are able to deploy a range of thinking and learning strategies. The importance of making the 'culture of the classroom' explicit is highlighted, along with the fact that teachers feel constrained by the demands of an overcrowded curriculum and the need to address individual learning needs of all of their students. Implications for classroom practice along with teacher training and professional development are proposed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foreign Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/19</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The H-bug epidemic: the impact of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal infection on New Zealand society and health 1955-1963</field><field name="creator">Jowitt, Deborah Mary</field><field name="description">An epidemic of staphylococcal infections occurred in New Zealand hospitals and communities from 1955-1963. The 'H', or 'Hospital Bug', a strain of Staphylococcus aureus characteristic of the epidemic, was resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics. Post-operative patients, the frail elderly and mothers and babies were particularly vulnerable to staphylococcal colonization and infection. This thesis places the H-Bug epidemic in its historical context, discussing the ways in which the government and health professionals responded to the rising incidence of staphylococcal infection, and the major effects of the epidemic on medical and hospital practice. It also examines the impact of persistent staphylococcal infection on women and families in the community. Primary sources provided the basis for this thesis. The H-Bug epidemic has gone largely unrecorded except in contemporary documents. Health Department files and Auckland Hospital Board records as well as newspaper clippings were important sources. The New Zealand epidemic was clearly linked to the global pandemic of antibiotic resistant staphylococcal infection, 1946-1966, through medical literature and archival documents. International medical journals, including the New Zealand Medical Journal, published numerous articles on the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal infection, providing an excellent record of research, case studies, current opinion, and recommended practice. The most valuable contribution to an understanding of the impact and experience of the H-Bug epidemic was, however, provided by the nineteen people who agreed to be interviewed for the study. Interviewees included a wide variety of health professionals and women and their children, all of whom had personal experience or association with the epidemic. In this thesis it is argued that the main focus of the medical response was the prevention and control of hospital cross-infection, both to protect patients and to preserve the public perception of the hospital as a safe venue for care. Although the emergence of resistant strains of staphylococci was widely attributed to the misuse of antibiotics, this thesis contends that the Health Department was reluctant to impose restrictions on medical prescribing and that Health Department official and senior clinicians chose instead to modify hospital environments and clinical practice. Rooming-in was widely introduced to counter the epidemic despite the fact that a trial in 1959, at National Women's Hospital, did not demonstrate a reduction in infection rates among neonates. The concept endured, however, as it held strong appeal for hospital administrators hard pressed to keep wards adequately staffed with trained personnel. It was also supported by women and health professionals who were convinced of the benefits of a close mother-baby relationship from birth. The H-Bug epidemic was eventually resolved by the introduction of the methicillin antibiotics in the early 1960s. As a consequence, confidence in a pharmaceutical solution to infectious disease remained intact until the emergence of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms in the 1980s. The lessons of the H-Bug epidemic had been largely forgotten in the intervening years, ignored until New Zealand clinicians were reminded once again that antimicrobial resistance would inevitably accompany the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and inadequate attention to infection prevention and control.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug resistance in microorganisms</field><field name="subject">Antibiotics</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Hospitals</field><field name="subject">Safety measures</field><field name="subject">Maternal health services</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/21</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lived reality of men who have been violent/violated</field><field name="creator">Bryant, John</field><field name="description">This qualitative research study examines the stories of five men's lived experiences of violence and violation. It is derived from conversations with the men that have been taped and transcribed. These in turn have been categorised into key existential themes and interpreted by myself as the researcher. The process of data collection, transcription and analysis has been performed under strict adherence to the tenets of a rigorous, ethical and trustworthy qualitative approach to undertaking research. Participant's revelations of their unique experiences of violence have been carefully and sensitively interpreted and given meaning through the lens of my personal worldview informed by a philosophical perspective. I have fully acknowledged my own influences upon the proceedings. The methodology that has informed this undertaking is based upon Martin Heidegger's (1927/1962) hermeneutic phenomenology. Phenomenology emphasises the search for raw experience buried in the text and takes me to the heart of men's lived reality of violence. Hermeneutics offers me a way of making meaning out of the subtext concealed within men's stories of violence. Heidegger's philosophy offers me a particular approach for understanding human experience. Van Manen's (1990) existential life world structures guide me towards violence as it is lived rather than as it is thought to be. As such this study emphasises ontological understanding over epistemological examination. The intention of this work is produce an understanding of the impact of violence on people's lives from the unique perspective of those who have experienced it. Its ultimate goal is to use this information to better understand the aetiology of male violence, and, more specifically, five men whose lives have been situated in the world of violence, so that it may be more effectively prevented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Men</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Violence</field><field name="subject">Violence in men</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/24</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reliability of foot and ankle water volumetry</field><field name="creator">Balasundaram, Jeyakhanthan</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the intra-rater (within day &amp; between days) and inter-rater reliability of foot/ankle water volumetry in healthysubjects.Study design: Repeated measures design with 2 raters.Background: Physiotherapists more often aim to reduce swelling in the acute phase of soft tissue injury. Reduction in swelling will hasten the healing process. Therefore swelling forms an important outcome measure that is worth studying during the healing process to determine the efficacy of the intervention. Though there are different methods available to measure extremity swelling, water displacement method is widely used in physiotherapy studies. Although water volumetry has been used to assess the reduction in swelling over time, there is paucity of reliability studies that have assessed the between-days reliability.Methods: Thirty normal subjects with asymptomatic ankles were measured by 2 raters. Three repeated foot volume measurements were performed by each of the rater using water volumetry during a single test session. The same procedure was repeated approximately at the same time on the 3rd day and 5th day following the 1st measurement day by the same raters on the same subjects. The raters were blinded to each other's measurements. The order for rater's volumetric measurement on each subject on each day was determined by a random chart produced by SPSS. The reliability was measured in terms of systematic bias (Paired t test &amp; Bland &amp; Altman's plot), absolute reliability (Limits of Agreement [LOA] &amp; Standard Error of Measurement [SEM]) and relative reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC]).Results: There was no systematic bias between any of the trials within day/between days or between raters. The intra-rater reliability within day as calculated by ICC; LOA and SEM were 0.99, &#177;10ml and &#177;3.5ml respectively and for between days reliability the values were 0.99 (ICC), &#177;20ml (LOA) and &#177;7ml (SEM) and for interrater reliability the values were 0.99 (ICC), &#177;13ml (LOA) and &#177;5ml (SEM). The results demonstrated that water volumetry method was highly reliable within day and between days for both the raters; and highly reliable between raters.Conclusion: Water volumetry is a highly reliable method for measuring foot/ankle volume repeatedly on different days. The random error range in milliliters (ml) as estimated by the absolute reliability indices provides the practical use of this method in a clinical/research setting.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankle - wounds and injuries - measurement - evaluation</field><field name="subject">Foot - wounds and injuries - measurement - evaluation</field><field name="subject">Edema - measurement - evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/26</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Luminosity and illusion in the Bardo</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Mark</field><field name="description">This is a creative practice-based photographically researched project that is contextualised by a written exegesis.

Illusion and luminosity are discovered by 'seeing' these within the four elements, and are related in context to the Tibetan Buddhists' belief of an after-death reality.

An in-depth analysis of the phenomenon was completed, with the aim of evoking insights and developing understandings about the lived return-to-work experience. As this research was situated within the critical paradigm, the process of seeking, securing and sustaining employment was viewed in terms of power relationships, and through the multiple positionings of psychiatric disability, employment status and social capital.An unstructured interview process was used to explore the return-to-work experiences of eight purposefully selected informants with a history of mental illness and prior illness-related offending. They were living in the community and had returned to part or full-time employment, which they had sustained for at least six months. The gathered data was interpreted using hermeneutic analysis. This process revealed a number of themes, which were clustered into related groups, under eleven essential overarching themes. Freire's (1972) critical social theory was used to add critical depth to the findings.The findings reveal that returning to work exposes people who are affected by mental illness to an array of challenges and personal opportunities. People who have a forensic psychiatric history can encounter complex employment barriers related to stigma and misunderstanding. Therefore, the selected critical hermeneutic design provided a congruent framework with which to view the informants' quest to seek, secure and sustain employment. Despite significant obstacles, securing employment provides opportunities for individuals to test their skills while engaged in meaningful work activity. The acquisition of work skills can result in individuals' experiencing a strong sense of self-satisfaction. The experience of being bolstered by personal accomplishment often co-exists with, but is not necessarily negated by, difficulties that arise on-the-job.As there is scant reference to forensic rehabilitation within the mental health vocational literature, this study may be a timely contribution. It may also be used to add depth to the knowledge base within the field of mental health rehabilitation, in particular the specialised areas of forensic rehabilitation and vocational practise. Therefore, it may be a positive precursor to further discussion and analysis regarding work and education outcomes from the unique forensic psychiatric perspective.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hermeneutic analysis</field><field name="subject">Unstructured interviews</field><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Return to work</field><field name="subject">Work skills</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/29</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Game analysis in Rugby Union</field><field name="creator">Agnew, Marcus</field><field name="description">Due to rugby's increasing level of professionalism, rugby union performance analysis is in a rapid state of evolution. Coaches, media, administrators and players are demanding greater access to more detailed analysis of team and player performance. Owing to the dynamic nature of the game and high frequency of events, nobody can adequately recall all aspects of the game; therefore performance analysts are playing an increasingly important role in rugby. The ability of analysts to meet this demand is being enhanced by technological advancements world wide, including the integrated capabilities of digital video, computer systems and video analysis software. Most analyses are conducted post-match by reviewing video footage and coding events of interest. Sound methodological approaches exist to develop performance indicators, which, if appropriately collated, can be used to create performance profiles indicative of player and/or team abilities. Sufficient data should be collected to ensure valid profiles, which can then be compared against population norms for more objective interpretation. Rugby research has focused on a range of performance indicators related to game structures and tactical aspects, including lineout tactics, differences between winning and losing performances, which side of the field try scoring predominates, and the number of passes per try. Research has included analysis of the world's top teams to assess the effect of law changes on the game and rates of foul play across different competitions. Despite the range of detailed analysis in the literature, there is a need for a structured account of all logical units of play, defined and quantified in accordance with coaching language and concepts. Player interactions, and off the ball player formations, also present future research potential.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IT and sport analysis</field><field name="subject">Information technology and sport</field><field name="subject">Game coding</field><field name="subject">Synthesis of game structure in rugby</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/30</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning to do, learning to be: the transition to competence in critical care nursing</field><field name="creator">Fielding, Sandra</field><field name="description">Making the transition to an area of specialist nursing practice is challenging for both the learner and staff who are responsible for education and skill development. This study uses grounded theory methodology to explore the question: "How do nurses learn critical care nursing?"The eight registered nurses who participated in this study were recruited from a range of intensive care settings. The criteria for inclusion in the study included the participant having attained competency within the critical care setting. Data was collected from individual interviews. The findings of this study developed during the coding and comparative analysis process, and subsequently theoretical sampling was used to further explore the identified concepts.This study found that nurses' focus on two main areas during their orientation and induction into critical care nursing practice. These are learning to do (skill acquisition) and learning to be (professional socialisation). The process of transition involves two stages: that of learning to do the tasks related to critical care nursing practice, and the ongoing development of competence and confidence in practice ability. The relationship of the learner with the critical care team is a vital part of the transition to competency within the specialist area.This study identifies factors that influence the learner during transition and also provides an understanding of the strategies used by the learners to attain competency. These findings are applicable to educators and leaders responsible for the education and ongoing learning of nurses within critical care practice. The use of strategies such as simulated learning and repetition are significant in skill acquisition. However attention must also be paid to issues which influence the professional socialisation process, such as the quality of preceptor input during orientation and the use of ongoing mentoring of the learner.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intensive care nursing</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/34</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of ESOL teachers' attitudes towards teaching about taboo English in the second language classroom</field><field name="creator">Holster, Dianna</field><field name="description">Taboo English is an area of inquiry that has been overlooked in the research literature. Little appears to be published on the phenomenon of taboo language and its teaching implications for adult ESL/EFL students learning conversational English. This study aimed to investigate the attitudes and opinions of 80 ESOL teachers from 10 language schools in Auckland, New Zealand, towards the use of Taboo English in society and their attitudes towards teaching about taboo language to adult learners of conversational English. The project used a questionnaire designed to elicit a combination of both qualitative and quantitative data. Results showed that Taboo English was a valuable aspect of ESOL teachers' linguistic repertoire and that both males and females used taboo words in complex and diverse ways to communicate ideas quickly and efficiently. One of the key findings of the study contradicted the typical stereotype that females are more conservative in their taboo use than males. Another major theme that emerged was the linguistic prejudice towards teaching about Taboo English in the second language classroom. The vast majority of ESOL teachers in the study displayed little, if any, enthusiasm for teaching about taboo words to adult learners of conversational English despite acknowledging that taboo words are frequently heard in society today. This study concludes that Taboo language is an undeniable reality of English language use and that ESOL teachers, preparing adult learners to understand everyday language they will be exposed to in the 'real' world, need to address Taboo English to some degree. By not addressing this controversial language, teachers are insufficiently preparing learners to become empowered communicators in English.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Obscene words</field><field name="subject">Swearing</field><field name="subject">English Language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/35</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mrs Gallagher, Acts of disobedience: performance and installation in rural New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Findlay, Jules Julie Ann</field><field name="description">This art project examines aspects of New Zealand rural culture through the experience of a fictional performer, Mrs Gallagher. She questions the instrumental approach of agribusiness production, both as it enframes her domestic/farm helper role and the farming of animals. She uses the practices of everyday life, domestic crafts and appropriated materials of agribusiness to draw attention to the traditional ideological boundaries between the human/animal and assigned gender roles.Employing the tactics of 'making do', Mrs Gallagher uses inventive play to produce new forms that cross the domestic/agribusiness boundary. It is her aim that her acts of intervention and these hybrid forms will promote a more mindful use of technology and greater recognition of the continuity and difference that exists between humans and nature.All objects will be presented in site-orientated installation. Evidence of Mrs Gallagher's intervening acts is witnessed and documented using time-based media by a collaborative performer, the cultural theorist K.

The purpose of this study is to show that whanau is not only a social grouping belonging to Maori society, but an aspect of cultural identity central to the future development of Maori. Whanau is a concept belonging to Te Ao Maori, and the development of this concept has been challenged through the history of Aotearoa by external cultural influences and internal responses to these influences. These influences include Western paradigms and societal norms introduced through colonisation and leading to the modern perception that whanau is a mirror image of the concept of family.Modernisation, as an example of a Western developmental theory is applied in this study to demonstrate the impact of an ethnocentric notion on the concept and experience of whanau - culturally, socially, economically and spiritually. It is observed by the writer that whanau remains central to strategies for development as a people notwithstanding this experience. This observation required that the study explore the key elements retained by whanau, for the concept of whanau to have achieved sustainability. Although the effects of external influences have impacted on the structural, functional and relational aspects of wh&#257;nau, it is evident in the findings from this study conducted with descendents of Ngati Te Oro that the practice of whanau as a cultural grouping was significant to retaining a cultural identity. This finding has strengthened the position that there are specific contributing aspects towards a secure whanau identity that provides the foundations as well as the vehicle to progress the development of Maori.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Family relationships</field><field name="subject">Kinship</field><field name="subject">Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">Whanau</field><field name="subject">Kupu</field><field name="subject">Maori Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/37</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mode of entry observations for environmental based INVs (International New Ventures)</field><field name="creator">Hogg, David</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the risk and internationalisation practices of International New Ventures (INVs) in the environmental sector. The purpose of the research is to make observations regarding the manner in which environmental INVs manage risk when internationalising.The literature review focuses upon the published literature that relates to INVs, risk and risk management, mode of entry and the environmental sector. Section one of the literature review provides the characteristics of what constitutes an INV. Section 2 provides a review of the risk literature, this allows the differences between Multi National Enterprise (MNE) and INV risk and risk management to be reviewed. Section 3 takes the international business risks mentioned in section 2 and relates them to the mode of entry literature (i.e. the internationalisation of firms). The final section of the literature review is used to justify the investigation into the water pollution and control sector of the environmental industry. The research question is 'What strategies do environmental INVs use when entering new international markets?' The research question is broken into five specific research questions and addressed using the Repertory Grid process. The Repertory Grid process is used as it can turn the tacit knowledge held by the participants into explicit knowledge. The results show areas of convergence and divergence between practice and academia. The results also suggest new issues that need to be considered when firms internationalise. This culminates in the observations made in regard to the way environmental INVs manage risk when internationalising.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interpretive paradigm</field><field name="subject">Porter's five forces</field><field name="subject">Competition</field><field name="subject">Traditional internationalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/38</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of service delivery: the difference between front-line employees' and customer's perception of the service delivery within the New Zealand real estate industry</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Vicki</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to investigate the difference between front-line employees' perception of service versus the customer's perception of the service delivery within the New Zealand Real Estate Industry. This research examines the service perception of the service delivery within the real estate industry using an exploratory study, pre-test and a survey. The lack of knowledge within real estate particularly around the importance of services has been a major motivator for this research. In reviewing the literature, a substantial amount of literature was available on service delivery however there was a gap in the literature on the service delivery in the real estate industry. This research addresses this gap through analysing the real estate industry, focusing on the Auckland market. Four dimensions of service were identified using SERVQUAL. Findings from the factor analysis showed that employees and clients have different perceptions of service. The management implications are wide and will positively impact the industry. For the industry, increasing service delivery will ensure the industry gains a more professional image and standing within New Zealand business.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer services</field><field name="subject">Customer relations</field><field name="subject">Consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Real estate agents</field><field name="subject">Real estate business</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/40</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual communication design strategies: multidisciplinary human-centred approach in branding and marketing</field><field name="creator">Yu, Jenny</field><field name="description">This research study is focused on the buying behaviour of modern consumers. The literature indicates that modern consumers are sophisticated, discerning and are less loyal to a particular brand than they used to be. Consumers today are more concerned with buying a product that not only meets their needs but also provides them with pleasurable experiences. There are many ways to explain buyer behaviour; however for this thesis storytelling, dream theory, and "Lovemarks" have been used to examine the usefulness of the selected theories to the visual communication design industry. The research has focussed on an homogeneous product (bottled water) as a vehicle to establish whether all the plans and strategies in recently published literature can be trusted and be used for design strategies for planning a marketing campaign. The reason for doing this is to establish some new knowledge that could contribute to the design industry in terms of criteria for branding, marketing and design strategy in visual communication design. An extensive secondary research of the literature has been made to inform this study. Primary information has also been gathered by using carefully designed and comprehensive materials involving professional interviews, and a major case study of bottled water has been conducted, which includes a field study, focus groups and surveys. Information and raw data generated by the research have been analysed either quantitatively or qualitatively. The result generated by this study is not conclusive, however, pointing to the fact that the buying behaviour of consumers is complex and variable.

Leadership is still mysterious and complex. This study is a journey of discovery designed to explore the complexities and prominence of leadership as it exists in New Zealand. The journey began with a literature review metaphorically represented as three poles of knowledge. The first pole focused on M&#257;ori (ordinary, of this land, native people of New Zealand) and M&#257;ori culture where leadership is highly valued. The second explored sport and in particular rugby, which enjoys celebrity status amongst M&#257;ori and New Zealanders. The final pole reviewed organisational studies and literature on leadership.The study pursued perceptions of male M&#257;ori rugby players concerning leadership, from a M&#257;ori, rugby, and New Zealand perspective. The research approach employed by this study is based on the principles of grounded theory, kaupapa M&#257;ori methodology and its Western cousin, ethnomethodology. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with nine prominent past and present M&#257;ori rugby players. By focusing on this demographic, this study was able to examine M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; leadership styles, similarities and differences; highlight key cultural characteristics and strengthen arguments claiming a relationship exists between the three poles of knowledge. This approach enabled a review of those beneficial and advantageous qualities considered to have an impact on leadership in New Zealand.Findings from interviews revealed relationships do exist between the three poles of knowledge. The values or concepts wh&#257;nau (family, extended family), responsibility, collectivism, and tu&#257;kana/t&#275;ina (elder/leaders to younger/novices) relationships were identified as central qualities of M&#257;ori leadership. Collectivism is expressed as concerns of wh&#257;nau. Reciprocity was embodied in relationships of tu&#257;kana/t&#275;ina with rugby being a vehicle that enhanced both and encouraged leadership development. Findings combined with evidence from literature prompted discussion aimed at three different audiences: leadership theorists; M&#257;ori, and; rugby audiences.

However there are concerns about the patterns of use and the rising incidence of alcohol and drug related risks such as; hospital admissions, domestic abuse, and alcohol and drug related convictions. As a result alcohol and drug use among Maori is a major threat to their health and well being. Consequently there is a need for models that are culturally appropriate to effectively address the problem. In New Zealand there is an increase in the use of customary Maori values, beliefs and practices in the treatment of Maori with substance abuse. This has also involved the integration of Western approaches and treatment modalities that are beneficial to Maori. However, the main purpose of the research is to give credence to Te Toi o Te Matariki model within the clinical setting. It is anticipated that the outcomes will inspire confidence in cultural model of practice in personal growth and development for Maori people who present with substance abuse. Te Toi o Te Matariki model is examined in the context of the Te Ara Hou residential drug and alcohol programme, a service provided by Raukura Hauora o Tainui (RHOT) in Auckland. The analogy is "to ascend or achieve to the highest point of the Whare Wananga (house of learning) so that the best view or position in the world is gained."

Vipassana meditation focuses on developing sensitivity to body sensations, which are understood to accompany all emotion experiences; experienced meditators can feel in their own bodies physical sensations that reflect the experience of a person in close proximity. An aim of the research was to discover whether their meditation practice had enabled the participants to use this ability in their work with patients. The study focuses on psychotherapists' lived experience during clinical hours, and enquires about how they direct their attention to their body sensations, and to the relationship with patients. The study explores links between the practice of Buddhist meditation and the evenly-suspended attention recommended by Freud, and further developed by Bion in his psychoanalysis without memory or desire. Because I was interested in many aspects of therapists' lived experience, I chose the methodology of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, 2003) as a framework for analysing the data. I drew on philosophical underpinnings offered by Heidegger and van Manen. The study showed that the participating psychotherapists were helped by their meditative training to develop a sensitive receptivity to their own physical sensations and emotion experience, predisposing them to be aware of limbic resonance with their patients' emotional and physical experiences. Some participants focused their meditative awareness on the ebb and flow of closeness and distance between themselves and their patients, in an orientation to psychotherapy that can be described as relational mindfulness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychotherapy - religious aspects - Buddhism</field><field name="subject">Psychiatry and religion</field><field name="subject">Meditation - Buddhism</field><field name="subject">Meditation - therapeutic use</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/44</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the adoption and usage of internet banking: a New Zealand perspective</field><field name="creator">Podder, Braja</field><field name="description">Although the offering of financial products and services over the Internet by banks and financial institutions continues to spread, reports on Internet banking show that the adoption and usage of such services by consumers are low. Further, relatively little empirical research has been carried out to examine factors influencing users' adoption or use of Internet banking services, particularly in New Zealand. Hence, there is a need to identify relevant factors that influence New Zealand's bank customers' intentions to use Internet banking. This research used two commonly applied and empirically supported models of information technology adoption to achieve this objective. In this study, Davis's (1989) technology acceptance model (TAM) is extended by two external variables, namely risk and self-efficacy. The second model used is a reduced version of Moore and Benbasat's (1991) perceived characteristics of innovation (PCI) model, without the image and voluntariness constructs. A questionnaire was used to conducting a postal survey of 1000 individuals in Auckland, New Zealand. Out of 163 responses received 157(15.7%) were usable and with this data both research models were tested.The results reveal that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, self-efficacy, relative advantage, compatibility, and result demonstrability have a significant association with intention to use Internet banking, while risk, visibility and trialability are not significant. Both the modified TAM and PCI models used in the study have a similar explanatory power of slightly over 20% of the variance in intention. In the TAM model, perceived usefulness and self-efficacy are significant variables, while compatibility is the only variable significant for the PCI model. Further, results indicate that users' perceptions of various aspects of Internet banking are more positive than non-users' perceptions, except for risk.The results of this study indicate that both TAM and PCI have low capabilities in explaining the variances in users' intention to adopt or use Internet banking services. Therefore, further studies are recommended to examine the performance of these models in Internet banking studies and also to improve the prediction power of these models by incorporating additional constructs. Although risk is found to be insignificant in this study, considering results of prior studies, further studies are required to examine its influence on intention.For banks point of view, banks should consider launching campaigns to demonstrate the usefulness and benefits. Once users perceive that advantages outweigh disadvantages, they are more likely to adopt or use Internet banking. Additionally, banks must make continuous effort to understand consumers' requirement and design and deliver their products and services in such a way that it is consistent with customers' requirements, beliefs and the way customers are accustomed to work. Banks website should facilitate customers with a 'one stop comprehensive financial' service. Banks can arrange hands-on training for prospective users to enhance their self-efficacy or may pay additional interest on online-deposit accounts (can be access through Internet only). Besides promoting services, banks need to invest in staff education and training and be equipped with advanced computer technology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet banking</field><field name="subject">Information Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/45</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The curator's room: visceral reflections from within the museum</field><field name="creator">Osborne, Michelle Anne Louise</field><field name="description">In the way of museums, certain things have been collected and assembled for a display, a truth, in the form of a private room in which resides the dream world of the curator. Then, as the visual expression of this inner space deepens, they are carefully taken apart, always with respect for the original. Yet the work is not shaped by the hand of a conservator destined to abandon the imagination in favour of a trail of physical evidence. Nor does it reflect the conventional rationalist sensibilities of a museum worker who, by suppressing a poetic understanding of the world is confined by "cold language" (Frame 1992 p.45) and remains caught inextricably in the web of colonial thinking.Here the imagination is truth (Einzig 1996) and an understanding of the nature of this inner space the key to the locked door. The Anthropologist and the Archaeologist, indeed a whole host of disciplinary specialists may come knocking, but it is the artist that gains access to the curatorial spirit. Compelled as much by a love of the museum profession as a crisis of European consciousness (Spivak in Harasym 1990), objects are assembled for an inner journey to a place where shadow and sunlight chase each other across the landscape (McQueen 2000). This is the dialectic space of both curator and artist, of the rational and the irrational, of inside and outside, and of disciplinary devotion and betrayal.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art exhibition</field><field name="subject">Space</field><field name="subject">Artist</field><field name="subject">Curator</field><field name="subject">Museum</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/46</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of assessed writing requirements at undergraduate level in the humanities</field><field name="creator">Turner, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses play an increasingly important role in supporting non English speaking background students in their academic studies. Such courses have traditionally prioritised writing as the most significant literacy requirement (Johns, 1981). This prioritisation of writing reflects the perception that expertise in writing is an indication that students have acquired the cognitive skills demanded for university work (Weigle, 2002). It also reflects the fact that the majority of assessment tasks, which tend to drive student learning (Schwartz &amp; Webb, 2002), require some form of writing. For EAP courses to be effective, curriculum design needs to be informed by knowledge of current academic discourse demands and writing requirements in relevant discipline areas. Analysis of previous studies indicates that written assessment tasks vary between discipline areas. Findings also suggest that the most frequent assessment types vary over time as theoretical approaches to assessment change. This suggests the need to investigate the discipline-specific demands faced by different student cohorts enrolled on EAP courses. Some studies have identified the need for students to develop the skills involved in interpreting task instructions, as well as addressing the relevant topic and meeting the specific assessment requirements (Gravatt et al., 1997 and Carson, 2001). A key impetus for this study relates to this finding and was the fact that students enrolled on EAP courses were having difficulties interpreting instructions and marking criteria provided for some assessments in discipline-specific papers. The aims of this study were three-fold. The first was to investigate and analyse the type and form of written assessment tasks and related requirements, in three undergraduate courses. The second was to investigate lecturers' perceptions and intentions in producing these tasks. Thirdly, the study aimed to investigate and describe students' understandings and experiences of the same tasks. The study therefore involved a triangulated methodology in terms of data collection. The three methods employed were analysis of assessment documents, semi-structured interviews with the lecturers concerned, and questionnaire surveys of students enrolled on the three papers. The results of the study reinforce the findings of earlier studies in that there are considerable differences between discipline areas in assessment types and in the levels of associated cognitive demands. Although the study identifies what appears to be a new assessment type at undergraduate level - the 'literature review' assignment - lecturers' expectations for this assessment appear to vary between discipline areas. The differences identified appear to be influenced by lecturers' perceptions of the role of assessment, which in this case seem to be limited to the concept of assessment as the certification of learning, and as being predominantly summative in function. Furthermore the study shows that a significant proportion of student respondents found the majority of assessment instructions difficult to understand, and that only one of the papers provided assessment criteria. The findings suggest that the absence of explicit marking criteria appears to disadvantage non-English speaking background students in particular. The conclusions of the thesis focus primarily on the dual, 'critical pragmatic', role of EAP practitioners in seeking to inform curriculum design and also to influence assessment practice; the implications of the study for the university's assessment and academic literacy policies and their implementation; the implications of the findings for EAP curriculum design, and suggestions for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academic writing</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/48</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the conflict resolution questionnaire</field><field name="creator">Henning, Marcus</field><field name="description">Many questionnaires used in the measurement of conflict are expensive and difficult to obtain.

The present thesis evaluates the recently developed questionnaire that is easily accessible through the Internet, the Conflict Resolution Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ was developed as a measure of the conflict resolution ideas presented by Weeks (1994), and Fisher and Ury (1991). It has been used to measure a person's ability to create mutually beneficial resolutions to conflict for all participants. In addition, the CRQ items measure respondents' perceptions regarding how often they engage in certain conflict-related behaviours, and their level of awareness regarding conflict issues. The CRQ is also designed to promote understanding of conflict, and has been used as an educational tool. Participants were asked to fill in the CRQ alongside an established questionnaire, the Rahim Organisational Conflict Inventory, part two (ROCI-II) (Rahim, 1983a). The responses of 338 participants to the CRQ and ROCI-II were statistically analysed. Hypotheses were tested regarding the CRQ's reliability and validity. CRQ reliability was statistically appraised through exploration of internal consistency and split-half reliability scores. CRQ validity was examined by evaluating the CRQ in terms of content, construct and concurrent validity. Establishing content validity was a qualitative process. Corroborating construct validity essentially relied on factor analysis procedures. Decisions regarding CRQ's concurrent validity were based upon correlation measures between the CRQ and the ROCI-II, which was used as an established standard measure of conflict. The results confirmed that two of the McClellan's (1997c) factors were reliable and that the CRQ had content validity. There was marginal support of construct validity, whereby from the factor rotation it was shown that two of the CRQ factors were matched by their derived counterparts. In addition, the results showed modest support for concurrent validity based on the comparisons of three CRQ factors against two factors from a well-established questionnaire. These findings also lend support for the methods of conflict resolution presented in the works of Weeks (1994) and Fisher and Ury (1991).A modified version of the CRQ is presented, the 'CRQ-II'. A posthoc analysis suggests that the CRQ-II can satisfy psychometric requirements, although further research is recommended to confirm the CRQ-II. Practice implications regarding the development of the CRQ-II are discussed, and future research considerations are explored.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conflict management</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/49</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lesbian mothers: queer families: the experience of planned pregnancy</field><field name="creator">Bree, Caroline</field><field name="description">Lesbian-identified women are choosing to become parents in increasing numbers. This 'lesbian baby boom' has implications for midwives and their practice. The purpose of this study was to gain insight and understanding of planned pregnancy from a lesbian perspective, in order to facilitate the provision of appropriate care for lesbian mothers and their families.The methodology used for the study was radical hermeneutics informed by lesbian feminism and queer poststructuralism. Purposive sampling identified ten lesbian-identified mothers and conversational interviews with the participants yielded rich data about the phenomenon of inquiry. Thematic analysis of the data was foregrounded by a discussion of the socio-political context.A number of findings emerged from the study. Careful pre-conceptual planning reflected a highly responsible approach to parenting. The women's partners felt uncertain about their parenting role and experienced a lack of acknowledgement by the wider community. Despite legal access to assisted fertility, the participants usually sought an involved father for their child. Lesbian mothers expressed a preference for a lesbian midwife and all experienced homophobic attitudes from healthcare professionals. Queer families included mothers and their partners, fathers and their partners, children, families-of-origin, and close friends.Recommendations from the study include the provision of safe and supportive workplaces for lesbian-identified midwives, the use of inclusive language such as partner and parent, acknowledgement of the woman's partner as a co-parent, midwifery resources featuring same-sex parents and midwifery education covering diverse family forms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lesbian mothers</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Birth control</field><field name="subject">Gay parents</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/51</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The journey towards employment for Chinese early childhood student teachers: a case study</field><field name="creator">Heald, Denise J</field><field name="description">The topic of this thesis stems from my interest in finding out whether a partial early childhood Certificate qualification could procure employment in early childhood centres for Chinese student teachers, which could then eventuate in Permanent Residency status. Employment in early childhood centres is currently being driven by the need to comply with Ministry of Education requirements which state that centres need to have fifty per cent of their teachers fully qualified and registered by 2007. The literature surrounding the employment experiences of Asian immigrants to New Zealand reveals negative outcomes, and discrimination is cited as one of the causes of this. However, early childhood education in New Zealand espouses a strong philosophy of cultural diversity and inclusive practice.The employment experiences of seven Chinese early childhood student teachers are documented in this thesis using a qualitative mixed-method approach involving Case Study as the overarching methodology/method, supplemented with Narrative Inquiry and Documentary Analyses to collect and analyse the data.The main findings of my research were: there are obstacles that this ethnic group faced in gaining employment relevant to their qualification - this was a negative, but not unexpected outcome. The second major finding was that, despite the over-arching philosophy of early childhood education in Aotearoa/New Zealand, I found that there were several areas where the participants of this study were vulnerable to 'discrimination'. This was predominantly in the form of unfair practices and included: interview experiences; relief teaching; employment contracts; and payment issues. The participants of this study were also vulnerable in other ways. In order to enrol in further study to become fully qualified, they need to achieve a high IELTS (International English Language Testing System) level.A third and much more positive outcome was that participants who found employment did so through practicum placements, networks of friends, and with those centres that were accepting of 'cultural difference'. All of these findings were to some extent largely congruent with the literature on immigration experiences of 'migrants'.Further research needs to be undertaken on this topic by myself, and others in this field, in particular, how International Students are 'protected' in Aotearoa/New Zealand. I found that there was a 'loophole' in the Immigration Points Table and that International Students are possibly being encouraged to enrol in Early Childhood Certificate programmes in the belief that they will find employment and eventually Permanent Residency status. This research shows that this is not always the case.In addition to this, further research needs to focus on the views of centre owners and staff, with regard to employing Chinese early childhood educators; the views of Chinese parents with regard to their perspective of Chinese teachers and lastly, in the area of relief teaching. In the conclusion several recommendations for changes to policy and practice at the tertiary level are raised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early childhood teachers</field><field name="subject">Asian teachers</field><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Culturally competent care</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">Immigrants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/52</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epicardial pacing in New Zealand (1977-2002)</field><field name="creator">Searby, Karen Ann</field><field name="description">Reviews of clinical practice for paediatric pacemaker implantation and follow-up are necessary to provide an evidence-base for future policy and practice in this field. Epicardial pacing data available through Green Lane Hospital, New Zealand's (NZ) primary referral centre for paediatric cardiac surgery and pacemaker implantation, was reviewed with the following aims:  Assessment of pacemaker lead performance over time in relation to the type of epicardial lead implanted - steroid-eluting (SE) and non steroid-eluting (NSE).  Determination of the survival rate of epicardial leads. Identifying factors predicting or associated with lead failure.A database of pacing and sensing thresholds and lead impedance data at implant, 2, 6 and 18 weeks and 6 monthly intervals thereafter, was compiled and the prevalence and timing of complications in relation to lead type, location and implant route determined. In total 192 leads (155 SE, 37 NSE) were implanted in 96 patients (52 male) aged 3 days to 71 years (y) (median 1.7y), 74 patients were &lt; 17 years of age at implant. Congenital heart defects were present in 82% of patients. Follow-up (f/u) was possible for 180 leads. Mean f/u duration for the 150 SE leads was 3.1y (2 weeks - 8.8y) and for the 30 NSE leads was 4.5y (2 weeks - 27y).SE and NSE pacing thresholds were similar at implant. NSE pacing thresholds peaked at 6 weeks post implant and remained significantly higher than SE leads throughout f/u in surviving leads, although the difference was small at 2 and 4 y. SE and NSE leads had similar ventricular sensing thresholds and lead impedances throughout the study period.Survival at 5 years for all leads was 61% (66% for SE leads and 41% for NSE leads). Primary causes of failure in the leads receiving f/u were exit block and lead fracture. The occurrence of exit block was significantly higher (p&lt;0.0001) in NSE leads (57%) compared to SE leads (5%). Lead fracture occurred in 15% of leads with the highest fracture rate at 2-3 y post implant. Patient age and weight at implant, gender, previous cardiac surgery, lead polarity, indication for pacing and implant route were not predictors of lead failure. NSE leads were 6 times more likely to fail compared to SE leads (p &lt;0.0001).The main study findings were: SE leads maintain lower pacing thresholds and a reduced incidence of exit block compared to NSE leads. It is therefore recommended that SE leads be developed which can penetrate fibrosed, scarred or fatty epicardial surfaces. Where SE lead use is contraindicated, alternative surgical techniques for SE lead placement should be attempted rather than implanting NSE leads. Lead fracture is a significant complication of epicardial pacing in paediatric patients. Using stronger bipolar leads implanted by the subxiphoid route may reduce the risk of fracture. Medium term survival (5 y) of SE epicardial leads is acceptable and therefore the continued use of these leads is recommended, particularly in young patients, allowing their veins to be saved for transvenous leads later in their life.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiac pacemakers</field><field name="subject">Cardiac pacing</field><field name="subject">Cardiac Pacing, Artificial</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/54</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MICE and local economic development in New Zealand: defining a role for the web</field><field name="creator">Lau, Kam Hong Chloe</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how information and communication technologies (ICT), particularly the World Wide Web (Web), can contribute to the role that Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Conventions, and Exhibitions (MICE) properties play in local economic development (LED).

The emergence of the new information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the context of transnational capitalism precipitates the co modification of information, communication and knowledge. This process is obscured by the ideological construction of techno-futurism. Techno-futurism is a combination of technological determinism and futurism that appropriates notions of progress. In the pages which follow, historical analyses of this ideology inform the subsequent critique of knowledge economy discourse. In New Zealand knowledge economy discourse contained techno-futurist elements and deflected attention from the global absorption of national capitalism. In this context the Catching the Knowledge Wave Conference (KWC), held in Auckland in the first days of August 2001, is examined. I argue that the instigators and organisers of the conference were enmeshed within the business culture of finance capital and ICTs. Textual analysis of keynote addresses reveals the ideological dimensions to knowledge wave and knowledge economy talk. These dimensions are; entrepreneurialism, knowledge as (economic) progress, and globalism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Technological</field><field name="subject">Innovations</field><field name="subject">Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/56</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The window: an experimental short film about a man who lives his life in darkness</field><field name="creator">Jain, Priti</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the potential of typography as a significant visual element in the narration of a short film.

Further research has shown large performance benefits in sprint and endurance power (7 - 9%) when cyclists combined explosive single-leg jumps with cycling-specific high-intensity interval training during a competitive season. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the jumps to the gains in performance in competitive cyclists in a randomized control trial.The training protocol for the control group was based on previous experimental work in which the control group (n=8) completed cycle specific interval training followed by a series of explosive single-leg jumps. The experimental group (n=7) carried out the same cycle specific interval training but did not participate in the explosive single-leg jumps. While the current study did not use a true control group, the investigation was carried out in the knowledge that a combination of high intensity interval cycling and explosive single-leg jumps causes changes positive changes in performance. Participants took part in 10 x 30-min sessions consisting four sets of high intensity intermittent cycling (4 x 30-s maximum efforts at 50 - 60 min-1 alternating with 30-s recovery). Between each set of 4 x 30 s sprints the control (ballistic) group carried out one set of explosive single-leg jumps (20 for each leg), while the experimental (continuous) group cycled for 20 s at 50 - 60 min-1.Before and after the training period all cyclists completed an incremental peak power test for assessment of VO2max, lactate threshold, exercise economy and peak power, a 30 s Wingate sprint test and a 20 km time-trial. Relative to the control group the percent mean changes (&#177;90% confidence limits) in the experimental group were: power at 4-mM lactate, -4.2 (&#177;6.3); VO2max, -3.1 (&#177;3.7); mean time-trial power, -0.7 (&#177; 4.7); peak incremental power, -1.7; (&#177;5.0); power at 80% max heart rate, -2.8; (&#177;5.6); Wingate peak power, -4.2; (&#177;7.8). We conclude that high-intensity training may improve performance but the combination of high-intensity training and explosive resistance training in the competitive phase is likely to produce greater gains in trained cyclists than high intensity cycling alone.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competitive cycling</field><field name="subject">Randomized controlled trials</field><field name="subject">Performance gains</field><field name="subject">High intensity interval training</field><field name="subject">Explosive single-leg jumps</field><field name="subject">Training protocols</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/58</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation study of intangible business relationship value measurement</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Annie Liqin</field><field name="description">Both marketing researchers and practitioners realise that having customer relationships that enhance a firm's competitive advantage is an important strategic issue and that there is a need for relationship value measurement. But the research on relationship value measurement is limited, especially from a seller's perspective, despite numerous calls for it. The reason for the limited research might be that the nature of customer relationships is complex, largely intangible, and long-term oriented. Baxter and Matear's (2004) study directly addresses the issue of the measurement of the intangible part of the value of a business-to-business relationship from a seller's perspective. Synthesising an intellectual capital model into the relationship marketing literature, Baxter and Matear (2004) propose an intangible relationship value (IRV) model for assessing the value of the intangible part of the resources that sellers gain through their relationships with their business buyers. The IRV model has been empirically tested and supported in New Zealand's manufacturing industry. The current study replicated Baxter and Matear's (2004) study in order to further assess the validity of the IRV model and its scales. Exploratory factor analysis was used first to identify the dimensionality of the IRV. Then the four aspects of construct validity - reliability, and convergent, discriminant, and nomological validities - were examined. The exploratory factor analysis of the focal relationship value items in the questionnaire found six first-order dimensions of the IRV. As expected, these six first-order value dimensions are the same as in the Baxter and Matear (2004) study: competence, attitude, intellectual agility, relationships, organisation, and renewal and development. Further exploratory factor analysis of the summated scales of these six first-order values found two higher-order value dimensions: the human intangible value dimension and the structural intangible value dimension. Thus the dimensionality of the IRV model is supported in the current study. The exploratory factor analysis retained 36 out of the initial 42 measures developed by Baxter and Matear (2004). These 36 retained measures include 20 of the 22 measures in Baxter and Matear's (2004) final purified scales. The validity of these 36 measures was then further investigated. The reliability examination found that the measurements of the six first-order IRV constructs are reliable in the current study. Evidence was also found for the convergent and discriminant validities in the measurements of the human and structural intangible value, the convergent validity in the measurement of the IRV, and the nomological validity of the IRV construct. Thus, the 36 measures retained in the final results of the current study are valid for the respondents in the current study. The findings suggest that Baxter and Matear's (2004) intellectual capital approach to measuring IRV is appropriate. It has potentially provided a way to assess intangible value in relationships. Based on the dimensions and the measures provided by the IRV model, sellers can systematically assess the potential IRV of their current and potential customer relationships, and make their strategic decisions on how to manage these customer relationships accordingly.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship value</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Value measurement</field><field name="subject">Intangible value</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/60</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental techniques to determine the Young's Modulus of the trachea</field><field name="creator">Hermawan, Vera</field><field name="description">In addition to its usefulness in modeling and simulation processes, the modulus of elasticity is an index which is highly used in biomedical identifications and tissue characterizations. For many composite and viscoelastic materials an "accurate modulus" is an idealistic hypothesis and an "equivalent modulus" is normally of a high biomechanical significance. The composite shape of the trachea, which consists of the smooth muscles and cartilage rings, renders the fact that an equivalent modulus is in place for many applications. In this paper three in-vitro nondestructive testing techniques are presented to determine the Young modulus of elasticity of the trachea and the results are compared with the standard uniaxial state of stress method. These techniques are based on: (1) simulating the trachea as a pressurized vessel and deducing a special relationship between the pressure and the radial strain; (2) using two hydrophones and studying the variation in acoustic transmittance caused by the presence of the trachea in a water-bath; (3) considering the trachea as a thin cylindrical shell and determining the resonance vibration response.

It focuses on the lived experience of therapists and the different meanings made of what is experienced. The purpose of this research is to bring into the light spiritual experiences of therapists and how they are experienced in the therapeutic process. It contributes to current debate about spiritual experience in the day- to- day practice of psychotherapy. The methodology of phenomenological hermeneutics is chosen as it provides the means to study therapists' lived experience. The study is guided by the philosophical thinking of Heidegger, Gadamer and Van Manen.The findings of this study reveal different types of spiritual experience. These include non-ordinary states of consciousness where there is a feeling sense of being beyond the boundaries of linear time and space. Experiences involve noticing subtle body feelings before they manifest in everyday consciousness. They include hearing and seeing phenomena that may normally be overlooked or disavowed in psychotherapy. The findings show therapists' ability to notice, explore and utilize subtle body phenomena was a combination of their own capabilities, their spiritual practice, and years of experience as therapists. The therapist's body appeared to be like a doorway into experiences that had transformative effects on both therapists and clients. The meanings made of experiences reflected therapists' spiritual and cultural beliefs. These beliefs meant that therapists are attuned to something bigger than everyday identity that gave meaning and purpose to the work and was a rich source of wisdom and guidance, comfort and a sense of being held in the work.  Specific attitudes and qualities of presence are revealed that reflect therapists' spiritual beliefs. Participants described experiences that emerged out of the context of the therapeutic relationship but could not be explained clinically. The findings show therapists' world views, their spiritual and cultural beliefs and capacity to experience the unknown, bring a richness and diversity of meanings to the therapeutic relationship that includes the wider contexts of culture and the environment.  This study explores current thinking about spiritual experience in psychotherapy and its effects on the therapist. It raises issues for further discussion relating to the role of therapists' spiritual experience in contemporary psychotherapy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychotherapists</field><field name="subject">Interpretative methodology</field><field name="subject">Unstructured interviews</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Dreams and synchronicities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/64</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fate of vitamin C in commercial fruit juices</field><field name="creator">Nagra, Surinder</field><field name="description">Vitamin C occurs in relatively high concentrations in fresh and processed fruits and vegetables but is found to a lesser extent in animal tissues and animal-derived products. Nearly 90 % of vitamin C in the human diet is obtained from fruits and vegetables but this can be indirect by way of commercially prepared fruit juices. These juices are often enriched with vitamin C which has been synthetically prepared. There is a wide range of such juices on the New Zealand market, and they are a significant source of dietary vitamin C for many in the population. The focus of this research is on the Keri range of juice products.The present study monitors the fate of vitamin C during storage of Keri juices up to the best-before date, and under a range of other storage and consumption situations. Two methods were adopted for determining ascorbic acid (AA, the chemical identity of vitamin C). These were the titrimetric method, which is based upon the reduction of the dye 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol by AA in acidic solution, and liquid chromatography, which is used to separate AA from its immediate oxidation product dehydroascorbic acid. In the latter method these two analytes can be measured independently. The liquid chromatography was less successful than the simpler titrimetric method, so most of the work was done by titration. However, the concentration of dehydroascorbic acid, which has vitamin C activity in vivo, remained uncertain. Moreover, the titrimetric method could not be applied to juices with high purple anthocyanin concentrations, like blackcurrant, because the colour change at the titration end point could not be detected. pH adjustment to change colour was ineffective, and decolourisation with charcoal led to the rapid and complete destruction of AA. The concentration of AA in Keri juices at the time of manufacture were always much higher than claimed on the labels. Storage for up to nine months at room temperature resulted in a loss in AA of between 37 and 68 %, depending on the juice and exposure to fluorescent light. However, the time of storage was a much more dominant factor than light exposure. The kinetics of loss, straight lines, were most easily explained by an aerobic model of AA degradation from oxygen diffusing across the polyethylene tetraphthalate bottle wall. Overall, the label claims made were defensible in terms of the best-before date, because it took at least 100 days of storage before the AA concentration in the most susceptible juices fell below the claimed value. This is because these drinks are fast moving consumer goods and storage beyond 100 days is unlikely. (Nonetheless, the supplier (Keri Juice Company) has since adopted its new unitised method of formulating juice. This has resulted in an initially higher concentration of vitamin C as compared to the juices under investigation.) In the nine months storage experiment there was some evidence for the presence of dehydroascorbic acid in blackcurrant drinks, but not in another three juices. Pasteurisation during preparation of these drinks resulted in up to 7 % loss of AA, probably due to oxygen dissolved in water, and accelerated by heat of pasteurisation. Higher temperatures in later storage also accelerated losses. Progressive exposure of juice to air during simulated consumption of 3 L bottles over a week also accelerated losses. Finally, exposure to sunlight in a diurnal temperature environment accelerated losses five-fold higher than in total darkness. Filtration of ultraviolet light approximately halved the loss due to sunlight. Overall however, it can be concluded that AA in the Keri range of juices is very resistant to degradation of AA.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commercially prepared fruit juice</field><field name="subject">Titration</field><field name="subject">Liquid chromatography</field><field name="subject">Vitamin C loss</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/67</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene selection based on consistency modelling, algorithms and applications</field><field name="creator">Hu, Yingjie (Raphael)</field><field name="description">Consistency modeling for gene selection is a new topic emerging from recent cancer bioinformatics research. The result of classification or clustering on a training set was often found very different from the same operations on a testing set. Here, the issue is addressed as a consistency problem. In practice, the inconsistency of microarray datasets prevents many typical gene selection methods working properly for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In an attempt to deal with this problem, a new concept of performance-based consistency is proposed in this thesis.An interesting finding in our previous experiments is that by using a proper set of informative genes, we significantly improved the consistency characteristic of microarray data. Therefore, how to select genes in terms of consistency modelling becomes an interesting topic. Many previously published gene selection methods perform well in the cancer diagnosis domain, but questions are raised because of the irreproducibility of experimental results. Motivated by this, two new gene selection methods based on the proposed performance-based consistency concept, GAGSc (Genetic Algorithm Gene Selection method in terms of consistency) and LOOLSc (Leave-one-out Least-Square bound method with consistency measurement) were developed in this study with the purpose of identifying a set of informative genes for achieving replicable results of microarray data analysis.The proposed consistency concept was investigated on eight benchmark microarray and proteomic datasets. The experimental results show that the different microarray datasets have different consistency characteristics, and that better consistency can lead to an unbiased and reproducible outcome with good disease prediction accuracy.As an implementation of the proposed performance-based consistency, GAGSc and LOOLSc are capable of providing a small set of informative genes. Comparing with those traditional gene selection methods without using consistency measurement, GAGSc and LOOLSc can provide more accurate classification results. More importantly, GAGSc and LOOLSc have demonstrated that gene selection, with the proposed consistency measurement, is able to enhance the reproducibility in microarray diagnosis experiments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gene selection</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Bias</field><field name="subject">Reproducability</field><field name="subject">Cancer bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">DNA microarrays</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/69</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of consumer knowledge in consumer evaluations of brand extension</field><field name="creator">Ma, Yun</field><field name="description">This study examines the effects of two types of consumer knowledge, product and brand knowledge, on consumer fit perceptions between an extension and its parent brand, so as to further investigate the role of consumer knowledge in brand extension evaluations. Based on the reviewed literature four hypotheses were proposed. The first two hypotheses predicted that both product and brand knowledge has an impact of consumer perceived fit between an extension and its parent brand. The other two hypotheses proposed that product knowledge affect more on the fit perceptions between a functional brand and its extension, while brand knowledge affect more on the fit perceptions between a prestige brand and its extension. An experiment was performed to examine these hypothesized relationships. Two hypotheses related to brand knowledge are supported, while the other two hypotheses related to product knowledge are not supported statistically. The results reveal that product and brand knowledge have different effects on consumer fit perceptions between an extension and its parent brand in terms of different brand types, functional vs. prestige brand. The experimental findings demonstrate that brand knowledge has an impact on consumer fit perceptions between an extension and its parent brand, and its effect dominant in prestige brand extension evaluations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumers</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Brand name products</field><field name="subject">Public opinion</field><field name="subject">Brand choice</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/71</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midwives' experiences of working with women in labour: interpreting the meaning of pain</field><field name="creator">Vague, Stephanie</field><field name="description">A key midwifery activity is the support of a woman in labour. Pain in labour has been extensively researched from the woman's perspective, but less has been explored in relation to the midwife and her approach to pain. The way in which the midwife works with a woman and her pain in labour is the focus of this qualitative study, using Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenology. This philosophical approach seeks to uncover or illuminate aspects of the midwife's practice which are frequently taken for granted in their everydayness. Seven midwives, including both independent practitioners and hospital-employed, were interviewed. Their narratives were analysed to uncover the meaning of the way in which midwives work with women and their pain in labour. The findings of this thesis suggest that midwives work by interpreting the woman's pain. Before the pain begins, they 'leap ahead' to help them anticipate the pain and how they will confront it. During labour, midwives give pain meaning by translating its purpose in that context. They 'leap in' when required, sometimes using 'self as an intervention. Midwives interpret women's pain through their understanding of lived time. They know how the perception of time passing changes depending on the setting for labour or the amount of anxiety and pain the woman is experiencing. Midwives use time in their work. They break it down to help a woman focus on a single contraction rather than looking too far ahead toward the unknown. Time can be a midwife's friend when the arrival of the baby replaces the urgent need for pain relief. It can also be her enemy if her interpretation of a woman's pain differs from the woman's perception. The memory of pain may persist for the woman, after labour has finished, with a backlash for the midwife. Some midwives believe in the process of birth and the woman's ability to labour with such conviction that they gain a woman's complete trust. At her most vulnerable time, they encourage the woman to call upon inner reserves and be truly empowered by her experience.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwives</field><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Pain</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/72</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using information and communication technology to facilitate supply chain management in the New Zealand construction industry</field><field name="creator">Wang, Ye</field><field name="description">The New Zealand construction supply chain today is inefficient. From a literature review it is found that non value adding activities including waste of time and materials are caused by islands of information with ineffective communication between supply chain participants. This represents an opportunity for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to provide a strategic supply chain management model for the industry enabling interaction and shared information between all parties. To evaluate the performance of ICTs in the New Zealand construction supply chain, this thesis uses as a case study newly launched software---BlueSky. BlueSky was developed by the Building Integration Software Company located in AUT Technical Park. BlueSky was designed to integrate the fragments of the current information flow of the chain from architect through to the end property owner.   Supporting Data was gathered by distributing a structured questionnaire designed to find the opportunities and inhibitors for utilizing ICTs to facilitate the synthesis of the chain. 200 responses were received. The study was funded by a TEC grant. The BlueSky case study is based on two pilot sites; one is an architectural design company and the other is a master contractor company in Auckland. The case study also evaluated the potential problems which may bring risks to supply chain members and provide possible recommendations for future research.  The study found from the results of the questionnaire that a significant shift in the mindset of participants of the supply chain will be necessary in terms of collaboration and team work if mutual benefits are to be achieved.  It is found that in the two pilot sites BlueSky did make a significant difference in terms of reduced cost, accuracy of information, improved documentation management, and overall increased speed and clarity of information.  In the wider community of the industry as a whole considerable education is needed to break down mistrust between members. In general each member appears to be determined to secure the best result as individuals rather than considering the overall outcome for the whole chain. This reluctance to co-operate is coupled with a reluctance to utilize ICTs. Recommendations are made to overcome this mindset.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supply chain</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="subject">Business communication</field><field name="subject">Information and communication technologies</field><field name="subject">Construction industry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/74</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being constrained and enabled: a study of pre-registration nursing students ethical practice</field><field name="creator">Johns, Susan</field><field name="description">This study uncovers the experience of being ethical from the perspective of pre-registration nursing students. Using the qualitative methodology of phenomenology, specifically that outlined by van Manen, it seeks to show how students act ethically within everyday practice.Ethics is vital to any health related profession and the growing complexity of New Zealand's health care system requires more responsibility for ethical decision making in nursing care. Providing nursing care is an ethically charged undertaking and despite ethics taking an increasingly important place in nursing education few studies show the contextual nature of ethical practice from the perspective of students. This study aims to partly redress this situation.In this study I have interpreted the experiences of twelve pre-registration students. Using seventeen stories shared by the student participants, my personal understandings and literature, the meaning of being ethical has been illuminated. Three themes emerged from the interpretation. These include 'keeping things 'nice'', 'being true to yourself' and 'being present'. This thesis asserts that the overarching theme within these themes is that of 'being constrained and enabled'. Being constrained shows the experiences of students as they live through the tensions of being and doing as they strive to be ethical. Being enabled shows the experience of self-determination. Finally the study maintains that the shaping of ethical practice for undergraduate students may be enhanced when their reality is positioned and valued within educational processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing students</field><field name="subject">Nursing ethic</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/75</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What influence does brand image and brand reputation have towards achieving a sustained competitive advantage in the sports apparel industry?</field><field name="creator">Sweeney, Brett</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research was to investigate the contribution of brand image and brand reputation towards the creation of a sustained competitive advantage (SCA) in the sports apparel industry. The literature review indicates that intangible resources are more likely to be sources of SCA because they are invisible and difficult to copy. In addition, brand image and brand reputation are recognised as two of the most important intangible resources. However, the relationship between brand image, brand reputation and SCA has not been sufficiently explored. A comparative case study of three leading sports apparel brands Adidas, Puma and Canterbury Clothing Company was conducted. Data were collected supporting a triangulation collection method of secondary data sources as well as interviews with a senior manager from each of the brands and two focus groups conducted with consumers. Data analysis involved a six-step coding process, also known as thematic analysis. Subsequent analysis identified three elements that influence both brand image and brand reputation. Sponsorship, product quality and media were found to influence how consumers perceive a firm's brand image, and over time this brand image is believed to create a brand reputation. Furthermore, findings suggest that brand image will potentially lead toward a competitive advantage (CA) and brand reputation can potentially lead towards a SCA. These elements are underpinned by eight propositions and are presented in a proposed model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/76</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fiji 2000 coup: a media analysis</field><field name="creator">Gounder, Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of both the local and international media during the May 2000 coup, to determine whether the coverage was fair and to suggest solutions for the future. It will first discuss and compare literature that has been written on the Fiji coups, focusing on literature on the media and the coups in particular. According to Fowler (1991) the role of a journalist is to collect facts, report them objectively and present them fairly and without bias in language which is designed to be unambiguous, undistorting and agreeable to readers. However, in most times this is not the case. A thematic content analysis will be done on news articles that appeared in The Fiji Times, The New Zealand Herald and The Australian to find common themes during the coverage of the crisis. A lot of criticism of the both the local and international media&#8217;s role during the May 2000 coup emerged after the crisis. Critics included editors and journalists of the local and international media and political and historical analysts who knew the &#8216;real reasons&#8217; behind the coup and did not see this being reported. A summary of interviews with journalists and editors who covered the coup, both local and overseas, will give an insight into their thoughts and reactions during the coup. It will also determine whether the journalists suffered from the Stockholm syndrome. The Stockholm syndrome describes the behaviour of kidnap victims or people who associate a lot with the captors, and who over time become sympathetic to their captors. The name is derived from a 1973 hostage siege in Stockholm, Sweden when at the end of six days of captivity at a bank; several kidnap victims actually resisted rescue attempts, and afterwards refused to testify against their captors. During the Fiji coup, apart from Speights supporters, journalists were the only ones who spent a lot of time with the coup leader either at press conferences or staying at Parliament to get good stories. As a result, some journalists began to &#8216;sway&#8217; towards Speight or began to experience the Stockholm  syndrome which was reflected in their stories. The thesis concludes that a few journalists in Fiji did suffer from the Stockholm syndrome. It also concludes that a crisis manual is needed for media organisations in Fiji to avoid the same mistakes being repeated as in the last three coups. The overseas media on the other hand need to attach themselves to the local media to avoid parachute journalism and inaccurate reporting. Overseas media organisations need to assign special reporters to Pacific Island affairs to understand the culture and other complex issues which would help in reporting their issues fairly and accurately.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Coup d'&#233;tat, 2000</field><field name="subject">Press coverage</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/77</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New sport teams and the development of brand community</field><field name="creator">Grant, Nigel</field><field name="description">The professional sport market and its established teams offer consumers a service and experience that is typically high in social identification, emotional involvement (Underwood, Bond &amp; Baer, 2001) and a sense of community or social belonging (Heere &amp; James, in press). The strong social attachment to a sports organisation and its brand is proposed here to closely resemble the concept of a brand community (Mu&#241;iz Jr &amp; O'Guinn, 2001). For newly-established teams without a considerable history, along with having to compete with their established competitors, there is generally a lack of consumer identification or emotional investment in the team.This study aimed to investigate newly-established teams within the New Zealand sports market with two specific research questions: 1) What issues affect the development of a new sports team brand, and 2) Do managers of new sports teams use antecedents of brand community or social identification in their branding strategies, and if so, how?A qualitative, case study approach was used; featuring both interviews with managers of three newly-established New Zealand sports teams and direct observations of their stadiums. Findings suggested that the managers believed that existing image and awareness, audience nature, win-loss record, quality of the team or competition, and a lack of history were the main issues affecting the development of their brands. Respondents largely considered the antecedents of a brand community as important, with the exception of history. Promotion of these antecedents was largely absent from each of the team's branding strategies. Along with providing a detailed review of brand community literature, this thesis provides recommendations for managers of new teams on how to develop and position branding strategy toward the long-term goal of creating a community around their team brand.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Branding</field><field name="subject">Sport marketing</field><field name="subject">Brand community</field><field name="subject">Sports management</field><field name="subject">Consumer identification</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/78</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc></add>
