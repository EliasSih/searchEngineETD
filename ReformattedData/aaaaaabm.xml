However it places physical and chemical stress upon soil structure, which may affect soil physical properties, soil water availability and grapevine functioning. Common soil types within Australian vineyards appear vulnerable to soil degradation and there is emerging evidence of such degradation occurring. Two South Australian vineyards (one located at Nuriootpa in the Barossa Valley, the other in the McLaren Vale winegrowing region) were used to examine evidence of altered soil physical properties due to irrigation. Significantly higher soil strength and lower permeability was found under or near the dripper in irrigated soils. There was also evidence that irrigation increased subsoil bulk density at Nuriootpa. It was uncertain how irrigation caused these changes. While sodicity was present at Nuriootpa, it appeared the physical pressures exerted by irrigation, such as rapid wetting and prolonged wetness, also contributed. To gauge the severity of the degradation at Nuriootpa, a modelling study assessed the impact of higher soil strength and salinity on grapevine transpiration. The SWAP model (Soil- Water-Atmosphere-Plant) was modified and then calibrated using soil moisture data from Nuriootpa. Simulations were conducted for different irrigation regimes and the model output indicated that degradation led to a reduction in cumulative transpiration, which was almost entirely due to higher soil strength. However the reduction was relatively minor and there was evidence of water extraction by roots in all soil layers. Hence the degradation, in terms of higher soil strength and salinity, was not considered a significant management problem in the short - term. Evidence of increased waterlogging and its consequences require further investigation. Roots were observed in soils at Nuriootpa with penetration resistance (PR) much greater than 2 MPa, which was thought to completely impede grapevine root growth. It was hypothesised that roots avoided the physically hostile matrix by using biopores or structural cracks. A pot experiment tested this hypothesis and examined the relationship between soil strength, biopores and root growth for grapevines. Grapevine rootlings (cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) were grown into pots with varying degrees of soil compaction, with and without artificial biopores. No root growth occurred when PR&gt;2 MPa unless biopores were present. Pores also improved root growth in non-compacted soil when PR approached 1 MPa, which suggested biopores influence root growth in soils regardless of compaction levels. Therefore PR should not be the only tool used to examine the rooting-potential of a vineyard soil. An assessment of soil structure, such as biopore density and size, should be incorporated. In drip-irrigated vineyards, there is a possibility that degraded clayey subsoils could be ameliorated by manipulating zones of soil drying. At distances away from the dripper, drying events could generate shrinkage cracks that improve drainage and provide opportunities for root growth. From a practical perspective, drying events could be manipulated by moving the dripper laterally or by changing the irrigation frequency and intensity. The potential of this simple, non-invasive, ameliorative approach was investigated. Large, intact cores were sampled from Nuriootpa subsoil where degradation had been identified. Individual core bulk density was calculated using a formula that was derived by solving two common soil physics equations simultaneously. This proved to be an accurate and non - invasive method. Half the cores were leached with a calcium solution, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K [subscript s] ) was measured on all cores before and after drying to a matric potential of -1500 kPa. Soil drying led to a significant increase in K [subscript s], which indicated an improvement in structure through the creation of shrinkage cracks and heaving. Calcium treatment had no impact on K [subscript s], but that could change with more wetting and drying cycles. Results indicated the need for further investigation in the field, where different compressive and tensile forces operate. Harnessing this mechanism may provide an attractive soil management option for growers. The soil physical degradation identified is concerning for sustainable production in irrigated vineyards. Given the sites were representative of typical irrigation practices, such degradation may be widespread. While modelling suggested the impact of higher soil strength and salinity was minimal, these properties should be monitored because they may worsen with continuing irrigation. Furthermore, the impact of irrigation on subsoil permeability needs to be defined more accurately. An increased incidence of waterlogging could significantly restrict production, which was evident when overly wet growing seasons were modelled. If subsoil permeability was found to be significantly lower in irrigated soils, amelioration may be required. In this instance, the use of drying events to generate structure provides an option. Ultimately, the impact of drip irrigation on soil physical quality warrants further attention, and it is imperative to monitor the physical quality of vineyard soils to ensure sustainable production.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of environmental factors on the development of corticotroph subpopulations in the fetal sheep pituitary.</field><field name="creator">Farrand, Kirsten</field><field name="description">The prepartum surge in fetal plasma cortisol, essential for the maturation of organs in mammals and the normal timing of parturition in some species, including sheep, may result from an increase in the molar ratio of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the fetal circulation. Related to this, the cleavage of POMC to ACTH by the enzyme, prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), may be influenced by corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the capacity of individual corticotrophs to process POMC to ACTH may vary and individual corticotrophs are differentially responsive to CRH. It is not known, however, if there are separate corticotroph subpopulations in the fetal sheep pituitary which can be identified by differential colocalisation of POMC, ACTH and the CRH receptor 1, CRHR&#8321;, nor if changes in the relative proportions of such subpopulations play a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the overall changes in pituitary function described previously during gestation and in response to suboptimal uterine environments. To investigate these hypotheses, it was first necessary to develop novel methods for the simultaneous immunohistochemical labelling of POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; in individual cells on sections of fetal sheep pituitary. In addition, I developed and validated an automated method to categorise and count individual cells to increase the quantitative power of this study. Pituitary tissue was collected from control fetuses at 53-55 (n=6), 63-85 (n=6), 110 (n=4), 139-141 (n=4) and 144-145 (n=6) days gestation. Two animal models, known to alter pituitary function in the fetal sheep, were used to investigate corticotrophic adaptations to suboptimal uterine environments. For the maternal periconceptional undernutrition (PCUN) model, maternal feed was reduced to 70% of maintenance requirements from at least 45 days before to 7 days after mating and fetal tissues were collected at 53-55 days gestation (n=7). For the placental restriction (PR) model, the majority of the placental attachment sites were removed in five ewes before mating and fetal tissues were collected at 140 (n=4) and 144 (n=4) days gestation. Pituitary sections were simultaneously labelled with antisera raised against full length POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; and the proportions of pituitary cells with combinations of antisera were quantified. Four subpopulations of corticotrophs were identified, which expressed either: POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321;, ACTH+CRHR&#8321;, POMC+ CRHR&#8321; or POMConly. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of pituitary cells expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; between 53-55 and 65-85 days gestation, before an increase at 110 days gestation and a further marked decrease between 139-141 and 144-145 days gestation. In fetuses from the PCUN group, the proportion of pituitary cells expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; in early gestation was reduced. PR resulted in a significantly higher proportion of corticotrophs expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; during the prepartum period. This work represents the discovery of the differential expression of POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; in individual corticotrophs of the fetal sheep pituitary and the first insights into the pituitary adaptations to periconceptional nutrient restriction and placental restriction at the level of individual corticotrophs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endocrinology; ontogeny; fetal origins of adult disease; periconceptional undernutrition; placental restriction; immunohistochemistry; image analysis</field><field name="subject">Sheep Fetuses Physiology.</field><field name="subject">Pituitary gland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of phosphorus uptake pathways in a non-responsive arbuscular mycorrhizal host.</field><field name="creator">Grace, Emily Jane</field><field name="description">AM plants acquire Pi via two pathways; the direct uptake pathway via plant roots and the AM pathway via external fungal hyphae and colonised cortical cells. It has been assumed that these two pathways are additive and therefore in non-responsive plants the AM pathway is often considered to be non-functional. However, data from &#179;&#178;P uptake studies indicates that the AM pathway is functional in many non-responsive symbioses and in some instances supplies the majority of plant P. In recent years the high-affinity Pi transporters involved in both direct and AM Pi uptake pathways have been identified. They are expressed at the root epidermis and the symbiotic interface of colonised cortical cells and respond to the P and AM status of the plant. The overall objective of the work described in this thesis was to characterise Pi uptake via the AM pathway in barley, a non-responsive AM host, using an approach which integrated physiological measurements of plant responsiveness and AM contribution with investigations of gene expression and functional characterisation of the plant Pi transporters. A preliminary survey of field-grown barley demonstrated the persistence of AM colonisation under commercial cropping regimes in southern Australia and highlighted the relevance of AM studies to commercial agriculture. Under glasshouse conditions AM colonisation of barley induced depressions in growth and P uptake compared to NM controls. Growth depressions were unrelated to percent colonisation by two AM fungal species and could not readily be explained by fungal C demand; the strong correlation between growth and P content suggested that P was the limiting factor in these experiments. However, a compartmented pot system incorporating &#179;&#178;P-labelling demonstrated that the AM pathway is functional in colonised barley and, in the interaction with G. intraradices, contributed 48% of total P. This suggested that P flux via the direct uptake pathway is decreased in AM barley. The expression of three Pi transporters, HvPT1, HvPT2 and HvPT8 was investigated in colonised roots. HvPT1 and HvPT2 have previously been localised to the root epidermis and root hairs and are involved in Pi uptake via the direct pathway whilst HvPT8 is an AM-inducible Pi transporter which was localised by in-situ hybridisation to colonised cortical cells. Using promoter::GFP gene fusions the localisation of HvPT8 to arbuscule-containing cortical cells was confirmed in living roots from transgenic barley. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the expression of these three Pi transporters indicated that HvPT1 and HvPT2 were expressed constantly, under all conditions regardless of AM colonisation status and indicated that decreased P flux via the direct pathway is not related to expression of these transporters. HvPT8 was induced in AM colonised roots. However, the level of expression was not related to flux via the AM pathway or arbuscular colonisation. The HvPT8 transporter was further characterised by constitutive over-expression in transgenic barley. &#179;&#178;P uptake assays in excised roots demonstrated increased Pi uptake from low P solution compared to wild-type roots and confirmed that HvPT8 is a functional Pi transporter with high-affinity transport properties. This is the first report of characterisation of an AM-inducible Pi transporter in planta. When these transgenic plants were grown in solution culture there was no increase in growth or P uptake relative to wild-type or transgenic controls and growth in soil and AM colonisation were also unaffected in these transgenic lines. The data presented in this thesis highlights the importance of combined physiological and molecular approaches to characterising plant AM interactions. The persistence of AM colonisation in barley in the field indicates the importance of improving our understanding of symbiotic function in non-responsive plants. Future efforts should be directed towards understanding the signals which regulate P flux via both the direct and AM pathways with the ultimate aim of enhancing AM responsiveness of non-responsive species. Making the direct and AM pathways additive in nonresponsive species should be a key aim of future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphorus; phosphate transporter; barley; arbuscular mycorrhiza; symbiosis; plant nutrition; plant gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An extension of the Jolly-Seber model combining two sources of capture-recapture data</field><field name="creator">Madon, B&#233;n&#233;dicte</field><field name="description">I propose a modification of the Jolly-Seber model, the two-source Jolly-Seber (TSJS) model, to estimate population size by combining two sources of capture-recapture data of the same population where there might be an unknown overlap between two datasets. This is the case with recent surveys of whales and dolphins where researchers use individual identification records from both photo-identification and DNA profiling of skin biopsy samples. This sampling configuration results in two datasets that might contain the same individuals. This new approach enables the estimation of the overlap and the calculation of the population size using capture-recapture information arising from both sampling methods. Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the properties of the present estimator. When all the assumptions are met, the estimator seems to be unbiased as long as the occasion-specific simultaneous sampling probability is above 0.2. Simulation analyses also indicate that the proposed method performs better than existing closed-population estimators when there is little heterogeneity among individuals in capture probabilities and when the average capture probability is high. Alternatives have been explored and a two-source version of model M0 has also been developed and compared to the TSJS estimator. Traditional closed-population estimators have been compared to the new approaches (TSJS and two-source M0 models) when the population is open and the assumption of homogeneous capture probability is violated. Both procedures are finally applied to real data on the humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, on the wintering grounds of New Caledonia (South Pacific), where individuals have been sampled independently by skin sampling biopsy and photo-identification or simultaneously by both methods on a same capture occasion. The proposed methods hold great promise in monitoring by providing researchers and managers with a method allowing a diversity of sampling protocols. It could be more efficient in estimating population size, in terms of both precision and bias, than models based only on one type of data. And as it is important to control variation in a sampling design, this methodology could also provide a useful way to reduce variation by increasing the sample size and, hence, to enhance the estimator precision.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tuo Mao: the Operational History of the People's Liberation Army</field><field name="creator">Andrew, Martin Kenneth</field><field name="description">This thesis shows that the doctrine of Active Defence has been the overriding concern of the PLA since 1950 and not any form of People&#8217;s War. Active Defence is based on three basic principles: no provocation of other nations; no bases anywhere on foreign soil; and no seizure of territory. The PLA&#8217;s articulated doctrine in the 1950s was to &#8216;Protect the North and Defend the South&#8217;. In the 1960s this changed to &#8216;Lure the Enemy Deep into the Country&#8217; in order to crush him with &#8216;People&#8217;s War&#8217;. In the 1970s, this became &#8216;Prepare to Fight Early and Fight Big&#8217;. By using examples of the PLA in battle this thesis shows how the doctrine changed in light of failures in battle. The post-Mao reorganisation of the PLA to rectify these faults turned it into a modern military force, building on this legacy by transforming itself into a hardened and networked military. The PLA has now reached a stage of its history where it can fully implement its operational art that took root in the theories espoused in the 1920s and 1930s through the Soviet model, and tried to be implemented in the 1950s and 1960s only to be thwarted by the Cultural Revolution. The People&#8217;s Liberation Army&#8217;s operational art, this thesis demonstrates, has now come of age.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People's Liberation Army</field><field name="subject">China armed forces</field><field name="subject">History, Asia, Australia and Oceania (0332)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/24</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cloud of Suspicion: Investigating the Effects of Clouds of Suspicion on Sports Heroes' Perceived Endorsement Values</field><field name="creator">Borchard, Jillian M.</field><field name="description">Advertising practitioners recognise the benefit of using celebrities in brand or product sponsorship.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Storytelling memories : a tangible connection to bomber command veterans : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Marriott, Tanya</field><field name="description">As we pass the 6oth anniversary of the end of World War Two (WW2) historians are diligently collecting the memoirs of veterans to preserve for future generations. Public archives of memorabilia, letters, photos and artefacts, in the process of digitisation are complimenting the stone memorials of the past. This material culture of memory discusses human interaction. &#8220;The poor, the rich, the brave and the afraid, the hero and the deserter&#8221; (Moriarty, 1999, p 654). In contemporary museum culture this digitised information is presented in either web-based systems, or interactive kiosks. However, this approach to packaging memories and historical data often leaves out much of the depth of the topic information, skimming the surface of the knowledge conveyed. New solutions to memory and artefact display have been developed effectively in the Churchill room&#8217;s exhibit designed by Small Design (Kabat,2008) and Memory Miner (Memory Miner, 2008), a home-based memory archive programme by John Fox. Both convey the memories and artefacts upon a mapped interface, using our desire to discover and connect with memories to navigate the narrative in a self-guided format. The Storytelling Memories project seeks to build on current research to formulate an interactive platform of memory immersion and experience within a museum environment. The project utilises a touch sensitive surface as an interface between the viewer and the memories. A physical controller, when placed near the interface surface will &#8220;unlock&#8221; contained memories, enabling an open-ended storytelling experience. The design encourages the user to interact directly with the memories to create their own dialogue, with the intention of developing a more emotive, personal connection to the Veteran.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World War Two</field><field name="subject">museum exhibit design</field><field name="subject">war veterans</field><field name="subject">interactive platform</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410306 Communications and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He urupounamu e whakahaerengia ana e te wh&#257;nau : wh&#257;nau decision processes : a thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health (M&#257;ori), Massey University.

This thesis describes principles and practice that whanau utilise in decision processes from the findings of a retrospective qualitative case study of three whanau, who decided to participate in genetic research into a medical condition affecting their health. Four elements of whanau decision processes emerged from the data. Hui, rangatiratanga, manaakitanga and kotahitanga are Maori constructs that emphasise the collective nature of whanau decision making, and substantiate philosophical, theoretical and anecdotal evidence that Maori have distinctive ways of reaching decisions, underpinned by unique philosophical conventions. The results of this research place greater significance on the process of decision making than actual decisions, an incidental finding that has not been articulated by previous studies of Maori health and whanau. Contrary to western theoretical knowledge of decision making, whanau decision processes are collective activities. Individual decision making is closely linked to and depends on the collective, because individual identity manifests from the collective, and individual wellbeing is closely linked to that of the collective. When decision processes are familiar to members of a whanau, they are more likely to engage in decision making because they have a greater sense of knowledge and thus control of the processes, and they feel more able to contribute meaningfully to achieving aspirations for their own health. This thesis provides evidence that the New Zealand health sector, health legislation and policies are largely unfavourable for guaranteeing whanau engagement in decision processes. Yet, whanau decision making is an overall objective of the Government&#8217;s Maori Health Strategy: He Korowai Oranga, to address inequalities in health between Maori and other New Zealanders that have unacceptably become the norm.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori health</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Wh&#257;nau</field><field name="subject">Decision making</field><field name="subject">Hauora</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bringing the market 'back into' supermarket : creating a social hub for local communities : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walters, Amie</field><field name="description">This design project addresses the contemporary supermarket chain, seeking to bring back to this typology the traditional sociality and dynamic qualities of the urban marketplace. In this sense to &#8216;bring back&#8217; does not mean to restore time, but rather to provide the means for public engagement by establishing the supermarket as an active civic space. By negotiating between the micro-levels of everyday life and the macro-levels of culture and civic society, I propose to transform the supermarket into a communal &#8216;event-space&#8217; by formulating a &#8216;kit of parts&#8217; that is applied to the national supermarket chain New World &#8211; &#8220;the only local supermarket nationwide&#8221; &#8211; thereby establishing it as a viable, productive social hub. Encouraging health and wellbeing benefits through the rituals of cooking, dining, learning, communing and consuming, this sociocultural connection to the commercial environment also reinforces health research studies, which advocate a community-based approach toward producing the best outcome for upward mobility and community revitalization. The concept is developed through research into historical and contemporary models to a final proposal of a range of Communal Elements. These elements are adapted and applied to three site-specific locations around New Zealand within an urban, suburban and rural context. This new approach to land use, innovative partnerships, health planning and sensory-based design strategies instigates a radical revision of the role of the supermarket. The thesis proposes that this is not only fiscally viable but that it provides positive assets to communities and neighbourhoods as a global entity within a local reality.

Polyrhythm is a musical term for the simultaneous occurrence of two or more independent rhythms.

These issues of recruitment and retention are reflected in other areas for Maori such as health, where Maori have worse levels of health Maori are more likely to have lower socioeconomic status. The initial findings of recent research indicate that Maori nursing students find it a struggle to remain on the Bachelor of Health Science in nursing degree programme. This study is designed to explore further what might be occurring for Maori nursing students by obtaining a snapshot of their health. Aim: To describe the health status of Maori nursing students. Participants: 75 nursing students undertaking nursing degree programmes in New Zealand, who identified as Maori. Method: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken with Maori nursing students completing nursing degrees from thirteen of sixteen tertiary institutions in New Zealand. Instrument: A questionnaire comprising demographic data, SF-36, and two cultural questions was used for students to self assess their health status. Participants were also invited to write relevant comments on the survey. Findings: Descriptive statistical data revealed participants with a stronger cultural identity as Maori were more likely to have their cultural needs met whilst studying compared to participants with a weaker Maori cultural identity. Participants in a relationship had more income than those who were not in a relationship. Participants&#8217; overall health was worse than one year prior and their physical health was better than their mental health. More specifically, for physical health, general health, tiredness and lack of vitality were most affected, while roles and relationships were most affected for mental health. Implications: Institutions providing cultural support and kaupapa Maori programmes may assist in improving the recruitment and retention of Maori in nursing programmes. These results revealed a snapshot picture of the health 3 status of Maori nursing students and identified issues around their health status which is consistent with the literature.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing students</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">M&#257;ori</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical investigation of traffic flow : inhomogeneity induced emergence : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Liu, Mingzhe</field><field name="description">This research work is focused on understanding the effects of inhomogeneity on traffic flow by theoretical analysis and computer simulations. Traffic has been observed at almost all levels of natural and manmade systems (e.g., from microscopic protein motors to macroscopic objects like cars). For these various traffic, basic and emer- gent phenomena, modelling methods, theoretical analysis and physical meanings are normally concerned. Inhomogeneity like bottlenecks may cause traffic congestions or motor protein crowding. The crowded protein motors may lead to some human diseases. The congested traffic patterns have not been understood well so far. The modelling method in this research is based on totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). The following TASEP models are developed: TASEP with single inhomogeneity, TASEP with zoned inhomogeneity, TASEP with junction, TASEP with site sharing and different boundary conditions. These models are motivated by vehicular traffic, pedestrian trafficc, ant traffic, protein motor traffic and/or Internet traffic. Theoretical solutions for the proposed models are obtained and verified by Monte Carlo simulations. These theoretical results can be used as a base for further developments. The emergent properties such as phase transitions, phase separations and spontaneous symmetry breaking are observed and discussed. This study has contributed to a deeper understanding of generic traffic dynamics, particularly, in the presence of inhomogeneity, and has important implications for explanation or guidance of future traffic studies.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traffic flow</field><field name="subject">Computer modelling</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280210 Simulation and modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of subjective memory complaints in predicting cognitive impairment associated with future Alzheimer&#8217;s disease: a community based study</field><field name="creator">Tarantello, Concetta</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memory disorders -- Diagnosis.</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease -- Diagnosis.</field><field name="subject">Cognition disorders -- Diagnosis.</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychological tests.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing power balance in matrix organizations.</field><field name="creator">Saracoglu, Nursen Emine</field><field name="description">Modern organizations require new structural forms to cope with uncertainties arising from the challenges of global competition and rapid technological and environmental changes (Clarke and Clegg, 1998). One of the most important developments in the area of planned change has been on how to work with large systems so as to initiate and sustain change over time. It was from such contexts that the matrix concept emerged. During the 1950s the term matrix emerged in the United States aerospace industry and, as it has developed through the years, the term has come to be accepted in both business and academic circles. In the 1960s the matrix was sought as a fundamental alternative for dealing with unique management problems of coordination, communication and control (Davis and Lawrence, 1977). In the 1970s and 1980s interest in matrix organizational structures peaked. Since that time, research and literature on the matrix has diminished; contrarily, organizations continue to adopt the matrix as a viable alternative to deal with their increasingly complex business environment. In the recent past, some of the companies that applied a complex global matrix structure have included Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), Zurich (1991); Brown &amp; Root (BR), UK (1999); Hatch (1999) &#8211; Formerly BHPE and Kaiser mergers; IMC (1999); Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB), (1999); and Sinclair Knight and Merz (SKM), (2002). These companies have used matrix structures to achieve worldwide economies of scale, combined with local flexibility and responsiveness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of political theories of organizations in major international companies that have implemented matrix structure, with a focus that includes identifying: i. The key factors behind the strategic decision to change the corporate organization in international companies to a matrix structure. ii. The weaknesses and strengths of these matrix structures for subsequent organizational performance. iii. The effects of transition to matrix structure on organizational performance. iv. The factors used to maintain a power balance between divisions. v. A model that seeks to diminish or reduce matrix structure weaknesses to increase organizational effectiveness. The research was conducted in the form of a questionnaire survey and semistructured interviews. To illustrate the implementation of the matrix structure that occurred in a real world environment, SKM has been researched as an intensive case study. Preface As a professional engineer I have had opportunities to be involved with major projects in various international organizations. I have also had opportunities to observe organizations and to analyse their operations by exploring existing procedures and manuals. It was noticeable that the overall success of the projects relied very much on organizational decision making. This observation led my paradigm shift from projects to organizational studies and to the idea of conducting research that aims to investigate the weaknesses and strengths of matrix structures for organizational performance. Introduction Thesis structure This thesis presents a detailed account of the research activities undertaken by Nursen Saracoglu and the outcomes of that research. The purpose of this research is to investigate the validity of political theories of organizations in major international companies that have implemented matrix structure. Data has been collected using a combination of methods, including questionnaires, semistructured interviews, and direct examination of library catalogues and databases. The structure of this thesis is designed as follows: Chapter 1 introduces, and describes the background to the research project. The theories that provide a background to the various factors involved in organizations choosing to change to matrix structures, and the resulting positive and negative effects on the organization, are presented in this chapter. Chapters 2 reviews and analyses the literature review that has been conducted to focus, especially, on how changes to the structure and design of power in matrix organizations can have important implications and consequences. The literature review looks in detail at different organizational theories, particularly theories on power within organizations, which have a bearing on the effect of a matrix structure on an organization. Each theory is critiqued in terms of its relevance to matrix structure analysis. Strategic Contingencies Theory (SCT) and Resource Dependency Theory (RDT) best explain the effect of different levels of power inside a matrix structure. Chapter 3 details the research design and methodology. This chapter describes the advantages and disadvantages of quantitative and qualitative approaches and presents the rationale of selecting research methodology. The participating organization, SKM, is described in terms of its history and its matrix structure is outlined. Chapter 4 illustrates the results of research that defines potential areas of concern associated with matrix structures. The discussion mainly centres on the methods used to analyse the data and then focuses on the different dependent and independent variables derived from the data that are used in the analysis for correlation purposes. The aim of this chapter is to explain the various statistics used to analyse the data and to list the variables that came up as a result of answers to questionnaire. These variables are then analysed against each other in order to develop a sense of the effectiveness of the matrix structure in SKM. In Chapter 5 the qualitative data was examined using the responses obtained from interviews with the top managers of SKM. This chapter aims to identify the themes that have emerged from these interview responses and present them in order of most to least common within each area of research, illustrated with comments from some of the respondents. Chapter 6 discusses the survey and interview results in order to exploit quantitative findings to identify patterning in qualitative data.

The follow-through experience involves midwifery students following women on their journey through pregnancy, labour and birth and into the early parenting period. The concept was introduced to midwifery education in Australia in 2001 when it was embedded in the foundational Australian College of Midwives. National Education Standards for Bachelor of Midwifery programs. The inclusion of the follow-through experience in Bachelor of Midwifery education programs was a deliberate strategy to ensure midwifery students would experience midwifery continuity of care. Aims The aims of this research were to: explore the follow-through experience in order to better understand its impact on students, midwifery education providers and midwives, and, to identify the learning that is associated with this experience. Setting This research was conducted in Australia. Students from all three-year pre-registration Bachelor of Midwifery programs were invited to participate. Design A qualitative study was undertaken. In-depth interviews were conducted with key stakeholders who had been involved in the development and implementation of the follow-through experience. Data were collected from former and current Bachelor of Midwifery students through an online survey and telephone interviews. A thematic analysis was undertaken and situated learning and constructivist theories were used to identify whether learning occurred in the context of the follow-through experience. Results The findings provided a unique insight into the follow-through experience from the perception of students and stakeholders. This research established that students do learn from their engagement in this experience. This learning was characterised by the primacy of the relationship with the women. Students also identified the challenges they faced in undertaking these experiences, including problems with recruitment and time commitment. Difficulties were identified around requirements of the follow-through experience, the lack of support at times for students, and the lack of congruence with the existing Australian maternity system. These difficulties were identified as having a significant impact on the students. ability to engage in, and to maximise their learning from, this experience. A conceptual model was developed to provide a synthesis of the results of this research and a framework for effective implementation and management of the follow-through experience. Implications This research has implications for midwifery education, particularly in Australia but also internationally. This experience does indeed provide unique learning opportunities for students. It is however essential that the student is given adequate support to aid their learning and to ensure they gain the most from these experiences. Conclusions The follow-through experience is an innovative education strategy and this research identified that learning occurred within this experience. This learning was identified as being situated in the context of students being placed with women. This research clearly identifies the value of the follow-through experience as an important component of student learning.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery students.</field><field name="subject">Midwifery education.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economics of managing congestion: with special reference to backcountry recreation</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Geoffrey N.</field><field name="description">The management of congestible recreation resources has been based largely on the concept of satisfaction. This concept is poorly defined and often does not reflect objectives for management of recreation resources. One way of addressing these problems is to define and use measurable objectives for management of recreation resources. One such objective is economic efficiency. The concept of efficiency is defined and economic theory developed to identify efficient allocations of congestible resources, the efficient capacities of resources under different allocation mechanisms, and the efficiency costs of use of lottery-based allocation mechanisms. The usefulness of this body of economic theory in allocation of backcountry recreational resources is addressed through investigation of ability to measure demand for congestible resources, and the problems associated with use of surrogate measures of demand.  Theoretical models of efficient management of congestible resources cannot be applied with the current state of knowledge because existing non-market valuation methods are not able to identify Hicksian-compensated demand functions for congestible backcountry recreation. Use of Marshallian demand measures introduces the possibility of resource misallocations of unknown direction and magnitude.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">congestion</field><field name="subject">recreation</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">crowding</field><field name="subject">welfare</field><field name="subject">demand</field><field name="subject">displacement</field><field name="subject">rationalisation</field><field name="subject">non-market valuation</field><field name="subject">160402 - Recreation, Leisure and Tourism Geography</field><field name="subject">140205 - Environment and Resource Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maturity modelling of corporate responsibility: New Zealand case studies</field><field name="creator">Nichols, E.</field><field name="description">Corporations are increasingly being expected to be responsible to not only shareholders, but also to employees, society and for the environment. This expectation increases as business crises, such the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the Enron collapse, continue to occur. In New Zealand several umbrella organisations were established to aid organisations in the quest to become sustainable or corporately responsible, such as New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development, New Zealand Businesses for Social Responsibility, and the Sustainable Business Network. A number of high profile companies such as Hubbard Foods Ltd, Landcare Research, Fonterra and Telecom belong to these umbrella organisations and have produced reports that reflect not only economic prosperity but also environmental quality and social equity. The aim of this research is to identify how organisations are implementing corporate responsibility issues into the operations, and using this information to construct a maturity model. The value of a maturity model is as an analytic tool, where an organisation can be benchmarked against the best in the field. Developing a maturity model for integrating corporate responsibility into an organisation enables managers to identify at which stage the organisation is currently situated and then provides an action plan of where to progress in the future. A preliminary maturity model is developed based on previous models from the fields of corporate responsibility, environmental management and sustainability. This exploratory study used the case study method to analyse six organisations that are members of the New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development and are producing annual sustainability reports. Using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines for sustainability reporting, 10 years of annual reports from each case company were analysed and compared against these guidelines. The results were used to identify what corporate responsibility areas businesses are currently reporting on and therefore implementing within the organisation, and identifying if there is an evolutionary pattern applicable to all organisations thereby enabling the construction of a maturity model. The findings show that although there was an increase in the GRI indicators included the reporting is poorly developed. The major areas of change have been in the reporting of governance and management structures, the development and inclusion of vision statements and changes in management policies. There was increased reporting in some environmental and social indicators, but no clear patterns of change emerged. Using the data and analysis a refinement of the proposed maturity model was made.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporate responsibility</field><field name="subject">global reporting initiative</field><field name="subject">maturity modelling</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">sustainability reporting</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340100 Economic Theory</field><field name="subject">150303 - Corporate Governance and Stakeholder Engagement</field><field name="subject">150106 - Sustainability Accounting and Reporting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of imperfect mixing in suspended plant and animal cell cultures</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Caleb Kin Lok, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A common problem observed in large-scale cell cultivation is reduced culture performance compared with small-scale processes due to the existence of concentration gradients caused by poor mixing. Small-scale simulations using microbial cell suspensions have shown that circulation of cells through concentration gradients of oxygen, pH and glucose can result in reduction of cell growth and product formation similar to the effects observed in large-scale bioreactors. This study was aimed at using scale-down studies to investigate poor mixing in large-scale bioreactors used for suspended plant and animal cell culture. Two plant cell suspensions and a hybridoma cell line were used in this work. The range of oxygen transfer coefficients achieved in the hybridoma and plant suspensions were about 50???20 h-1 and 12???6 h-1, respectively. One-vessel simulation was developed to induce fluctuations of dissolved oxygen tension in a 2-L bioreactor using intermittent sparging of air and nitrogen. The effect of dissolved oxygen fluctuations on the cells was examined by comparing the performance of the cultures with those operated at constant dissolved oxygen tension. In the hybridoma suspension culture, only slight effects on cell growth were observed at circulation times above 300 s. No effect on the specific glucose uptake rate or antibody production was observed at the circulation times tested. Analysis of gene expression for selected hypoxia-related genes also suggested that the overall effect was limited. In plant cell suspensions, the specific growth rates and biomass yields on total sugar in the cultures under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension were essentially the same as those at constant dissolved oxygen tension for both transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Thalictrum minus. Under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension, no effect on antibody accumulation was observed in transgenic N. tabacum suspensions, but a decrease in berberine accumulation was observed in T. minus. From the results, it can be concluded that only minimal effects due to the development of concentration gradients would be expected in large-scale bioreactors used for the cultivation of the hybridoma and plant cell suspensions tested in this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Plant cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Novel hydrogels for protein drug delivery</field><field name="creator">Mawad, Damia, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Embolic agents are used to block blood flow of hypervascular tumours, ultimately resulting in target tissue necrosis. However, this therapy is limited by the formation of new blood vessels within the tumour, a process known as angiogenesis. Targeting angiogenesis led to the discovery of anti-angiogenic factors, large molecular weight proteins that can block the angiogenic process. The aim of this research is development of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) aqueous solutions that cross-link in situ to form a hydrogel that functions as an embolic agent for delivery of macromolecular drugs. Methods: PVA (14 kDa, 83% hydrolysed), functionalised by 7 acrylamide groups per chain, was used to prepare 10, 15, and 20wt% non-degradable hydrogels, cured by UV or redox initiation. Structural properties were characterised and the release of FITCDextran (20kDa) was quantified. Degradable networks were then prepared by attaching to PVA (83% and 98 % hydrolysed) ester linkages with an acrylate end group. The effect on degradation profiles was assessed by varying parameters such as macromer concentration, cross-linking density, polymer backbone and curing method. To further enhance the technology, radiopaque degradable PVA was synthesised, and degradation profiles were determined. Cell growth inhibition of modified PVA and degradable products were also investigated. Results: Redox initiation resulted in non-degradable PVA networks of well-controlled structural properties. Increasing the solid content from 10 to 20wt% prolonged the release time from few hours to ~ 2 days but had no effect on the percent release, with only a maximum release of 65% achieved. Ester attachment to the PVA allowed flexibility in designing networks of variable swelling behaviors and degradation times allowing ease of tailoring for specific clinical requirements. Synthesis of radiopaque degradable PVA hydrogels was successful without affecting the polymer solubility in water or its ability to polymerize by redox. This suggested that this novel hydrogel is a potential liquid embolic with enhanced X-ray visibility. Degradable products had negligible cytotoxicity.  Conclusion: Novel non-degradable and radiopaque degradable PVA hydrogels cured by redox initiation were developed in this research. The developed PVA hydrogels showed characteristics in vitro that are desirable for the in vivo application as release systems for anti-angiogenic factors.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug delivery systems</field><field name="subject">Drug targeting</field><field name="subject">Polymers in medicine</field><field name="subject">Drugs - Controlled release</field><field name="subject">Polymeric drug delivery systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Was the Tooth Fairy breast fed? The politics of infant tooth decay</field><field name="creator">Luxford, Yvonne, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the mid 1970s American paediatric dentists started publishing claims that breast feeding an infant on demand and/or during the night was as dangerous to the infant's dental health, in terms of the production of caries, as the previously established dangers of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay. It was argued by some dentists that this danger increased if the infant was breast fed for an extended period of time. Such claims have gained support from many dentists, and their professional bodies, into the twenty-first century. This thesis examines the historical, social, commercial and cultural influences that supported the development of such assertions. It analyses the ways in which expert reinforcement was gained, and scrutinises the scientific controversy as publicly fought in professional journals and other outlets. The thesis also examines the growing status of the dental profession, especially in connection with its claim to specialised scientific and medical knowledge in the production of dental caries. Further, consideration is given to the medicalisation of breast feeding and the associated commercial infant feeding dispute. The thesis attempts to redress the current lack of theoretical analysis of the construction of dental knowledge. To date there has been minimal academic contribution to the history of dentistry; however, the absence of extensive analysis has been advantageous in enabling an original approach to the material.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breastfeeding.</field><field name="subject">Dental caries in children.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereotype threat behind the wheel</field><field name="creator">Yeung, Nai Chi, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Stereotype threat refers to the pressure that individuals feel when they are at risk of confirming a demeaning stereotype about themselves. Research has found that stereotype threat impairs performance on cognitive-based tasks by inducing mental interference (e.g., Schmader &amp; Johns, 2003). This thesis hypothesised that this finding would generalise to driving and that drivers who are better able to inhibit cognitive interference (i.e., with better inhibitory ability) would be less susceptible to the disruptive effect of stereotype threat than drivers who are less able (i.e., with poorer inhibitory ability). A series of three experiments conducted in a driving simulator tested the predictions using the gender stereotype of driving skills and investigated the interpretation of the results. The experiments revealed that stereotype threat exerted both a facilitative and debilitative influence on driving performance, as indicated by different performance measures. The facilitative effect diminished when drivers experienced increased mental demands or when they were assessed by an unexpected performance measure, while the debilitative effect was more likely observed among drivers who received negative feedback than drivers who received positive feedback. Moreover, the results supported the prediction that inhibitory ability would moderate the detrimental impact of stereotype threat as the performance of drivers with poorer inhibitory ability was impeded more than that of drivers with better inhibitory ability. Regarding the processes underlying the present findings, the experiments provided suggestive evidence that stereotype threat elicits cognitive interference and simultaneously motivates drivers to concentrate on particular performance areas in an attempt to refute the stereotype. In combination, these processes appear to be at least partly responsible for the performance deficits and boosts observed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stereotype (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Stereotypes (Social psychology)</field><field name="subject">Bahavior modification</field><field name="subject">Automobile driving - Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Performance - Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a validated falls risk assessment for use in clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Tiedemann, Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Falls risk factor assessment is the first step in the development of appropriate intervention strategies for the prevention of falls. However, few multifactorial, validated falls risk assessments exist which are suitable for use in busy clinical settings. This project aimed to develop a reliable and valid falls risk assessment that was feasible for use in various clinical settings. The QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment was developed and evaluated via four methods; a) the test-retest reliability of the measures was assessed with 30 community-dwelling older people, b) the concurrent validity of the measures was assessed by comparison with performance in the Physiological Profile Assessment, c) the predictive validity of the measures was assessed by comparison of performance with prospective falls in two studies involving large samples of community dwelling older people and d) the feasibility of the assessment was evaluated with 40 clinicians who trialled the assessment with their patients. The QuickScreen clinical falls risk assessment consists of eight measures, including previous falls, total medications, psychoactive medications, visual acuity, touch sensation, the sit to stand test, the near tandem stand test and the alternate step test. The test-retest reliability of the assessment measures was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.89) and the assessment measures discriminated between multiple fallers and non-multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. The clinicians that trialled the assessment reported that it was quick and easy to administer and that it assisted in the management of their elderly patients. These results show that the QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment has proven validity, test-retest reliability and is practical for use in a variety of clinical settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) in old age</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strength and ductility of high-strength concrete shear walls under reversed cyclic loading</field><field name="creator">Dabbagh, Hooshang, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study concerns the strength and behaviour of low-rise shear walls made from high-strength concrete under reversed cyclic loading. The response of such walls is often strongly governed by the shear effects leading to the shear induced or brittle failure. The brittle nature of high-strength concrete poses further difficulties in obtaining ductile response from shear walls. An experimental program consisting of six high-strength concrete shear walls was carried out. Specimens were tested under inplane axial load and reversed cyclic displacements with the test parameters investigated being longitudinal reinforcement ratio, transverse reinforcement ratio and axial load. Lateral loads, lateral displacements and the strains of reinforcement in edge elements and web wall were measured. The test results showed the presence of axial load has a significant effect on the strength and ductility of the shear walls. The axially loaded wall specimens exhibited a brittle behaviour regardless of reinforcement ratio whereas the specimen with no axial load had a lower strength but higher ductility. It was also found that an increase in the longitudinal reinforcement ratio gave an increase in the failure load while an increase in the transverse reinforcement ratio had no significant effect on the strength but influenced the failure mode. A non-linear finite element program based on the crack membrane model and using smeared-fixed crack approach was developed with a new aggregate interlock model incorporated into the finite element procedure. The finite element model was corroborated by experimental results of shear panels and walls. The finite element analysis of shear wall specimens indicated that while strengths can be predicted reasonably, the stiffness of edge elements has a significant effect on the deformational results for two-dimensional analyses. Therefore, to capture the deformation of walls accurately, three-dimensional finite element analyses are required. The shear wall design provisions given in the current Australian Standard and the Building Code of American Concrete Institute were compared with the experimental results. The comparison showed that the calculated strengths based on the codes are considerably conservative, specially when there exists the axial load.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Concrete walls -- Testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of surface science to sulfide mineral processing</field><field name="creator">Goh, Siew Wei, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surface spectroscopic techniques have been applied to facets of the flotation beneficiation and hydrometallurgical extraction of sulfide minerals to enhance the fundamental understanding of these industrially important processes. As a precursor to the determination of surface chemical composition, the sub-surface properties of some sulfide minerals that have not previously been fully characterised were also investigated. The electronic properties of ??-NiS and ??-NiS (millerite), Ni3S2 (heazlewoodite), (Ni,Fe)9S8 (pentlandite), CuFe2S3 (cubanite), CuFeS2 (chalcopyrite), Cu5FeS4 (bornite) and CuS (covellite) were investigated by conventional and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy augmented by ab initio density of state calculations and NEXAFS spectral simulations. Particular aspects studied included the relationship between sulfur coordination number and core electron binding energies, the higher than expected core electron binding energies for the sulfur in the metal-excess nickel sulfides, and the formal oxidation states of the Cu and Fe in Cu-Fe sulfides. It was concluded that the binding energy dependence on coordination number was less than previously believed, that Ni-Ni bonding was the most likely explanation for the unusual properties of the Ni sulfides, and that there was no convincing evidence for Cu(II) in sulfides as had been claimed. Most of the NEXAFS spectra simulated by the FEFF8 and WIEN2k ab initio codes agreed well with experimental spectra, and the calculated densities of states were useful in rationalising the observed properties. XPS, static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and NEXAFS spectroscopy were used to investigate thiol flotation collector adsorption on several sulfides in order to determine the way in which the collector chemisorbs to the mineral surface, to differentiate monolayer from multilayer coverage, and to characterise the multilayer species. It was found that static SIMS alone was able to differentiate monolayer from multilayer coverage, and together with angle-resolved NEXAFS spectroscopy, was also able to confirm that 2-mercaptobenzothiazole interacted through both its N and exocyclic S atoms. The altered layers formed on chalcopyrite and heazlewoodite during acid leaching were examined primarily by means of threshold S KLL Auger electron spectroscopy, but no evidence for buried interfacial species was obtained.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface chemistry</field><field name="subject">Sulphide minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spontaneous recovery in Pavlovian fear extinction and latent inhibition</field><field name="creator">Leung, Hiu Tin, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments reported in the present thesis examined the behavioural processes of Pavlovian fear extinction and latent inhibition. The first series of experiments studied the reacquisition of extinguished fear responses following different amounts of extinction training. Rapid reacquisition occurred when rats were reconditioned after moderate extinction, showing that the original learning remained intact across this extinction. In contrast, when reconditioning was given after massive extinction, reconditioned responding was first depressed but then spontaneously recovered over time. This suggests that massive extinction produces a relatively permanent loss of the originally learned responding, while additionally imposes on the extinguished CS a transient latent inhibitory process that prevented the immediate but not the delayed expression of reconditioning.  The second series of experiments studied the impact of spontaneous recovery of extinguished fear responses on their additional extinction. These experiments demonstrated that a CS that had time to show spontaneous recovery underwent greater response loss across additional extinction than one lacking recovery. They also showed that an excitor extinguished in compound with a CS showing recovery suffered greater response loss than an excitor extinguished in compound with a CS lacking recovery. Further, extinction of a compound composed of two CSs, one showing recovery and a second lacking recovery, produced greater extinction to the CS that showed recovery. These results show that spontaneous recovery of extinguished responses deepens their extinction through an error-correction mechanism regulated by both common and individual error terms.  The third series of experiments studied the spontaneous recovery of latently inhibited and extinguished fear responses in within-subject designs. Using a compound test procedure, a CS that had received extensive preexposure or extensive extinction was found to have undergone greater spontaneous recovery relative to a CS just moderately preexposed or moderately extinguished. A CS given a mixed history of preexposure and extinction also underwent greater recovery relative to a CS just preexposed or just extinguished. These results suggest that both latent inhibition and extinction share a transient depressive process, and that the resulting recovery of responding is proportional to the amount of this depression.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spontaneous recovery</field><field name="subject">extinction</field><field name="subject">latent inhibition</field><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">conditioning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of iron chelators as anti-proliferative agents against cancer : molecular mechanisms behind the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Le, Nghia Trung Van, School of Women???s &amp; Children???s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">Iron (Fe) is a fundamental requirement for life since it is involved in many cellular processes critical for growth and proliferation. Indeed, studies which deplete Fe from neoplastic cells using specific chelating agents result in G1/S arrest and apoptosis. However, the precise role of Fe in the control of the cell cycle remains unclear. Chapter one of this thesis, discusses the potential mechanism(s) by which Fe chelators cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that this process involves multiple molecules and is highly complex. Thus, the studies presented in this thesis assess the effects of specific high affinity Fe chelators on the expression of molecules that may play important roles in cellular arrest and apoptosis. The general methodology used in these studies is summarized in chapter 2. In previous investigations Fe chelators such as 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311) were shown to be far more potent anti-tumor agents than the clinically used ligand, desferrioxamine (DFO). Studies detailed in chapter 3, examined the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the universal cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 following Fe-deprivation. To further characterize the effects of chelators on cell cycle arrest, experiments compared their activity to the DNA-damaging agents, actinomycin D (Act D) and cisplatin (CP). The latter two compounds increase the expression of p53 and its target gene p21CIP1/WAF1. Incubation of normal and neoplastic cells with all agents resulted in increased accumulation of nuclear p53, with the effect being more pronounced for Act D and CP. As expected, both Act D and CP markedly increased nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels, while DFO and 311 caused a significant (p &amp;lt 0.0004) decrease. This result was surprising, since the WAF1 gene which encodes the universal cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 was markedly up-regulated at the mRNA level following Fe chelation. Proteasomal inhibition studies demonstrated the partial involvement of proteasomes in decreasing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 levels following DFO treatment. In contrast, the incubation of 311-treated cells with proteasomal inhibitors did not reverse the down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 when compared to the control. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that only DNA-damaging agents and not Fe chelators increased the nuclear translocation of p21CIP1/WAF1. Collectively, this suggests that the chelators prevented translation of WAF1. Moreover, this decrease in nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein expression did not appear to be due to a general effect in which Fe chelators inhibited mRNA translation since the transferrin receptor 1 was markedly up-regulated (15-21- fold) by DFO or 311. The combination of 311 with Act D or CP prevented the marked p21CIP1/WAF1 nuclear accumulation normally observed in response to these DNAdamaging agents. Significantly, the effect of chelation on reducing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 expression was reversed by the Fe-donor, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), indicating that WAF1 translation was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. This study is the first to demonstrate that Fe chelators markedly up-regulate the mRNA expression of WAF1 but paradoxically inhibit its translation. The down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 protein by chelators may be a novel mechanism by which these ligands cause G1/S arrest through cell cycle dysregulation. In chapter 4, gene arrays were used to assess the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle control and the p53 pathway following the incubation of cells with DFO, 311 or Act D. The N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) was the only molecule identified that was specifically up-regulated by Fe chelation and not DNA-damage. Although the exact function of the Ndrg1 protein is unclear, previous studies have shown that this molecule markedly slows down tumor growth (Kurdistani et al. Cancer Res. 1998:58;4439-44) and acts as a potent metastasis suppressor protein (Bandyopadhyay et al. Cancer Res. 2003:63;1731-6). Subsequent experiments examined the mRNA and protein expression of Ndrg1 using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. Incubation of cells with DFO or 311 resulted in a marked increase in the expression of Ndrg1 mRNA and protein within 3 h and 6 h, respectively. This increase in Ndrg1 after incubation with chelators was not found with their Fe complexes nor when the Fe-binding site had been synthetically inactivated. In addition, the induction of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was correlated with the ligands??? permeability and anti-proliferative activity. Indeed, the up-regulation of Ndrg1 by Fe chelators can be readily reversed by Fe-repletion. Collectively, this indicates that the induction of Ndrg1 was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. Previous studies demonstrated for the first time that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was dependent on HIF-1?? and p53 stabilization. In contrast, investigations using fibroblasts derived from a HIF-1?? knockout (HIF-1??-KO) mouse demonstrated that the transcriptional upregulation of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was mediated by a HIF-1??-dependent and - independent mechanism. In addition, subsequent experiments using the p53-deficient H1299 lung carcinoma cell line revealed that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was not dependent on p53 status after Fe-depletion. Collectively, the presented studies suggest that Ndrg1 may be a novel link between Fe metabolism and the control of proliferation. The up-regulation of Ndrg1 by potent Fe chelators is significant and may be beneficial in the prevention of tumor metastasis. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that the molecular mechanisms behind the G1/S arrest and apoptosis involved multiple molecules following Fe chelation. Indeed, this study shows a potential mechanism by which Fe chelators may cause cell cycle dysregulation through the down-regulation of nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels. In addition, the work presented identifies the up-regulation of the metastasis suppressor protein, Ndrg1, following Fe-deprivation. Collectively, the results indicate that potent Fe chelators can not only be used as anti-proliferative agents, but may also be beneficial at inhibiting tumor cell metastasis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Iron chelates</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Racism, pluralism and democracy in Australia : re-conceptualising racial vilification legislation</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Tamsin, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australian debates about racial vilification legislation have been dominated by mainstream American First Amendment jurisprudence and popular American notions of 'free speech' to the exclusion of alternative Europeans models. This can be seen from notions of Australian racial vilification legislation as inconsistent with 'free speech' rights as well as the influence of some of the basic assumptions of First Amendment jurisprudence on political speech cases in the Australian High Court. Despite the widespread existence of legislation that penalises racial vilification at State and Federal levels, there has been a rise in Australia over the past 10 years of divisive 'race' politics. Against that background, this thesis considers the scope and limits of racial vilification legislation in Australia. It is argued that First Amendment jurisprudence is inadequate in the Australian context, because it is heavily dependent upon economic metaphors, individualistic notions of identity and outdated theories of communication. It assumes that 'free speech' in terms of lack of government intervention is essential to 'democracy'. It ignores the content, context and effect of harmful speech, except in extreme cases, with the result that socially harmful speech is protected in the name of 'free speech'. This has narrowed the parameters within which racial vilification is understood and hindered the development of a broader discourse on the realities of racist harms, and the mechanisms necessary for their redress. The author calls for the development of an Australian jurisprudence of harmful speech. Failing an Australian Bill of Rights, that jurisprudence would be grounded upon the implied constitutional right of free political speech, informed by an awareness that modern structures of public speech favour a very limited range of speech and speakers. The jurisprudence would take advantage of the insights of Critical Race Theory into the connections between racial vilification and racist behaviour, as well as the personal and social harms of racial vilification. Finally, it is argued that the concepts of human dignity and equality, which underpin European discrimination legislation and notions of justice, provide a way forward for Australian jurisprudence in this area.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Race discrimination</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Freedom of speech</field><field name="subject">Racism in language</field><field name="subject">Racism</field><field name="subject">Civil rights</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composing women and feminism at the turn of the twentieth century in England, France and Germany</field><field name="creator">Harris, Amanda Jane, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The turn from the nineteenth century into the twentieth saw an increase in the number of composing European women attaining prominence in the music world. This period of history is also now recognised as one of the key phases of the first wave of feminism. Feminists and musical women moved in a similar stratum of society. Although women of this era have increasingly been the subject of scholarly research, music historians have rarely investigated the links between the turn of the century??s wave of composing women and feminists.  This dissertation uses the feminist and musical press as a means to investigate composing women??s engagement with feminism. I examine feminists?? regard for women musicians and conversely composing women??s views on feminism. The thesis also reframes the privatelives of composing women through an analysis of primary sources. The composers who form the focus of this biographical investigation include Lili Boulanger (1893-1918), Ethel Smyth (1858-1944), Luise Adolpha Le Beau (1850-1927), Louise H??ritte-Viardot (1841-1918) and Armande de Polignac (1876-1962). Using a large body of newly analysed, unpublished correspondence and private papers, this research offers fresh insights into the biographies of composing women as well as their own self-portrayal, revealing the complex nature of Ethel Smyth??s sexuality and reassessing the fatalistic portrait of Lili Boulanger which has been drawn in some previous studies. These biographical insights background the contentions of the thesis that composing women and feminists shared common ground.  Through investigating the presence of musicians in the feminist press and of feminism in the musical press, the thesis reveals an ambivalent relationship between feminists and musicians. The disappointed expectations of feminists are contrasted with the reasons composing women had for retaining a distance from feminism. The exploration of composing women??s political and personal context enables an understanding not only of their contribution to music history, but also of their place within the greater history of women??s development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nineteenth century</field><field name="subject">Wwomen</field><field name="subject">Feminism</field><field name="subject">Twentieth century</field><field name="subject">Composers</field><field name="subject">England</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">Smyth</field><field name="subject">Boulanger</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformations of the oriental in the architectural work of Juraj Neidhardt and Dusan Grabrijan</field><field name="creator">Alic, Dijana, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the correlation between architectural expression and political ideology in the work of two prominent post-World War Two Yugoslav architects, Dusan Grabrijan and Juraj Neidhardt. It focuses on their collaborative architectural writings, namely 'Sarajevo and Its Satellites' (1942), published during the pro-Nazi government of the Independent State of Croatia, and Architecture of Bosnia and the Way Towards Modernity (1957), produced at the peak of Yugoslav socialism. Both publications explored the relevance of the Ottoman/Islamic built heritage to the creation of a modern city but only in the latter did the authors identify this legacy as a suitable catalyst for the creation of a Bosnian modern architectural expression. This change in position, the thesis argues, developed in relation to the 1950s nationalist discourse in Yugoslavia and, more specifically, the socialist led validation of the Bosnian Muslim community through the latter's official re-presentation from a religious to a national group. Grabrijan and Neidhardt's conception of the Bosnian Oriental expression as a 'synthesis of old experiences and new ways', similarly offered to resolve the long-standing problematic relationship between the architecture of Ottoman origin and an architecture deemed appropriate for a socialist society. Architectural historians of Yugoslav modernism have recognised Grabrijan and Neidhardt's contribution to modernity and praised their capacity to connect Yugoslav modernism with the international agenda. However, the specifics of Grabrijan and Neidhardt's vision and the ideological connotations embedded in it have not been acknowledged. This thesis addresses that omission and shows that while there had been earlier attempts to integrate the Bosnian Islamic past into architectural debates, Grabrijan and Neidhardt's model of Bosnian Oriental offered a place for the Ottoman fabric within the new socialist architectural aspirations. The thesis foregrounds the important role that architecture plays in the process of construction, as well as destruction, of national identities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Socialism</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Ideology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proposing a cultural landscape paradigm: a case study: Prospect reservoir at Western Sydney</field><field name="creator">Zambre, Pallavi, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study sets out to investigate and question the Burra Charter, its Interpretations and approaches for protection of cultural landscape in Australia. While achieving the preservation of state and national icons, the Charter has overlooked the meanings and values of heritage landscape. Drawing on the field of landscape theory, my research seeks to extend the theoretical approach to study of the cultural landscape. Thus, this thesis proposes the cultural landscape paradigm (CLP) which provides a framework to interpret the inherent values of cultural landscape based on ecological, experiential and narrative approaches.  Towards this goal, the research attempts to demonstrate and apply the CLP by conducting a case study of the culturally significant landscape of Prospect Reservoir in western Sydney. The study is undertaken with the help of a detailed analysis of landscape elements, historic documents, narrative references, personal observations and photographs. I found that although the site has been conserved on the principles of the Burra Charter, the regional identity and sense of place has not been taken into account. Over time, degradation of the ecosystem has changed the ecological, narrative and experiential quality of the place. Thus the landscape reflects the Burra Charter's values of national, state significance, and dominance in portraying a story of European past, with limited concern for aboriginal cultural landscape.  A current issue at the site is the increasing urban pressure of western Sydney. How can we interpret, protect the regional identity and cope with the ecological changes so as to maintain the continuity with the past landscape? Similarly to what extent does the Burra Charter address these issues? I respond to these questions by developing and applying the CLP. This results in expanding the values and meaning of the cultural landscape of Prospect Reservoir, and provides guidance for cultural landscape planning in general. Hence, the thesis also demonstrates the need for the Burra Charter practitioners to rethink their actions for the future of cultural landscapes, where the landscape is a continuously changing, naturally and socially driven phenomenon.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation and 21st century projections of global climate models at a regional scale over Australia</field><field name="creator">Perkins, Sarah Elizabeth, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the ability of global climate models (GCMs) to simulate observed conditions at regional scales by examining probability density functions (PDFs) of daily minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax) and precipitation (P). Two new measures of model skill are proposed using PDFs of observed and modelled data. The first metric (Sscore) compares the amount of overlap between the two PDFs. The second metric (Tailskill) is the weighted difference between the PDF tails, where extreme events are represented. The resulting measures of skill are used to differentiate, at a regional scale, between weaker and stronger models. It is investigated whether the weaker models bias future projections given by multi-model ensembles, increasing the uncertainty in the range of projected values and the change from the 20th Century.  The Sscore is demonstrated to be robust against inhomogenities found in highdensity Australian datasets, and is a simple and quantitative measure of how well each GCM can simulate all observed events. This methodology is executed for twelve Australian regions of varying climates for all Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment Report models for which daily data was available for 1961-2000. Across Tmin, Tmax and P some GCMs perform well, demonstrating that some GCMs provide credible simulations of climate at sub-continental scales.  Projections of the annual and seasonal mean and yearly return values over the A2 and B1 emission scenarios are investigated. Models are omitted from an ensemble based on their ability to simulate the observed PDF at regional scales. The stronger models are generally in agreement with the change in mean values, particularly for Tmin and Tmax, though it is shown that they vary in their projections of the yearly return value at least twice as much as projections in the mean values.  Lastly, a means-based evaluation method, the Sscore and the Tailskill are employed to differentiate between weaker and stronger models for projections in the 20-year return value of Tmin and Tmax. Weaker-skilled ensembles project larger increases in 20-year return values than stronger-skilled ensembles, such that in some regions for maximum temperature the ensembles are statistically significantly different. Demonstrably weaker models bias projections given by an all-model ensemble and should be excluded so the most reliable estimates of future climate can be obtained.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Projection</field><field name="subject">Climate</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Existence and uniqueness of solutions to non-linear first order dynamic equations on time scales</field><field name="creator">Zaidi, Atiya-tul-Hussain, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The theory of dynamic equations on time scales provides an important bridge between the fields of differential and difference equations. It is particularly useful in describing phenomena that possess a hybrid continuous-discrete behaviour in their growth, like many temperate--2one insect populations and crops. A dynamic equation on a time scale is a generalised. 'two-in-one' model, it serves as a differential equation for purely continuous domains and as a difference equation for purely discrete ones.  The field of "dynamic equations on time scales" is about 20 years old. As such, much of the basic (yet very important) linear theory has been established, however the non-linear extensions are yet to be fully developed. This thesis aims to fill this gap by providing the foundational framework of non-linear results from which further lines of inquiry can be launched.  This thesis answers several important questions regarding the qualitative and quantitative properties of solutions to non-linear dynamic equations on time scales.  Namely, (i) When do solutions exist? (ii) If solutions exist, then are they unique? (iii) How can such solutions be closely approximated? (iv) How can we explicitly solve certain problems to extract their solutions?  The methods employed to address the above questions include: dynamic inequalities; iterative techniques and the method of successive approximations; and the fixed point approaches of Banach and Schauder.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A competency based theory of business partnering : an empirical study of Australian business-to-business partnerships</field><field name="creator">Gray, David Michael, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research, conceptualizes, operationalises and empirically tests a competency-based theory of business-partnering performance within an Australian business-partnering context. Drawing on theory from social psychology and marketing, the research integrates a number of theoretical approaches including resource-based theory, competency based theory, relational factors view, relational interaction theory, and competitive advantage theory to explain why some business partnerships are more successful than others are. The results use a ???process model of business-partnering??? performance to explain the interaction process through which business partners exploit the available partnering related ???operant resources??? and how these resources influence the performance of business partnerships and their ability to achieve a competitive advantage. Specifically, this research investigates a number of important internal resources, which facilitate the building, and maintaining of external businesspartner relations including ???joint alliance competence???, ???joint alliance structure???, ???interpersonal relational competence??? and ???market orientation???. This research shows that an adequate understanding of how these ???operant resources??? are deployed/accessed and co-created by the business partners to achieve a competitive advantage requires integration of ???relational interaction theory??? into ???resource-based theory??? and ???competency-based theory???. The results of this research show that those firms that pursue business partnerships as a competitive strategy can improve performance by engaging in a range of activities, which facilitate the building of ???relational capital??? of the partnership. The results provide support for conclusion that ???communication behaviour??? is a central and important mediating variable in the performance of business partnerships. Overall, the findings are consistent with the literature in finding support for the notion that ???joint alliance competence??? is a direct antecedent of businesspartnering performance. There is support for the notion that the partnership???s ability to govern and manage itself is an important determinant of ???communication behaviour??? and ???co-ordination behaviour???. The results identified ???market orientation???, ???co-ordination behaviour??? and ???relational capital??? as all having a direct influence on business-partnership profitability. Finally, given the relatively high failure rates of business partnerships this research provides greater opportunity for a discussion of the kinds of intervention strategies that could be used to minimise the risk of failure and/or to improve partnership performance.

These networks have broad applications spanning wide ar- eas, such as environmental monitoring, infrastructure maintenance, traffic manage- ment, energy management, disaster mitigation, personal medical monitoring, smart building, as well as military and defence. While these applications require high per- formance from the network, they suffer from resource constraints (such as limited battery power, processing capability, buffer space, etc.) that do not appear in tra- ditional wired networks. The inherent infrastructure-less characteristic of the sensor and ad hoc networks creates significant challenges. This dissertation addresses these challenges with two protocol designs. The main contributions of this dissertation are the design and evaluation of CS- MAC (stands for CDMA Sensor MAC), a novel multi-channel media access control (MAC) protocol for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) wire- less sensor networks. Our protocol design uses combination of DS-CDMA and fre- quency division to reduce the channel interference and consequently improves system capacity and network throughput. We provide theoretical characterisation of the mean multiple access interference (MAI) at a given node in relation to the number of frequency channels. We show that by using only a small number of frequency chan- nels, the mean MAI can be reduced significantly. Through discrete event simulation (using UC Berkerly NS-2 simulator), we provide comparison of our proposed system to a pure DS-CDMA system as well as a contention based system. Simulation results reveal that our proposed system can achieve significant improvement in system efi ciency (measured in packet/second/channel) of a contention based system. When the same number of packets are transmitted in the network, our system consumes much less communication energy compared to the contention based system. A distributed channel allocation protocol is also proposed for the network forma- tion phase. We prove that our algorithm converges with correct channel assignments. Simulation results reveal that a much smaller number of channels is required than theoretical value when nodes are uniformly randomly deployed. The second contribution of this dissertation involves the design and evaluation of two location-aware select optimal neighbour (SON) algorithms for CSMA/CA based MAC protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. Both algorithms concentrate on the improvement of energy eficiency of the whole network through the optimisation of the number of neighbours of each node. Our algorithms not only consider radio electronic energy consumption (e.g., coding, decoding) and radio transmission energy consumption (e.g., power amplifier), but also the electronic energy consumption at those irrelevant receivers (those who are not addressed by the transmission) that are located within the transmission range. Through simulations, we show that our algorithms can achieve signi??cant energy savings compared to the standard IEEE 802.11.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">sensor networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic ocular surface medium: clinical and in vitro studies</field><field name="creator">Watson, Stephanie Louise, Prince of Wale Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Therapeutic Ocular Surface Medium (TOSM) is a potential new treatment for patients with ocular surface disorders such as dry eye and persistent epithelial defect (PED). New therapies are needed as many patients with dry eye and PED continue to suffer despite maximal standard therapy, and while efficacious autologous serum therapy is not routinely available. Like serum, TOSM contains tear components and was expected to have some of the physiological effects of tears. Clinical and in vitro studies were used to evaluate two similar formulations of TOSM. To comply with local pharmacy manufacturing policies, components were omitted from TOSM v1 to produce TOSM v2. In pilot studies, conducted over 1 month, TOSM v1 improved dry eye signs and symptoms and healed over a quarter of PED. In a 2 month randomised double-masked trial, TOSM v2 improved the signs and symptoms of dry eye but was not superior to saline (placebo). No serious or irreversible side-effects occurred. The altered composition of TOSM v2 may have reduced its efficacy. However, a significant improvement in blepharitis (eyelid margin disease) and conjunctival impression cytology (an objective measure of ocular surface health) was found with TOSM v2. Improvement in blepharitis is an encouraging finding as it has not been reported in other dry eye trials. It was hypothesised that TOSM would benefit ocular surface disorders by improving ocular surface health. In vitro, primary and cell line human corneal epithelial cells were supported by TOSM v1 and TOSM v2. Outgrowth from limbal explants and corneal reepithelialisation following wounding occurred with TOSM v2. This and the impression cytology findings support our hypothesis. Further, ocular surface damage with dry eye and PED may activate the corneal wound healing response. For wound healing, compared to human serum, TOSM v1 and TOSM v2 had beneficial effects in vitro on epithelial cells and human corneal fibroblasts. This may translate into a reduction in potentially vision-threatening corneal scarring in vivo with TOSM. However, ocular surface disorders are a heterogenous group and wound healing is a complex process such that different preparations of TOSM may be needed for use in different disorders and at different stages of the disease process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Therapeutics, Ophthalmological</field><field name="subject">Eye - Diseases</field><field name="subject">Ocular Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards prevention - a population health approach to child abuse and neglect : health indicators and the identification of antecedent causal pathways</field><field name="creator">O'Donnell, Melissa</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The primary aims of this thesis were to investigate health indicators of child maltreatment, as well as pathways into the child protection system using routinely collected government databases, enabling a preventative health approach to child abuse and neglect. This thesis aims to improve understanding of the trends in child maltreatment and the factors, at the child and family level, which increase or reduce vulnerability to child maltreatment so more effective prevention policies and practices can be developed. This project uses longitudinal de-identified population data from the Western Australian Government Departments of Child Protection, Health and Disability Services. These data contained information on demographic, clinical, social and child protection outcomes of children and their families. Record linkage of administrative data was undertaken to: investigate health indicators of abuse and neglect using Hospital Morbidity data to enable the monitoring of population trends in abuse and neglect; compare proportion of cases obtained using health indicators with the Department of Child Protection data, and describe the physical, psychological and social characteristics of abused and/or neglected children and families. Statistical techniques utilised include logistic and Cox regression to investigate risk of adverse child outcomes, taking into account potential confounding and time to event. The main findings include:  There has been an increase in assault and maltreatment related hospital admissions over the last 25 years.  ...  There has been a marked increase in the birth prevalence of Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome (NWS) in Western Australia over the last 25 years, from 1 per 10,000 live births in 1980, to 31 per 10,000 live births in 2005. Specific maternal characteristics associated with having a child with NWS are identified and these children have an increased risk of child protection involvement.  A population level analysis of child and parental factors determined the estimated increase in risk of substantiated child maltreatment for child intellectual disability, parental admissions for mental health, substance use, and assault, as well as greater socio-economic disadvantage. Conclusions This is the first body of research which has extensively used longitudinal, population level linked health and child protection data to investigate health indicators of child abuse and neglect and antecedent causal pathways. Monitoring injuries and conditions associated with child abuse and neglect in routinely collected data and using multiple sources of ascertainment are important initiatives in child maltreatment surveillance. Health indicators of child abuse and neglect are not subject to the same definitional and policy issues as child protection data and therefore provide a more valid comparison over time and between jurisdictions. The identification of factors which increase vulnerability for children and families to child maltreatment is essential in the implementation of prevention strategies including universal public health approaches as well as the identification of at-risk families for targeted intervention.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child abuse -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Child abuse -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Child welfare -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Health status indicators</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Child abuse and neglect</field><field name="subject">Data linkage</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pixel and patch based texture synthesis using image segmentation</field><field name="creator">Tran, Minh Tue</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Texture exists all around us and serves as an important visual cue for the human visual system. Captured within an image, we identify texture by its recognisable visual pattern. It carries extensive information and plays an important role in our interpretation of a visual scene. The subject of this thesis is texture synthesis, which is de ned as the creation of a new texture that shares the fundamental visual characteristics of an existing texture such that the new image and the original are perceptually similar. Textures are used in computer graphics, computer-aided design, image processing and visualisation to produce realistic recreations of what we see in the world. For example, the texture on an object communicates its shape and surface properties in a 3D scene. Humans can discriminate between two textures and decide on their similarity in an instant, yet, achieving this algorithmically is not a simple process. Textures range in complexity and developing an approach that consistently synthe- sises this immense range is a dfficult problem to solve and motivates this research. Typically, texture synthesis methods aim to replicate texture by transferring the recognisable repeated patterns from the sample texture to synthesised output. Feature transferal can be achieved by matching pixels or patches from the sample to the output. As a result, two main approaches, pixel-based and patch-based, have es- tablished themselves in the active  eld of texture synthesis. This thesis contributes to the present knowledge by introducing two novel texture synthesis methods. Both methods use image segmentation to improve synthesis results.  ... The sample is segmented and the boundaries of the middle patch are confined to follow segment boundaries. This prevents texture features from being cut o  prematurely, a common artifact of patch-based results, and eliminates the need for patch boundary comparisons that most other patch- based synthesis methods employ. Since no user input is required, this method is simple and straight-forward to run. The tiling of pre-computed tile pairs allows outputs that are relatively large to the sample size to be generated quickly. Output results show great success for textures with stochastic and semi-stochastic clustered features but future work is needed to suit more highly structured textures. Lastly these two texture synthesis methods are applied to the areas of image restoration and image replacement. These two areas of image processing involve replacing parts of an image with synthesised texture and are often referred to as constrained texture synthesis. Images can contain a large amount of complex information, therefore replacing parts of an image while maintaining image fidelity is a difficult problem to solve.

Studies performed in Western societies suggest that the annual incidence of DVT is about 0.8 to 1.2 per 1,000, PE about 0.3 to 0.6 per 1,000, and VTE about 1.0 to 1.8 per 1,000. However, it is not known if these estimates can be generalised to the Australian population because of differences in ethnic composition and other risk factors for VTE among the different populations. In this thesis, I undertook a prospective, community-based cohort study over a 13-month period in 2003 &#150; 2004 to determine the incidence and crude event rate of symptomatic, objectively verified VTE in north-east metropolitan Perth. The study population was broadly representative of the national Australian population in terms of age, sex and ethnic distribution. Cases were identified through multiple overlapping sources. The incidence of DVT, PE and VTE in the community were 0.52 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.41 &#150; 0.63), 0.31 (95% CI: 0.22 &#150; 0.40) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.69 &#150; 0.97) per 1000 per year, respectively. The annual incidence of DVT, adjusted to the World Standard population, was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.26 &#150; 0.44) per 1000, PE 0.21 (95% CI: 0.14 &#150; 0.28) per 1000 and VTE 0.57 (95% CI: 0.47 &#150; 0.67) per 1000. The crude event rate for VTE was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.71 &#150; 0.99) per 1000 per year. These findings suggest that the incidence of DVT, PE and VTE are lower than in other Western societies studied. Possible reasons include a lower prevalence of exposure to causal risk factors (genetic and environmental) and incomplete case ascertainment. Knowledge of the local incidence and event rate allows health planners to allocate appropriate resources and evaluate cost-effective preventive measures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pulmonary embolism</field><field name="subject">Thromboembolism</field><field name="subject">Thrombophlebitis</field><field name="subject">Perth (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Community incidence</field><field name="subject">North-east metropolitan Perth</field><field name="subject">Venous thromboembolism</field><field name="subject">Prospective study</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathology of rotator cuff tendonopathy</field><field name="creator">Wu, Bing</field><field name="description">Tendonopathy, resulting in the loss of mechanical strength of a tendon, is a serious health problem affecting many people. The common symptom of tendonopathy is pain &#150; patients' daily activities, their participation in sport and exercise, and their ability to work are greatly compromised. Tendonopathy is considered to be a degenerative disorder caused by repetitive injury of the tendon. The most common tendon lesions are Achilles tendon rupture, lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) and rotator cuff tear. However, in spite of its clinical significance, our knowledge about tendonopathy is still very poor. This research was undertaken to investigate the pathology of tendonopathy. It is proposed that apoptosis, autophagic cell death and myofibroblasts play a role in the progression of tendonopathy in the rotator cuff; the aim of this study was therefore to determine if this was indeed the case. Tendon tissues were collected from 30 patients suffering from rotator cuff tears. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL assay) was performed to detect apoptosis. Autophagic cell death of the tenocytes in the ruptured rotator cuff tendon was detected by immunohistochemical staining for ubiquitin. Myofibroblasts were identified immunohistochemically with anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin (anti--SMA) antibody. The distribution of apoptosis, autophagic cell death and myofibroblasts, as well as the total cell density, were assessed respectively and were correlated using a four-category (i.e. graded from 0-3) degeneration of collagen matrix. &#150; 6 &#150; The results showed that apoptosis, autophagic cell death and myofibroblasts were observed in all of the samples. The highest percentage of autophagic cell death was evidenced in the Grade 2 matrix, while the percentage of apoptosis increased significantly with the increase of matrix degeneration from Grade 0-3; a similar pattern was found for myofibroblasts. The total cell numbers varied among the matrix grades, with the maximum and minimum percentages occurring in Grades 1 and 3, respectively. It can be concluded that apoptosis, autophagic cell death and myofibroblasts might be closely related to the damage of the extracellular matrix (ECM) structure.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Cell death</field><field name="subject">Extracellular matrix</field><field name="subject">Myofibroblasts</field><field name="subject">Shoulder joint -- Rotator cuff -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Tendons -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Autophagy</field><field name="subject">Myofibroblast</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Tendonopathy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fetal programming of sheep for production on saltbush</field><field name="creator">Chadwick, Megan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Saltbush is one of the few types of forage that will grow on salt affected land but, sheep struggle to maintain weight when grazing saltbush mainly because of its high salt content. Therefore, a strategy to improve salt tolerance of sheep would be beneficial to the profitable use of revegetated saline land. This could be done by manipulating the dietary salt load of pregnant or lactating ewes which could 'program', or permanently alter the physiology of their offspring to allow them to cope better with a high-salt diet as adults. When rat dams consume a high amount of salt during pregnancy, the salt balance mechanisms of their offspring are 'programmed' due to suppression of the offspring's renin-angiotensin system in early development. If this occurs in offspring from ewes grazing saltbush, beneficial adaptations may be programmed in these offspring which could allow them to better cope with the high-salt content of saltbush. I tested the general hypothesis that offspring born to ewes that consumed a high-salt or saltbush diet from mid-pregnancy to early lactation would have an increased capacity to cope with salt that would allow them gain weight when grazing saltbush in later life. To test this hypothesis, I pair-fed ewes either a high-salt diet (14% NaCl) or control diet (2% NaCl) in an animal house from day 60 of gestation until day 21 of lactation. During the same period, I also conducted a field experiment where ewes grazed on saltbush (supplemented with barley) or on pasture (supplemented with lupins).  ...  This led to the high-salt offspring retaining more salt than control animals. In contrast, the renin activity of saltbush was consistently lower than pasture offspring which allowed them to excrete salt more rapidly. In experiment three, the saltbush offspring gained tissue weight after grazing saltbush for 8 weeks, whereas the offspring in the other three treatments lost weight. High-salt and saltbush offspring also had higher greasy fleece weights at 22 months of age than their respective control groups. Feeding saltbush to ewes from mid-pregnancy to early lactation induces physiological adaptations in their offspring that allow them to cope better with salt and gain weight when grazing saltbush as adults, supporting my hypothesis. However, contrary to expectations, the high-salt offspring did not gain weight when grazing saltbush because their physiological adaptations, such as salt retention, did not allow them to cope better with a salt load. The reason that saltbush offspring showed different adaptations to highsalt offspring is likely to be because saltbush contains not only NaCl but also high amounts of other minerals such as potassium, and other plant compounds, which may influence the adaptive responses of the offspring. This research has direct implications for farmers because it shows they could utilize otherwise unproductive saltland by grazing pregnant ewes on saltbush to 'program' their offspring to gain weight when they graze saltbush later in life.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Halophytes as feed</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Feed utilization efficiency</field><field name="subject">Fetal programming</field><field name="subject">Saltbush</field><field name="subject">High-salt diet</field><field name="subject">Renin angiotensin system</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From conduits to communities : plant water use strategies and evapotranspiration in a semi-arid ecosystem in south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Patrick John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Understanding the ecohydrological dynamics of native vegetation can provide a benchmark for future efforts to restore landscape hydrology and allow predictions of potential landscape responses to climate uncertainty and associated changes in vegetation cover. The key drivers of evapotranspiration (Et) involved in maintaining a hydrological balance that minimises deep drainage in semi-arid ecosystems operate at a range of scales, and in this thesis I assessed the water relations of functionally and taxonomically diverse plant communities in south-western Australia from the leaf-level to ecosystem scale. For three key communities; heath shrubland, mallee (small multistemmed eucalypt) -heath, and open eucalypt woodland, populating a typical catenary sequence of soil types along a slope, I addressed the following questions: 1) What are the predominant water use strategies of wheatbelt native plant communities and what underlying trade-offs determine the distribution of plant water use strategies along the topographical gradient? 2) What are the roles of soil water and hydraulic limitation in controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of transpiration in different functional types? 3) What is the magnitude and partitioning of total Et in the woodland community and what processes determine Et fluxes on a seasonal and annual basis? 4) What are the seasonal differences in Et among contrasting community-types and how do these patterns relate to canopy attributes and transpiration capacity along the topographical gradient? A key philosophical step in working with species-rich communities was to develop the concept of 'hydraulic functional types' (HFTs) to identify groupings of species using associations of physiological and morphological traits that define their hydrological functioning.  .... However, as shallow soils dried during spring and summer, Et fluxes were significantly lower at the heath site (0.35 versus 0.66 mm day-1 for the woodland in February), demonstrating that the seasonality of Et fluxes differentiates communityscale contributions to regional water balance. Land-surface exchange of water over native vegetation is by no means uniform, but varies according to the spatial and temporal availability of water along topographical gradients. In general, shallow soils present fewer opportunities for water use partitioning and favour drought hardiness and a transpiration response that tracks recent rainfall patterns, whereas deeper soils promote greater differentiation in water use strategy and support canopies responsive to atmospheric demand. This thesis provides a unique description of ecosystem water balance in a global biodiversity hotspot by viewing complex vegetation mosaics in terms of their relevant hydrological units. This information is fundamental to sustainable agroforestry and revegetation efforts and our ability to gauge possible changes in vegetation structure and function under a changing climate.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arid regions -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Ecohydrology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Evapotranspiration -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Transpiration</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Water requirements</field><field name="subject">Plant water use</field><field name="subject">Semi-arid ecosystems</field><field name="subject">Ecohydrology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fictional Savonarola and the creation of modern Italy</field><field name="creator">Hogan, Marina</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with Girolamo Savonarola and with his place in the imagination and collective memory of Italians from the early nineteenth century to the present. It examines the works of a variety of Italian fictional authors who turned to Savonarola in the belief that he could help them pursue objectives which, in their opinion, Italy and Italians should strive to achieve. At first, he was called upon by nationalist writers of the Risorgimento to inspire a people and convince it of the need for a free, united Italy. Later, as the new nation began to consolidate and Italians came to realize that unification had not delivered all that it had promised, Savonarola was employed in a negative way to show that military action and force were necessary to ensure Italy's progress to the status of great power. As Italians became more aware of the grave social issues facing their nation, he was called upon, once again, to help change social policy and to remind the people of its civic responsibility to the less fortunate members of society. The extent of Savonarola's adaptability is also explored through the analysis of his manipulation by the writers of Fascist Italy. Remarkably, he was used to highlight to Italians their duty to stand by Mussolini and the Fascist Regime during their struggle with the Catholic Church and the Pope. At the same time, however, one writer daringly used Savonarola's apostolate to condemn the Regime and the people's blind adherence to its philosophies. As Fascism fell and Italy began to rebuild after the Second World War, there was no longer a need for Savonarola to be used for political or militaristic ends. In recent times, emphasis has been placed on the human side of the Friar and he has been employed solely to guide Italians in a civic, moral and spiritual sense. From the Risorgimento to the present, the various changes in Italian history have been foreshadowed in the treatment of Savonarola by Italian fictional authors who turned to him in difficult times to help define what it is to be Italian.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fictional Savonarola</field><field name="subject">Creation modern Italy</field><field name="subject">Savonarola, Girolamo, -- 1452-1498</field><field name="subject">Savonarola, Girolamo, -- 1452-1498 -- Fiction</field><field name="subject">Savonarola, Girolamo, -- 1452-1498 -- Influence</field><field name="subject">Italy -- Politics and government -- 1870-1914</field><field name="subject">Italy -- Politics and government -- 1914-1945</field><field name="subject">Fascism -- Italy -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Risorgimento</field><field name="subject">Religion in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing systems to identify and deploy saline and waterlogging tolerant lines of Eucalyptus occidentalis Endl</field><field name="creator">Hendrati, Rina Laksmi</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Eucalyptus occidentalis, a timber species from south Western Australia, is highly salt and waterlogging tolerant. Screening identified genotypes tolerant of high salt concentrations and waterlogging. Tolerance at provenance, family and individual level, and how phenotypic performance under salt and waterlogging was inherited was explored to provide a breeding population. Salt and/or waterlogged screening was carried out under controlled conditions up to extreme salt levels to determine tolerance between genotypes. This tank method was shown to produce repeatable results. Seedlings of 30 families from 9 provenances were used for screening. At low salt concentration (up to 300 mM NaCl), differentiation occurred for some traits but in general there was only a slight reduction in growth under salt, and waterlogging alone was not detrimental. At high salt concentration (550 mM) differentiation occurred among genotypes for all traits. Equivalent genotypes were also planted in field trials at three sites, two with medium (583 - 847 mm) and one with low rainfall (372 - 469 mm), in southern Western Australia. Survival was low (&lt;53%) after 9 months due to an exceptional dry season followed by 3 months waterlogging in Kirkwood (38 - 1360 mSm-1), but was high &gt;89% after 33 months in saline fields in Sandalwindy (96 - 976 mSm-1) and Roberts (88 - 1424 mSm-1). Some families were similarly in high rank for height under saline conditions in controlled and field trials. Height had the highest narrow-sense heritability value, especially under controlled saltwaterlogging (0.85) treatment and 20% selection enabled a gain of 8-14% under controlled conditions and in the field. Leaf production under salt was not an inherited trait. Systems were developed to hasten deployment of selected material. Extended daylength (16 h) and paclobutrazol (1 mg a.i/mm stem circumference) stimulated flowering in 2 year-old plants. Clonal propagation was possible. Grafting success varied from 0-100% depending on scion/rootstock provenances.  ... There was only a slight reduction in heterozygosity from species level to provenance and family levels, and two superior genotypes maintained high diversity. v Crossing was possible using one stop pollination of cut immature styles and capsule retention varied from 0-34% and germination rate from 2-96%. Genetic distance between parents was correlated with seed set and offspring fitness. Wider genetic distances increased capsule retention, seed germination and seedling survival. Under 500 mM salt-waterlogging, offspring heights were similar when parental genetic distances were similar. High heritability value for height from ANOVA-REML parental screening was confirmed using parent-offspring regression. Screened superior genotypes, which withstood very high salt concentration, provide a breeding population for further breeding and for plantations under saline regions in low-medium rainfall areas in Western Australia and other parts of the world. These trees provide an economic return in areas where no other plants may survive and an environmental service in potentially reducing waterlogging, salinity and its spread.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Effect of salt on</field><field name="subject">Soils, Salts in</field><field name="subject">Waterlogging (Soils)</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus occidentalis</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Waterlogging</field><field name="subject">Screening</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of the recovery of the microbial community in jarrah forest soils after bauxite mining and prescription burning</field><field name="creator">Lalor, Briony Maree</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Recovery of soil nutrients, microbial populations and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes are critical to the success of rehabilitation following major ecosystem disturbance. Bauxite mining represents a major ecosystem disturbance to the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest in the south-west of Western Australia. Mining has created a mosaic of mined areas in various stages of succession surrounded by non-mined forest areas. Initial site preparations within rehabilitation areas such as contour ripping alter soil structure (creation of mound and furrows) and over time also influence the distribution of vegetation and litter. Current performance criteria developed by industry, government and other stakeholders have determined that before post-bauxite mined areas of jarrah forest can be integrated back into normal forest management practises they should be functional and demonstrate resilience to normal forest disturbances such as fire. Furthermore, resilience should be of a manner comparable to non-mined analogue forest sites. Currently little is known of the resilience of microbial communities and C and N cycling in rehabilitation sites to normal forest disturbances such as prescription burning. As such, before rehabilitated jarrah forests can be successfully integrated into broad scale forest management regimes, a more thorough knowledge of the potential impacts of burning practises on the soil microbial community and C and N cycling processes in these systems is required.  ... While there are similar rates of C and N cycling the underlying microbial community structure was distinctly different; implying a high degree of functional redundancy with respect to C and N cycling. Differences in the C and N cycling and structure of the microbial communities were likely to be due to differences in soil environmental conditions (i.e. soil alkalinity/acidity, soil moisture) and C substrate availability which influence the physiological status of the microbial community and in turn are related to successional age of the forests. Results also suggest that the measurement of CLPP can be a useful approach for assessment of changes in the functional ability of microbial communities. However, the interpretation of how well these rehabilitation forests have recovered heterotrophic abilities was greatly affected by the methodological approach used (e.g. MicroRespTM or Degens and Harris, 1997). Importantly, results from Chapter 4 and 5 suggested that the effects of a moderate prescription fire on C and N processes, CLPP and microbial community structure of 18 year old rehabilitation forests are likely to be short-lived (&lt; 2 years). Furthermore, the effects of the moderate spring prescription fire were not large enough to decouple C and N cycling processes over the short-term (&lt; 1 years) which suggests that by 18 years of age rehabilitation forests demonstrate comparable functional resilience to a moderate prescription burn.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminum mines and mining -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Fire ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Forest ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Jarrah -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">Prescribed burning -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soil microbiology</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Nitrogen content -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">Community level physiological profiles</field><field name="subject">Microbial community structure</field><field name="subject">Mine rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Jarrah forest</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen cycling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breast cancer and pregnancy : how does a concurrent or subsequent pregnancy affect breast cancer diagnosis, management and outcomes?</field><field name="creator">Ives, Angela Denise</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  A diagnosis of breast cancer is a life-changing event for any woman. For young women and their families it can be devastating. Women aged less than 45 years make up 20% of new cases of breast cancer diagnosed annually in Australia. With the trend for women to delay pregnancy, young women diagnosed with breast cancer may want at least the option to become pregnant after diagnosis and treatment but little is known about how pregnancy affects breast cancer or how breast cancer affects pregnancy. The aims of this thesis were to investigate how concurrent and subsequent pregnancy affects the development and outcomes of breast cancer and how breast cancer affects a concurrent or subsequent pregnancy. This study describes two groups of women identified from the entire Western Australian population less than 45 years of age when diagnosed with: 1. Gestational breast cancer, defined as breast cancer diagnosed while a woman is pregnant or in the first twelve months after completion of a pregnancy; and 2. Breast cancer who subsequently conceive. This study focused on three main areas; patterns of care and outcomes for women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer and those women diagnosed with breast cancer who subsequently conceived; the imaging and pathological characteristics of gestational breast cancer; and lastly the psychosocial issues associated with gestational breast cancer.  ...  This result was statistically significant.  In an age and staged matched case control study lymph node negativity did not purvey a survival advantage for women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer as it did for the non- gestational breast cancer controls. Women diagnosed with breast cancer who have good prognosis tumours need not necessarily wait two years to become pregnant. In an age matched case control study women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer were more likely to have extensive insitu carcinoma, higher mitotic rates and tumours with medullary like features than their age matched controls. In a Cox's proportional hazards regression model which included pathological characteristics, there was no significant difference in survival for women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer were compared to women diagnosed with non-gestational breast cancers. The psychosocial issues for women diagnosed with gestational breast cancer are similar to other young women diagnosed with breast cancer but the effect on the 9 lives of women dealing with pregnancy and breast cancer simultaneously was much greater. The issues of breast cancer and pregnancy are complex at both a physical and psychological level. Much more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of how pregnancy affects breast cancer and its spread. Women who are pregnant when diagnosed with breast cancer or who consider pregnancy after their diagnosis need unbiased support from those around them. Survival is important but other survivorship issues may be just as important. To translate these findings into clinical practice and offer directions for future research eleven recommendations are proposed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Fertility</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Young women -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Fertility</field><field name="subject">Young women</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributing team leadership : a grounded theory study of how followers exercise leadership</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Grant</field><field name="description">The complex social phenomenon of leadership has been of interest for thousands of years and the subject of formal scientific research for over a century. The individual (sole) leader has been the focus of majority of the studies and leader-follower dyads have featured prominently in the identification of leader behaviours The paradigm has shifted, from the early quantitative approach to the most recent 'new leadership' perspectives which include theories such as transformational, charismatic and visionary leadership. Non-leaders (labelled followers and sometimes subordinates) have received little research attention despite being in the majority in teams. This study examined the research question, 'How do followers exercise leadership?' Approaching the question using grounded theory research methodology, leadership behaviours were studied in 48 seven- to nine-person teams of Year 11 male students attending an outdoor leadership program in one of two consecutive years in South Africa. The qualitative research was based on (1) data collected and analysed from observations in the field, including an extensive video record; (2) semi-structured interviews with course participants and staff; and (3) in-course leadership review documents. This research extends the existing theory of distributed leadership by defining and clarifying particular processes and skills of how followers in this study exercised leadership. Influence is central to leadership and also the core category in this study. In the context of the substantive field, theoretical propositions generated by the research include that team members are generally concerned about contributing and belonging and, when leading, focus on initiating or taking charge of influencing. Instead of being limited to a single leader, the leading role is distributed amongst team members, though not necessarily in equal proportion. In all teams, more than one member exercised leadership, and in most teams every member exercised some leadership behaviour during the four day program. Depending on context, followers exercised leadership by employing one or more of eight influencing behaviours and switching from following to leading roles. Communicating and listening emerged as core leadership behaviours, vital to team processes and most frequently used. Coordinating and motivating were identified as key influencing behaviours, regularly used and important to team processes. Risking, anchoring, mediating and channelling were categorised as situational influencing behaviours, used less frequently, based on context. This research articulates the mechanism whereby team members switch between leading, following and sometimes nominal member roles. Insights are provided of how individuals in a team may, for a period of time, occupy a leading role and then, at other times, occupy a following role. Occupying these roles is not related to formal assignment of roles. This study not only shows that followers play a greater role in leadership than existing literature on research indicates, but it also defines eight influencing behaviours used to exercise leadership. The study has important implications which can help managers and leaders in formal roles maximise the contributions of their followers. This study can also contribute to the design of leadership training and help build more effective teams and organisations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Organizational sociology</field><field name="subject">Self-directed work teams</field><field name="subject">Teams in the workplace</field><field name="subject">Followership</field><field name="subject">Distributed leadership</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conflict management in consumer behaviour : examining the effect of preferred conflict management style on propensity to bargain</field><field name="creator">Daly, Timothy Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on two under-researched areas of consumer behaviour: conflict handling styles and consumer bargaining. As illustrated in this thesis, consumer bargaining is a substantial and important behaviour that has rarely been studied from a consumer perspective. Further, conflict handling, which is considered an important and wellresearched phenomenon in an organisational context, has been rarely applied to consumer behaviour, despite the potential for conflict in many areas. The aims of this thesis were to a) examine consumer bargaining behaviour across a variety of culturally diverse nations; b) develop and validate a new instrument to measure conflict handling styles; and c) examine the relationships between the likelihood of consumer bargaining, preferred conflict handling styles, and personal values. Consumer bargaining was found to be common in both developed and developing nations. Respondents from Australia and Germany reported bargaining for a broad range of products that vary in their prices, including cars, electronics, appliances, clothing, and computers. Bargaining in South Korea was even more common, including everyday purchases like clothing, and food and drink. Finally, bargaining in Brazil was almost as common as in South Korea, and also included expensive consumer durable purchases, such as electronic products and cars, in addition to everyday purchases, such as clothing, and food and drink. The conflict handling style instrument developed in this project had convergent validity with existing ratings scales, reproduced the theorised structure of the dual-concerns model of conflict handling, and had predictive validity in a service recovery context. The benefits iii of the new scale over existing ratings scales include: a) capturing relative preference for the conflict handling styles; b) reduction of sources of common method variance; c) reduction of ratings scale response biases; and d) reduction of numerical effect biases, such as different perceived distances between response categories. The newly developed scale was also used to assess the hypothesised relationships between personal values, conflict handling styles, and consumer bargaining intensity in a developed Western country (Germany). As expected, the dominate conflict handling style was positively related, while the avoid conflict handling style was negatively related to consumer bargaining intensity. Although no relationship was found between personal values and consumer bargaining intensity, personal values were found to be an antecedent of conflict handling styles. Specifically, the power value type was found to be a positive predictor of the dominate conflict handling style, while benevolence and social universalism were found to be positive predictors of the integrate conflict handling style.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Conflict management</field><field name="subject">Negotiation</field><field name="subject">Consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">Conflict handling style</field><field name="subject">Dual-concerns model</field><field name="subject">Bargaining</field><field name="subject">Best-worst scaling</field><field name="subject">Personal values</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wrist guards as a public health intervention to reduce the risk of wrist fracture in snowboarders</field><field name="creator">Slaney, Graham</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The aim of the research was to explore the association between wrist guard use and wrist fracture risk in snowboarders in Australia.

Cases were defined as any snowboarder seen at the Clinic with a fractured wrist (N = 119), and controls as any snowboarder seen at the clinic for any reasons other than a fractured wrist (N = 375). Severity of forearm injuries were defined and analysed separately. Study participants completed a questionnaire consisting of: basic demographics (age and sex only); wrist guard use on the day of presentation; normal use of protective equipment; the number of days spent snowboarding that season; the ability of the snowboarder; and ski run difficulty. Risk taking behaviour was assessed by a history of any previous fracture or joint injury and psychometric questions. Clinic medical staff recorded site and severity of fractures and soft tissue injuries. Logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted odds ratios for these risk factors against the main outcome measure. Presence of wrist fracture and injury in snowboarders with and without wrist guards.  ... There was a significant association between wrist guard use and soft tissue elbow injuries (adjusted odds ratio = 17.6, p = 0.011, 95% CI: 1.93 &#150; 160.2), but no significant association with elbow fractures (adjusted odds ratio = 1.84, p = 0.385, 95% CI: 0.46 &#150; 7.30). There was thus no evidence in this study that wrist guards increase the occurrence of other severe injuries in the forearm by transferring the impact force away from the protected wrist up the arm. No evidence was found for compensatory risk taking behaviour in participants wearing protective equipment. A local injury prevention strategy was implemented in schools in the Mt Buller district during the course of this study. Education about the protective effects of wrist guards enabled a policy change in the local secondary college so that wrist guard use is now mandatory for all snowboarders in the school ski programme: That policy states:</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Snowboarding injuries -- Victoria</field><field name="subject">Snowboarding -- Safety measures -- Victoria</field><field name="subject">Wrist -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Wrist guards</field><field name="subject">Wrist fracture</field><field name="subject">Snowboard</field><field name="subject">Injury prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of maternal-fetal interactions on the aetiology of allergic disease</field><field name="creator">Breckler, Liza Anne</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The dramatic increase in the expression of allergic diseases such as asthma and allergy over the last 20-30 years has highlighted the urgent need to identify causative factors. It was hypothesised that direct immune interactions between mother and fetus contribute to the cytokine milieu of pregnancy, thus influencing immune maturation after birth. Further it was speculated that the cytokine responses produced as a result of maternalfetal interactions are Th-2 skewed in women allergic disease, which programmes their offspring towards developing an allergic phenotype after birth. To test this hypothesis a cohort of 169 pregnant women were recruited at 20 weeks gestation and defined as allergic or non-allergic based on both clinical history and skin prick test sensitisation. These women and their infants were followed up throughout pregnancy (20 weeks, 30 weeks, 36 weeks gestation and 6 weeks post-partum) and up to 2.5 years of age. Mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) were used to measure maternal cytokine (IL-6, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-) and lymphoproliferative responses to fetal alloantigens at each pregnancy time-point. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of mothers and infants were performed to assess the effect of HLA mismatch on maternal MLR responses to their fetus. After delivery, mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from cord blood (CB) and stimulated with allergens, mitogen and toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.  .... As IL-6 also participates in adaptive immunity by promoting Th-2 differentiation it is proposed that the production of IL-6 as a results of maternal encounters with paternal antigens during pregnancy, contribute to the Th-2 skewed responses observed universally in most infants at birth. Associations between maternal-fetal interaction and clinical outcomes in infancy: Although clinical signs of allergy in infancy were not the main outcome measure of this thesis, there were interesting, yet complex relationships between the production of these maternal cytokines towards the fetus and allergic disease at infant follow-ups. Increased maternal IFN-&#191; to fetal alloantigen was associated with asthma at 2.5 years and a trend towards recurrent wheeze at 12 months. In contrast decreased maternal IL-13 production was associated with IgE mediated food allergy at 12 months. Adjusting for maternal allergy and other potential confounders including infant gender, method of delivery, HLA mismatch, and paternal allergy did not account for these relationships. Further follow-ups of these infants are required to determine if these relationship last in to early childhood. In conclusion, the findings of this thesis provides further support for the hypothesis that immune responses at birth are programmed prenatally, and that this programming has implications later in life. Importantly, the placenta is the immunologically active interface between mother and fetus during pregnancy. Therefore it is emphasised that there is a crucial need for future research to focus on early immune programming at the placental level before the aetiological pathways of immune mediated diseases can be fully elucidated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Allergy -- Etiology</field><field name="subject">Maternal-fetal exchange</field><field name="subject">Cytokines -- Immunology</field><field name="subject">Fetus -- Immunology</field><field name="subject">Fetus</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Allergic Disease</field><field name="subject">Immunity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterisation of cranio-facial form in young West Australians of different population affinity</field><field name="creator">Ruddenklau, Kate Johanna</field><field name="description">One major area of forensic science is to provide identifications of previously unidentifiable individuals. Many of these techniques rely on the accurate interpretation of the morphology of the facial form. An individual's facial form is the result of a complex interaction of their genetic ancestry and the many environmental factors they are exposed to throughout their lives. Facial studies to date have primarily focused on single populations, or on comparing different populations residing in different areas. Very few have looked at the relationships between the facial forms of different populations living in the same area of individuals of mixed population ancestry. In this study the facial morphology of 431 West Australian young adults was analysed, and the relationship between their self reported population affinity and their facial form investigated. The impact of factors such as sexual dimorphism and body mass on facial form were also considered. The relationship between the facial morphology of individuals of mixed population heritage and their parent populations was studied, as was the effect that migration can have on facial form. Strong relationships between self-reported population affinity and facial form were demonstrated over the range of populations in the study. Sex and body mass were seen to have an impact on the morphology of the face; but they did not eclipse the influence of the genetic population affinity. Individuals with ancestry derived from more than one population were seen to resemble one population over another in different areas of the face rather than demonstrating an equal combination of both parent populations. A migration effect was seen in the facial forms of even the first generation offspring of migrants.</field><field name="date">&lt;2010&gt;</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">3D stereophotogrametry</field><field name="subject">Face</field><field name="subject">Morphometric</field><field name="subject">Migration effect</field><field name="subject">Age</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">BMI</field><field name="subject">Population affinity</field><field name="subject">Human identification</field><field name="subject">Human beings -- Anthropometry</field><field name="subject">Phenetic affinity</field><field name="subject">Photogrammetry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family holiday decision making in Thailand : projecting preference and influence</field><field name="creator">Praditsuwan, Nattaya</field><field name="description">One major policy of the Tourism Authority of Thailand is to promote domestic tourism. In Thailand, the family is considered to be the main social group, and as such is the main target for domestic tourism marketers. However, relatively little is known about family decision making, especially in Thailand. This thesis addresses this gap in knowledge by employing a two-staged conjoint study to examine the preferences and the influence of family members in a destination choice decision. At the first stage (an in-home interview), family members were asked to provide their holiday destination preferences and their estimation of the other family members' preferences. At the second stage (an in-home interview two weeks later), they are asked to provide their estimation of the joint family preferences, after being provided with a table listing the individual family members' preferences. Finally, they were asked to make the holiday destination decision as a family. This design allowed three thesis aims to be addressed: 1) to examine individual family members and the family group preferences; 2) to examine the ability of family members to predict other family members' preferences and their influence on the family decision; and 3) to examine family members actual influence of family members on the family decision. The findings revealed considerable similarities in the importance of attributes, with price and destination being more important, as well as the levels, with the majority preferring a lower rather than higher price and a beach rather than mountain destination. Further, there was reasonable accuracy in the prediction of each others' preferences, although parents were more accurate than children. However, there was a considerable amount of inaccuracy in the prediction of each others' influence. Family members systematically overestimated their own influence, and underestimated the influence of other family members.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family vacations -- Thailand</field><field name="subject">Families -- Thailand -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Families -- Thailand -- Decision making</field><field name="subject">Thailand -- Family relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superalgebras and brane actions</field><field name="creator">Reimers, D. T.</field><field name="description">The Noether charge algebra of brane actions is typically modified by a topological anomalous term. The underlying cohomology of this anomalous term is investigated, and it is shown that the anomalous term possesses a gauge freedom. The result is that the anomalous term generates a parameterized family of topological charge algebras. When fermionic charges are taken to be nonvanishing, the known algebras underlying extended superspace formulations of the action appear in these families. This phenomena is investigated for minimal p-branes, Dp-branes and (p, q)-strings. The algebras resulting from the D-brane actions are shown to allow the construction of extended superspace actions without worldvolume gauge fields. It is shown that the actions are !-symmetric, and that the symmetry is generated by a right action. The global and local symmetry transformations of the Born-Infeld gauge field are thus shown to be described geometrically by left/right actions of the underlying extended supertranslation group. An equivalence class construction is proposed for the description of compact fermionic dimensions. In this construction, open strings in extended superspace translate to closed strings in compact superspace, and fermionic topological charges may be realized by closed strings. The differential underlying the descent construction for Noether charge algebras is shown to be naturally described as a dual of the de Rham differential. The ghost fields used in the construction are shown to be described geometrically as a vielbein with respect to this differential.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Superalgebras</field><field name="subject">Branes</field><field name="subject">String Theory</field><field name="subject">Branes</field><field name="subject">Superalgebras</field><field name="subject">Supersymmetry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses of Posidonia australis Hook.f. and Posidonia sinuosa Cambridge et Kuo transplants to nitrogen, phosphorus and iron additions in Oyster Harbour, Western Australia, with focus on root development</field><field name="creator">Hovey, Renae Kathleen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] There is a well-documented global decline of seagrass meadows in response to anthropogenic pressures. Transplantation of rhizome fragments into denuded areas has been used to enhance natural recovery but nutrient limitation and poor root growth may contribute to low success rates. Addition of nutrients to sediments has been proposed as a means of enhancing growth and survival of seagrass transplants by alleviating nutrient limitation but there is limited information of the effects of nutrient additions to seagrass transplants, particularly root development and morphology. In addition to nutrient limitation, sulphide accumulation in sediments with high organic matter has been shown to reduce seagrass growth and experimental iron additions have been shown to enhance seagrass growth by buffering the development of reduced conditions in organic rich sediments. This thesis examines responses (growth, morphology and nutrient status) of Posidonia australis and Posidonia sinuosa transplants to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and chelated iron (Fe EDTA) additions, and includes a detailed investigation of root growth and morphology in response to these additions. Experiments were carried out in underwater plots in Oyster Harbour, a sheltered estuarine inlet with seasonal river flow, located on the southern coast of Western Australia. In the first experiment, nutrients (N, P and N+P) and Fe EDTA were added to sediment underlying transplants at the end of summer (March 2005).  ... Nitrogen (both N and N+P) addition also reduced overall biomass allocation to roots. Nitrogen concentrations increased with N addition in P. sinuosa only but both species had more negative d15N values with N and N+P addition indicating that added N had been taken up. In contrast, P addition had little effect on root growth, and P concentrations only increased in P. australis. However, tissue concentrations of Zn, Co, and Mo in both species increased with P addition. Roots showed limited morphological variation (total root length, mean root diameter, root fineness, specific root length, surface area) in response to nutrient addition. Combined N and P addition increased lateral root density (branches m-1) but had no effect on other morphological parameters of the root compartment. Iron addition had no effect on P. sinuosa but P. australis transplants significantly reduced root growth and productivity, particularly in spring/summer growth period, due to lower primary and lateral growth rates. Overall, N or P additions did not enhance growth although these nutrients were taken up. Iron additions also had little effect on transplant growth. Seagrass transplants had significant root growth although they appeared not to respond to nutrient or iron addition. Both species produced extensive root systems capable of taking up sediment nutrients, which suggests that root development was not a limiting factor in establishment and growth of transplants in the temperate estuary, Oyster Harbour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Posidonia australis -- Western Australia -- Oyster Harbour -- Roots -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Posidonia australis -- Effect of minerals on -- Western Australia -- Oyster Harbour</field><field name="subject">Posidoniaceae -- Western Australia -- Oyster Harbour -- Roots -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Posidoniaceae -- Effect of minerals on -- Western Australia -- Oyster Harbour</field><field name="subject">Seagrass transplants</field><field name="subject">Root growth</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen, phosphorus, iron additions</field><field name="subject">Growth and morphology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analysis of the promoter regions of alternative oxidase genes from Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="creator">Ho, Lois H. M.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles found in almost all eukaryotic cells to contain more than 1000 different proteins. The majority of these proteins are encoded in the nucleus, translated in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. The overall aim of this study was to characterise the regulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (NEMP). This was carried out in the plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, using the alternative oxidase (AOX) as a model. Specifically, the aims were to i) determine how regulation of NEMP interact with known regulatory pathways/mechanisms; ii) determine if the pattern of coexpression observed for NEMP are due to co-regulation, and iii) to determine whether mitochondrial retrograde regulatory pathways interact with known chloroplast regulatory pathways. AOX1c is one of five genes encoding AOX in Arabidopsis. It is expressed in a variety of organs and is not induced by stress. Thus, its regulation was characterised in order to gain insight into the regulation of NEMP under normal growth conditions. Analysis of the promoter of AOX1c revealed cis-acting regulatory elements (CAREs) common to both AOX1c from Arabidopsis and AOX2b from soybean. Additionally, Site II elements, previously shown to be involved in the regulation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, are present in the upstream promoter region of AtAOX1c and were shown to be strong negative regulators of AtAOX1c expression. AOX1a is a gene encoding AOX that is induced at a transcript level, by many stress treatments.  BA signalling and provide evidence of at least one common factor between chloroplastic and mitochondrial retrograde regulatory pathways, i.e. ABI4. ... The above results reveal that the regulation of NEMP are integrated with the mainstream regulatory pathways that control gene expression for a variety of proteins in various locations. Although this is not unexpected, it does raise the question of how mitochondrial function impacts, or feeds back, to alter these pathways, i.e. how mitochondrial retrograde signals affects the regulation of genes encoding proteins in a variety of locations. The observed interaction of mitochondrial and plastid retrograde regulatory pathways at the level of ABI4, suggests that mitochondrial signals have the potential to act as a powerful regulators of many cellular functions. Although interaction between mitochondrial and other organelles at a cellular level has been known for some time, there is still much work left to be done to define the network of molecular interactions that exists to regulate and integrate the expression of NEMP with all other proteins in the cell. This study reveals that interactions also occur at regulatory steps that have to potential to regulate many function in organelles, even if no direct metabolic link exists. However, this study has only begun to uncover these interactions at a molecular level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana -- Cytogenetics</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana -- Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Mitochondrial pathology</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Respiratory chain</field><field name="subject">Oxidative stress</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetries in unimanual and bimanual coordination : evidence from behavioural and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies</field><field name="creator">Faulkner, Deborah</field><field name="description">The issue of the laterality of control during unimanual and bimanual coordination was addressed in this thesis. Two tasks were used throughout: a repetitive discrete response task (finger tapping) and a continuous task (circle-drawing). Different mechanisms have been implicated in the temporal control of repetitive discrete movements and continuous movements. The tasks also differ in the degree of spatiotemporal coordination required which might have important implications in the question of laterality of control. The first section of the thesis examined between-hand differences in the dynamics of performance during unimanual and bimanual coordination. During tapping, the dominant hand was faster and less temporally variable than the nondominant hand. During circle drawing the dominant hand was faster, more accurate, less temporally and spatially variable, and produced smoother trajectories than the nondominant hand. During bimanual coordination, several of these asymmetries were attenuated: the rate of movement of the two hands became equivalent (the hands became temporally coupled), the asymmetry in temporal variability during tapping was reduced, and the asymmetry in trajectory smoothness during circle drawing was reduced. The second section of the thesis examined the effects of disrupting motor processes with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left or right primary motor cortex (M1) on the ongoing performance of the hands. In the first study, TMS over left or right M1 during unimanual tapping caused large disruptions to tapping with the contralateral hand but had little effect on the ipsilateral hand. In contrast, for a subset of trials during bimanual tapping, two lateralized effects of stimulation were seen: the effect of TMS on the contralateral hand was greater after stimulation over left M1 than after stimulation over right M1, and prolonged changes in inter-tap interval were observed in the left hand regardless of the side of stimulation. In the second study, TMS over left M1 during circle drawing decreased the accuracy of drawing with both the contralateral and ipsilateral hand, whereas TMS over right M1 decreased accuracy of drawing only with the contralateral hand. This lateralized effect was not limited to the bimanual case, but was also apparent during unimanual drawing. The final chapter addressed issues in bimanual motor control after unilateral stroke. Performance of the affected limb was examined during unimanual and bimanual coordination in a group of stroke patients with varying levels of impairment. The results indicated an improvement in the performance of the affected limb for some patients with mild to moderate, but not severe upper limb motor deficits during bimanual movement. The improvements were limited to the patients who showed evidence of temporal coupling between the hands. These findings support the hypothesis that the dominant motor cortex has a role in the control of both hands during bimanual coordination. In addition, the dominant hemisphere appears to play a role in controlling both hands during unimanual movements which require a greater degree of spatiotemporal coordination. The final study suggests that temporal coupling between the limbs is crucial for the facilitation of performance of the affected limb during bimanual coordination, which has both theoretical and practical implications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laterality</field><field name="subject">Motor ability -- Psychophysiology</field><field name="subject">Motor cortex -- Effect of magnetism on</field><field name="subject">Bimanual</field><field name="subject">Motor control</field><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Laterality</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A therapeutic approach for the skeletal muscle a-actin based congenital myopathies</field><field name="creator">Ravenscroft, Gianina</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Mutations in the skeletal muscle -actin gene (ACTA1) have been shown to be one cause of a broad group of muscle disorders all termed the congenital myopathies. Over 170 different mutations have now been identified across all 6 coding exons of ACTA1 in patients presenting with muscle weakness and any one or more of the following histopathological features: nemaline rods, intranuclear rods, fibre-type disproportion, excess of thin filaments and central cores. While the identification of the causative gene has been of great comfort for affected patients and their families, with pre-natal genetic testing becoming available, the ultimate aim is to develop a therapy for these disorders. Of the therapies currently being explored for the muscular dystrophies, up-regulation of an alternative gene seemed to be one of the most promising avenues for treatment of the ACTA1 diseases. Up-regulation of utrophin, the foetal homologue of dystrophin, has been shown to be a promising therapy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The main aim of my research was to determine whether up-regulation of cardiac -actin, the predominant -actin expressed in foetal skeletal muscle and in the adult heart, could be used as a therapy for the ACTA1 diseases. A proof-of-concept experiment was performed whereby skeletal muscle -actin knock-out (KO) mice (all of which die by postnatal day 9) were crossed with transgenic mice over-expressing cardiac -actin (known as Coco mice) in postnatal skeletal muscle. ... While patients that are ACTA1 nulls have been identified in a number of mainly consanguineous populations, the majority of ACTA1 mutations result in dominant disease in which the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type skeletal muscle -actin. Research described in this thesis also focuses on characterizing two transgenic mouse models of dominant ACTA1 disease at the ultra-structural, cellular and functional level; this is the first step towards a proof-of-concept experiment to determine whether cardiac -actin up-regulation can dilute out the pathogenesis of dominant ACTA1 disease. It has long been noted that patients with ACTA1 disease do not have ophthalmoplegia, even in the most-severely affected individuals. Protein analysis performed on extraocular muscle (EOM) biopsies obtained from humans, sheep and pigs showed that the EOMs co-express cardiac and skeletal muscle -actin, with cardiac -actin comprising  70 % of the striated -actin pool. Thus we propose that sparing of the EOMs in ACTA1 disease is at least in part due to cardiac -actin diluting out the pathogenesis associated with expression of the mutant skeletal muscle -actin. This finding provides further support for the hypothesis that dilution of mutant skeletal muscle -actin in dominant ACTA1 disease by up-regulation of cardiac -actin may be a viable therapy for this group of devastating muscle diseases. The research contained herein has advanced the understanding of the pathobiology of skeletal muscle -actin diseases and provides strong evidence in support of cardiac -actin up-regulation as a promising therapy for these diseases.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Muscles -- Abnormalities</field><field name="subject">Muscles -- Diseases -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Congenital myopathies</field><field name="subject">Skeletal muscle alpha-actin</field><field name="subject">Up-regulation therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patient compliance and spontaneous movements while following an early active motion protocol after a flexor tendon repair</field><field name="creator">Saleeba, Elizabeth Constance</field><field name="description">Compliance to strict home exercise programs is understood to be a mainstay of post-surgical flexor tendon rehabilitation. Therapists recognise the potential of poor compliance (overuse or under-use of prescribed exercise) and spontaneous movements during rehabilitation. Some therapists may suggest that compliance to specific exercise regimens and control of spontaneous or general movements are fundamentally important in optimising the rehabilitation outcomes and minimising the potential of adverse events. Yet there is little objective data to document the actual levels of exercise or spontaneous finger movement performed outside the clinical setting. The purpose of this study was to document both diary and instrumented methods of reporting finger movement during a 48hr period. Following surgical repair of the flexor tendon, subjects attending a private hand therapy clinic provided consent and reported subjective diary (n=16) data of sets and repetitions of exercise for up to 6 weeks post-operatively. Nine subjects also had instrumented data logged on 3 occasions during the first 6 weeks of rehabilitation and were not fully aware of the purpose of the instrumentation. All subjects were instructed to perform 10 passive followed by 10 active exercises every waking hour, for the first 6 weeks and were assessed on range of motion, DASH, pain and strength. Results demonstrated that patients reported, via their diaries, that they are on average 80% compliant. Parallel data logger information suggests that this figure is more likely to reflect 50% compliance. A significant (p&lt; .05) increase in spontaneous movements in the last 2 weeks of the 6 week assessment period was detected.

This thesis examines the use of innovative health services management coupled with information and communication technology (ICT) to more efficiently deliver services to disabled older people in the hospital, community and residential care. The hypothesis explored is that ICT can provide clinical services to older people in poorly serviced communities and groups, thus extending the influence and capabilities of specialist health care professionals. The relevance of these studies is predominantly for those people who live outside the metropolitan regions, particularly in remote and rural communities, and also for those frail older people, who because of disability, are unable to travel to specialist health services. There are a series of studies presented in this thesis which have all been published. They have demonstrated that in a community and rural setting, ICT use in the assessment and management of geriatric syndromes such as dementia is valid and practical. This included the validation of commonly used assessment tools via Telehealth. A Telehealth protocol for assessment of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) was developed and published. The use of ICT to link health services clinical and administrative data for determining stroke outcomes and disability has been evaluated and a resource utilization prediction model developed. Finally, in residential care a survey and a qualitative study of poor uptake of ICT services in hostels and nursing homes revealed insights into ICT perception by the older people in care facilities and their professional staff. The implications and future development of these studies have been discussed, especially barriers to increased uptake of ICT, cost comparisons and the potential of future technologies such as video conferencing mobile phones.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">Older people -- Care -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Older people -- Health and hygiene -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Older people -- Services for -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Rural health services -- Western Australia -- Communication systems</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication in medicine -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Telehealth</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">Demnetia</field><field name="subject">Aged care</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novel parametrized controller reduction technique based on different closed-loop configurations</field><field name="creator">Houlis, Pantazis Constantine</field><field name="description">This Thesis is concerned with the approximation of high order controllers or the controller reduction problem. We firstly consider approximating high-order controllers by low order controllers based on the closed-loop system approximation. By approximating the closed-loop system transfer function, we derive a new parametrized double-sided frequency weighted model reduction problem. The formulas for the input and output weights are derived using three closed-loop system configurations: (i) by placing a controller in cascade with the plant, (ii) by placing a controller in the feedback path, and (iii) by using the linear fractional transformation (LFT) representation. One of the weights will be a function of a free parameter which can be varied in the resultant frequency weighted model reduction problem. We show that by using standard frequency weighted model reduction techniques, the approximation error can be easily reduced by varying the free parameter to give more accurate low order controllers. A method for choosing the free parameter to get optimal results is being suggested. A number of practical examples are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller reduction method. We have then considered the relationships between the closed-loop system con gurations which can be expressed using a classical control block diagram or a modern control block diagram (LFT). Formulas are derived to convert a closed-loop system represented by a classical control block diagram to a closed-loop system represented by a modern control block diagram and vice versa.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Control theory</field><field name="subject">Digital control systems</field><field name="subject">Discrete-time systems</field><field name="subject">Feedback control systems</field><field name="subject">Linear systems</field><field name="subject">Linear time invariant systems</field><field name="subject">Model reduction</field><field name="subject">Closed loop systems</field><field name="subject">Controller reduction</field><field name="subject">Double controller</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of genetic diversity in human sexual selection : is the MHC special?</field><field name="creator">Lie, Hanne Cathrine</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The assumption that facial attractiveness signals mate quality is central to current evolutionary theories of human sexual selection. Evidence for direct links between attractiveness and mate quality is, however, scarce, and the exact nature of mate quality remains the subject of debate.

This thesis investigates whether individual genetic diversity plays a role in human sexual selection. The main aim is to examine whether MHC diversity, compared to genetic diversity in general, is especially important for mate preferences, health and mating success. The four studies herein are based on data collected from a large sample of heterosexual, Caucasian males and females. Participants were photographed, provided a DNA sample, and completed questionnaires regarding sexual history and health. Genetic diversity was calculated as both mean heterozygosity (H) and standardised mean-d2 (d2), separately for 12 MHC microsatellite loci and 11 nonMHC loci. The photographs were rated for various attractive features by opposite-sex raters. The first study investigated whether MHC diversity influences preferences for facial appearance in a potential mate, and if so, are they specific to the MHC and are they mediated by specific facial characteristics? I found that MHC-H, but not nonMHCH, positively predicted male facial attractiveness, and that this relationship was mediated by facial averageness. For females, nonMHC-d2 predicted facial symmetry, and potentially attractiveness. These findings indicate that faces contain visual cues to mate quality in both males and females, providing support for evolutionary theories that our preferences are adaptations for identifying mates of high quality.  ... Measuring them both allowed me to tease apart their effects on mate preferences, and on health and mating success. Indeed, the MHC appears to be especially important in sexual selection as MHC diversity predicted female mate preferences after controlling for nonMHC diversity, and MHC dissimilarity predicted male mate preferences after controlling for nonMHC dissimilarity. Moreover, although MHC diversity did not appear to influence males&#146; preference for females, it did predict female mating success, suggesting that males also attend to MHC-related cues, although perhaps non-facial cues, when seeking mates. Additionally, nonMHC diversity predicted both male preferences for female faces and health, suggesting that such preferences are adaptive. Importantly, by providing direct links between facial attractiveness and biological markers of individual quality, genetic diversity, these results support the commonly held assumption that facial attractiveness signals mate quality.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mate selection</field><field name="subject">Sexual attraction -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">HLA histocompatibility antigens</field><field name="subject">Human genetics</field><field name="subject">Sexual selection</field><field name="subject">Humans</field><field name="subject">Facial attractiveness</field><field name="subject">MHC</field><field name="subject">HLA</field><field name="subject">Major histocompatibility complex</field><field name="subject">Mate choice</field><field name="subject">Mate preferences</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Beauty</field><field name="subject">Genetic quality</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and interpretation of clusters of seismic events in mines</field><field name="creator">Hudyma, Martin Raymond</field><field name="description">Spatial clustering of seismic events in mines has been widely reported in literature. Despite obvious visual correlations between spatial clusters of seismic events and geomechanical structures in mines (such as pillars, dykes and faults), very limited research has been undertaken to utilise this information to filter seismic data. A linkage between spatial seismic event clusters and discrete rockmass failure mechanisms is tenuous and not well established using current seismic analysis techniques. A seismic event clustering methodology is proposed. The first component of the methodology uses a complete-linkage (CLINK) clustering routine to identify relatively compact clusters of seismic events.

LPCs can differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes and thus are capable of replenishing the damaged liver. Due to their plasticity and robust nature in culture systems, they are promising candidates for use in cell therapy. However, to be able to use LPCs as tissue regenerating stem cell-like cells in the clinic, we need to fully understand how they are controlled. Although a strong association between LPCs and inflammation has been shown in many chronic liver diseases, the role of the immune system in LPC-mediated hepatic regeneration is poorly understood. We hypothesise that specific immune cells and mediators are needed to induce the LPC compartment, and that these are common to the LPC response in different injury settings. Therefore, the present study focused on the characterisation of the inflammatory environment in the LPC response, which generates this niche. The aims of this study were (i) to identify the immune cells that are important for the LPC response, (ii) to define the cytokine profile and (iii) to determine the role of the cytokine producing cells during liver regeneration. To study hepatic inflammation following liver injury, a diet-induced model of liver injury (choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet, CDE diet) was compared to two transgenic mouse models of immune-mediated hepatitis (Met-Kb, 178.3). Although all three models are characterised by hepatitis, histological analysis revealed that LPCs were only detectable in the CDE and Met-Kb livers. In the 178.3 model, livers regenerated from proliferating hepatocytes. An LPC response could not be induced in these mice even when liver damage was made more severe. In the other two models, LPC numbers increased over time showing the highest numbers one week after the peak of liver injury. LPCs were often found in close proximity to inflammatory cells, in particular macrophages.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemokines</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Liver cells -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Stem cells</field><field name="subject">Liver progenitor cells/liver stem cells</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Liver regeneration</field><field name="subject">Cytokines and chemokines</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hematocrit, implications for bloodstain pattern analysis</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Natasha</field><field name="description">Blood is one of the most common and important types of physical evidence present at a crime scene.  When liquid blood is acted upon by external physical forces, that blood is often distributed through the air in the form of droplets, with bloodstains and bloodstain patterns deposited on adjacent surfaces.  Using the mathematical relationship that exists between the blood droplet and resultant bloodstain&#146;s length and width ratio, the angle at which the blood droplet impacted the receiving surface can be determined.  Using this relationship, it becomes possible for Bloodstain Pattern Analysts to determine the three dimensional Region of Origin for the blood source from which the bloodstains under examination have originated.  A Bloodstain Pattern Analyst performs angle of impact calculations from bloodstains for the purpose of making a three dimensional determination of blood source Region of Origin. The reliability of that determination is based on an assumption that one of the most important biological properties of blood; the amount of red blood cells or hematocrit value, has no influence over the length to width ratio of a bloodstain.  As a consequence the Impact angle = arcsine [width/length] calculation has been assumed accurate regardless of the 'unknown' hematrocrit value.  This thesis investigated the effect of the hematocrit value on the angle of impact calculation and thus the ability to determine the three dimensional blood source Region of Origin.     Bloodstains were created by releasing a series of 18&#181;L droplets, with ten different hematocrit values, onto a ceramic tile at four different angles.  The resultant bloodstain length and width was measured and impact angle calculated.  Evaluation of the research data shows that the hematocrit value significantly affects the bloodstains length and width.  However, it is apparent that there is close agreement between the known and calculated impact angles irrespective of the hematocrit value.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hematocrit -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Forensic hematology</field><field name="subject">Bloodstain pattern analysis</field><field name="subject">Bloodstain pattern analysis</field><field name="subject">Hematocrit</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sulphur transformation during pyrolysis of an Australian lignite</field><field name="creator">Yani, Setyawati</field><field name="description">Australia has the largest economical lignite resources in the world. However, the utilisation of lignite is faced with a number of technical, economical and environmental problems due to its high moisture content and some of the deposits containing high sulphur and high inorganic matter. During pyrolysis, the first step of any thermochemical conversion processes of coal, some of the sulphur in lignite evolves as sulphur-bearing volatiles while others are retained in the solid phase of the lignite char. The present research aims to study the sulphur transformation during pyrolysis of Australian lignite. The specific objectives of this research include a study on the transformation of pyrite, sulphate and organic sulphur during lignite pyrolysis as well as an investigation of the effect of inorganic matter on the sulphur transformation during lignite pyrolysis. To help the interpretation of sulphur transformation, the lignite samples were characterised using a combination of analytical techniques, i.e. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescent (XRF), ion chromatography (IC), Scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Fourier transform infra red (FTIR), solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and petrographic analysis. Pyrolysis was carried out in a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) and fixed bed reactor. The lignites and their chars were analysed for sulphur forms using a carbon sulphur (CS) analyser. To study the volatiles released during pyrolysis, experiments were also performed using a TGA coupled to a mass spectrometer (TGA-MS). Eleven (11) Australian lignite samples, denoted as L1 to L11, respectively, from the same lignite deposit but with different sulphur and inorganic matter concentrations were employed in this study. They are categorised as of low quality since they contain high Executive Summary Sulphur Transformation during Pyrolysis of an Australian Lignite v moisture, very high ash, low fixed carbon and thus they have low calorific value, except for L1. The lignites contain considerable amount of total sulphur, except for L1. Mineralogy of the lignites showed that the lignites contain extremely high sodium and chlorine. FTIR and solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy confirmed that oxygenated functional structures are significantly present in the lignites.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sulphur</field><field name="subject">Lignite -- Desulphurization -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Lignite -- Sulphur content -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Pyrolysis</field><field name="subject">Sulphur transformation</field><field name="subject">Pyrolysis</field><field name="subject">Sulphate</field><field name="subject">Australian lignite</field><field name="subject">Pyrite</field><field name="subject">Organic sulphur</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Root morphology, photosynthesis, water relations and development of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) in response to soil constraints at restores bauxite mines in south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Szota, Christopher</field><field name="description">Bauxite mining is a major activity in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) forest of south-western Australia.

The observation of geographical variation in CRC incidence and increased CRC risks in populations consuming high levels of meat prompted researchers to hypothesise a link between meat and CRC. An area of particular interest in CRC pathogenesis is the meat-derived compounds such are heterocyclic amines (HCAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and meatderived mutagenic activity. Australia is among the countries with high incidence of CRC and also high levels of per capita meat consumption. Hence, clarifying the possible link between meat consumption and the risk of CRC in order that this can be translated into preventive dietary recommendations for the public is important. The objective of this thesis was to examine whether meat consumption is related to risk of CRC in an Australian population. The term meat consumption in this thesis means meaures of consumption of red and white meat that incorporate frequency and cooking method. The following hypotheses were investigated: 1. Increasing intake of meat prepared by methods that involve higher cooking temperature and time is positively associated with the risk of CRC; 2. Increasing exposure to meat-derived heterocyclic amines (HCAs) is positively associated with the risk of CRC; 3. Higher levels of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from meat consumption is a risk factor for CRC; 4. Exposure to meat-derived mutagens increases the risk of CRC.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Benzopyrene</field><field name="subject">Chemical mutagenesis</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) -- Cancer -- Nutritional aspects</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) -- Cancer -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Heterocyclic compounds -- Carcinogenicity</field><field name="subject">Mutagenicity testing</field><field name="subject">Rectum -- Cancer -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Meat consumption</field><field name="subject">Colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Heterocyclic amines</field><field name="subject">Benzo[a]pyrene</field><field name="subject">Meat mutageniaity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative audiology and the development of a seeding model for affordable and sustainable audiology education</field><field name="creator">Goulios, Helen</field><field name="description">The recognition by societies of the problems caused by deafness and hearing impairment has led to a significant increase in the need for audiologists. Additionally, the rapid development of audiology in the last few decades, a wide diversity of audiology education programs, and increased globalisation highlighted the need to evaluate current audiology education and practice from an international perspective. A major aim of this thesis was therefore to study comparative audiology, to allow systematic analysis of what hearing health care is needed worldwide, and the strategies required to achieve future improvements. Rather than remaining theoretical, this thesis also aimed to develop an affordable and sustainable seeding model for audiology education, which would build capacity in countries with inadequate audiology education. An international study surveyed major audiology organisations, and completed surveys were received from 62 countries (representing 78% of the world population). Eighty-six percent of countries needed more audiologists, and cited a lack of government funding, low public awareness of deafness and inadequate audiology education as major reasons for the shortages. There was a wide range of professionals providing hearing health care and a large overlap in their scope of practices. To discuss these complex issues, a conceptual model for hearing health care was developed which formalised the interacting issues, and highlighted the feedback loops between them. The conceptual model presented a framework that was used to discuss individual countries in more detail, and provided a basis for the design of strategies aimed at improving hearing health care and education for groups of countries. Although five distinct groups were described, in practice, most countries may benefit to some extent from hearing health care systems that range from decentralised community-based models (providing basic care), to more institutionally-based models (offering advanced services and technologies). Evolution of hearing health care systems from basic community-based, to more advanced institutionally-based services, would presumably come with strengthening economies and health and education infrastructures, and concurrent growth in audiology education and private and public hearing health care markets. The rate at which this occurs depends in part on the strength of a country&#146;s economy, but also on its other health priorities, the equality of its wealth distribution, the diversity and geographic spread of its population, and the adequacy and efficiency of its hearing health care education programs.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative audiology</field><field name="subject">International audiology</field><field name="subject">Audiology education models</field><field name="subject">Hearing health care services</field><field name="subject">Hearing health care indices</field><field name="subject">Audiology workforce planning</field><field name="subject">Audiology</field><field name="subject">Audiology -- Study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rehabilitation of unilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss with a bone anchored hearing aid</field><field name="creator">Eager, Katrise Mary</field><field name="description">The long-term outcomes of subjects fitted with a bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) for a unilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss (UPSHL) are still evolving. Previous studies have focused on the comparison between shortterm outcomes obtained with hard-wired contralateral routing of signal (CROS) hearing aids and those obtained with BAHA devices. Published results on subjects who have worn their BAHA devices for UPSHL for more than twelve months are limited. This study explored the long-term outcomes of adults fitted with a BAHA for UPSHL. The aims were firstly to examine subjects' pre-operative and postoperative speech perception in quiet and noise, as well as administer two standardised questionnaires, the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Benefit (APHAB) and the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP). The second aim was to evaluate the responses of implanted subjects following the preoperative test protocols using a supplementary questionnaire, the Single Sided Deafness Questionnaire (SSDQ). The third aim was to monitor the subjects' implant or repair issues. In addition, questionnaire results were compared to subjects who underwent pre-operative assessment but were not implanted. All subjects had a UPSHL resulting from various aetiologies including vestibular schwannoma or other skull base tumour removal, viral infections, cochlear trauma, idiopathic sudden hearing loss, and Meniere's disease. There was a significant difference between the implanted groups' pre- and post-operative outcomes measures, indicating a treatment effect from the fitting of the BAHA device. No significant changes were found with the non-implanted groups' longterm outcome measures in regards to their perceived hearing difficulties. No significant correlations were found between outcome measures and gender, age of fitting, length of deafness, or ear affected for either group.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audiology</field><field name="subject">Bone-anchored hearing aids</field><field name="subject">Deafness</field><field name="subject">Hearing aids</field><field name="subject">Hearing disorders</field><field name="subject">&lt;bone anchored hearing aid&gt;</field><field name="subject">&lt;audiology&gt;</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The condition at settlement of the western rock lobster, Panulirus cygnus George : spatial and temporal fluctuations</field><field name="creator">Limbourn, Andrew John</field><field name="description">The condition at settlement of the western rock lobster pueruli presumably reflects both their energetic condition in reaching the near shore and subsequent recruitment into adult populations. In recruiting to the near shore the pueruli swim across the continental shelf where oceanographic conditions are complex and likely influence the success of recruitment. The results from the biochemical studies are interpreted in light of the oceanography off the coast of Western Australia. I investigated the nutritional condition of larval phyllosomata, post-larval puerulus and first instar post-pueruli juveniles of the spiny lobster, Panulirus cygnus, to determine energy use during the non-feeding transitional puerulus stage. Biochemical analyses of lipid, fatty acid (FA) and protein revealed that lipid, in particular phospholipids, is primarily used for energy during the nonfeeding puerulus stage. Monounsaturated FA showed the greatest decline with development, whereas the polyunsaturated FA showed a high degree of sparing, suggesting these FA are not used as a substrate for energy production. The knowledge gained on the biochemistry of energy use in P. cygnus was then used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability in the nutritional condition, in particular lipid condition, of puerulus collected at three near shore locations (Alkimos, Jurien Bay and Dongara) along the Western Australia coast, and one offshore location (Houtman Abrolhos Islands). The one offshore location was chosen as I hypothesised that arriving pueruli are likely to be in a better state of nutrition than those arriving at more coastal locations where the potential journey from offshore larval feeding grounds to the near shore is considerably greater. This element of my research showed lipid levels to be inversely related, generally, to shelf width but were variable, suggesting pueruli may travel complex trajectories to reach nearshore settlement. The lipid and FA composition of pueruli was also consistent with spatial and seasonal variation in Leeuwin Current and coastal productivity regimes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decapoda (Crustacea) -- Larvae</field><field name="subject">Lipids</field><field name="subject">Lobsters -- Larvae</field><field name="subject">Western rock lobster -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">El Ni&#241;o Current</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin Current</field><field name="subject">Puerulus</field><field name="subject">Decapod larvae</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin Current</field><field name="subject">ENSO</field><field name="subject">Lipid biochemistry</field><field name="subject">Western rock lobster</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ownership structure, corporate goverance and financial performance of public listed companies in Singapore</field><field name="creator">Koh, Charlie Tai-Joo</field><field name="description">The object of this empirical study is to clarify, consolidate and build on various conflicting research findings on the relationships among ownership structure, corporate governance, and corporate performance using data from 149 Singapore public listed companies.

Specifically, arachidonic acid is metabolised by cytochrome P450 -hydroxylase to produce vasoactive 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), and by 5-lipoxygenase to produce proinflammatory leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which can further be metabolised by -hydroxylase to from 20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4. F2-Isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) are produced through free radical attack on arachidonic acid and have been recognised as the most reliable markers of lipid peroxidation in vivo. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterised by abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia. It is associated with low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress and an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Dietary weight loss is strongly recommended for the management of the MetS and can potentially minimise the risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in individuals with the MetS. Little is known regarding the role of these arachidonic acid metabolites in the MetS and the effect of weight loss on their metabolism. Chapter three comprised of three in vitro studies aimed to examine 20-HETE synthesis in human blood cells. 20-HETE acts as a second messenger for vasoconstrictor actions of angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in renal and mesenteric beds. Human neutrophils and platelets are integral to the inflammatory process.  ... Production of LTB4 and 20-OH-LTB4 was significantly lower compared with controls (P&lt;0.005) and remained so after adjustment for neutrophil count (P&lt;0.05).The weight loss intervention resulted in a 4.6kg reduction in body weight and a 6.6cm decrease in waist circumference and a significant increase in LTB4 and 20-OH- LTB4 in the weight loss group. Chapter Five continued to investigate the role of other arachidonic acid metabolites, 20-HETE and F2-IsoPs in the MetS and the effect of weight loss. In the case-control study (Human study 1), plasma and urinary 20-HETE and F2-IsoPs were significantly elevated in the MetS group, but no significant difference was found in stimulated-neutrophil 20-HETE. A significant gender x group interaction was observed in that women with the MetS had higher urinary 20-HETE and F2-IsoPs compared to controls (P&lt;0.0001). In a randomised controlled trial (Human study 2), relative to the weight-    maintenance group, a 4.6 kg loss in weight resulted in a 2 mmHg fall in blood pressure but did not alter the production of 20-HETE or F2-IsoPs. No significant differences were shown in 20-HETE released from stimulated-neutrophils before and after weight loss. 20-HETE and oxidative stress may be important mediators of cardiovascular disease risk in the MetS. Although a 4% reduction in body weight reduced BP, there were no changes in plasma or urinary 20-HETE or F2-IsoPs. In summary, in vitro studies show that human neutrophils and platelets can produce 20-HETE in response to Ang II and ET-1, and human studies demonstrate that the presence of MetS has a significant impact on arachidonic acid metabolism and effective weight loss can restore leukocyte synthesis of LTB4.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arachidonic acid -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome</field><field name="subject">Metabolism -- Regulation</field><field name="subject">Weight loss</field><field name="subject">Arachidonic acid metabolism</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome</field><field name="subject">20-HETE</field><field name="subject">Weight loss</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuromuscular-biomechanical outcomes of different types of resistance training on people with knee osteoarthritis</field><field name="creator">Heiden, Tamika Louise</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients have high levels of pain, functional and strength deficits of the quadriceps, decreased proprioceptive acuity, and increased co-contraction and knee joint loading in gait, compared to age matched controls. The increased knee joint loading in this population occurs most commonly in the medial tibio-femoral compartment, due to increased external adduction moments, and with increasing disease severity there is a concomitant increase in the knee adduction moments. A key finding within the knee OA literature is that dynamic loading in gait, due to increased external adduction moments, strongly predicts pain and radiographic disease progression. Current research has shown that exercise interventions reduce pain and time to complete functional activities; however, the effect of these interventions on knee joint loading and muscular activation in gait is still unclear. In addition, the need for specific knee joint strengthening to cause these alterations has not been investigated and it remains unknown if improvements occur due to specific muscle strengthening or due to some general effect of exercise. Therefore, the primary aim of this research study was to examine the effects of general (upper body) and specific (lower body) resistance training interventions on self-perceived outcomes, neuromuscular function and kinematic, kinetic and muscle activation during gait of OA patients compared with asymptomatic controls. ... The examination of gait data following exercise (Study 4) showed trends for changes in the muscle co-contraction ratios. Specifically, the medial/lateral co-contraction ratio (MLCCR) displayed a trend in early stance where the upper body exercise group increased their lateral muscle activity and the lower body group reduced their lateral muscle activity, and the medial/lateral hamstring co-contraction ratio (HAMCCR) displayed this same trend during loading. The trend toward reduced lateral muscle activation, following lower body resistance training, suggests that specific muscle strengthening may have the ability to alter the load distribution. The kinematic and kinetic variables of gait were unchanged by the exercise interventions, highlighting the sensitivity of muscle activation pattern changes due to muscle strengthening. This thesis provides new insights into the co-contraction strategies utilised by knee OA patients. The directed co-contraction strategy employed by knee OA patients and its relationship to the external adduction moment in gait suggest an attempt to redistribute the loading within the knee joint, most likely in response to pain. Further, we have separated the effects of exercise and found differences in self-perceived outcomes based on exercise specificity. This first examination into muscle co-contraction following resistance training of knee OA patients has highlighted the possibility of alterations to the co-contraction patterns following lower body exercise. However, the implications of altering this muscle activation strategy and the consequent effect on distribution of load within the knee joint requires further consideration.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Gait in humans</field><field name="subject">Human mechanics</field><field name="subject">Knee -- Diseases -- Exercise therapy</field><field name="subject">Knee -- Diseases -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis -- Exercise therapy</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Knee osteoarthritis</field><field name="subject">Gait</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeing and measuring the 2D face</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Susan</field><field name="description">This is a study of the factors that affect face shapes, and the techniques that can be used to measure variations in two dimensional representations of faces. The materials included thirty photographs of people in natural poses and thirty portraits that were based on the pose photographs. Visual assessors were asked to score the photographs and portraits in terms of pose (cant, turn and pitch) and also to compare the portraits to the photographs and score them in terms of likeness in the depiction of the face and its component features. Anthropometric indices were derived and used to score the images for the pose variables as well as for aspects of individual variation in external face shape and the spatial arrangement of the features. Geometric morphometric analysis was also used to determine the shape variation occurring in the photographs, the variation within the portraits, and to specifically discern where the portraits differ from the photographs in the depiction of head pose and individual differences in facial morphology. For the analysis of pose it was found that visual assessors were best at discerning the extent of head turning and poorest at discerning head pitch. These tendencies occurred in the visual assessments of both the photographs and the portrait drawings. For the analysis of the individual variation in face shapes it was found that external face shape varies according to upper face dimensions and the shape of the chin, and that vertical featural configurations are strongly linked to external face shape. When the portrait and photograph data were placed in the same geometric morphometric analysis the inaccuracies in the portrait drawings became evident. When these findings were compared to the visual assessments it transpired that, on average, visual assessment was generally congruent with the geometric morphometric analysis, but were possibly confounded by patterns of dysmorphology in the portraits that were contrary to what this study suggests are normal patterns of face shape variation. Overall this study has demonstrated that while anthropometric and visual assessments of facial differences are quite good, both were comparatively poor at assessing head pitch and tended to be confounded by the dysmorphologies arising in the portrait drawings. Geometric morphometric analysis was found to be very powerful in discerning complex shape variations associated with head pose and individual differences in facial morphology, both within and between the photographs and portraits.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropometry</field><field name="subject">Face -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Face perception</field><field name="subject">Morphology -- Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">Visual assessment</field><field name="subject">Geometric morphometrics</field><field name="subject">Anthropometry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation on the risk of viral infection in musculoskeletal grafts</field><field name="creator">Yao, Felix Caspar</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Around 50,000 hip and knee replacements are performed every year in Australia and this number has been increasing by around 13% annually since 1998 (Transplantation Society 2006). The incidence and number of revision surgery has increased by a similar proportion. Autogenous bone or allograft is still the gold standard grafting material and is currently used in a variety of reconstructive surgical procedures. The use of any allograft material carries with it the risk of transfer of disease from donor to recipient. These tissues can transmit the same viral and bacterial infections as blood, and the products of a single donation may be transplanted to several recipients. In contrast to blood, musculoskeletal tissues may come from surgical and cadaveric donation. Overall, the prevention of infection relies on the maintenance of rigid protocols for procurement, donor and allograft testing, secondary sterilisation, and the adherence to internal safety standards within the tissue banks. This thesis aims to determine the risk of viral infection among musculoskeletal tissue donors in Australia. We retrieved and analysed data retrospectively from three large tissue banks in Australia (Perth, Queensland, Victoria). This includes 12,415 musculoskeletal tissue donors, 10,937 of which are surgical donors and 1,478 of which are deceased donors, for the period of 1993 -2004. This data was analysed to determine the prevalence and incidence of viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) in musculoskeletal allografts. The results indicate that the risk of viral infection from musculoskeletal tissue transplantation in Australia is low. ... The results indicate that the overall prevalence of screened transfusion-transmitted viral infections did not vary significantly for musculoskeletal donors over the study period, despite falling in the general population and first-time blood donors. In tissue donors, HIV incidence significantly decreased over time, and HBV decreased significantly during 1999-2001; however, there was an apparent increase in the estimated incidence of HCV in 2002-2004 compared with earlier years. Furthermore the residual risk estimate of HIV in the period 2002-2004 has declined 5-fold compared to estimates in the period 1993-1995. This is perhaps due to greater awareness of high risk behaviours among donors, improvement in donor recruitment and an overall decrease in infection levels in the general population. Musculoskeletal tissue is second only to blood as the most frequent transplanted human tissue. Viral infection is a potential complication of tissue transplantation. In this thesis the rates of HIV, HBV, HCV and HTV infection in musculoskeletal donors in Australia were identified and then compared with results in published data from Canada, Scotland and the United States. The study also compared that result with first-time blood donors because they have satisfied similar donor selection criteria (Galea et al. 2006). The results indicate that prevalence and incidence estimates for viral infection in Australian tissue donors are higher than those in blood donors. This was also reported in studies from other countries. Accordingly, it is crucial that viral prevalence and incidence be monitored to evaluate the safety of tissue supply and to improve donor selection processes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bone transplantation</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus</field><field name="subject">HIV (Viruses)</field><field name="subject">HIV infections</field><field name="subject">Homografts</field><field name="subject">HTLV (Viruses)</field><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal system -- Surgery</field><field name="subject">HIV - Human Immunodeficiency Virus</field><field name="subject">HBV - Hepatitis B Virus</field><field name="subject">HCV - Hepatitis C Virus</field><field name="subject">HTLV - Human T Lymphotrophic Virus</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic-based sedentary behaviour among children within the family home environment : a descriptive study</field><field name="creator">Granich, Joanna</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This descriptive study identified correlates of electronic media use among pre-adolescent children (10-12 year olds). It specifically focused on the potential influence of individual factors and the social and physical environment within the family home setting. The prevalence of overweight/obesity in children is escalating. Sedentary behaviour in the form of electronic media use (comprised of television (TV) and video/DVD viewing, video and computer gaming, and computer use) is a contributing and a modifiable risk factor for overweight/obesity. To date, research focused on sedentary behaviour has been largely derived from physical (in)activity data where the absence or observed low levels of physical activity participation or TV viewing only has been used as a proxy for sedentariness. Little is known about the specificities of children's electronic media use; its impact on children's overall leisure and screen-time; and, the potential influencing factors that may operate at the home level. The family home is a context-specific setting where electronic media use is a daily practice for most children. To better understand electronic-based sedentary behaviour among children the following specific aims were addressed; 1) To describe children's leisure time, particularly time spent with electronic media. 2) To explore children and parents' perceptions about electronic-based sedentary behaviour. 3) To determine the prevalence of children's electronic-media use at home. 4) To examine the influence of individual, family social and home physical factors associated with different levels of electronic media use by children.  ...  The availability and accessibility of a variety of electronic equipment at home, especially in the child's bedroom (particularly among boys), was also associated with children's screen behaviour. Physical aspects of the family home (i.e., lay-out and yard size) had a mixed effect on children's electronic media use. Overall, the nature of electronic media use among children is complex and is influenced by dimensions that present at children's individual, family social and physical home level. The knowledge generated from this study about specific correlates of electronic media use has extended the understanding about its impact on children's discretionary time. Future prospective longitudinal research is warranted given that most studies investigating electronic media and sedentary behaviour are of cross-sectional design. Including other forms of sedentary behaviour such as sitting and talking with friends and family, reading and/or using telephones may provide a more comprehensive measure of sedentariness in the future. Further studies should use multivariate statistical analyses (i.e., modelling) to improve clarity of relationships between multiple variables and gauge mediating factors. This study also calls for future intervention research. Findings on gender-specific correlates of electronic media use provide superior information for the development of tailored behaviour modification strategies aimed at girls and boys respectively. Active involvement of household members in the intervention is also warranted. Utilising this study's findings may strengthen intervention outcomes towards a more directed and sustained behaviour change</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children -- Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Computers and children</field><field name="subject">Obesity in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Obesity in children</field><field name="subject">Television and children</field><field name="subject">Video games and children</field><field name="subject">Electronic media use</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Descriptive study</field><field name="subject">Sedentary behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of a long span bridge response to blast loading</field><field name="creator">Tang, Edmond Kai Cheong</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] As a consequence of the increase in terrorist incidents, many comprehensive researches, both experimental and numerical modelling of structure and blast interaction, have been conducted to examine the behaviour of civilian structures under dynamic explosion and its impact. Nevertheless most of the works in literature are limited to response of simple structures such as masonry walls, reinforced concrete beams, columns and slabs. Although these studies can provide researchers and structural engineers a good fundamental knowledge regarding blast load effect, it is more likely for blast load to act upon entire structures in actual explosion events. The interaction between blast load and structures, as well as the interaction among structural members may well affect the structural response and damage. Therefore it is necessary to analyse more realistic reinforced concrete structures in order to gain an extensive knowledge on the possible structural response under blast load effect. Among all the civilian structures, bridges are considered to be the most vulnerable to terrorist threat and hence detailed investigation in the dynamic response of these structures is essential. This thesis focuses on the study of the response of a modern cable-stayed bridge under blast loadings. ... Firstly, analysis is conducted to examine the failure of four main components namely pier, tower, concrete back span and steel composite main span under close proximity dynamic impact of a 1000 kg TNT equivalent blast load. Secondly, based on such results, the remainder of the bridge structure is then tested by utilizing the loading condition specified in the US Department of Defence (DoD) guideline with the aim to investigate the possibility of bridge collapse after the damage of these components. It is found that failure of the vertical load bearing elements (i.e. pier and tower) will lead to catastrophic collapse of the bridge. Assuming that terrorist threat cannot be avoided, hence protective measures must be implemented into the bridge structure to reduce the damage induced by explosive blast impact and to prevent bridge from collapse. As such, a safe standoff distance is determined for both the pier and tower under the blast impact of 10000 kg TNT equivalent. This information would allow the bridge designer to identify the critical location for placing blast barriers for protection purpose. For the case of bridge deck explosion, carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) is employed to examine in respect of its effectiveness in strengthening the concrete structure against blast load. In this research, appropriate contact is employed for the numerical model to account for the epoxy resin layer between the CFRP and concrete. In addition, to ensure that the CFRP can perform to its full capacity, anchors are also considered in the numerical study to minimize the chance of debonding due to the weakening of the epoxy. The results reveal that although severe damage can still be seen for locations in close proximity to the explosive charge, the use of CFRP did reduce the dynamic response of the bridge deck as compared to the unprotected case scenario. Further investigation is also carried out to examine the change in damaged zone and global response through variation in CFRP thickness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Long span bridges -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Blast effect -- Simulation methods</field><field name="subject">Cable stayed bridges -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Blast loads</field><field name="subject">Progressive collapse</field><field name="subject">Bridge damage</field><field name="subject">Protection</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is shaping the practice of health professionals and the understanding of the public in relation to increasing intervention in childbirth?</field><field name="creator">McAra-Couper, Judith P</field><field name="description">The increasing rates of intervention in childbirth are an issue for women, their families, health professionals, and society across much of the Western World. This study is a response to these increasing rates of intervention, as reflected in the research question: 'What is shaping the practice of health professionals and the understanding of the public in relation to increasing intervention in childbirth?'  The participants in the study were nine health professionals: midwives and obstetricians, who were interviewed individually, and thirty-three members of the public who took part in six focus groups.  The research was carried out under the umbrella of critical hermeneutics, and the particular approach used was that of critical interpretation as formulated by Hans Kogler.  This approach enabled a hermeneutical thematic analysis of that which is shaped (worldviews) and a critical structural analysis (discursive orders, social practices, relationships of power and structures of domination) of the shaping and shapers of practice and understanding. The research process facilitated by critical interpretation in identifying and describing the shaping and shapers of practice and understanding adds an important dimension to the statistical picture of increasing intervention that is of concern, both to health professionals and the public.  The research revealed that the everyday world and its associated processes of socialisation in the 21st century - in particular pain, choice, and technology - shape the practice of health professionals and the understanding of the public in relation to increasing intervention.  The study's findings were supported by the revelation that many of the social and cultural values, such as convenience, ease, and control, that underpin Western society in the 21st century, correlate with what intervention has to offer, which results in intervention being increasingly sought after and utilised.  This milieu of intervention, which increasingly surrounds childbirth, is shown to be calling into question those things that have traditionally been at the heart of childbirth: the ability of the woman to birth and the clinical skills of the health professional. This research provides insight and awareness of those things that are shaping understanding and practice and birth itself and creating a milieu in which intervention is increasingly normalised.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intervention</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Caesarean</field><field name="subject">C-section</field><field name="subject">Epidural</field><field name="subject">Critical hermeneutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protecting management information systems: Virtual Private Network competitive advantage</field><field name="creator">Sirisukha, Sid</field><field name="description">Information security technologists and business scholars are motivated by a desire to understand how and to what extent the application of IT within enterprise systems leads to improved and secured organizational performance. An effective relationship between business and IT professionals is a primary determinant of success in gaining business advantage through the enterprise system. As business innovation has relied increasingly on partnerships between business and IT professional, a different perspective of how IT professionals view their organizational contributions was needed for organizations to remain competitive. Business knowledge is essential if IT professionals are to create linkages with other organizational units and have a wider perspective about business objectives, thus achieving fit between IT and organizational strategies. Organizations have started responding to this challenge by demanding more business acumen in their IT staff. The focus of this study is on the knowledge that is beyond that of independent business and IT only domain knowledge of information security. Therefore, technical areas of knowledge, such as hardware and software, all of which are closely associated with IT skills, are not discussed in this thesis. This is not to declare that such knowledge is not important. Clearly technical knowledge is part of the IT professional's overall information security technology expertise, but this study is about the organization proficiency of business and the IT professional, and is therefore interested in what enables business and IT professionals to apply their business domain and technical knowledge in ways that are beneficial to the organization and to act cooperatively with their customers and business partners. The purpose of this study is to employ the triangulation method to identify the theoretical links and empirically examine the association between business and IT perspective of information security. An important contribution of this study is the identification of business and IT perspectives on information security technology. By establishing the link between business and IT, the study focuses and evaluates Virtual Private Network (VPN) as an information security technology to find out if VPN can secure and gain competitive advantage by partisan business process and organization performance. This study articulates distinctive characteristics of Virtual Private Network and management processes that extend the range of applicability across diverse business segments. It distinguishes between business and IT and explains why the exploitation of a complementary set of related information security entities (such as VPN) across multiple functions create competitive vi advantages even across a diverse set of businesses that have limited opportunity to exploit business process and organization performance. The most important direct predictor of this study is a high level of communication between business and IT. However, one cannot mandate meaningful communication between individuals. IT people have to earn the right to play a meaningful role in management forums. Based on the findings from this study, one important way for an IT person to be heard is for him/her to devote the time necessary to create competitive advantage and develop shared domain knowledge, the most influential construct in the research model. An IT person needs to understand the leverage points of the industry, the history and current issues of the business units, and to learn to apply business oriented objectives in the application of technology to business problems. This change in view would help focus their attention on security technology and ideas that could produce the most benefit and create competitive advantage, rather than those that offer the most technical promise.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virtual Private Network</field><field name="subject">VPN</field><field name="subject">Competitive advantages</field><field name="subject">Management information system</field><field name="subject">Empirical methods</field><field name="subject">Descriptive methods</field><field name="subject">Interpretive methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preexercise strategies: the effects of warm-up, stretching, and massage on symptoms of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage and performance</field><field name="creator">Weerapong, Pornratshanee</field><field name="description">This thesis uncovers the rational and Romantic assumptions about the relationship between objects and identity that are embedded in occupational therapy, and critiques current practice from that perspective. It is based on an initial assumption that there is in fact a relationship between people's identity and the objects they make, have, use and are associated with. This assumption is explored through an interpretive examination of the fields of literature that are commonly identified as informing occupational therapy, supplemented by selected popular literature. The exploration takes a philosophical approach, guided by notions from philosophical hermeneutics, including pre-understandings, the hermeneutic circle and fusion of horizons. The conclusion reached is that people informed by Western philosophies interpret the identity meanings of objects in both rational and Romantic ways. To inform the study, the nature of rationalism and Romanticism are then explained, and the implications of these philosophical traditions in relation to objects and identity are teased out. This interpretation is guided by a history of ideas methodology, which entails approaching historical texts from a new perspective, in this case the identity meanings of objects. Thus informed, occupational therapy literature, primarily that published in Britain between 1938 and 1962 is examined from the perspective of objects and identity. What is revealed is that rational and Romantic understandings of objects, and of patients' and their own identity are clearly discernible. Such understandings afforded early occupational therapists both ways to organise their growing knowledge of the therapeutic application of crafts and the transformative outcomes of occupational therapy intervention. Gradually however, factors both internal and external to the profession served to undermine therapists' Romanticism. Primary amongst these were World War II, which saw a redeployment of occupational therapists from mental health to physical rehabilitation settings; advances in rehabilitative medicine, which brought a reduction in secondary complications and the adoption of teamwork; and the development of new practice areas including domestic rehabilitation using gadgets to enhance function and pre-vocational rehabilitation. As a result, tensions between rational and Romantic understandings crystallised around two long-standing controversies. These were whether or not craft equipment such as weaving looms should be adapted to serve specific remedial purposes, and whether it was the process of making a crafted object or the quality of the finished product that was more important. In the event, these contested ideologies became largely irrelevant as craftwork was sidelined from mainstream practice. With it, occupational therapists' Romantic vision of transforming people's lives through creative activity also slipped away. Several reasons for this loss of one of the profession's founding philosophies are proposed. They include the substantial absence of the professions' philosophical foundations from its education, and the paucity of theory and research methodologies that might have informed the nature and process of transformative change that earlier occupational therapists had observed and reported. The thesis concludes by arguing for the importance of recovering a balance between rationalism and Romanticism. A call to action is issued, addressing change in educational practice, concerted research effort to identify and articulate transformative processes within occupational therapy, and political action focusing on the inclusion of Romantic perspectives within policy and strategic documents.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stretching exercises</field><field name="subject">Massage</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Sports injuries</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="subject">Injuries prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' motivation to learn, academic achievement, and academic advising</field><field name="creator">Henning, Marcus A</field><field name="description">Numerous models of academic advising address the complex nature of student retention and attrition. Most tend to ignore the subtleties of implementing motivational and self-regulatory changes associated with academic advising. This present study investigates the learning experiences of university students and their use of academic advising. The research incorporates an educational model as its primary investigative lens, namely Hirsch's (2001) multiple intervention model. The study further examined critical areas of learning and advising, specifically motivation, self-regulation, academic difficulty, and academic achievement.This research was conducted at a New Zealand university and comprised of three studies. In the first study, 14 participants were interviewed about their academic problems, readiness for study and use of learning and study strategies. In the second, a total of 317 participants completed a demographic survey and two questionnaires measuring aspects of motivation and self-regulation. In the third study, 147 participants completed follow-up self-report questionnaires. The mixed-paradigm analyses were twofold. Study 1 utilised a meaning-centred approach to classifying and understanding the interview responses. Studies 2 and 3 incorporated multivariate and categorical statistical procedures.Interview narratives from Study 1 suggested that students experiencing academic difficulty tended to voice more problems, to be less ready for study and to be more avoidance oriented than students not experiencing academic difficulty. In Study 2 students indicating low motivation levels for study had more self-perceived problems in the areas of concentration, self-monitoring, use of educational materials and developing time management than students with higher motivation levels. In addition, students with academic difficulty appeared to have more problems with motivation and use of study material than students with no evidence of academic difficulty. Students' motivation levels tended to vary over time indicating that students may perceive their rationale for study as an unfixed or malleable entity. Student attitude at the beginning of the academic semester significantly predicted grade outcome. Motivation and self-regulation response measures obtained immediately prior to the examination period, however, were unable to predict end-of-semester grade averages. In Study 3 completion of short group-based study skills programmes appears to have a link with end of semester grade average, but there were no significant shifts in measures of motivation and self-regulation. Students accessing one-to-one academic advising services were usually students with higher levels of motivation for study. The use of one-to-one academic counselling, however, was not determined by academic difficulty.Overall, the studies contribute a systematic and integrative process of investigating the area of academic advising. The research highlights the importance of goal orientations and students' initial perceptions about the value of their course of study in relation to academic achievement and in reference to the seeking of academic assistance from academic advising services. The findings suggest that although Hirsch's (2001) model provides a valuable framework to investigate ways students study and learn, it requires additional refinement especially in areas of categorisation and application before it can be confidently endorsed. The findings also indicate that academic advisory services provide a valuable service for students in terms of academic achievement, but further research is required in the areas of cultivating motivation and self-regulation changes, and especially in the area of affect development. Finally, the study confirms the worth of mixed-paradigm research and the need for more in depth research in the multifaceted world of academic advising.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">Self-regulation</field><field name="subject">Academic advising</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soft systems analysis of ecosystems</field><field name="creator">Shanmuganathan, Subana</field><field name="description">This research is a case study evaluation of the use of self-organising map (SOM) techniques for ecosystem modelling to overcome the perceived inadequacies with conventional ecological data analysis methods. SOMs provide an analytical method within the connectionist paradigms of artificial neural networks (ANNs), developed from concepts that evolved from late twentieth century neuro-physiological experiments on the cortex cells of the human brain.  The rate and extent at which humans influence environmental deterioration with commensurate biodiversity loss is a cause for major concern and to prevent further degradation by human impact, parsimonious models are urgently needed.  Indeed, the need for better modelling techniques has never been so great.  Ecologists and many national and international bodies see the situation as 'significantly critical' for the conservation of our global ecosystem to foster the continued wellbeing of humanity on this earth.The thesis investigates and further refines SOM based exploratory data analysis methods for modelling naturally evolving, highly diverse and extremely complex ecosystems. Earlier studies provide evidence on SOM ability to analyse complex forest and freshwater biological community structures at limited scales.  On the other hand, growing concerns over conventional methods, their soundness and ability to model large volumes of data are seen as of little use, leading to arguments on the results derived from them. Case study chapters illustrate how SOM methods could be best applied to analyse often 'cryptic' ecosystems in a manner similar to that applied in modelling highly complex and diverse industrial system dynamics.  Furthermore, SOM based data clustering methods, used for financial data analysis are investigated for integrated analysis of ecological and economic system data to study the effects of urbanisation on natural habitats.SOM approaches prove to be an excellent tool for analysing the changes within physical system variables and their effects on the biological systems analysed.  The Long Bay-Okura Marine Reserve case study elaborates on how SOM based approaches could be best applied to model the reserve's intertidal zone with available numeric data.  SOM maps depicted the characteristic microclimate within this zone from ecological monitoring data of physical attributes, without any geographical data being added.  This kind of feature extraction from raw data is found to be useful and is applied to two more case studies to study the slow variables of ecosystems, such as population dynamics, and to establish their correlation with environmental variations.   SOM maps are found to be capable of distinguishing the human induced variations from that of natural/ global variations, at different scales (site, regional and global) and levels using regional and global data.  Hence, SOM approaches prove to be capable of modelling complex natural systems incorporating their spatial and temporal variations using the available monitoring data, this is a major advantage observed with SOM analyses.In the third case study, potential use of SOM techniques to analyse global trends on the effects of urbanisation in environmental and biological systems are explored using the World Bank's statistical data for different countries.  Many state and international institutions, concerned over global environmental issues, have made attempts to develop indicators to assess the conditions of different ecosystems.  The enhancements with SOM approaches against the currently recommended indicator system based on information pyramid and pressure-state-response (PSR) models are elaborated upon.The research results of SOM methods for ecosystem modelling, similar to that applied to industrial process modelling and financial system analysis show potential. SOM approaches (i.e. cluster, dependent component, decision system and trajectories/ time series analyses) provide a means for feature extraction from the available numeric data at different levels and scales, fulfilling the urgent need for modelling tools to conserve our global ecosystem.  They can be used to bridge the gap in converting raw data into knowledge to inform sustainable ecosystem management.  Increasingly, traditional methods based on Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) designs and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) are seen to be unsuitable for ecological data analysis, as they are unable to detect human induced environmental impacts from that of a natural cause.  This thesis proves that SOM techniques could be applied to modelling not only a natural systems complexity but also its functioning and dynamics, incorporating spatial as well as temporal variations, to overcome the constraints with conventional methods as applied in other stated disciplines.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biotic communities</field><field name="subject">Ecosystem management</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand travel agents in the internet era: impacts, responses, and relationships</field><field name="creator">Garkavenko, Vladimir</field><field name="description">The impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is a significant issue in today's tourism industry. The development of the internet has made information easily accessible to consumers, and has therefore established a direct link between consumers and suppliers. As a result, traditional travel distribution channels are changing rapidly. A major feature of this change is "disintermediation", with principals such as airlines, hotels and rental car chains bypassing intermediaries and sell directly to consumers. Travel agents (TAs) are considered to be particularly vulnerable to this process. ICTs have the potential to replace their core competencies, which include transaction processing (ticketing and settlement) and information provision (raw product information provided by suppliers).This thesis focuses on the impact of ICTs on the TA sector, and specifically on the New Zealand TA case. A theoretical approach based on regulation theory  combined with a mixed method approach was used to investigate the main issues in New Zealand. The research included a case study to identify the principal issues and trends in the TA sector, in-depth interviews with TAs and industry specialists to refine the main issues and allow the formulation of some theoretical assumptions, in-depth interviews with consumers regarding the role of TAs in the internet era and the quality of service they provide, and a fully-structured, national on-line survey of TAs to verify the assumptions made in the earlier interviews and test the applicability of the post-Fordism model for the New Zealand TA sector.Based on the findings, it is argued that disintermediation is particularly pronounced in the relationship between airlines and travel agents. To minimise the risk of disintermediation and improve business performance, TAs need to reposition themselves and review their core strategies to compete efficiently in the changing business environment. The thesis reveals that consumers perceive TAs as mainly "transaction facilitators". Nevertheless the thesis show that process of "reintermediation" is a reality for some New Zealand TAs.An application of regulation theory to the New Zealand TA case reveals that in its traditional form, the regulation theory cannot explain the complexities found in the modern TA environment. The thesis reveals several distinct modes in TA perceptions of their business environment and their survival strategies, which indicates a heterogeneous, clustered population. A "formula for success" is developed for TAs in New Zealand. In this respect, TAs that perceive ICT as a strategic tool and are orientated towards consumers appear to have a business advantage.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Travel agency</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Information and communication technology (ICT)</field><field name="subject">Tourist bookings</field><field name="subject">Direct sales</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">There's no meaning in chocolate: a narrative study of women's journeys beyond the disruption of depression</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Jan D</field><field name="description">Professional treatment, mainly medical and psychological, dominates research and clinical practice concerning women and their recovery from depression. This thesis challenges the assumption that women cannot be 'experts' actively involved in their own recovery. This study explored the narratives of eighteen women in Aotearoa New Zealand whose lives had been seriously disrupted by depression. They had found ways other than, or in addition to, professional solutions that helped them to live undisrupted meaningful lives. 	The research used a narrative inquiry approach informed by authors from across the social sciences including Arthur Frank, Jerome Bruner and Rivka Tuval-Mashiach. The underpinning social constructionist understanding of depression is informed by the work of Jane Ussher and Janet Stoppard. The women whose individual narratives provide the core data for the study ranged in age from 32 to 70 years at the time they told their stories. Their lives had been disrupted by depression at different times during the last 50 years of the twentieth century. Five of the women met as a group with the researcher as the analysis began, and their ideas informed significant aspects of the conclusions.	The women had all experienced major depressive disorder, although this was not always formally diagnosed. Their recovery had involved a range of responses from outside the professional mainstream including physical, mental, social and spiritual aspects. Each woman had sought and found a 'formula' that was 'right' for her. The narratives showed all the women talked of their experience with depression and recovery in an holistic and contextualised way. They all talked about 'chocolate' solutions which provided symptom relief, and 'deeper' and often more complex sets of solutions which enabled them to discover or re-discover meaningful ways to live. Meaning-making often involved growing spiritual or transpersonal awareness in the broadest sense. A surprising finding was that the patterns of recovery were not related to the severity of the depression at the worst time. Rather, it emerged that the ways the women talked about their recovery journeys mirrored their stories of the 'jolly good reasons' why they were depressed; the more complex and lengthy the story leading up to the worst times, the more complex the formulae required for recovery. 	The implications of the research for clinical practice and for policy makers are that depression and recovery need to be seen as gendered, contextualised, and holistic. Women need opportunities to discover and take advantage of a range of 'things' so that they can find their own 'right formula' for recovery. This formula may involve professional treatment including anti-depressant medication and psychological therapy, but it is likely to involve many other things as well. This study challenges the notion that recovery needs to be guided by a professional expert, and creates hope for women being able to learn from each other's experiences.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative inquiry</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Women's recovery</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Lay solutions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of brief-intermittent hypoxic exposure on high-intensity kayaking and cycling performance</field><field name="creator">Bonetti, Darrell</field><field name="description">Adaptation to the shortage of oxygen at altitude (hypoxia) promotes physiological changes which could enhance endurance performance.  Consequently, altitude training has become a popular practice among competitive endurance athletes. Since its inception, the live-high train-low paradigm (LHTL) has been widely regarded as the most effective approach to altitude training. Over the past decade, brief intermittent simulation of LHTL via the use of hypoxic inhalers and re-breathing devices has gained increased popularity, but the evidence supporting their use is limited and conflicting. The experimental studies in this thesis investigated the response of sea level exercise performance and related physiological measures following adaptation to the usual and a novel protocol of brief intermittent hypoxia.  I intended to perform all experimental studies on flat-water kayakers.  Therefore, an initial requirement of this thesis was to establish the smallest worthwhile effect in performance for this sport. The final study utilising a meta-analytic approach was conducted to compare the effectiveness of brief intermittent hypoxia to other natural and simulated protocols, and to investigate the topical issue of what physiological responses mediate performance changes following hypoxic exposure.  In Study 1, the typical variation in competitive performance of elite flat-water canoeists was investigated using a repeated-measures analysis of race times.  For individual flat-water canoeing events, the smallest worthwhile change in performance time was ~0.5%. In two separate experimental studies, adaptation to 60 min per day of brief intermittent hypoxia consisting of alternating 5 min intervals of hypoxia and normoxia for 3 weeks (5 days per week) using a nitrogen filtration device resulted in clear enhancement of endurance performance (~5%) for kayakers (Study 2) and cyclists (Study 3). Clear enhancements in repeat sprint performance were observed for kayaking only. The physiological mechanisms underlying performance changes were unclear.  Modification of the hypoxic and normoxic intervals (Study 3) did not result in any clear alterations in performance or physiological mechanisms.  The meta-analysis (Study 4) revealed clear enhancements in endurance power output of 1-3%  in sub-elites following adaptation to hypoxia with the natural altitude protocols, and with two of the artificial-altitude protocols (LHTL-long and LHTL-brief-intermittent). In elite athletes the enhancements tended to be smaller and were clear only for the natural protocols. These enhancements could be mediated by VO2max, although other mechanisms may be possible.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hypoxia, Kayaking, Cycling, High intensity exercise</field><field name="subject">Sports training</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative accountability in the Ugandan community-led HIV/AIDS programme</field><field name="creator">Awio, Godwin</field><field name="description">Internationally, many public sector reform initiatives have been undertaken over the last three decades under the label New Public Management (NPM), with improvements in accountability and management among their main objectives. This thesis draws on social capital theory to examine the potential of a Ugandan community-led HIV/AIDS programme to supplement NPM approaches to public service delivery and accountability. Hermeneutics methodology is used to guide the research design and the interpretation of evidence.The findings of this study suggest that Uganda's community-led HIV/AIDS initiatives operate within a "bottom-up" accountability framework, characterized by the community taking a role in budgeting, program implementation, reporting, project-oversight, and audit activities. In regard to accounting practices, this study reveals that Ugandan community projects use basic and simple accounting procedures. The findings suggest that simple communal accountability mechanisms can compensate for the types of formal control mechanisms typically promoted within NPM-style reforms. The findings also suggest that multiple accountability relationships can operate in the form of both hierarchical and lateral accountability practices and that these multiple accountability relationships lead to tighter control and accurate accountability, even though formal accountability mechanisms may be weak.This study identified some challenges for community-led service delivery initiatives, including the potential for corrupt practices in some community groups and variations in the level of participation of group members in the execution of various tasks. Further, several areas for further research have been identified. These include the measurement of social capital within community groups and the establishment of measures of group capacities.This study has revealed the latent accountability technology of a "bottom-up" communitarian accountability framework and demonstrated its potential as a complement to NPM models of service delivery and accountability. As an accountability innovation, it needs to be keenly watched as further field experiences emerge over time and reveal more of its potential in developing countries, and perhaps beyond.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uganda</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">Social capital</field><field name="subject">Accounting practice</field><field name="subject">Pubic sector reform</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uncovering "regimes of truth": locating and defining discourses associated with hydro-electric development in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wells, Philippa Katherine</field><field name="description">This thesis reveals and explores a history of the New Zealand present, providing insight into myths through which New Zealanders shape their perceptions and relationships with the world that surrounds them, and interrogating the concepts that support those myths.

Popular discourse also recognises environmental values - hence the appearance of concerted public and media campaigns against proposed development of coastal and timbered areas and the survival of lobby and pressure groups based on environmental causes such as opposition to genetic modification and the alienation of areas considered of natural significance. However, a study of relevant strains of discourse in the New Zealand environmental context reveals ruptures and reversals, inconsistencies and contradictions. The focus and meanings within discourse have changed; the position and power of the environment has been both affected by, and has affected, power relationships. At certain times and in particular social conditions, an environmental voice has been compelled to occupy a space on the outskirts of a dominant discourse and to comply with its discursive practices, as a way of gaining legitimisation. At others, an environmental discourse has gained a fleeting triumph, to be privileged as truth. From the official outset of European colonisation in 1840, a discourse grounded in such modernist values as technological optimism, economic progress and capitalism both framed and legitimised utterances of the colonists and grounded decisions that were to fundamentally and permanently affect the New Zealand physical environment. Themes that were to echo through the years in such discursive enunciations as acclimatisation and engineering were justified on the basis of "progress". Such themes included the presumption that "man" and fulfilment of "his" needs was the ultimate dictate, and that this could and would be achieved through scientific discovery and its application through engineering and arts. Only through such a pursuit could civilisation advance onwards and upwards along a never-ending path. Within such a discourse, Nature had no distinct or valid domain outside that of man, but was merely a storehouse of raw materials, to be dipped into by Man when and where desired. One of the most significant manifestations for New Zealand in the twentieth century of this modernist discourse has been the development of hydro-electricity. The availability of the necessary technology in a country boasting plentiful rainfall, numerous fast-flowing rivers, pockets of population and a tradition of socialist, centralist political philosophy shaped hydro-electricity as a metaphor for New Zealand-style civilisation - enabled and controlled through government decision-making. Consequently, a genealogical study of the discourses relating to hydro-electricity policy and debate can provide valuable insight into the power relations between those exercising power through a modernist discourse and an environmental resistance, and into strategies that were adopted or developed as part of such discourses in the exercise of power. In particular, a detailed study of specific examples permits the interplay of socio-temporal factors and practices to be appreciated. Hydro-electricity is thus the contextual focus selected in this thesis, a focus reflected in the title. The genealogical method involves uncovering and contextualising primary and secondary materials within their historical setting. Through the interrogation of such materials this approach contributes to a critical understanding of power relations and how those relations influence strategies that might be utilised in the exercise of power. Such a method was therefore selected to analyse the tensions implicit in discourse within three historically and contextually specific case studies. These case studies involved in chronological order the proposal to harness the waters of the Bowen Falls in Fiordland during the 1920s, the proposal to raise the level of Lake Manapouri (together with that of the neighbouring Lake Te Anau) in the 1960s, and finally the proposal to divert a large proportion of the mean water-flow of the Lower Waitaki river during the first part of the twenty-first century. A principal conclusion that is reached through the analysis is that the present environmental discourse in New Zealand is not the inevitable outcome of progressive and logical history. Nor can it be explained as chance or as a consequence of world changes, but is a function of power/knowledge. Changes in the regime of truth are therefore the outcome of a successful power strategy exercised by a resistance in challenging that regime of truth. In addition, what might be defined as "environmental discourse" in the New Zealand context is narrowly defined, limited by environmental cause, a cause shaped in turn by the language of conservation. The lesson from history is that the regime of truth of such a discourse is not an end, stable and unchanging for the future, but must be seen rather as brittle, uncertain and vulnerable to attack. A third conclusion that emerges from the hydro-electricity focus is that this particular discursive enunciation of a New Zealand-style modernist discourse was a metaphor for social and economic progress, thereby occupying a privileged position as truth. Finally, one of the important contributions to methodological debate made by the thesis lies in its application of the Foucauldian genealogical method in exploring the general history of a socio-temporal context, thereby uncovering power strategies effected through discourse. This in turn reveals the hidden events, the silent voices and the games played in establishing and challenging a regime of truth.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydroelectric power plants</field><field name="subject">Environmentalism</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The poetics of making</field><field name="creator">Ho, King Tong</field><field name="description">This is a practice-led research project that seeks to explore the cross-cultural aesthetics and conceptual ideas of an art project. I position myself as an art practitioner who intends to apply the Western modes of technological advancement of digital imaging and ink jet technologies to the substrates used by traditional Chinese artists for ink painting and calligraphy, usually called Xuan Zhi [&#23459;&#32025;]. Through this process, the aesthetics and conceptual ideas of both cultures will be explored, examined, analysed and interrogated for the potential development of a new aesthetics in the context of digital art. There are three major components in this research project; a creative document in the form of a collection of artwork, an exegesis and a collection of documentation. The creative document will be a body of visual image-based artwork that includes a series of collateral works from the ongoing research and practice of the project. It is the negotiated output of a potentially new aesthetics in digital art, specifically in the context of digital still imaging and digital printmaking. The exegesis is an analytical and critical commentary that places the creative document in relevant theoretical, philosophical, cultural and historical contexts. The documentation is a collection of the ongoing empirical practice of ink jet technology on Xuan Zhi. The visual physical form of both the exegesis and the documentation are also included as part of the creative document. These three components together form a unity and are presented as artefacts to represent the main focus of the research - the Poetics of Making.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ink jet printmaking technology</field><field name="subject">Digital art and aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Chinese philosophy and aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Chinese traditional art substrates</field><field name="subject">Photography</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural aesthetics and concepts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fuzzy ontology and intelligent systems for discovery of useful medical information</field><field name="creator">Parry, David Tudor</field><field name="description">Currently, reliable and appropriate medical information is difficult to find on the Internet. The potential for improvement in human health by the use of internet-based sources of information is potentially huge, as knowledge becomes more widely available, at much lower cost. Medical information has traditionally formed a large part of academic publishing. However, the increasing volume of available information, along with the demand for evidence based medicine makes Internet sources of information appear to be the only practical source of comprehensive and up-to date information. The aim of this work is to develop a system allowing groups of users to identify information that they find useful, and using those particular sources as examples develop an intelligent system that can classify new information sources in terms of their likely usefulness to such groups. Medical information sources are particularly interesting because they cover a very wide range of specialties, they require very strict quality control, and the consequence of error may be extremely serious, in addition, medical information sources are of increasing interest to the general public. This work covers the design, construction and testing of such a system and introduces two new concepts - document structure identification via information entropy and fuzzy ontology for knowledge representation. A mapping between query terms and members of ontology is usually a key part of any ontology enhanced searching tool. However many terms used in queries may be overloaded in terms of the ontology, which limits the potential use of automatic query expansion and refinement. In particular this problem affects information systems where different users are likely to expect different meanings for the same term. This thesis describes the derivation and use of a "Fuzzy Ontology" which uses fuzzy relations between components of the ontology in order to preserve a common structure. The concept is presented in the medical domain. Kolmogorov distance calculations are used to identify similarity between documents in terms of authorship, origin and topic. In addition structural measures such as paragraph tags were examined but found not to be effective in clustering documents. The thesis describes some theoretical and practical evaluation of these approaches in the context of a medical information retrieval system, designed to support ontology-based search refinement, relevance feedback and preference sharing between professional groups.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicine</field><field name="subject">Computer network resources</field><field name="subject">Medical telematics</field><field name="subject">Medical informatics</field><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The efficacy and microstructure effects of insider trading regulations</field><field name="creator">Gilbert, Aaron</field><field name="description">The competition for external capital amongst small and developing financial markets has resulted in a growing awareness of the importance of investor protection laws if markets are to be competitive. One particularly important aspect of such laws is the need to control the behaviour of insiders. Insider trading, widely perceived as trading by investors who have an unfair advantage by virtue of access to confidential information, represents a significant threat to market confidence and investors' willingness to invest in the market. For small markets therefore, not controlling such behaviour represents a significant cost in terms of the development of the market and the economy as a whole. However, while insider trading can do significant harm to the market, it also has the potential to be beneficial to the market as a signal of incorrectly priced information. The question becomes therefore how best to balance the advantages and disadvantages of insider trading. Most markets have relied on regulations to control insiders, however, little research has been done to establish if this is effective.This thesis seeks to provide additional evidence with respect to the role of regulation in controlling insider trading. The issue is explored within the context of the New Zealand market where recent legislation, the Securities Market Amendment Act 2002, offers a prime opportunity to seek further understanding on the issue. In particular, four studies focussed on the role of regulation with respect to insider trading are undertaken within this thesis. In the first the impact of the law change on the profitability and informational base of insiders is examined. A significant decline in profitability is observed in addition to evidence of a change in the informational basis of insiders' trades from knowledge of upcoming announcements to short-term market mispricing. The impact of the new law on four aspects of the market is then examined. A significant increase in liquidity is found following the introduction of the new law, as well as significant reductions in the cost of equity, bid-ask spread and return volatility. The law therefore appears to have improved these aspects of the market. The bid-ask spreads were then examined in more depth by observing the impact of the laws on the cost of informed trading. Strong evidence of a decline in the cost of informed trading was observed, along with significant decreases in the proportion of the spread composed of information asymmetry costs. The declines were largest for those firms most prone to insider trading.Lastly, the elements of an effective insider trading regime were investigated by examining the impact of various legal variables on the cost of informed trading and the total spread. The results indicated that stronger laws have resulted in lower spreads and less informed trading costs, and that effective regimes should prevent insiders passing on their information, should rely on financial penalties over criminal sanctions, and should be both enforceable and policed by a strong public regulator. Overall this thesis finds strong evidence that insider trading laws can be effective in controlling the behaviour of insiders, and that well drafted statutory regulations can be of significant benefit to the market.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Securities Market Amendment Act 2002</field><field name="subject">Insider traders</field><field name="subject">Securities</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A philosophical critique of the best interests test as a criterion for decision making in law and clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Godbold, Rosemary P</field><field name="description">The best interest test is the legal mechanism which governs decision making on behalf of adults who lack the capacity to make their own health care treatment decisions. The test has attracted considerable criticism from health professionals, academics, judges and lawyers for being ill-defined and non-specific. The question of what is meant by 'best interests' remains largely unanswered. As a consequence, the test gives medical and legal decision makers considerable discretion to apply their personal value judgements within supposedly value-free philosophical frameworks - unreasoned and opaque decision making processes are the inevitable result. Because of the dominance of supposedly value-free philosophical frameworks, the place of values in decision making is not always fully understood. Reasoning is not possible without values, which stem from our emotions and passions, our upbringing, our religion, our cultures, our processes of socialisation and from our life experiences. Values help us make sense of our daily lives.  I argue that law - like any other social institution - is essentially a human, values based construct. I put forward a theory of values-based law which argues for the recognition that laws, rules and conventions are based on, and contain, individual values. Currently, medical and legal decision makers justify grave decisions on behalf of society's most vulnerable citizens without revealing, or even acknowledging the values which drive and inform their decisions. Any opportunities to scrutinise or debate the values driving decisions are lost. Ultimately, values-based law argues that values underlying best interest determinations must be exposed to facilitate honest, transparent and fulsome decision making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. By applying the theory of values-based law, supposedly value-free decision making processes are exposed as insufficient to facilitate fulsome, honest and transparent legal reasoning.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophical analysis</field><field name="subject">Bad faith</field><field name="subject">Kuhn</field><field name="subject">Scientific revolutions</field><field name="subject">Objectivism</field><field name="subject">State of nature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibration of branched circular cylindrical shells as applied to airway walls</field><field name="creator">Au, Pui Ming</field><field name="description">This research focuses on investigating the vibration characteristics of branched circular cylindrical shells with applications to airway passages.

It focussed specifically on the concept of user satisfaction, the construct of cognitive style as applied to users and systems analysts, and their interrelationships. Prior studies were found rarely to investigate the changes in user satisfaction during system usage. Further, any reference to cognitive style in the IS literature proved to be sparse, open to question and discouraging in terms of its value. By developing and using a new instrument, the System Satisfaction Schedule, or SSS, the present study was able empirically to demonstrate clear patterns of changing user satisfaction during system usage. These were demonstrated, both as a general trend and in terms of its relationship to the cognitive styles of the key players (analyst and user) involved in system development and maintenance. Cognitive style was measured using Kirton's Adaption-innovation Inventory, or KAI. This study was thus able to suggest new rules for system development based on the assessments of the cognitive styles of both users and systems analysts. These rules focussed primarily on simple team choice: which analyst to put with which user. However, inferences for larger system development teams were drawn and suggestions for further research duly made. The present study thus also contributes to the successful practice of system development. To give effect to the above, this study set out to investigate empirically the way user satisfaction changes over 1&#189; to 2 years of system usage and, as mentioned above, the way user satisfaction is impacted by the cognitive styles of the user and the systems analyst. Most significantly, relationships were studied between user satisfaction and the difference in cognitive style between the analyst and user. It was found that user satisfaction generally rises linearly with usage, and that while the size of the analyst user cognitive differential does negatively impact user satisfaction over most of the time of system use, this effect is only particularly strong for two short periods; one within the first four months of usage and the other in the last three. From these results the new rules for system development mentioned above, followed. In terms of the decline of users' mean perceived severities of individual problems, the exponential decay and reciprocal models were found to fit the data the best. This study developed a new model for the motivation to use, develop or maintain a system (the Mechanical Model), based on its own results and Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation. In this, Herzberg's hygiene factors have been replaced with the concept of dissatisfiers. These are measured as expressions of dissatisfaction as and when they occur. Their use removes the researcher's need, when designing user satisfaction instruments, to speculate on complete lists of factors which may satisfy users, and which may date as technology and other contextual factors change.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">User interfaces (Computer systems)</field><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">Information technology - Management</field><field name="subject">Information Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing, contesting and consuming New Zealand's tourism landscape: a history of Te Wairoa</field><field name="creator">Bremner, Hamish</field><field name="description">The thesis focuses on documentation regarding the historical growth of tourism at Te Wairoa, Rotorua, New Zealand. Te Wairoa acted as a gateway to Otukapuarangi and Te Tarata of Rotomahana which represented an iconic tourism landscape in the nineteenth century. A theoretical engagement with tourism studies and the utilisation of history as an analytical device reveals that the consumption of the tourism landscape is an ongoing, contested, and negotiated cultural construction of place.The history of tourism development at Te Wairoa exhibits the entrenchment of European colonial power in New Zealand. However, within the structures of colonial authority, strategies of survival for the colonised are employed. In this particular case, the strategies include the engagement with Western ethics of capitalism, the manipulation and appropriation of symbols of the 'other', and the control of access through land ownership. The economic and social development of Te Wairoa, based on a tourism economy, also highlights the existent tensions in both a colonial and post-colonial relationship in New Zealand.The research further argues that individual tourism sites reflect culturally ascribed values associated with place. As the combination of exogenous and endogenous social, cultural, political and economic forces evolve so to does the production and consumption of the tourism landscape. Evidence for these considerations is provided by publicly available historical material including archival documents, historical literature, contemporary accounts, newspapers, and government records. The result is an in-depth study which provides an original and thematic interpretation of the history of Te Wairoa as well as supporting a model for investigating change in the cultural construction of place.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling of an electroactive polymer hydrogel for optical applications</field><field name="creator">Paxton, Robert Alan</field><field name="description">In this work a finite element model is proposed to describe the swelling of poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels under the influence of an external electric field. The specific application of this model is for optical applications, but the design could be used equally well for other applications such as sensors and actuators.The model is proposed as five individual modules, which work in conjunction with each other but which can also function independently. This independence allows the model to provide intermediate results to the user, and also permits each module to be improved or adjusted individually without affecting the operation of the overall model. The first module is the Electrical module, which calculates the external electric field present in the hydrogel by solving Laplace's equation. The second module is the Chemical module, which uses the electric field to calculate the diffusion and migration of ions through the hydrogel/solvent regions. The third module is the Force module, which uses the change in ion concentrations to calculate the resulting change in osmotic pressure (force). This force is then used in the Mechanical module to calculate the deformation of the hydrogel, based on the assumption of linear elasticity. Finally, the fifth module is the Optical module, which uses the deformation to calculate the theoretical change in focal length.To verify the operation of the model, numerous experiments were conducted with the deformation of a poly(acrylic acid) hydrogel being measured under various external voltages with different electrode configurations. Overall, the model agrees quite well with the experimental results, but also highlights some interesting discrepancies that will need to be considered in future work. There is also some scope for improvement in the experimental method used, but again this is left for future work.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="subject">Polymer colloids</field><field name="subject">Ophthalmic lenses</field><field name="subject">Colloids</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Within the web: the family/practitioner relationship in the context of chronic childhood illness</field><field name="creator">Dickinson, Annette R</field><field name="description">This study explores the phenomenon of the relationships between practitioners and families who have a child with a chronic illness.  Using a heremeneutic phenomenological method informed by the writings of Martin Heidegger [1889-1976] and Hans-Georg Gadamer [1900-2002], this study provides an understanding of the meaning of 'being in relationship' from the perspective of both families and practitioners.Study participants include ten family groups who have a child with a chronic illness and twelve practitioners from the disciplines of nursing, medicine, dietetics, physiotherapy and speech therapy who work with children with chronic illness.  Narrative audiotaped interviewing was the means by which the participants told their stories about times that relationships worked well and when they did not.  These stories uncover the every day realities of 'being in relationship' and provide another understanding of the relationship between family and practitioner.The findings of this thesis suggest that chronic childhood illness 'throws' families and practitioners together into a web of relationships that must work for the sake of the child.  The relationship is primarily conducted between adults.  Children are usually excluded.  In order to understand and manage the child's illness, practitioners and families 'go around' and act 'in-between' relationships.  While the quality of the relationship from the family perspective is not essential to the chronic illness journey, relationships are more successful when practitioners recognise the uniqueness of each family web.  The nature of the relationship is often simple, yet it co-exists with complexity.  This thesis proposes that a 'companion relationship' between practitioners and family may offer a more effective and satisfying way of working.  It also challenges practitioners to consider the voice of children within health care relationships.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chronic diseases in children</field><field name="subject">Parent and child</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Professional-Family Relations</field><field name="subject">Chronic Disease</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acid hydrolysis of neutral glycosphingolipids</field><field name="creator">Nardan, Denise</field><field name="description">Blood group glycolipids are important tools in the study of microbial receptor interactions and other biological phenomena. Presently blood group glycolipids of interest are isolated from biological samples. However, all glycolipids are not readily available due to the low frequency of some phenotypes in the general population. The ability to acquire the rare glycolipids from the degradation of common glycolipids would be a useful alternative to trying to obtain the molecules from biological sources.This research set out to establish the ability of blood group glycolipids to be degraded into useful glycolipids in a controlled manner by acid hydrolysis and possibly metal catalysis. The initial experiments investigated the degradation/hydrolysis of the more readily available glycolipid globoside with a range of salts and acids to establish degradation concepts such as; temperature, type of acid, acid concentration, and the role of metal ions in glycolipid degradation. These concepts then led to a series of degradation experiments with the blood group glycolipids Leb and ALeb. These glycolipids were incubated with a range of acid concentrations and varying temperatures. Thin layer chromatography separation and chemical and immunochemical staining were the main methods used to identify the products of degradation.It was established that metal ions were not directly involved in the catalysis of glycolipids in the short-term, however some metal ions were indirectly implicated in their degradation due to their ability to form acid solutions. Acid hydrolysis was established as the principle mechanism for glycan chain degradation. In general it was found that the glycan chain primarily lost its fucose groups (in no particular order) and was then followed by sequential degradation of the remaining glycan chain. The glycan chain also appeared to have a protective function on the ceramide moiety.  Degradation of globoside established a simple sequential pathway of glycan chain reduction from the non-reducing end. Blood group glycolipids ALeb and Leb first lost their fucose side groups followed by sequential reduction of the glycan chain. Although not fully controllable, degradation of Leb was able to produce Lea, Led and Lec. In contrast degradation of ALeb did not produce any Lea or Led. Instead A-type 1 and two novel A-like structures, 'linear A' and 'GalNAc-Lea' were generated. Lec was only produced from ALeb in extremely acidic conditions. This research established the ability to generate, by acid hydrolysis, a range of rare and "unnatural" novel glycolipids from more commonly available structures. It is of interest that the so-called unnatural glycolipids obtained from the acid hydrolysis of ALeb may, in theory, occur naturally in the acid environment of the stomach, and as such could have the potential to be implicated in disease. It is probable that by applying the principles learned here, a range of novel and natural structures suitable for use in the study of biological interactions can be obtained.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acid hydrolysis</field><field name="subject">Glycosidic bonds</field><field name="subject">Lewis blood groups</field><field name="subject">Fucose</field><field name="subject">glycolipids</field><field name="subject">A Lewis b</field><field name="subject">Lewis b</field><field name="subject">Lewis c</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Balancing recognition and disrespect: recovery as the process of identity formation: a New Zealand study of how services shape recovery from sexual abuse</field><field name="creator">Frerichs, Gudrun</field><field name="description">This study explored how the recovery of victims of sexual abuse is shaped by services available. Using the philosophical underpinnings of critical theory within the framework of Honneth's recognition theory this study provides an understanding of participants' experiences and views of recovery from sexual abuse. The study was conducted with ten adult survivors of sexual abuse using semi-structured individual interviews and two focus groups with eight service providers. The analysis identified that the recovery from sexual abuse is the development of a positive sense of identity reflected by participants' self-confidence, self-respect, and self-esteem. In this study this is described as the process of identity formation. Services shaped recovery from sexual abuse by providing experiences of recognition and disrespect. Recognition was given in the form of emotional support and care, cognitive respect, and social esteem that led to an improvement of participants' functioning. Disrespect was perceived by participants as they struggled with the invisibility of sexual abuse, with inequality, and with the lack of understanding, through which their overall functioning deteriorated. Recovery emerged as a dynamic process that, most of all, required from services that they provide experiences of recognition and from survivors that they accurately perceive that recognition was given to them. For recovery to occur, participants needed to balance experiences of recognition and disrespect, a process in which they needed to surrender the longing for the entirely good and benign caregiver and accept that both 'good' and 'bad' qualities reside in each caregiver, agency, therapist, or generally the 'other'.  This balancing resulted in the development of self-confidence, self-respect, and self-esteem. Recovery was experienced by participants when they were able to resist disrespect and either engaged in fighting for their rights or removing themselves from situations in which their rights could be violated. Only by having a practical experience of being able to protect their physical and psychological integrity did participants become aware that they had recovered from the legacies of sexual abuse and could proceed with their lives without professional assistance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical theory</field><field name="subject">Service provision, Treatment, Psychotherapy, Mental health</field><field name="subject">Recognition theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talking pictures: a creative utilization of structural and aesthetic profiles from narrative music videos and television commercials in a non-spoken film text</field><field name="creator">Ings, Welby</field><field name="description">This thesis is about storytelling. It is presented in three parts, a major output with two supporting components. The first and primary section is the short film. The second is an exhibition of images, props, and environments created for the work. The third is the exegesis. Situated as creative practice, the project tests and develops structural and aesthetic hypotheses in the creation of a non-spoken film text. These hypotheses are shaped by considerations from two areas.The first is design for narrative music video. An analysis of selected texts leads to a creative reconsideration of the role and profile of imagery, space, time, sound, enigma, closure, and narrative voice. The second area is typography. Reflecting on the anti-language, bogspeak, and the culture that has given rise to its development, the thesis develops inaudible typographical voices that operate as narrative contributions to the film.These two areas of consideration support a unique way of telling stories. This is significant because emerging uses of short film now take these texts beyond the theatre. They are marketed as commercially available stories in their own right. As distribution companies are formatting them on DVDs, viewers are seeing these stories not once, but many times. It is useful therefore, for the design of such texts to consider alternative methods of narration that might work to preserve the durability and complexity of their stories as they unravel over repeated screenings.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Storytelling</field><field name="subject">Graphic arts</field><field name="subject">Short films</field><field name="subject">Homosexuality, Male</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power relationships within a corporate finance department: a Foucauldian approach to corporate hierarchies and resistance</field><field name="creator">Garland, Angela M</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis investigates power relationships within a corporate Finance Department employing a Foucauldian approach to explaining corporate hierarchies and resistance and the implications.Research was conducted in the form of a case study and observation of a corporate finance department, referred to as the 'Finance Department', at the 'Company', referred to as such for confidentiality purposes. The Company is a large Dutch based mail and logistics entity that operates internationally across over 200 countries and has its corporate head office just outside of Amsterdam. The Company's Finance Department was in the throws of change, particularly around hierarchies as a result of the reengineering process with the purpose of creating efficiencies. The aim of the research was to evaluate the power relationships that existed within the hierarchies between management and workers who worked either for the Finance Department or closely with it, and to analyse the outcomes of these power relationships in terms of resistance.The case study is a Foucauldian insight into the different individuals who worked either within the Finance Department or closely with it, with an evaluation of their roles and how their differing power structures impacted upon the workflow within the Finance Department.The outcome of this research is an evaluation of those individuals and their relationships at a particular point in time, which was impacted by so many different factors. The research could give readers an understanding of power relationships and framework for contextual Foucauldian evaluation.The significance of the contribution arising from this particular piece of research is that it involves the combination of a case study method with a Foucauldian perspective. The combination of these two elements allows the research to be done both from the top down and also from the bottom up. Increasing in use as a research tool (Hamel, 1992), the case study contributes uniquely to our body of knowledge of individual, organisational, social and political phenomena (Yin, 1994). The Foucauldian perspective plays an important part in terms of an understanding of power, despite the fact that it is often difficult to fully comprehend the meanings behind Foucault's work (McHoul &amp; Grace, 1993).</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glass ceiling</field><field name="subject">Business hierarchy</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured interviews</field><field name="subject">Interpretive approach</field><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of trade liberalisation on economic structure and performance: case of the OECS</field><field name="creator">Samuel, Thomas</field><field name="description">In keeping with global liberalisation trends and impelled by external liberalisation in terms of eroding preferential treatment in their principal export markets, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)1 together with the wider Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) region, has since 1993 embraced a policy of trade liberalisation as a strategy for growth and development. In large measure this was done through the phased implementation of a Common External Tariff (CET) involving a progressive lowering of tariff rates over the period, 1993-1998. The theoretical arguments in support of this policy change are based on the assumption of a positive link between trade liberalisation and economic growth. They contend that trade reforms that increase the outward-orientation/openness of trade regimes would result in structural change that reallocate resources in line with comparative advantage leading to exportled growth. This will then be followed by faster economic growth as countries benefit from efficiency gains, technology spillovers and other positive externalities.The thesis empirically assesses these claims against the nature of the impact of trade liberalisation on: (i) the export structure of the OECS and (ii) its economic growth performance. Using a comparative analysis in a dichotomous framework of ten-years before and after the policy reforms we find that in general the predictions of the underlying neo-classical trade model are not supported by the empirical evidence. There were indications of structural changes in exports in terms of reduced specialisation and competitiveness of traditional sectors and a steady shift of the macro-economy away from commodity production both agriculture and manufacturing towards services. Meanwhile the evidence suggests a revenue-neutral fiscal impact and no indication of systematic increase in technology transfer over the post-reform period.Using alternative estimation specifications in a single or simultaneous framework with and without fixed effects in a panel data setting, trade liberalisation was repeatedly found to be negatively associated with growth. In contrast openness was found to be positively correlated with both growth and export performance. At best a J-curve type impact of trade reforms on economic growth is deduced suggesting a long period of adjustment. However prospects for sustained growth seem remote on current indications suggesting the need for a reform of the international trade rules to cater to the special needs of LDCs and SIDS. In this pursuit a plausible alternative approach to the mode of implementation of trade liberalisation in is presented.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intellectual capital reporting in New Zealand: refining content analysis as a research method</field><field name="creator">Steenkamp, Natasja</field><field name="description">This study examines voluntary intellectual capital reporting (ICR) in New Zealand firms' annual reports, with a view to contributing to understanding ICR practice. This study also reflects on content analysis with a view to refining the methodology when applied to investigating ICR.The literature includes widespread claims that intellectual capital (IC) resources are important value drivers and assets, and that IC information should be reported externally. However, complexities relating to identifying IC prevent it from being recognised as an asset under current accounting regulations. Consequently, the traditional financial reporting system is being criticised as out-of-date, giving deficient and irrelevant information, and having lost its value relevance. Numerous scholars have investigated voluntary ICR in several countries, but have presented different results and findings. The literature argues that the results of many ICR studies cannot be meaningfully compared because inconsistent data collection instruments have been applied. To advance ICR research, further refining and developing of the methodology is advocated; problems relating to applying methodological issues need to be resolved. Moreover, to establish consensus about ICR, more research and evidence is needed concerning exactly what and how IC is reported.The 2004 annual reports of the 30 largest (by market capitalisation) New Zealand firms listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange were analysed. Content analysis was applied to determine what and how IC is reported. Inferences about what IC is communicated were made based on an analysis of the content of texts and visual representations. To determine how IC is reported, voluntary reporting was categorised according to the form, nature and location of the disclosure. Frequencies of mention were recorded. Hence, each incidence of occurrence was coded and counted.This study reflected on content analysis methodology by searching the literature for guidance on how to apply this approach and how to deal with the challenges and problems it poses. The thesis discusses methodological issues that could be applied differently, and hence hinder the replicability and comparability of ICR studies. Moreover, the ICR literature provided limited guidance about how to deal with methodological challenges and problems, and revealed an absence of explicit recording instructions. Therefore, explicating this study's recording instructions should enhance replicability and comparability of future ICR research and hence further refine the methodology.Some results of this content analysis study disconfirm those of prior research: New Zealand firms show high levels of ICR, the most reported IC category is human capital, and the most reported IC item is employees. In line with prior research, this study showed that most ICR is presented in declarative terms. Moreover, more than one-third of New Zealand firms' ICR is disclosed as pictures. This indicates the importance of pictorial information as a means of reporting IC and the need to include graphics when conducting ICR research. This study's findings also indicate a narrative approach, similar to the European notion of story telling, to voluntarily report IC information. This approach suggests that narratives have possible potential for voluntary ICR, as an approach that departs from a measurement and quantification approach.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual capital reporting</field><field name="subject">ICR studies</field><field name="subject">Voluntary reporting</field><field name="subject">Accounting regulations - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Content analysis methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transport-related physical activity, health outcomes, and urban design: descriptive evidence</field><field name="creator">Badland, Hannah M</field><field name="description">Environments that support physical activity (PA) engagement are now seen as an important part of the solution for accumulating daily physical activity which confers health benefits, particularly transport-related PA (TPA). Despite this recognition, understanding the determinants of health-related PA has traditionally focused on identifying associations between the social environment and non-specific PA domains. As such, prior to commencing this thesis little was known about the relationships between the built environment and overall PA engagement within the New Zealand context. Little was also known about associations between TPA attitudes and behaviours, and urban design. This research sought to overcome this paucity of knowledge by investigating associations between overall PA and TPA engagement and perceptions, health outcomes, urban design, and socio-demographic variables from a public health perspective. The body of research was initiated with two literature reviews that formed the context for the following six empirical chapters. Data in the empirical chapters were drawn from three self-report surveys using adult samples. The research commenced by examining associations between urban design and overall PA engagement, and then narrowed towards TPA-specific relationships. TPA relationships were identified through the development and implementation of a reliable survey that captured associated behaviours and attitudes. Several new findings were drawn from this body of work. Overall, 21% of adults recognised they could replace automobile journeys on at least two days per week, and walking was deemed an acceptable travel alternative. Adult TPA engagement levels were low; 7% commuted to place of work/study and 32% travelled to the convenience shop by TPA modes. Furthermore, when compared with those who commuted to an occupation by TPA, respondents who used motorised travel were less likely to be classified as active (odds ratio (OR)=0.5) and be of normal body mass index (OR=0.5). No significant health relationships existed for convenience shop travel. As well, 4% of adults reported no automobile availability. When this group was compared with those with unrestricted automobile availability, they were less likely to be classified as active (OR=0.3), but were more likely to engage in TPA modes to access destinations (occupation, OR=6.3; convenience shop, OR=9.8). Occupation-related commute distances also revealed interesting findings. Overall, 50% of respondents perceived they could, and 10% of the sample actually did, commute by TPA modes for distances less than five kilometres, and relationships were strongly mediated by distance. Other urban design variables were objectively assessed with TPA engagement for occupation-related commute distances less than five kilometres. Those who travelled along the most connected street networks were more likely to engage in TPA modes (OR=6.9) when compared with respondents travelling along the least connected networks. No relationships were found with other urban design variables and TPA engagement.This research substantially contributes to this research area by identifying associations between overall PA and TPA engagement and perceptions with urban design. It is likely that shifting the perceptions of adults who recognise they can employ TPA modes, into actual TPA engagement will result in promising population health gains. Future PA initiatives with adults should consider promoting walking for transport as a sustainable solution. A lack of TPA interventions is evident; however, methodological issues need to be resolved before developing such initiatives. Although strategies aimed towards changing perceptions may be valuable for future TPA interventions, it is likely macro-scale urban design modifications (e.g., improved job-housing balance, highly-grained street networks) and legislation (e.g., automobile restrictions) will have the greatest success for increasing TPA engagement in the adult population.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">adults</field><field name="subject">built environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family factors in bilingual children's code-switching and language maintenance: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">Yu, Shanjiang</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to investigate family factors in relation to young Chinese immigrants' code-switching and language maintenance. Specific attention is given to children's code-switching behaviour and how parents respond and the effect of parental response upon children's language choice in any subsequent utterance. Attempts are also made to identify the family factors that might have an effect on making language choice. Data were collected monthly through naturalistic tape-recording of families' conversations for one calendar year. Recordings of every other month were transcribed and coded for analysis. A questionnaire was used with the children's parents to obtain general family background information as well as to compare the parents' language beliefs and their actual language behaviour in real life.Results indicated that within an average of 28.1 months of stay in New Zealand, the use of Mandarin Chinese, their ethnic language, was dramatically reduced. In typical family conversations, the parents were using Mandarin Chinese in only 75.6% of their conversational turns and that figure for the children was 65.1%. If the amount of mother tongue use at home is an indicator, then the speed of shift in these families investigated appears to be relatively fast. Few parents, however, felt that their children were using too much English or ever attempted to stop them doing this, despite the fact that all the parents claimed that they very much wanted their children to maintain the ethnic language and were fully aware of the importance of their role as the main input source of their ethnic language. This seems to suggest that the marketplace value of the mainstream language is overtaking the core value of their ethnic language.Results also showed that parental use of English caused a substantially increased use of English from their children. There tended to be an "upgrading" towards English in the children's language choice suggesting that code-switching could be a temporary stage for the children along the gradual process of language shift. On the other hand, the parents were also found using more English after their children's code-switching. One of the reasons for this might be that the parents want to improve their English and regard their children as an ideal person to practise English with.With regard to daily communication functions, results showed that children often resorted to English for daily speech acts indicating that language function replacement has occurred for many daily communicative functions resulting from a gradually reduced use of the ethnic language.Many family factors were found to be affecting language use in the families: the presence of grandparents and the decision to return to their birth country for residence in the future were clearly correlated with increased use of the ethnic language; the parents' level of English language, on the other hand, was found to be related to the amount of English used, though with exceptions.These results strongly suggest that English is taking over the family domains that used to belong to the ethnic language. Parents who want their children to maintain their ethnic language need to put daily effort into action. Without painstaking daily effort, language shift will and probably is happening no matter how strong their theoretical beliefs might be.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language maintenance</field><field name="subject">Chinese language</field><field name="subject">Bilingualism in children</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Foreign Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of simulated altitude exposure on sea level performance</field><field name="creator">Hinckson, Erica</field><field name="description">Exposure to natural altitude using the "live high-train low" method improves athletic endurance performance at sea level by 1-2%. This method can also be employed with hypoxic devices that simulate altitude, but there is limited and conflicting research on their efficacy. Consequently, three studies were undertaken to investigate changes in sea level performance of endurance runners following exposure to altitude simulated with hypoxic tents. The device was chosen because of its potential for incorporation into the athlete's routine. In Study 1, 10 runners received altitude simulated with hypoxic tents (~9 h overnight at 2500-3500 m) and trained at sea level, while 10 runners in the control group performed usual training. Athletes in both groups performed a lactate-threshold test, but only the altitude group performed a run to exhaustion. The effect on  4-mM lactate speed was unclear, owing to poor reliability of this measure. There was a 16% increase in time to exhaustion in the hypoxic conditioning group, equivalent to a 1.9% (90% likely limits, &#177;1.4%) increase in speed in a time trial. Effects on performance were not apparent four and eight weeks after use of the tents. To improve precision of the effect of the tents and to determine the effects on performance of different durations, a further controlled trial was performed. A reliability study (Study 2) was first conducted to investigate the potential for runs to exhaustion to provide reliable measures of performance. Eight runners performed a test consisting of three runs to exhaustion lasting ~2, ~4 and ~8 min on six occasions over 14 wk. The critical power and log-log models were used to provide factors for converting variability in time to exhaustion into variability in equivalent time-trial time. Variabilities in time to exhaustion expressed as coefficients of variation for predicted 800-3000 m timetrial times were ~1-3%. A crossover study (Study 3) was then conducted in which 11 athletes performed usual (control) training and usual training with altitude exposure by using tents for 25 &#177; 3 days (mean &#177; SD) for 8.1 &#177; 0.6 h.d-1, progressing from a simulated altitude of 2500 m to 3500 m above sea level. Washout period between control and altitude treatments was four weeks. Performance was assessed with treadmill runs to exhaustion as in Study 2. Improvements in mean predicted times (altitude-control) for standard competition distances of 800, 1500 and 3000 m derived from the runs to exhaustion were 1.0% (&#177;1.3%), 1.4% (&#177;1.2%) and 1.9% (&#177;1.5%) respectively. There was some evidence that hypoxic exposure favoured those athletes carrying the I allele for angiotensin converting enzyme. In summary, the main finding from the series of studies is that hypoxic tents are likely to enhance sea level endurance running performance by ~1-2%.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Altitude, Influence of</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethical issues and workplace problems in commercial hospitality: a New Zealand study</field><field name="creator">Poulston, Jill Mabel</field><field name="description">This study explores a world of pretence and glamour, uncovering and explaining the causes of workplace problems and dubious practices lying behind the cheerful facade of commercial hospitality. Such an exploration necessarily extends into unethical, unsafe and unfair practices, eight of which are selected for detailed analysis. These are: working in smoke, sexual harassment, constructive dismissal, staffing levels, training, illegal alcohol service, poor food hygiene, and theft. Some of these problems or practices are deliberately destructive (and are therefore considered as ethical issues), some can cause harm (so are health and safety issues), and some concern the way staff are managed (and are therefore labour issues). The persistent focus however, is the avoidable harm and wrongdoing that can occur where groups of people are controlled by a few. Several themes are explored, in particular the causes of poor ethical standards and management's influence on these standards. The hypotheses address the behaviour of hospitality workers generally, but managers in particular, as they are ultimately responsible for workplace conduct, and are therefore best placed to make change. Ethical standards are investigated by measuring the actual and perceived incidence, tolerance and management acceptance of problems according to individuals' demographic attributes. The combination of quantitative and qualitative data enables a thorough and scientific analysis of practices in a domain well known for persistent social problems, with the specific intention of identifying causes, and therefore solutions. The following hypotheses are examined: H1) Unethical behaviour is common in hospitality; H2) Management is aware of unethical behaviour in hospitality; H3) Management actively or passively supports unethical behaviour in hospitality, and H4) Management's support is a cause of unethical behaviour. Although unethical practices are found to be common, many managers are unaware of this, while some are significant causes of sexual harassment, constructive dismissals and poor standards of training. Observations include the influence of codes of ethics on undesirable behaviours such as sexual harassment, the influence of social consensus on workplace behaviour, and the profound unhappiness of many hospitality employees. The causes of workplace problems and unethical behaviour are found to be low pay and poor training. A principle of reciprocated loyalty is proposed, based on the relationships identified between employer commitment and employee behaviour, and informed by mechanism theory, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This is the first major analysis of workplace issues in New Zealand hospitality, and offers solutions to problems such as theft, sexual harassment and understaffing, that significantly undermine the industry's credibility and potential for success.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate social responsibility in Islam</field><field name="creator">Mohammed, Jawed  A</field><field name="description">Notions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have been suggested to be consistent with an Islamic view of society. Indeed, values and principles that have been central to Islam since the time of the holy Prophet Mohammed (Peace and Blessings be upon him) may serve as a foundation for notions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) similar to those in the West. Much contemporary discussion of CSR, however, has not recognized this. These discussions have largely been based on a Western orientation informed by Western religious values. Moreover, CSR has evolved literally in response to particular issues or problems that are specific to businesses in a Western context. This led to a lack of a comprehensive global context within which a wider perspective of CSR should be positioned. On the other hand, the notion of social responsibility and justice has been an integral part of Islamic society for nearly 14 centuries. However, the Islamic literature remains scattered, fragmented and lacks a coherent framework that would allow such a concept in Islam to be systematized. While Islamic philosophy is rich in precepts pertinent to CSR, these precepts have not yet been formally synthesized to present a systematic model with an explicit notion of CSR in Islam. Thus, there exists a gap in both the Western and Islamic literature. This was fruitfully exploited in this study to advance the understanding of the concept of CSR in a wider cultural and religious setting. This study explored this new territory and presented a conceptual framework of CSR in Islam based on Shariah (the Islamic legal and social system) derived from the holy Qur'an and Hadith. It provided both, a counterpart and a comparable base in the study of various issues relevant to CSR and international business from a much wider global perspective. It also provided significant insights into Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh) regarding business practice. The consistency of the conceptual framework of CSR in Islam with contemporary business practices was explored using a survey of Islamic banks located in different parts of the world. The survey revealed that many current practices of Islamic banks mirror the expected behaviours or practices generated in the Islamic framework. In fact, it was possible to discern that the organizations surveyed implement the Islamic code of conduct rather extensively. Against this background, a consistency with the framework of CSR in Islam presented in this study was identified. Such consistency, however, was driven by legal requirements in adherence to Shariah rather than an explicit understanding or pursuit of CSR. The lack of a systematic framework with explicit notions of CSR from an Islamic perspective caused hindrance in implementing CSR practices in Islamic organizations. It follows that this study was a modest step towards filling this lacuna by presenting a systematic and coherent framework of CSR in Islam.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic ethics</field><field name="subject">Islamic banking</field><field name="subject">Empirical survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te hau ora o naga kaumatau o Tuhoe: a study of Tuhoe kaumatau mental wellness</field><field name="creator">McNeill, Hinematau</field><field name="description">Tuhoe is considered to be one of the last bastions of 'traditional' Maori language and culture. The main purpose of the research was to examine the mental health status of Tuhoe kaumatua (elderly). Even before the research was undertaken anecdotal evidence indicated that a significant feature of the Tuhoe aging population was the apparent absence of mental health problems. Kaumatua are however particularly susceptible to physical diseases that afflict modern Maori, regardless of geography or tribal origin. To explore the health status of Tuhoe kaumatua, the study needed to take into account external cultural influences and, in particular, the colonial experience. This justifies a comprehensive theoretical approach that includes European philosophical influences which, it will be argued, have impacted on Maori lifeways.  Notwithstanding, the study draws principally on Maori conceptualisations of the world, mainly because kaumatua mental wellness was considered to be inextricable to Tuhoe language and culture. The research attempted to isolate those factors that sustain kaumatua mental wellness. In determining the causal factors of wellness it soon became apparent that the practice of traditional Maori healing, embedded in ancient esoteric knowledge, was of considerable significance. This feature is apparent from the outset. The opening karakia of the Tuhoe tohunga (specialist/healer), Hohepa Kereopa invokes ancient Maori atua (Gods) and endows the work with an aura of spiritual protection. He has stipulated that both the karakia (prayer) and mihi (greeting) remain in Maori (Tuhoe dialect) because he believes that the essence of these rituals are best preserved in the Maori language.  Throughout this entire body of work Hohepa Kereopa maintains a discernible and enduring presence.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Tuhoe (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kupu</field><field name="subject">Kaumatua</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accruals: signalling or misleading? Evidence from New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Koerniadi, Hardjo</field><field name="description">Studies on earnings management usually hypothesise that managers manage accruals opportunistically. Few studies however, argue that managers can also use accruals to improve the value relevance of reported earnings to help investors better assess the firm's operating performance. While substantial evidence on managers' opportunistic behaviour on accruals has been documented in the literature, empirical evidence on the informativeness of accruals is scarce and inconclusive. The purpose of this thesis is to examine whether managers use accruals to communicate private information regarding the firm's operating performance, or as reported in the literature, use them for their own benefit.  This thesis finds that on average, firms reporting high earnings accompanied by high accruals have significantly negative subsequent period stock returns suggesting that these firms manage their accounting earnings. Focusing on stock dividend issues as an incentive to opportunistically increase accruals, the results are found to be consistent with the earnings management hypothesis. Stock dividend issuing firms are reported to significantly increase accruals in the issue year followed by poor earnings and stock price performances in the subsequent year. Moreover, discretionary accruals of the issuing firms are negatively correlated with both future earnings and abnormal stock returns. This evidence attempts to complement the earnings management literature. The analysis on the incentive to decrease accruals related to share repurchases, however, does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that managers use their discretion to decrease accruals. To investigate the hypothesis that managers use accruals to convey information regarding their firm's future profitability, this thesis employs the contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements as the research setting. This choice was made to increase the likelihood of detecting the use of accruals as private information communication while simultaneously mitigating the likelihood of the opportunistic income smoothing hypothesis to explain the results. The evidence strongly indicates that managers use both accruals and dividend increases as their private information communication regarding their firm's future profitability. Dividend increasing firms report positive accruals which are positively correlated with future profitability. This finding contributes to the literature by providing evidence on the accrual signalling hypothesis. Overall, the results of this thesis suggest that, depending on the incentives, managers can use the discretion accorded under the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in estimating accounting accrual, either to manage accruals opportunistically or to help investors better assess the firms' operating performance.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accruals</field><field name="subject">Earnings management</field><field name="subject">Signalling</field><field name="subject">Business finance</field><field name="subject">Market performance</field><field name="subject">Cross sectional Jones model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The philosophy and practice of holistic health care</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Deborah Ann</field><field name="description">For almost three decades 'holistic health care' has been a widely invoked term. It is called upon as an antidote to mechanistic science, as justification for the use of alternative therapies, as instruction to good practice and even as a boundary marker in establishing professional identity. In the service of these intentions it has assumed various meanings. The first aim of this study is to identify from the literature, the illusion of shared meaning that saturates this term and to expose the implications of this lack of clarity. The elusive nature of the meanings attributed to holism and the problem of determining an appropriate method of pursuing these meanings is addressed. A particular understanding of conceptual analysis and practical reasoning are defended as adequate tools. The group of ideas from which the term holism can be distinguished, individualism, dualism and reductionism, form the context of the examination of understandings of wholeness. Eight distinctions of wholeness are examined and the common conceptual feature of 'purpose' is suggested. This requires considerable justification which is provided by an exploration of the notion of 'partness'. Recourse to the seminal work of Smuts (1926) is sought and the derivation of the idea of holism from evolution theory is explored. A key understanding explored is the nature of emergent properties and their role in the holistic doctrine, 'the whole is more than the sum of the parts'. Employment of the word holism in social science, philosophy, and biology is examined and a number of fallacies about holism exposed. With a somewhat clearer understanding of holism, and a working notion of wholeness, theories of health are discussed as contenders for a philosophical basis for 'holistic health care'. While several show some congruence, it is argued that the Foundations Theory of Health can be shown to demonstrate the characteristics of work for wholeness identified in this work. The conclusion that holistic health care is in essence working creatively with incipient wholes, is explained and justified by a discussion about how a health worker might become more holistic in her practice.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holistic medicine</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inclusive education a decade after democratisation: the educational needs of children with disabilities in KwaZulu-Natal</field><field name="creator">Maher, Marguerite</field><field name="description">Commitment to a single, inclusive education system has been the aspiration of reform in education in a democratic South Africa. The dilemma facing the democratically elected government was to write educational policy which, when translated into practice, would improve the educational standards offered to students in impoverished schools while at the same time allow the maintenance of the high standards achieved in schools which had been privileged under the apartheid system. There was, furthermore, the challenge of providing a curriculum that would be meaningful to students from diverse backgrounds bearing in mind the socio-historical moment within which education found itself.Research on inclusive education in the developed world has been extensive. There has been less research completed in developing world countries. Situated in the Pietermaritzburg area of KwaZulu&#8208;Natal (KZN), South Africa, a developing world country, participants in the current study were parents of children with disabilities, aide workers, regular and special educators, managers who made decisions affecting the education of these children, and the children themselves. The research is positioned in the theory of interpretivism which provided the opportunity to give a voice to the participants, to interpret how they made sense of their world. The methodology used was qualitative description with an evaluation component. Qualitative description allowed the discovery and understanding of "a phenomenon, a process, or the perspectives and worldviews of the people involved" (Merriam, 1998, p. 11). Data are presented so that the participants' point of view could be understood and made explicit (Artinian, 1988). Using qualitative description, this current study explored the beliefs about disability and inclusive education specifically of stakeholders in the education of disabled children. The evaluation component provided the means of ascertaining the extent to which disabled students were having their educational needs met, and the extent to which the policy ideals of inclusive education, as articulated in White Paper 6 (Department of Education, 2001), were being achieved.Inclusive education in this present study is viewed as a multifaceted construct which shares a reciprocal relationship with various theoretical determinants. The determinants considered in the present study are (a) concept of other, (b) disability discourse, (c) equity, (d) reconceptualist/incrementalist approaches to inclusive education, and (e) prerequisites for regular and special educator buy-in.Findings revealed that there was evidence of inclusive education beginning to be implemented in KZN in that barriers to learning for many students were being addressed and removed. The specific provision in policy documents directed towards children with disabilities was behind schedule, however, and there was little evidence of full inclusion of students with disabilities in regular education. Reasons for this were multiple and were explored in relation to criteria at a macro- and micro-level, distilled from the literature, which seem to be necessary for the successful inclusion of students with disabilities.The most significant macro-level factors were (i) the legacy of apartheid and the democratic process, moving towards a liberal democracy, still being in progress; (ii) the discourse around disability espoused by the majority of the population resulting in high levels of ostracism of the disabled; and (iii) the disabled becoming lost in the wide definition of need in the barriers to learning approach to inclusive education.The most significant micro-level factors were (i) regular educators being reluctant to embrace the inclusive education initiative because of problems they had encountered with another recent initiative, the implementation of Outcomes Based Education; (ii) special educators fearing for their students if they were to be included without the requisite preparation and support; and (iii) some parents lacking the efficacy to access education of any sort for their disabled children.These macro- and micro-level findings exist within a multifaceted array of factors, an intricate web of nuances and complexity.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inclusive education</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">Democratisation</field><field name="subject">Disability discourse</field><field name="subject">Interpretive paradigm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between objects and identity in occupational therapy: a dynamic balance of rationalism and romanticism</field><field name="creator">Hocking, Clare</field><field name="description">This thesis uncovers the rational and Romantic assumptions about the relationship between objects and identity that are embedded in occupational therapy, and critiques current practice from that perspective. It is based on an initial assumption that there is in fact a relationship between people's identity and the objects they make, have, use and are associated with. This assumption is explored through an interpretive examination of the fields of literature that are commonly identified as informing occupational therapy, supplemented by selected popular literature. The exploration takes a philosophical approach, guided by notions from philosophical hermeneutics, including pre-understandings, the hermeneutic circle and fusion of horizons. The conclusion reached is that people informed by Western philosophies interpret the identity meanings of objects in both rational and Romantic ways. To inform the study, the nature of rationalism and Romanticism are then explained, and the implications of these philosophical traditions in relation to objects and identity are teased out. This interpretation is guided by a history of ideas methodology, which entails approaching historical texts from a new perspective, in this case the identity meanings of objects. Thus informed, occupational therapy literature, primarily that published in Britain between 1938 and 1962 is examined from the perspective of objects and identity. What is revealed is that rational and Romantic understandings of objects, and of patients' and their own identity are clearly discernible. Such understandings afforded early occupational therapists both ways to organise their growing knowledge of the therapeutic application of crafts and the transformative outcomes of occupational therapy intervention. Gradually however, factors both internal and external to the profession served to undermine therapists' Romanticism. Primary amongst these were World War II, which saw a redeployment of occupational therapists from mental health to physical rehabilitation settings; advances in rehabilitative medicine, which brought a reduction in secondary complications and the adoption of teamwork; and the development of new practice areas including domestic rehabilitation using gadgets to enhance function and pre-vocational rehabilitation. As a result, tensions between rational and Romantic understandings crystallised around two long-standing controversies. These were whether or not craft equipment such as weaving looms should be adapted to serve specific remedial purposes, and whether it was the process of making a crafted object or the quality of the finished product that was more important. In the event, these contested ideologies became largely irrelevant as craftwork was sidelined from mainstream practice. With it, occupational therapists' Romantic vision of transforming people's lives through creative activity also slipped away. Several reasons for this loss of one of the profession's founding philosophies are proposed. They include the substantial absence of the professions' philosophical foundations from its education, and the paucity of theory and research methodologies that might have informed the nature and process of transformative change that earlier occupational therapists had observed and reported. The thesis concludes by arguing for the importance of recovering a balance between rationalism and Romanticism. A call to action is issued, addressing change in educational practice, concerted research effort to identify and articulate transformative processes within occupational therapy, and political action focusing on the inclusion of Romantic perspectives within policy and strategic documents.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Identity (Philosophical concept)</field><field name="subject">Rationalism</field><field name="subject">Romanticism</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Somatic and cognitive stress management techniques: their effect on measures of stress and competency in managers</field><field name="creator">Le Fevre, Mark</field><field name="description">Stress management interventions (SMIs) are increasingly used by organisations across both private and public settings. Such interventions are employed with the expectation that they will be effective in reducing levels of stress in participants and in turn, will provide a return to the organisation by way of increased productivity through performance improvements of those employees whose stress has been reduced. Despite the increasing popularity of SMIs, there exists a lack of evidence on whether they have any effect on the performance of users, and on the relative effectiveness of the components that often make up SMIs. Although the literature addressing SMIs and their effects is increasing, relatively few studies directly compare different techniques, and even fewer employ randomised controlled designs or follow-up measures. The assumed relationship between the reduction of stress and improvement of managerial performance does not appear to have been tested with a randomised controlled trial. The term &#8220;stress&#8221; as used in this study specifically denotes the concept of &#8220;distress&#8221; as defined by Selye (1956; 1987).  To support this use of the term, the evolution of current terminology in the field of occupational stress is briefly discussed with specific reference to the development and influence in the wider literature of the Yerkes Dodson Law (Yerkes, 1909). The aims of this thesis were to (1) compare the relative effectiveness of two component techniques often used in SMIs (somatic and cognitive techniques) in the reduction of stress, and (2) to examine the effect of the use of these techniques on the performance of managers in their workplace. Study One was a randomised controlled trial assessing the effect of the use of somatic and cognitive stress management interventions on stress and performance in managers. Participants were 112 corporate managers who were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups (somatic or cognitive technique training) or to a wait list control group. The intervention groups were trained in their respective techniques over a 4 week period in brief (20-30 minute) face-to-face workshop sessions. Participants were provided with recordings of the techniques to assist practice between training sessions. At baseline, stress was assessed using the Occupational Stress Inventory &#8211; Revised Edition (OSI-R, Osipow, 1998), and managerial performance was assessed with the Personal Qualities Competency from the Inventory of Management Competencies (IMC, Saville Holdsworth Ltd., 1993). In the case of the IMC, self, colleague, and subordinate assessments were used. On completion of the 4 week intervention, the OSI-R was readministered, and then at week 12 and week 24, follow-up assessments of stress and managerial performance took place. At the week 12 follow-up, MANOVA for the OSI-R showed no significant difference between the somatic and cognitive interventions in their effect on stress, although both interventions did reduce stress relative to the wait list control group, as measured by the OSI-R. A significant intervention effect was also shown (&#951;p2  =  0.089, p =  0.002) for the combined intervention groups (cognitive and somatic). MANOVA for the Personal Qualities Competency showed a significant intervention effect for the self (&#951;p2  =  0.077, p  =  0.008) and colleague (&#951;p2  =  0.064, p  = 0.013) assessments, and a no significant effect (&#951;p2  =  0.032, p  =  0.063) for the subordinate assessment at the week 12 follow-up point. Unfortunately, withdrawal and attrition reduced the sample size below that required for analysis at the week 24 follow-up point. Study Two was designed as a follow-up qualitative study that aimed to gather information on participants&#8217; perceptions of the effects of the interventions on their stress and performance, and of their reasons for completion or no completion of the SMI. In this study, 14 participants from Study One took part in semi-structured interviews after the final follow-up assessment (week 24) for that study. The interviews were structured to elicit responses concerning participants&#8217; perceptions of the demands of their workplace and their stress, their experience of using the stress management techniques (including perceived benefits or behavioural changes from that use), their reasons for completion or no completion of the intervention, and their own definitions of stress. Several important findings emerged from this study. First, participants described their workplace as characterised by high pressure and demand with rapid change and a perceived lack of personal control. Second, participants who continued to use the techniques they had learned after the formal intervention was completed did so because they perceived personal benefits in terms of their ability to relax and in terms of their perceptions of workload and demand. For those who did not complete the intervention, the predominant reasons reported for no completion were workplace task demands, lack of top management commitment to an intervention of this nature, and lack of personal gain once the techniques had been learned. In relation to defining stress, participants did not have agreement, but rather reported definitions reflecting a multifaceted complex amalgam of physiological, psychological, and emotional aspects. Research such as this is important in terms of its contribution to the general field of occupational stress and its alleviation. It addresses a long-standing need to assess the relative effectiveness of some of the subcomponents commonly employed as part of more complex multifaceted approaches to SMIs, and the effect of the techniques on both stress and performance. This thesis makes several contributions to existing knowledge. First, this thesis clarifies the origin of the Yerkes Dodson Law and its relevance to current stress management thinking. In management texts distress has come to be regarded as too much stress or pressure. This is coupled with the idea that some stress has a positive impact on performance due to an earlier and erroneous interpretation of the Yerkes Dodson Law. Second, Study One provides evidence of the relative effectiveness of two different SMI components in the reduction of individuals&#8217; occupational stress, as well as evidence for the effectiveness of individual focussed SMIs in the reduction of stress in corporate managers. Third, Study One provides evidence for a positive effect on managers&#8217; performance consequent to their use of stress management techniques. This thesis also sheds light on managers&#8217; definitions of stress, and their reasons for completion or no completion of SMIs. In summary, individual focussed (or secondary) SMIs have the potential to reduce stress and to improve performance in corporate managers as perceived by both the individual and others in the workplace.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Occupational stress</field><field name="subject">Management performance</field><field name="subject">Stress management</field><field name="subject">Randomised controlled trial</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Board characteristics and firm performance: evidence from New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bathula, Hanoku</field><field name="description">Due to various corporate scandals and failures, there has been a renewed interest on the role of boards in the performance of firms.  This thesis examines the relationship between the key board characteristics and firm performance.  Unlike most studies on boards which predominantly use only financial variables affecting governance, I take a different approach by combining them with non-financial variables.  This combined set of variables is used for theoretical and empirical modelling. Based on the extant literature, I develop a conceptual framework and a set of hypotheses to examine the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance.  Board characteristics considered in this research include board size, director ownership, CEO duality, gender diversity, educational qualification of board members and number of board meetings.  Additionally, I use board size as a moderating variable to examine how the effect of other board characteristics is contingent on board size.  Firm performance is measured by return on assets. I test my hypotheses on a longitudinal sample of 156 firms over a four year period from 2004 to 2007.  My sample includes all firms listed on New Zealand stock exchange as on November 2007.  Empirical analysis is undertaken using Generalised Least Squares analyses. The findings of the study show that board characteristics such as board size, CEO duality and gender diversity were positively related with firm performance, where as director ownership, board meetings and the number of board members with PhD level education was found to be negatively related.  Board size was found to be moderating some of these relationships, indicating the critical role being played by board size in the design and role of corporate boards.  The findings also provide partial evidence to different governance theories, further indicating the need for theoretical pluralism to gain insights into boards&#8217; functioning. The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link by examining both the traditional variables such as board size, CEO duality, and number of board meetings as well as other organisational attributes such as gender diversity and competence variables represented by women and PhD holders, respectively.  The theoretical framework and the findings of my thesis are expected to stimulate scholars for further research to identify the contingency conditions upon which the board characteristics and firm performance may be dependent.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate boards</field><field name="subject">Board characteristics and meetings</field><field name="subject">Top management teams</field><field name="subject">CEO duality</field><field name="subject">Women on boards</field><field name="subject">Director ownership</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying sustainability for industry: a New Zealand electricity power sector case study</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Bernard Cho Ming</field><field name="description">Sustainable development is now being recognised as a vital component of our society in the environmental, ethical, social, technological, economic, and institutional aspects, or dimensions, so, this thesis develops a framework to quantitatively measure sustainability. This thesis is distinctive in that it focuses on quantitative methods encapsulated in a formal assessment procedure and includes sustainability concepts that have rarely been put into practical use in sustainability reports.  The framework is designed along the strategy that the methodology needs to be scale invariant and recursive, meaning the procedure is the same irrespective of the scale the user is interested in, and that different people can focus at different levels of sustainability by following a similar procedure. While the quantification process is aimed to be as unbiased as possible, a configuration of the tools from Total Quality Management (TQM) is adapted to identify sustainability indicators which are then mapped onto a scalar with mathematical functions. The sustainability indices are presented according to the amount of details needed by different users &#9472; some may need just one overall figure while others may need sustainability indices broken down by the six sustainability dimensions and presented on a spider diagram, while others may need all the details for analysis. This methodology also caters for sustainability analysis by different stakeholders. To fully demonstrate the potential of the methodology, the author has chosen to test it on a large-size industry sector so that it can have the capacity to be scaled up to a country or down to a small business, and on an industry sector that is important on its own right. Furthermore, this sector needs to be illustrative and has nontrivial complex problems. Under these criteria, the electricity sector of New Zealand was selected. The robustness of the methodology was investigated with inputs from three evaluators with different views: a standard view from the author that was made after much research in the sector and in the concepts of sustainability, a view with an environmental bias and one that focuses on commercial interests.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">Electricity sector</field><field name="subject">Sustainability index</field><field name="subject">Sustainability indicators</field><field name="subject">Quantify sustainability</field><field name="subject">Electricity spot price</field><field name="subject">Chaos</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-stakeholder organising for sustainability</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Aarti</field><field name="description">Multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaborations have been considered as &#8216;panacea&#8217; for complex local to global problems confronting governments, businesses and society. And for over a decade now, they have also been increasingly promoted as mechanisms to achieve sustainability. There is, however, a dearth of empirical studies that give deeper insights into the practical dimensions and various implications of such processes for sustainability. This dissertation explores how multi-stakeholder organising processes for sustainability occur in local settings. It relies on a theoretical framework that combines institutional and social movements theoretical perspectives. Such a theoretical cross-fertilisation has been helpful in explaining: (a) how the macro institutional context of sustainable development influences micro interactions of individuals during collaborations; and (b) how those micro interactions may influence the sustainability movement organised at macro societal levels. The dissertation is philosophically based on the principles of critical hermeneutics. It draws on the works of Hans-Georg Gadamer and J&#252;rgen Habermas to understand the nature of reality, society and human relationships. The study also uses literature on sustainable development, organising, dialogue, collaboration, stakeholder engagement, emotions and time. Three cases of multi-stakeholder dialogic collaborations organised to address sustainability of two regions in New Zealand were investigated through observations, interviews with participants and documentary research. These processes were developed in response to a regulatory change in New Zealand &#8211; the new Local Government Act (2002) which emphasises sustainable development of communities. The data across the three cases was analysed using principles of grounded theory and critical hermeneutics. Analysis reveals how various kinds of institutional pressures (engulfing cultural-cognitive, regulative and normative institutions connected with sustainable development) confront different stakeholders with varying intensities. Those pressures influence stakeholders to become involved in and commit to such collaborations. And as stakeholders participate in such processes, they are shown to engage with one another rationally and emotionally, and with different conceptions of time. The collaborations thus can be characterised by a complex fusion of rationality, emotionality and temporality. On the one hand, multi-stakeholder dialogic collaborations stimulate learning, facilitate relationship building and build social capital for implementing sustainable development. They thus prove themselves as potent governance mechanisms that can help to institutionalise sustainable development. On the other hand, multi-stakeholder dialogic collaborations for sustainability are highly messy, unpredictable, paradoxical and conflict-ridden processes of stakeholder engagement. They are shown to suffer from three major problematics: problematic of misunderstandings; problematic of stakeholders&#8217; emotions; and problematic of stakeholders&#8217; time. They thus, ironically and paradoxically, are also problematic solutions for sustainability.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stakeholder theory</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Dialogue</field><field name="subject">Institutional change</field><field name="subject">Critical hermeneutics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving spiking neural networks for adaptive audiovisual pattern recognition</field><field name="creator">Wysoski, Simei Gomes</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents new modular and integrative information methods and systems inspired by the way the brain performs information processing, in particular, pattern recognition. The proposed artificial systems use spiking neurons as basic elements, which are the key components of spiking neural networks. Of particular interest to this research are various spiking neural network architectures and learning procedures that permit different pattern recognition problems to be solved in an evolvable and adaptive way. Spiking neural networks are used to model human visual and auditory pathways and are trained to perform the specific task of person authentication. The systems are individually tuned and trained to recognize facial information and to analyze sound signals from spoken sentences. The modelling of the integration of different sources of information (multisensory integration) using spiking neural networks is also a subject of investigation. A network architecture is proposed and a model for audiovisual pattern recognition is designed as an example. The main original contributions of this thesis are: a) Evaluation and further extension of adaptive learning procedures to perform visual pattern recognition. A new learning procedure that enables the system to change its structure, creating/merging neuronal maps of spiking neurons is presented and evaluated on a face recognition problem. b) Design of two new spiking neural network architectures to perform person authentication through the processing of speech signals. c) Design and evaluation of a new architecture that integrates sensory modalities based on spiking neurons. The integrative architecture combines opinions from individual modalities within a supramodal layer, which contains neurons sensitive to multiple sensory information. An additional feature that increases biological relevance is the crossmodal coupling of modalities, which effectively enables a given sensory modality to exert direct influence upon the processing areas typically related to other modalities. The contributions were published in one journal paper and in four refereed international conference proceedings. The proposed system designs were implemented and, through computer simulations, demonstrated comparable performance with traditional benchmarking methods. The systems have some promising features: they can be naturally optimized in respect to different criteria: accuracy (when very accurate results are expected), energy efficiency (when management of resources play an important role), and speed (when a decision needs to be made within a limited time). In this thesis, most of the parameters have been exhaustively optimized by hand or by using simple heuristics. As a direction for future work, there is an opportunity to include automated, specially tailored parameters optimization procedures or even general-purpose optimization algorithms, e.g., Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization. Overall, the results obtained in this thesis clearly indicate that it is indeed possible to have fast and accurate adaptive pattern recognition systems scalable for multiple modalities computing with simple models of spiking neurons. However, it is important to advance the theory of spiking neurons to take advantage of its biological relevance to reach similar or better performance when compared to the human brain, for instance, exploring new neuron models, information coding schemes and network connectivity.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Visual pattern recognition</field><field name="subject">Auditory pattern recognition</field><field name="subject">Experimentation and quantitative evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ashes without reserve</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Maria Th&#233;r&#232;se</field><field name="description">This thesis is centrally concerned with the texts of Jacques Derrida that have addressed directly the theme of sexual difference. Yet to say the thesis is centrally concerned with a philosophy that positions itself clearly as one that deconstructs centrality and its trajectory of return, is to face the crisis or chiasmus of my concern. The thesis is not returned to Derrida. If the question of feminism for Derrida is a question from the margins, from interruptions, of the trace and of la cendre, ashes, the question of sexual difference is primordially and originarily that of the undecidability of the name, signatory, and textual border. She would not have appeared here. Therefore she cannot return. There are two frames to this research that can be recognized in the chapter sequence of the thesis. Initially I develop a preparatory engagement to a questioning of the ontology of sexual difference, with Chapters 2 and 3, with a questioning that broaches the metaphysics of the feminine with respect to the texts of Derrida, Heidegger and Cixous in particular and further engages with &#201;criture F&#233;minine, Levinas and feminist responses to Heidegger and Levinas. However, this broader questioning is undertaken in order to develop a sharper focus on the writings of Derrida that address Heidegger&#8217;s ontological difference, Levinas&#8217;s ethics before being, and a more originary questioning of sexual difference. The second frame and predominant focus of the thesis is on Derrida&#8217;s approach to the metaphysics of the feminine with four pivotal texts by Derrida from the late 1970s and early 1980s examined in Chapters 4 to 7. Each addresses a questioning of difference and the metaphysical tradition, under difference&#8217;s many names: ontological difference, sexual difference, diff&#233;rance, and engages deconstruction&#8217;s encounters with Nietzsche &amp; Heidegger (Spurs); the psychoanalysts Abraham &amp; Torok (&#8220;Fors&#8221;); Levinas (&#8220;At This Very Moment in This Work Here I Am&#8221;) and Hegel (Glas). In bringing together these four texts, my aim is to emphasize the significance of a double deconstructive movement of transgression and restoration, as this research&#8217;s politico-ethical acts of writing and reading for an otherwise discourse on sexual difference. This otherwise discourse has always already been produced with phallogocentrism and remains critical for the inventing of thresholds across philosophy, literature and their others. The ashen Preface enkindles a paradigmatic figure as deconstructive trace of sexual difference in writing and reading practices. A Postscript questions the binding to institutional laws constitutive of disciplinary practice while the fiery trace in Derrida&#8217;s writing on Kafka&#8217;s law concludes on the ash-laden edges of Blanchot&#8217;s unavowable work.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deconstruction</field><field name="subject">Jacques Derrida</field><field name="subject">Sexual difference</field><field name="subject">Politico-ethical poetics</field><field name="subject">&#201;criture F&#233;minine</field><field name="subject">Diff&#233;rance difference</field><field name="subject">Grammatology</field><field name="subject">General economy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetics and kinematics of strength and power development</field><field name="creator">Harris, Nigel</field><field name="description">The use of the squat exercise (and its derivatives) in gym-based settings is widespread owing to perceived functional performance enhancing effects.  In particular, there has been preponderance amongst practitioners with loads that maximise power outputs (Pmax) based on a perception that mechanical peak power is directly related to explosive functional performance such as sprinting ability.  The optimal muscular quality associated with squats remains elusive though, mostly due to methodological limitations in the research.  The four experimental studies in this thesis sought to quantify the kinetic and kinematic outputs of a machine squat-jump and their relationship to sprinting ability, both descriptively and across a training period.  First, an analysis of the kinetic and kinematic outputs of a machine squat-jump across a spectrum of loads was performed, with an emphasis on power output.  Then, the relationship of these outputs with sprint ability was investigated.  Correlations do not imply cause and effect, thus a training intervention was undertaken to quantify the relationships of the change in performance measures over time, and allow a comparison of different training protocols.  Specifically, one training group was prescribed training loads based on individually determined peak power outputs, and the other based on traditional maximal strength training loads.  Because the intention of this thesis was to enhance our knowledge of best strength training practice for elite sporting performance, highly trained athletes were specifically chosen as subjects, cognizant of the population specific nature of training adaptation. In study one, it was determined that the point on the power-load spectrum where peak and mean power occurred in the machine squat-jump was 21.6 &#177; 7.1 %1RM (mean &#177; SD) and 39.0 &#177; 8.6 %1RM respectively although there was considerable individual variation in these points.  A broad plateau in power outputs was evident for most subjects with at most a 9.9% (90% confidence limits &#177;2.4%) difference in peak or means power at loads up to 20 %1RM either side of the peak.  Studies two and three established that, of the multiple kinetic and kinematic measures investigated, only 1RM strength, work and impulse (all relative to body mass) provided any indication of useful kinetic / kinematic outputs that were potentially worthwhile developing for enhancing sprint performance, albeit with only moderate correlations (r = ~ -0.3).  Additionally, the intercorrelations between maximal strength and explosive kinetic and kinematic measures were only moderate (r = ~0.3), casting doubt on the common practice of pursuing high 1RM strength with the intention of improving explosive muscle performance.  The training study provided evidence that training at the load that maximised individual peak power output was no more effective for improving sprint ability than training at heavy loads and the changes in kinetic and kinematic outputs were not usefully related to changes in sprint ability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sports training</field><field name="subject">Strength, power, force inter-relationships</field><field name="subject">Athletic training</field><field name="subject">Power loads</field><field name="subject">Heavy loads</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resituating the meaning of occupation in the context of living</field><field name="creator">Reed, Kirk</field><field name="description">This study explores the meaning of occupation, defined as a &#8220;conceptual entity&#8230; [which] includes all the things that people do in their everyday life&#8221; (Sundkvist &amp; Zingmark, 2003, p. 40). Using a phenomenological hermeneutic method informed by the writings of Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) and Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), this study provides an understanding of the meaning of occupation interpreted from the perspective of 12 New Zealand adults who experienced a disruption to their occupations. The review of the literature suggests that early writers from the time of the Bible identified that occupation is not &#8216;wide open&#8217;, there are many factors that shape how and when a person engages in an occupation, which in turn shapes the meaning of occupation. Within the occupational therapy literature, discussion of the meaning of occupation is overshadowed by describing and defending practice. In occupational science scholars and researchers have focused largely on understanding occupation from a conceptual perspective rather than the ontological meaning of occupation. The exploration of the meaning of occupation is being advanced by only a few. In this study participants told their stories about their occupations. Data were analysed by indentifying key themes and engaging in a hermeneutic thinking process of going back to the work of Heidegger and Gadamer. Writing and re-writing was the method used to bring new understandings to the data. The findings of this thesis suggest that the meaning of occupation is complex, and tends to remain hidden. Analysis focuses on the call, Being-with, and possibilities. The call to occupation seems to be in response to what it is we care about or what concerns us. Being-with others while engaging in an occupation creates a bond and mood; the meaning of occupation changes depending on who the occupation is done with or without. The meaning of occupation is also revealed in the possibilities that are opened up or closed down. Occupation shows both ourselves and others what it is we are capable of in the journey of who it is we are becoming. Each of these facets of meaning work in unison and can be likened to three cogs in a wheel, each interconnected with the others. The thesis concludes by recognising that not all voices have been heard and argues for uncovering more about the meaning of occupation from the perspective of lived experience. A challenge is made to consider the meaning of occupation not as something that is individually derived but as something that is connected to the broader context of the world and others in the world.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupation</field><field name="subject">Meaning</field><field name="subject">Occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Occupational science</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The meaning of being in dilemma in paediatric practice: a phenomenological study</field><field name="creator">Water, Tineke</field><field name="description">This study explores the phenomenon of dilemma in paediatric practice. Using a hermeneutic phenomenological method informed by the writings of Heidegger [1889-1976] and Gadamer [1900 -2002] this study provides an understanding of the meaning of &#8216;being in dilemma&#8217; from the perspective of predominantly paediatric health care professionals but also families in New Zealand. Study participants include four families who had a child requiring health care and fifteen health care practitioners from the disciplines of medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, play specialist and occupational therapy who work with families and children requiring health care. Participants&#8217; narratives of their experiences of &#8216;being in dilemma&#8217; were captured via audio taped interviewing. These stories uncover the everyday realities facing health professionals and families and provide an ontological understanding for the notion of dilemma. The findings of this study suggest that experience of dilemma for health professionals reveals a world that is uncertain and questionable where they are thrown into having to make uncomfortable choices and must live with the painful consequences of their actions. The consequences of being in such dilemma have to find ways of living with the angst, or risk becoming too sensitive or desensitizing. For families the experience of dilemma reveals a similar phenomenon most evident in circumstances where they feel totalized by the impact of heath care encounters. This study has uncovered that the perspectives that health professionals and families bring to the experience of dilemma reveal different concerns and commitments and may be hidden from each other. This thesis proposes that health professionals and families need support in living with their own personal encounters of enduring experiences of dilemma.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child health</field><field name="subject">Healthcare practice</field><field name="subject">Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Medical choices</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neoliberalism and discourse: case studies of knowledge policies in the Asia-Pacific</field><field name="creator">Grewal, Baljit</field><field name="description">This thesis examines policy documents relating to the knowledge society of six Asia-Pacific countries (India, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Fiji and New Zealand). I employ Norman Fairclough&#8217;s version of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to explore the discursive construction of knowledge-related policies within a comparative case study methodology. Leximancer &#8211; a computer software for text analysis is used to assist in operationalising parts of the CDA. The general conclusions drawn from the study indicate that the evolving knowledge policy discourse in the Asia-Pacific is not based on any robust theoretical framework but on international and country-specific paradigms of the knowledge society. In the policy discourses, the knowledge society is posited as a desired outcome in light of external (global) imperatives - economic globalisation, technological knowledge and innovation flows, and ICT revolution &#8211; which are married to context-specific developmental imperatives arising from geography, culture, history and polity. This hybridisation process gives shape to unique knowledge society paradigms of each country. My CDA analysis shows that the ideology of neoliberalism is a key discursive influence on the knowledge society paradigms and is mutated by differences in contexts across different countries. In the discourses, neoliberalism operates via an emphasis on policy restructuring (privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation), and streamlining of governance mechanisms relating to key knowledge and information policy sectors. The resulting knowledge society constructions are context and time-dependent frameworks and exhibit two core arguments of convergence in all the case studies:  (1) ICT and Science &amp; Technology as vehicles for knowledge-based development need to grow in an enabling policy environment and; (2) the twin imperatives of globalisation and technological revolution mean that knowledge policy should have a competitive and innovation orientation, and should be continuously readjusted in tune with global economic changes. In addition to convergence, there are two major issues of divergence, namely: (1) emphasis on affirmative action in knowledge-related policies of India, Malaysia, and Fiji; (2) the promotion of cultural production and creative industries in Singapore, New Zealand, and more recently in Korea. The original contribution of this thesis is that it provides a reassessment of the role of neoliberalism in knowledge society. The study is novel both in the selection of the problem and the methodology. Comparative case studies using CDA have not been attempted at the regional scale and not with this level of documentary data. The use of Leximancer improves the management of textual data and increases the validity of the interpretations. A study of this magnitude has not been attempted for the Asia-Pacific region previously. Finally, the conclusions drawn from applying the CDA are both persuasive and creative in terms of analysing policy discourses of the knowledge society.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge society</field><field name="subject">Knowledge economy</field><field name="subject">Neoliberalism</field><field name="subject">Critical Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">Asia Pacific</field><field name="subject">Knowledge policy</field><field name="subject">Leximancer</field><field name="subject">Information society</field><field name="subject">Policy Analysis</field><field name="subject">Sociology of knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate reputation: Ontology and measurement</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Stephen</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is on the development of ontology and on a more effective way to measure corporate reputation that takes into consideration the orientations of a company&#8217;s various stakeholders. The focus by researchers and by practitioners on corporate reputation and on its management attests to an expanding interest. Yet there remains disparate knowledge about how corporate reputation should be defined; about what are its key components; about the relationships between those components and about how corporate reputation should be measured. This point to a need for clarification: to develop a methodology based on ontology of corporate reputation that has relevance for a company&#8217;s various stakeholder groups.  This research builds on a review of the academic literature and employs text analysis, the nominal group technique and a quantitative survey among stakeholders about the reputation of a high profile company. Theory-driven analysis provides insights into the corporate reputation construct and into a tool for measurement that takes into consideration stakeholder perceptions of a company&#8217;s reputation. The results of the study indicate that, in the eyes of its stakeholders, a company&#8217;s reputation is driven by nine factors: image, identity, management leadership, performance, corporate brand, products and services, financial performance, ethical management and leadership, and corporate leadership. Not all nine components share the same degree of relevance for stakeholders: different stakeholder groups rank the importance of the components of corporate reputation differently; they evaluate the reputation of the same company differently. The drivers of stakeholders&#8217; overall evaluations of a company&#8217;s reputation vary by stakeholder segment. Stakeholder groups are seen to display the characteristics of segments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate reputation</field><field name="subject">Reputation measurement</field><field name="subject">Reputation ontology</field><field name="subject">Stakeholders</field><field name="subject">C-OAR-SE procedure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics of the Onychoteuthidae Gray, 1847 (Cephalopoda: Oegopsida)</field><field name="creator">Bolstad, Kathrin S.</field><field name="description">Squids in the family Onychoteuthidae Gray, 1847 have been reported from every ocean but the Arctic, are taken frequently in deep-sea fisheries by catch, and are ecologically important in the diets of many marine predators including cetaceans, pinnipeds, sharks, and seabirds. However, the diversity and systematic of the family have remained poorly understood. Of the 60+ nominal species, 12&#8211;14 have generally been accepted in recent studies. Challenges to clarity include insufficient species descriptions, original descriptions published in eight languages and often based solely on early life stages, non-designation or subsequent loss of type material, and the existence of several unresolved species complexes. In light of the general systematic disarray of the Onychoteuthidae, a global revision of the family follows, based on ~1500 specimens examined from 19 repositories. Type material has been examined wherever possible; for some species, photographs of type specimens, original illustrations, and/or the original descriptions have provided the only information available. It has not been possible to fully disambiguate taxa in some cases (e.g. Gen. nov. 2), given the limited material and information available, but for all species treated in this revision (25 out of 26 species; no material was available for Kondakovia nigmatullini), descriptions and illustrations are provided to a consistent standard that will enable their reidentification. External and internal morphological characters and states are described for sub adult to adult stages of most species, with external characters reported through ontogeny as permitted by available material. Historically important characters are treated (general external morphology, body proportions, tentacle clubs, photophores, gladius, lower beak, radula), augmented by several more recently recognised characters (palatine teeth, detailed morphology of the tentacular hooks in adults, tentacular suckers in paralarvae, chromatophore patterns). The systematic value of both historical and new morphological characters at the generic and species levels are discussed; at all ontogenetic stages, tentacular club and hook morphology are considered the most valuable characters, although body proportions and gladius also prove useful. Partial disambiguation of the Onychoteuthis banksii complex has been possible in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, resulting in the resurrection of Onychoteuthis bergii Lichtenstein, 1818 and Onychoteuthis aequimanus Gabb, 1868, the description of two new species, Onychoteuthis lacrima and Onychoteuthis prolata (in press), and the expansion of one species&#8217; recognised distribution (Onychoteuthis compacta) to include the Atlantic Ocean. The genus Moroteuthis Verrill, 1881 is considered a junior synonym of Onykia Lesueur, 1821, in accordance with the findings of several earlier authors. However, morphological differences in the species &#8216;Moroteuthis&#8217; ingens necessitate the resurrection of the subgenus Moroteuthopsis Pfeffer, 1908b, with all other Onykia species placed into a new subgenus, Onykia (Onykia). Sexual dimorphism is reported in the beaks of Onykia (Moroteuthopsis) ingens (new comb.), and revised sex-specific equations are given for estimating this species&#8217; biomass based on LRL. Morphological and historical genetic data suggest a more distant relationship between Onykia and the species &#8216;Moroteuthis&#8217; knipovitchi Filippova, 1972 than was suggested by earlier classifications. This species is therefore considered to represent an undescribed genus, herein referred to as Gen. Nov. 1, which cannot be more fully diagnosed and described at present due to limited material. The generic position of &#8216;Onykia&#8217; rancureli (Okutani, 1981) is also uncertain; it may be allied to Walvisteuthis virilis Nesis &amp; Nikitina, 1986 (family Walvisteuthidae Nesis &amp; Nikitina, 1986), but confirmation is impossible without examining type material of W. virilis. A second new genus, Gen. Nov. 2, is therefore described for &#8216;Onykia&#8217; rancureli and several morphological variants reported from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Given that the majority of available onychoteuthid material was collected after 1950, resulting in the descriptions of over half of the generally accepted genera and species since 1960, ongoing collection programmes are necessary to further resolve onychoteuthid systematic.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systematics</field><field name="subject">Taxonomy</field><field name="subject">Cephalopoda</field><field name="subject">Onychoteuthidae</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneurs and organisations: a case study of the Gisborne aquaculture cluster</field><field name="creator">Johnstone, Bruce Alexander</field><field name="description">This research contributes to the discussion surrounding New Zealand&#8217;s entrepreneurial environment and Innovation Framework and addresses the research problem of whether the New Zealand government should seek to support entrepreneurship and innovation through the various knowledge-based or regulatory organisations it owns or funds, and if so, how it should go about accomplishing this. The approach taken was to use qualitative methods to examine how the government&#8217;s support for entrepreneurship and innovation was delivered to an emerging cluster of entrepreneurs from the point of view of those entrepreneurs.  The entrepreneurs were involved in the innovative industry of land-based aquaculture and fieldwork was carried out in the Gisborne Region, on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. This study began by reviewing relevant literature from academic, industry and government sources to identify relevant sub-themes and create a framework for analysis. Fieldwork was undertaken using ethnographic methods to explore how the entrepreneurs experienced the New Zealand entrepreneurial environment and innovation framework in their interactions with knowledge-based and regulatory organisations. Data was gathered primarily by participant observation and semi-structured interviews and transcripts were coded and analysed using NVivo&#174; software. An ethnographic narrative was produced and the interview transcripts analysed for relevance to the sub-themes from literature and to identify patterns that emerged from the data. This research reports that four of the entrepreneurs failed in their ventures due to a combination of factors both within their operations and within the entrepreneurial environment. These factors included technical difficulties maintaining livestock health and growth within an artificial marine environment, an inability to obtain assistance from knowledge-based organisations, problems in dealing with regulatory organisations, difficulty retaining trained staff, uncertainty about the market, and high energy costs. The M&#257;ori training organisation, Turanga Ararau, formed the Gisborne Aquaculture Society in an effort to establish a Gisborne aquaculture cluster however, this initiative proved unsuccessful primarily because the society failed to attract the 12 involvement of key stakeholders. This research contributes to the policy and practice of cluster facilitation by examining the extent to which best practice was followed in this attempt to establish a cluster and presents conclusions as to how the process of establishing the cluster could have been improved. This study also reports that the entrepreneurs were cut off from access to knowledge and research resources and received little advice or support from the knowledge based organisations that might have played a role in the development of their cluster. It examines how and why New Zealand&#8217;s Innovation Framework might be failing to recognise and support the vital role of entrepreneurs in economic development and suggests how this might be improved. The methodology chapters of this thesis contribute to literature regarding the use of ethnographic methods in entrepreneurship research and a further by-product of this thesis is an ethnographic account of the participant observation and semi structured interviews with the entrepreneurs. This research also provides an insight into the obstacles and challenges faced by entrepreneurs in New Zealand, in particular those involved in the emerging recirculating aquaculture industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entrepreneur</field><field name="subject">Ethnography</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Fish farming</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ICT in community-based lifelong learning center: model for northeast Thailand</field><field name="creator">Wech-O-sotsakda, Chanthana</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how rural and remote communities in northeast Thailand harness information and communication technologies (ICTs) for community development and develops a new model of ICT-based lifelong learning centre for local communities. The main research questions are: 1. How to adapt ICTs to fit rural communities? 2. How to integrate ICTs into their lifestyle? 3. How to use ICTs to forge stronger ties within and between local communities? 4. How to develop ICTs in community-based lifelong learning centre? The objective of this research is to develop a model of ICT in community-based lifelong learning centers (CLC) that is suitable for northeast Thailand, and to propose policies for implementing ICTs in CLCs. This study used qualitative methodologies to explore the problem. Data collection took place in Thailand between April, 2005 to March, 2006. The fieldwork covered two communities in Krainun Village, Katharawichai District and Khok Yai Community Forest, Wapi Pathum District, Mahasarakham Province. The data collection procedures included using surveys and questionnaires to develop the research agenda with the target groups while focus group techniques were used as the main data-gathering instrument to further investigate their needs and develop the CLC model. Interviews, observations, workshops and study trips were needed for additional data. A triangulation approach was used to analyse the data from surveys, interviews, observations and discussions. The basic data from the surveys were categorised into four aspects: geographical data, public utilities, social data, and economic data. Using the issues-based analysis methodology, the qualitative data from the focus groups were analysed and interpreted and triangulation was applied to difference data sources. The recorded materials were transcribed and issues related to the research questions were identified. The next step focused on developing the CLC model which applied Knowles&#8217; program development model for adult education and training. This focus on process is a distinguishing feature of this research and comprises the &#8216;new&#8217; characteristic in the model presented. The study showed that the rural communities grasped the benefits of ICTs and through concrete situations, realised that ICTs could meet their needs. ICT learning activities using a hands-on practical approach motivated them to adapt and integrate ICT in their daily life. They applied their experiences to acquire new knowledge and technology. Their CLCs were developed based on a similar model of their understanding of, and motivation to use, ICT. The model of CLC in both communities is based on their needs, including the concept of establishing a CLC, CLC objectives, CLC management, implementation and evaluation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community learning centre</field><field name="subject">Thai public policy</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Computer training</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive inspired mapping by an autonomous mobile robot</field><field name="creator">Wong, Chee Kit</field><field name="description">When animals explore a new environment, they do not acquire a precise map of the places visited. In fact, research has shown that learning is a recurring process. Over time, new information helps the animal to update their perception of the locations it has visited. Yet, they are still able to use the fuzzy and often incomplete representation to find their way home. This process has been termed the cognitive mapping process. The work presented in this thesis uses a mobile robot equipped with sonar sensors to investigate the nature of such a process. Specifically, what is the information that is fundamental and prevalent in spatial navigation? Initially, the robot is instructed to compute a &#8220;cognitive map&#8221; of its environment. Since a robot is not a cognitive agent, it cannot, by definition, compute a cognitive map. Hence the robot is used as a test bed for understanding the cognitive mapping process. Yeap&#8217;s (1988) theory of cognitive mapping forms the foundation for computing the robot&#8217;s representation of the places it has visited. He argued that a network of local spaces is computed early in the cognitive mapping process. Yeap coined these local spaces as Absolute Space Representations (ASRs). However, ASR is not just a process of partitioning the environment into smaller local regions. The ASRs describe the bounded space that one is in, how one could leave that space (exits) and how the exits serves to link the ASRs to form a network that serves as the cognitive map (see Jefferies (1999)). Like the animal&#8217;s cognitive map, ASRs are not precise geometrical maps of the environment but rather, provide a rough shape or feel of the space the robot is currently in. Once the robot computes its &#8220;cognitive map&#8221;, it is then, like foraging and hoarding animals, instructed to find its way home. To do so, the robot uses two crucial pieces of information: distance between exits of ASRs and relative orientation of adjacent ASRs. A simple animal-like strategy was implemented for the robot to locate home. Results from the experiments demonstrated the robot&#8217;s ability to determine its location within the visited environment along its journey. This task was performed without the use of an accurate map. From these results and reviews of various findings related to cognitive mapping for various animals, we deduce that: Different animals have different sensing capabilities. They live in different environments and therefore face unique challenges. Consequently, they evolve to have different navigational strategies. However, we believe two crucial pieces of information are inherent in all animals and form the fundamentals of navigation: distance and orientation. Higher level animals may encode and may even prefer richer information to enhance the animal&#8217;s cognitive map. Nonetheless, distance and orientation will always be computed as a core process of cognitive mapping. We believe this insight will help future research to better understand the complex nature of cognitive mapping.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive mapping</field><field name="subject">Spatial reasoning</field><field name="subject">Inaccurate mapping</field><field name="subject">Mobile robot</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity and obesity in children: measurement, associations, and recommendations</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Scott</field><field name="description">Widespread increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity have raised the prospect of serious public health consequences in many countries. New Zealand is no exception; according to the most recent national estimates, approximately one in three children is overweight or obese. As a consequence, an understanding of the specific risk factors that predict this condition in children is becoming increasingly important. It is generally accepted that the promotion of physical activity is a key strategy for reducing the risk of childhood obesity. However, there is limited information describing physical activity and its relationship with body fatness in young New Zealanders. The overall aim of this thesis was to gain insight into the associations between excess fatness and physical activity in New Zealand children from a diverse range of socio-demographic groups. Three related studies were conducted to achieve this aim: a large descriptive survey of obesity and physical activity patterns in primary-aged children, and two preceding studies which develop the methodology for objective assessment of physical activity in this population. The first study provided the only validation data for the NL-2000 multiday memory (MDM) pedometer in children. In a sample of 85 participants aged 5-7 and 9-11 years, the NL-2000 offered similar accuracy and better precision than the widely used SW-200 pedometer (NL-2000: mean bias = -8.5 &#177; 13.3%; SW-200: mean bias = -8.6 &#177; 14.7%). The second study investigated reactivity to wearing pedometers over four 24-hour testing periods in 62 children aged 5-11 years. The sample was divided into two groups: one was given a full explanation of the function of the pedometer, while the other received no information prior to testing. The absence of significant differences in step counts between the first and last test periods indicated that there was no evidence of reactivity to this device for either preparation procedure. The central study presented in this thesis was the measurement of physical activity, body composition, and dietary patterns in 1,226 children aged 5-12 years, from which four chapters (4-7) were derived. The sample was ethnically diverse, with 46.8% European, 33.1% Polynesian, 15.9% Asian, and 4.1% from other ethnicities. Physical activity levels over three weekdays and two weekend days were assessed using NL 2000 pedometers. Percentage body fat (%BF) was determined using hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analysis with a prediction equation previously developed for New Zealand children. Waist and hip girths, height, and weight were measured using standard anthropometric techniques. Parent proxy questionnaires were used to assess demographic and lifestyle factors and pedometer compliance. The first reported analyses of this dataset (Chapter 4) examined the effect of weather conditions on children&#8217;s activity levels. In boys, a 10&#186;C rise in ambient temperature was associated with a 10.5% increase in weekday steps and a 26.4% increase in weekend steps. Equivalent temperature changes affected girls&#8217; step counts on weekdays only (16.2% increase). Precipitation also had a substantial impact, with decreases in weekday and weekend step counts during moderate rainfall ranging from 8.3% to 16.3% across all sex, age, and socioeconomic (SES) groups. The aim of Chapter 5 was to understand the relationship between children&#8217;s step counts and their body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and %BF. Mean step counts for this sample were 16,133 &#177; 3,864 (boys) and 14,124 &#177; 3,286 (girls) on weekdays, and 12,702 &#177; 5,048 (boys) and 11,158 &#177; 4,309 (girls) on weekends. Significant associations were detected between steps.day-1 and both WC and %BF, but not between steps.day-1 and BMI. The findings in Chapter 6 extended these results by estimating the number of steps required to reduce the risk of excess adiposity in children (16,000 and 13,000 steps.day-1 for boys and girls, respectively). Finally, the study described in Chapter 7 examined the associations between excess adiposity and a series of demographic and lifestyle variables, providing the first assessment of body fat correlates in young New Zealanders. Our results indicated that children aged 11-12 years were 15.4 times more likely to be overfat (boys, %BF &#8805; 25%; girls, %BF &#8805; 30%) than those aged 5-6 years. In addition, the odds of overfat were 1.8 times greater in Asian children than in European children, and 2.7 times greater in the low SES group when compared with the high SES group. Three modifiable behaviours related to fat status were also identified: low physical activity, skipping breakfast, and insufficient sleep on weekdays. Clustering of these risk factors resulted in a cumulative increase in the prevalence of overfat.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Body composition</field><field name="subject">Pedometers</field><field name="subject">Bioelectrical impedance analysis</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Step counts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of yeast species as the biocomponent for priority environmental contaminants biosensor devices</field><field name="creator">Gurazada, Saroja</field><field name="description">Along with an increasing understanding of the harmful effects on the environment of a wide range of pollutants has come the need for more sensitive, faster and less expensive detection methods of identification and quantitation. Many environmental pollutants occur in low levels and often in complex matrices thus analysis can be difficult, time consuming and costly. Because of the availability and easy cultivation of the microorganisms with potentially high specificity, there is considerable interest in the use of living microorganisms as the analytical component (the biocomponent) of sensors for pollutants. While a number of biosensors using bacteria have been developed, yeast has been comparatively rarely used as the biocomponent. Yeast are attractive because they are easy to culture and they are eukaryotes which means their biochemistry is in many respects closer to that of higher organisms. This thesis describes the development of whole cell bioassays that use yeast cells as a sensing element and redox mediators to probe the intracellular redox reactions to monitor the catabolic activity of the yeast resulting from the external substrate, steady-state voltammetry is utilised as the electrochemical detection technique.  The isogenic differential enzyme analysis (IDEA) concept of Lincoln Ventures Limited, lead NERF funded research consortium uses bacteria that have been cultured using specific organic pollutants as the carbon source which are the biocomponent in sensors. The use of wild type yeast Arxula adeninivorans that has the ability to use a very wide variety of substrates as sources of carbon and nitrogen was used as an alternative to bacteria to validate the &#8220;IDEA&#8221; concept. Naphthalene and di-butyl phthalate were chosen as model target contaminant molecules. The performance, detection limits and the usefulness of yeast based biosensor applications for environmental analysis are discussed. This thesis also describes the development and optimisation of a simple, cost effective in vivo estrogens bioassay for the detection of estrogens using either genetically modified or a wild type yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, catabolic repression by glucose was exploited to achieve specificity to estrogens in complex environmental samples that eliminates the requirement for conventional sample preparation. This is the first time that the use of wild type yeast to quantify estrogens has been reported. The attractive features of the bioassay are its use of a non-GMO organism, its speed, its high specificity and sensitivity with a detection limit of 10-15 M. The similarity of binding affinities for major estrogens to those of human estrogens receptors makes this in vivo estrogen bioassay very useful for analytical/screening procedures. The electrochemical detection method also makes it easy to interface with a variety of electronic devices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yeast</field><field name="subject">Biosensors</field><field name="subject">Environmental contaminants</field><field name="subject">Estrogen bioassay</field><field name="subject">Electrochemical deduction</field><field name="subject">Redox mediators</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prevalence, perceptions, and correlates of physical activity among youth in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hohepa, Maea</field><field name="description">Sufficient physical activity, a key prerequisite for health, is lacking in many teenagers. Limited knowledge, however, exists about who, when, why, and if New Zealand teenagers are getting their daily dose of health-related physical activity. At conception of this thesis, available information was predominantly survey-derived with no New Zealand data and few international studies that had assessed adolescent physical activity levels objectively. Data were collected from three projects. Convenience sampling was used across all projects to recruit students from low-decile high schools located in the Auckland region. For Project 1, 236 Year 9 to Year 13 students each wore a pedometer for five days (three weekdays and two weekend days) and reported their mode of transportation to and from school. To explore ethnic and sex-specific perceptions of physical activity among youth (i.e., barriers, benefits, potential physical activity enhancing strategies), Project 2 involved nine focus group discussions with 44 Year 9 and Year 10 students who identified as M&#257;ori or European. Project 3 was a large cross-sectional study of 3,451 high school students (Years 9 - 13) from seven low-decile schools. Through this project the following self-reported data were collected: demographics, physical activity levels during four school-day physical activity opportunities (i.e., active travel, lunchtime physical activity, recess physical activity, after-school physical activity), sedentary behaviour (i.e., school-day television (TV) watching), level of perceived encouragement to be active, and the presence of home policies regarding TV use. Analyses revealed low physical activity participation and high TV use behaviours. Pedometer data showed that only 14.5% of participants achieved a conservative criterion of 10,000 steps daily. Also, daily steps varied by age group (junior students: 11,079 &#177; 330; senior students: 9,422 &#177; 334), sex (males: 10,849 &#177; 381; females: 9,652 &#177; 289), time of week (weekday: 12,259 &#177; 287; weekend day: 8,241 &#177; 329), and transportation mode to/from school (walkers: 13,308 &#177; 483; car transit users: 10,986 &#177; 435).  Low school-day physical activity levels emerged, especially during school hours (i.e., during recess and lunchtime). Based on dichotomised grouping (less active versus more active), the proportion of students in the &#8216;more active&#8217; group during morning recess and lunchtime, after school, and as part of active travel to/from school were 26%, 32.4%, 56.3%, 58.1% respectively. Only 11.1% of participants were in the &#8216;more active&#8217; group across all four physical activity opportunities.  The focus group data revealed primarily social benefits of physical activity (e.g., meeting new people, fun). Barriers were mainly environment-related and included lack of peer support, low accessibility to and availability of physical activity opportunities, alternative sedentary activities, structure of physical education classes (females only), and distance between home and school (in terms of active transportation). Potential strategies to increase physical activity reflected the articulated barriers and benefits (e.g., increase peer support, parents to turn off the TV, organised activities at school, restructure physical education classes to allow student involvement in the decision-making process of class content). No ethnic and few sex differences in perceptions were found. Focusing on the verbalised importance of social support from the focus groups, Project 3 data showed that the strength of association between perceived encouragement from different support sources (i.e., parents, older siblings/cousins, peers, school) and physical activity participation varied by the physical activity opportunity examined. In particular, multivariate logistical regression showed reduced odds of being in the &#8216;more active&#8217; group was associated with low parental encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.38-0.58; Seniors, OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.29-0.60) and low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51-0.74; Seniors, OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.35-0.69) for after-school physical activity, low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.32-0.48; Seniors, OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.29-0.57) for lunchtime activity, and low peer encouragement (Juniors, OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66-0.92) for active transportation (junior students only).  No significant difference in physical activity was found between students who received high encouragement from two parents than students who reported high encouragement from their sole parent in a single parent family. Concentrating on the after-school period, Project 3 data were analysed to examined the relevance of the displacement hypothesis during this school-day period. The association between parental strategies (i.e., encouragement to be active and having TV limits) and youth after-school activity behaviours (i.e., hours spent viewing TV, physical activity participation) was also examined.  Support for the displacement hypothesis emerged. In particular, compared to students who watched less than one hour of TV, those who watched greater than four hours of TV were half as likely to be in the more active group for after-school physical activity participation (adjusted OR:  0.51; 95% CI: 0.40-0.65). Comparing activity profile groups (i.e., based on combined TV use and after-school activity levels), compared to the participants in the &#8216;low TV/active&#8217; group, participants in the other three activity groups (e.g., &#8216;high TV/low active&#8217;) were at least 1.28 times more likely to have parents that executed only one parental strategy and up to 4.77 times more likely to have parents that did not carry out either strategy. Substantive opportunities exist for youth to be active every day, and in different contexts and environments, yet a large proportion of young people are not maximising these opportunities to be active. If the health issue of inactivity is to be tackled in a comprehensive and efficient manner, a multi-strategy, multi-environment, coordinated approach among local authorities, government agencies, schools, families, and neighbourhoods is required to address the noted policy, physical, and social-related associates of an active lifestyle for youth. Future effort, whether in the form of strategy development, intervention work, or research, needs to be founded upon ecological theory, where both individual and a range of familial, social, and physical environmental factors (and there potential interactions) are considered. Lastly, equal research attention should be directed at improved physical activity levels, and just as importantly, reducing time youth spend in a sedentary state.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Television watching</field><field name="subject">Questionnaire</field><field name="subject">Focus groups</field><field name="subject">Youth-centred approach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity in New Zealand preschoolers: amount, associations, and accounts</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Melody</field><field name="description">Improving physical activity (PA) participation is a public health priority in developed and developing countries to curb the substantial and growing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases. Early childhood may be an especially important time to encourage PA; however, there is a paucity of research in this area. The aim of this research was to contribute to the limited body of work in PA in early childhood by investigating PA measurement approaches in young children and applying this knowledge to determine socio-environmental associations of preschool PA. An initial literature review provided the background for the thesis and determined the approaches taken in the ensuing chapters. A second literature review provided a detailed critique of research specific to PA measurement in early childhood to further inform the empirical studies. Information for the empirical chapters was drawn from three research projects: two studies were completed that assessed tools for objectively measuring PA in young children (pedometers and accelerometers), and these studies informed a final project to quantify associates of PA in a sample of preschool-aged children. Novel and important findings from the preliminary studies were that pedometer accuracy for measuring free-living PA and walking in children aged 3-5 years was poor, especially for pedometers worn at the back of the child, or during slow walking. Furthermore, when investigating the utility of accelerometers (more complex and frequently adopted tools) to quantify PA intensity in preschoolers, their application and use of commonly employed thresholds resulted in systematic underestimation of PA intensity and poor agreement (&#61547;=0.09) when compared with a direct observation criterion measure. Application of existing accelerometer thresholds to classify PA intensity in preschoolers was therefore likely to yield biased estimates.  Given the dearth of robust alternatives, a novel approach was developed to calculate individual activity rates from the raw accelerometer data. To account for over-dispersion in accelerometer counts, daily average activity rates per second were derived for each participant using negative binomial generalised estimating equation (GEE) models with a first-order autoregressive (AR1) correlation structure. These rates were assumed to be exchangeable between days and normally distributed. Potential socio-environmental associates of children&#8217;s activity rates and body size were thus assessed using normal GEE models with exchangeable correlation structures. Parental PA and child age were independently and significantly associated with child activity rates (P&#8804;0.04). No relationships between child body size and PA or television (TV) exposure were found. Common approaches to PA measurement and data consideration were challenged in this research and novel robust methods devised utilising contemporary statistical methods. Accelerometer data can be successfully reduced to individual activity rates to mitigate current issues related to objective PA quantification with preschoolers. Parental involvement in preschool PA interventions is worthy of further investigation, and younger children may stand to benefit more from increased activity. Further exploration of the complex interactions between PA, exposure to media, and health outcomes in preschool-aged children is warranted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical Activity</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Accelerometer</field><field name="subject">Pedometer</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Measure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrative approaches to modelling and knowledge discovery of molecular interactions in bioinformatics</field><field name="creator">Jain, Vishal</field><field name="description">The core focus of this research lies in developing and using intelligent methods to solve biological problems and integrating the knowledge for understanding the complex gene regulatory phenomenon. We have developed an integrative framework and used it to: model molecular interactions from separate case studies on time-series gene expression microarray datasets, molecular sequences and structure data including the functional role of microRNAs; to extract knowledge; and to build reusable models for the central dogma theme. Knowledge was integrated with the use of ontology and it can be reused to facilitate new discoveries as demonstrated on one of our systems &#8211; the Brain Gene Ontology (BGO). The central dogma theme states that proteins are produced from the DNA (gene) via an intermediate transcript called RNA. Later these proteins play the role of enzymes to perform the checkpoints as a gene expression control. Also, according to the recently emerged paradigm, sometimes genes do not code for proteins but results in small molecules of microRNAs which in turn controls the gene regulation. The idea is that such a very complicated molecular biology process (central dogma) results in production of a wide variety of data that can be used by computer scientists for modelling and to enable discoveries. We have suggested that this range of data should actually be taken into account for analysis to understand the concept of gene regulation instead of just taking one source of data and applying some standard methods to reveal facts in the system biology. The problem is very complex and, currently, computational algorithms have not been really successful because either existing methods have certain problems or the proven results were obtained for only one domain of the central dogma of molecular biology, so there has always been a lack of knowledge integration. Proper maintenance of diverse sources of data, structures and, in particular, their adaptation to new knowledge is one of the most challenging problems and one of the crucial tasks towards the knowledge integration vision is the efficient encoding of human knowledge in ontologies. More specifically this work has contributed towards the development of novel computational and information science methods and we have promoted the vision of knowledge integration by developing brain gene ontology (BGO) system. With the integrative use of several bioinformatics methods, this research has indeed resulted in modelling of such knowledge that has not been revealed in system biology so far. There are many discoveries made during my study and some of the findings are briefly mentioned as follows: (1) in relation to leukaemia disease we have discovered a new gene &#8220;TCF-1&#8221; that interacts with the &#8220;telomerase&#8221; gene. (2) With respect to yeast cell cycle analysis, we hypothesize that exoglucanase gene &#8220;exg1&#8221; is now implicated to be tied with &#8220;MCB cluster regulation&#8221; and a &#8220;mannosidase&#8221; with &#8220;histone linked mannoses&#8221;. A new quantitative prediction is that the time delay of the interaction between two genes seems to be approximately 30 minutes, or 0.17 cell cycles. Next, Cdc22, Suc22 and Mrc1 genes were discovered that interacts with each other as the potential candidates in controlling the Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity. (3) Upon studying the phenomenon of Long Term Potentiation (LTP) it was found that the transcription factors, responsible for regulation of gene expression, begin to be elevated as soon as 30 min after induction of LTP, and remain elevated up to 2 hours. (4) Human microRNA data investigation resulted in the successful identification of two miRNA families i.e. let-7 and mir-30. (5) When we analysed the CNS cancer data, a set of 10 genes (HMG-I(Y), NBL1, UBPY, Dynein, APC, TARBP2, hPGT, LTC4S, NTRK3, and Gps2) was found to give 85% correct prediction on drug response. (6) Upon studying the AMPA, GABRA and NMDA receptors we hypothesize that phenylalanine (F at position 269) and leucine (L at position 353) in these receptors play the role of a binding centre for their interaction with several other genes/proteins such as c-jun, mGluR3, Jerky, BDNF, FGF-2, IGF-1, GALR1, NOS and S100beta. All the developed methods that we have used to discover above mentioned findings are very generic and can be easily applied on any dataset with some constraints. We believe that this research has established the significant fact that integrative use of various computational intelligence methods is critical to reveal new aspects of the problem and finally knowledge integration is also a must. During this coursework, I have significantly published this research in reputed international journals, presented results in several conferences and also produced book chapters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">Gene regulatory networks (GRNs)</field><field name="subject">Interaction</field><field name="subject">Computational</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Integration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The artist will be present: performing partial objects and subjects</field><field name="creator">Braddock, Christopher Gregory</field><field name="description">'The Artist Will Be Present' explores objects as traces that stem from performed actions, and my body in performance. Part-sculptural objects, video and sound act as performance documents that expand on notions of the &#8216;live&#8217; encounter. Interest lies in how we get to objects: process in variance to product or closure. And the question of how the body/s of the audience becomes participatory is at the forefront of these operations. From this viewpoint the exegesis aims to broaden existing scholarship on performativity, liveness and the part-sculptural object, exploring the manners in which various cultural practices act to animate objects. I reconsider the Euro-American genealogies of performance/body art (Bruce Nauman, Lygia Clark, Ann Hamilton et al.) in relationship to contemporary art practices in Australia and New Zealand (Alicia Frankvich, Carolyn Eskdale et al.) through the lens of late 19th-and early 20th-century writing on sympathetic magical action. A legacy of cultural anthropology dealing with magic (that was privileged in establishing grounding aspects of structural linguistics) circulates around the British anthropologist Stanley J. Tambiah whose thinking on persuasive analogy in ritual performance draws a crucial link between J. L. Austin&#8217;s performative utterance and James George Frazer&#8217;s notion of sympathetic magic. From such a perspective the operations of sympathetic mimesis&#8212;involving ambivalent similitude and contagion&#8212;are discussed in terms of performative and persuasive illocutionary force. This offers another model for articulating an authentic performative document as an encounter with the &#8216;live.&#8217; A phenomenological method of enquiry, including Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#8217;s concept of the chiasm,&#8212;along with notions of mimetic incongruence&#8212;crucially tease out relationships between the live and the performance document and aim at resisting subject/object dichotomies whereby concepts of embodiment and indeterminate play between artist, objects and audiences are activated.  Applied to contemporary debates on performance and &#8216;objects out of action,&#8217; part objects and images are transformed as partial &#8216;subjects&#8217;: metonymically part of larger wholes as trace (substitution) and contagious contact (liveness). What is lacking in the operations of sympathetic mimesis is precisely what &#8216;draws out&#8217; the body/s of the audience as they desire closure in object and duration. As these questions turn on the body of the artist/self and the audience/participant in performative installation practice, I offer an analysis of bodies in ritual exchange (donor/donee); subjects and objects as transformers: relations of force over form&#8212;liminal, reversible and redolent of lack&#8212;that emphasise encounter in difference to recognition. This is to speak of, in the words of Lygia Clark: &#8220;Tactile shocks to liberate the body.&#8221;</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Part objects</field><field name="subject">Donor</field><field name="subject">Objects out of action</field><field name="subject">Performance documents</field><field name="subject">Sympathetic magic</field><field name="subject">Artist's body</field><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Mimesis</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Performative installation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inter-organisational cooperation and network influences in destination marketing: the case of www.purenz.com</field><field name="creator">Bhat, Sushma Seth</field><field name="description">Individual businesses from a variety of sectors network and work together to create a successful tourist experience. The interdependencies of organisations producing this experience make cooperation a necessity in destination marketing. Despite the centrality of cooperation and networking in tourism marketing relatively little empirical research has been conducted in this area. This thesis uses the case of the development of the official NZ website www.purenz.com (purenz) to examine the role, form and process of inter-organisational cooperation in destination marketing.  Drawing on in-depth interviews with thirty- five industry members involved in establishing and managing www.purenz.com between 1999 and 2006 this thesis makes a number of contributions to both the marketing and tourism literature. The thesis confirms that there are considerable difficulties in broadening the marketing role of the national tourism organisation (NTO) beyond destination promotion.  The study also finds that destination marketing and destination management are still perceived as separate processes in the NZ tourism industry. In addition, the results of this study provide support for the view that the social networks in which firms are embedded have a considerable influence on inter-organisational alliance formation. This thesis contributes to the development of theoretical approaches to the study of cooperation in destination marketing by identifying five levels of cooperation in destination marketing: passive acceptance, support, alignment, contribution and pooling.  The levels are based on the different types of input that may be required from stakeholders by the NTO.  The level of cooperation desired in a particular context is a strategic choice to be made by the destination marketing management.  This choice is affected by the existing characteristics of the tourism network; the NTO leaders&#8217; perception of the need for and value of cooperation in destination marketing and also by the extent of shared understanding of the scope of destination marketing management among tourism stakeholders. The research points to the need to develop further the network characteristics affecting cooperation in destination marketing.  Further work is also needed to develop a more complete profile of the five levels of cooperation identified by this study and the investment required to achieve each level of cooperation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Destination marketing</field><field name="subject">Strategic alliances</field><field name="subject">Network</field><field name="subject">Tourism marketing</field><field name="subject">Inter-organisational cooperation</field><field name="subject">Case study methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextual information retrieval from the WWW</field><field name="creator">Limbu, Dilip Kumar</field><field name="description">Contextual information retrieval (CIR) is a critical technique for today&#8217;s search engines in terms of facilitating queries and returning relevant information. Despite its importance, little progress has been made in its application, due to the difficulty of capturing and representing contextual information about users. This thesis details the development and evaluation of the contextual SERL search, designed to tackle some of the challenges associated with CIR from the World Wide Web. The contextual SERL search utilises a rich contextual model that exploits implicit and explicit data to modify queries to more accurately reflect the user&#8217;s interests as well as to continually build the user&#8217;s contextual profile and a shared contextual knowledge base. These profiles are used to filter results from a standard search engine to improve the relevance of the pages displayed to the user. The contextual SERL search has been tested in an observational study that has captured both qualitative and quantitative data about the ability of the framework to improve the user&#8217;s web search experience. A total of 30 subjects, with different levels of search experience, participated in the observational study experiment. The results demonstrate that when the contextual profile and the shared contextual knowledge base are used, the contextual SERL search improves search effectiveness, efficiency and subjective satisfaction. The effectiveness improves as subjects have actually entered fewer queries to reach the target information in comparison to the contemporary search engine. In the case of a particularly complex search task, the efficiency improves as subjects have browsed fewer hits, visited fewer URLs, made fewer clicks and have taken less time to reach the target information when compared to the contemporary search engine. Finally, subjects have expressed a higher degree of satisfaction on the quality of contextual support when using the shared contextual knowledge base in comparison to using their contextual profile. These results suggest that integration of a user&#8217;s contextual factors and information seeking behaviours are very important for successful development of the CIR framework. It is believed that this framework and other similar projects will help provide the basis for the next generation of contextual information retrieval from the Web.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retrieval models</field><field name="subject">Personalized Web search</field><field name="subject">Contextual search</field><field name="subject">User profile</field><field name="subject">Relevance feedback</field><field name="subject">Query formulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The making of a journalist: the New Zealand way</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Ruth</field><field name="description">This study is a first of its kind for New Zealand journalism education, following 20 students at two different schools throughout a year-long training programme. It used two methods to gain a deeper understanding: a discourse analysis of their news stories written at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the year, and retrospective protocol analysis, to provide insight into their thinking processes, through their taped reflections. The research found that journalism education controlled by the New Zealand Journalists Training Organisation still resembles that of 20 years ago, despite increasing numbers of students learning journalism as part of degree programmes. Students are trained for the media industry through learning by doing. They receive basic instruction and then are expected to perfect their skills by practising their writing and to learn the conventions and routines of the media industry through socialisation and work experience. In the first half of the year, the students developed some skills in writing the traditional inverted-pyramid news stories. However, by the end of the year, their news writing showed technical signs of regression. Firstly, they were not writing in a succinct, clear fashion, emphasising news values. Secondly, they had been inadequately trained to write outside of the inverted-pyramid news story or to use popular &#8220;soft&#8221; lead sentences, so that their writing tended towards being promotional. Thirdly, journalism institutions strongly favour subediting by tutors and this detracted from the students gaining understanding of their own writing and being able to self-monitor and evaluate it. Lastly, they failed to show the critical thinking skills and independence necessary for a professional journalist so that they could research thoroughly, reflect deeply and write entertaining, informative and important news stories with flair. Their reflections confirmed these findings, suggesting some stress and disillusionment. The students could &#8220;declare&#8221; what they knew about writing a news story but could not put it into practice. They blamed their failure to write high quality news stories on the pressures of the course, the deadlines and high volumes of stories. The gaps in their journalism education were also revealed through what was not mentioned in their taped reflections: in particular, they failed to mention the importance of news values in making their stories more appealing. The major influence at first was the students&#8217; tutors, followed by work experience and the &#8220;real world&#8221; of the media industry. The concentration on job skills and gaining a job coupled with a lack of knowledge and discussion provided the students with an incomplete understanding of the pressures of the media industry they were entering.  The study recommends more debate about journalism education and more research, as well as a change away from &#8220;learning by doing&#8221; to a more critical, reflective approach.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Journalism education</field><field name="subject">Skills-based training</field><field name="subject">Advantages of reflective practice</field><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Thinking-aloud</field><field name="subject">Learning by doing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Obesity and its determinants in girls from five ethnic groups</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In light of alarming rises in the prevalence of obesity worldwide, tackling the obesity &#8216;epidemic&#8217; is now a national health priority in many countries. Increasingly, population measures that provide accurate estimates of body fatness in children are required. Body mass index (BMI), or weight standardised for height, remains the most cost-effective and practical tool in this regard. However, there is evidence that the association between BMI and body fatness is variable in children from different ethnic backgrounds. The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate the appropriateness of BMI thresholds for defining overweight and obesity in female children and adolescents from five diverse ethnic groups. Secondary objectives were to examine the associations between weight control practices and perceptions, and to compare objectively-measured physical activity levels with participation in active transport (AT). In order to achieve the primary aim stated above, it was necessary to obtain valid and reliable measures of body fat percentage (%BF) in a large sample of children. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is well suited for this purpose, providing a portable and cost-effective means to estimate fat-free mass (and subsequently %BF). While equations exist for European, Maori, and Pacific Island children, findings from the preliminary study described in Chapter 2 demonstrate that there are no BIA equations appropriate for Chinese and Indian children. Given that these two groups are two of the fastest growing ethnicities in New Zealand, a new equation was developed that enables Asian girls to be included in future BIA research. The main study of this thesis involved a large-scale investigation of body composition in New Zealand&#8217;s five major ethnic groups (European, Maori, Pacific Island, East Asian, and South Asian). A total of 1,081 adolescent girls aged 11-16 years participated in the Girls&#8217; Activity and Body Composition (ABC) Study. To extend the age range, data were combined with another study of 5-11-year-old New Zealand children (595 girls), coined the Body-Size and Steps in Children (BASIC) Study. Both studies measured BMI from height and weight, %BF from bio impedance measurements, and physical activity using sealed multiday memory pedometers over five consecutive days. A questionnaire was also administered to the adolescent-aged girls to gather data related to weight perceptions and practices. Initial analyses of the main dataset demonstrated that existing BMI definitions of overweight were relatively insensitive for predicting excess %BF in South and East Asian girls. Conversely, low specificity was observed for Pacific Island and Maori children. These findings provided the rationale for the second set of analyses: the development of BMI cut-off points that correspond to an equivalent level of %BF across all ethnicities. The adjusted BMI curves for overweight and obesity ranged from an average of 3.3 and 3.8 kg.m-2 (respectively) lower than international standards in South Asian girls to 1.5 and 1.9 kg.m-2 higher in Pacific Island girls. Clearly, the proposed changes will have significant effect on our estimates of overweight and obesity in this population group. Subsequent investigation revealed that many adolescent girls misclassify their weight status. However, the number of girls trying to lose weight exceeded those who perceived themselves as being overweight, with the magnitude of the difference dependent on ethnicity. It was concluded that interventions and educational campaigns that assist girls in recognising a state of excess body fat are a priority for all ethnic groups to ensure that behavioural changes necessary to combat widespread overweight and obesity are adopted. Finally, it was observed that the physical activity levels of the participants were significantly lower on weekends (9,528 &#61617; 4,407) than on weekdays (12,597 &#61617; 3,630). Furthermore, a consistent decline in daily step counts was observed with age: after adjustment for ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES), girls in school years 9-10 achieved 2,469 (weekday) and 4,011 (weekend) fewer steps than girls in years 1-2. Daily step counts also varied by ethnicity, with Maori girls the most active and South Asian girls the least active. Overall, girls who used AT to and from school averaged 1,052 more weekday steps than those who did not use AT. These data suggest that adolescent-aged girls and girls of Asian descent are priority groups for future physical activity interventions, and that the promotion of AT in girls appears to be worthwhile.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Body mass index</field><field name="subject">Body fat</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gendered embodiment and critical tourism - exploring Italian women's sensuality</field><field name="creator">Abramovici, Martine</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of Italian women&#8217;s sensual embodiment in leisure and tourism experiences (involving beautifying in the city and tanning at the beach) in, and around, the city of Rome. The central link in this thesis connects the field of tourism studies with social cultural theories of the &#8216;body&#8217;, placing this research within the most recent theoretical debates on the body. It is argued that in everyday life people take their bodies for granted, yet the body is absolutely crucial to the way we engage with the world and the people around us. Through analysing Italian women&#8217;s embodiment, this thesis seeks to gain in-depth understanding of Italian society and more particularly women&#8217;s position in society, thereby positioning the field of tourism studies as a means for analysing people&#8217;s quotidian cultural habits. Embracing the critical paradigm, this thesis takes a reflexive and embodied approach to research, challenging the all-pervasive hegemonic dominance of positivist, masculinist Western academic approaches. Through post feminist lenses, auto ethnography, in-depth interviewing and document analysis were used to carry out the field work, with the central aim of capturing and contextualising Italian women&#8217;s voices and embodiment. This research shows Italian society to be strongly patriarchal, reflecting gender inequity and inequality. Women are dominated in discourse (politics, senior management and television shows being predominantly male), pressured into family roles, and objectified in society through the media and the male gaze. Paradoxically, women are empowered through choosing to reproduce patriarchal values of beauty and objectification (the power of the agency), and to embody these in a sensual and sensuous way, thereby reversing power relations in their favour. Aiming to understand Italian society through exploring women&#8217;s sensual embodiment, this thesis contributes to a broader understanding of the gendered construction of social identity, and of patriarchy and power relations, from a woman&#8217;s perspective. It contributes to gender and body studies in the tourism field through bringing these separate fields together, through exploring the power of agency in embodiment, and through the critical research approach to the body.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical tourism</field><field name="subject">Reflexivity</field><field name="subject">Embodiment</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Patriarchy</field><field name="subject">Tanning</field><field name="subject">Italy</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Patterns in a world in slippage": playback theatre as professional development in three primary healthcare centres in Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Day, Fe</field><field name="description">This thesis is an account of praxis: it examines Playback conceptually, and portrays a programme of practical work exploring the experience of workplace audiences of five Playback Theatre performances, delivered from 2002-2005. The aim of the performances was to assist multi-disciplinary teams of staff in community health centres in Auckland New Zealand to communicate and work together with more understanding of each other. The thesis describes Playback as a way not only to elicit complex narratives which allow for diverse points of view to be expressed, but also as an aesthetic reworking of these narratives using action, music, dance, gesture and speech, in ways which have been influenced by 20th century avant-garde forms such as surrealism, dada, collage, jazz and poetry. Unlike some forms of theatre, Playback calls on elements of ritual and group method, in that it relies on audience members taking an active part in the performance by contributing narratives from their own lives. The thesis interrogates the notion of audience in theatre, using the words audience, spectator, spectactor, participant, public and polis, and specifically investigates two moments of the theatre as polis, in the French and Russian revolutions, when the potential of theatre to engage with the widest cross-section of the nation led to influential experiments and innovations in theatrical practice, each of which influenced the succeeding century. Some Playback discourse and practice is found to contain simplistic, even nostalgic, concepts of personal narrative, and the potential for performers&#8217; interpretations in Playback to reinscribe social privilege is noted. In spite of its simple structure, Playback demands extremely complex skills from all the performers, not only the facilitator. In addition, the complex setting of the practical work encompasses both local NZ health initiatives and developments in global health. The work in each Healthcare Centre is described in a complete chapter: each containing details of the Centre and the Playback, seen through the findings of the patient focus groups, through comments made in interviews by the staff and through the researcher&#8217;s observation and experience. In all three Centres, existential and emancipatory metanarratives surfaced in the performances and in interviews. Professionalism was seen as meaning different things: at Ng&#257;kau it was a measure by which people were found to be unsatisfactory; at Oranga, it referred to applying the lessons of the Playback to one&#8217;s own practice; while at P&#257;taka, professionalism was evident in narratives of self care, dedication and seeking clarification and support from peers. While the study revealed limitations of Playback, it also pointed to some unique contributions this form of improvisational theatre can make to a programme of staff or group development. In particular, Playback can open up spaces, people and topics, for non-dogmatic, pluralistic, embodied thinking and reflection, leading people to more nuanced understandings of themselves and each other, and can even affect attitudes and behaviours.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="subject">Audience</field><field name="subject">Playback theatre</field><field name="subject">Staff development</field><field name="subject">Radical hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Primary healthcare</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial reports</field><field name="creator">Chiang, Christina</field><field name="description">There has been a dearth of research on &#8216;auditors and environmental matters&#8217; since Collison (1996) and Collison and Gray (1997) completed their study on the views of UK auditors about whether auditing is changing, or should be changing, in relation to environmental concerns. It is now more than ten years since the publication of that study. Growing international concern for environmental matters has since led to the issue of International Auditing Practice Statement (IAPS) -1010: The consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial report in 1998 and, in New Zealand, Audit Guidance Statement (AGS) -1010: The consideration of environmental matters in the audit of a financial statement in 2001. Yet, to date, there has been no examination of the impact of IAPS-1010 or AGS-1010 on either current audit practice, or the issues raised by Collison (1996) and Collison and Gray (1997). This doctoral thesis has attempted to address the environmental impact gap in the auditing research literature. In particular, it has investigated the consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial reports in the light of AGS-1010, with a view to understanding better the following issues: (1) how auditors generally perceive the consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial reports; (2) the common approaches and practices auditors undertake when auditing environmental matters; (3) the challenges (if any) that auditors face in the audit of environmental matters (4) the impact (if any) of AGS 1010 on current audit practice and, finally, (5) how current practices in the audit of environmental matters may be improved and further developed to meet better the espoused aims of AGS-1010. Qualitative interviews with twenty-seven senior financial audit practitioners and others in New Zealand provided the basis for the findings. The interviews were taped, transcribed and managed with the use of computerised qualitative analysis software (NViVo7). Key findings from the research interviews were as follows: (1) the introduction of AGS-1010 had little impact on current audit practice in New Zealand; (2) environmental matters were treated no differently from any other audit issues, and auditors tended to apply common, familiar audit approaches in dealing with environmental matters; (3) auditors found the effective auditing of environmental matters challenging owing to their inability to identify such matters, and their lack of relevant expert knowledge. The most significant finding from this study is that, in general, common audit practices were riddled with issues of concern. These issues point to a broader and more significant problem. It would seem that current audit practices fail to consider many potential audit issues (including environmental matters) adequately in the audit of financial reports. For auditors to be more effective in their audit practice and in protecting the public interest, not only does audit methodology need a major review, but auditors themselves need to change their attitudes and mindsets in their approach to auditing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Financial auditing</field><field name="subject">Environmental matters</field><field name="subject">Audit practice</field><field name="subject">Financial reporting</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Legitimacy theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the teacher-student relationship in teacher education: a hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry</field><field name="creator">Giles, David Laurance</field><field name="description">The relationship between teacher and student has always been a central interest of the educational process.  While the nature of this relationship can be understood from various theoretical frameworks, research that seeks to understand the &#8220;lived experience&#8221; of this relationship is less prevalent.  This research explores the phenomenological nature of the teacher-student relationship in the context of teacher education.  Stories of the lived experience of this relationship were hermeneutically interpreted against the philosophical writings of Heidegger, Gadamer, and Buber. The research answers the question: what is the meaning of the teacher-student relationship?  Relationships are essential to the educational experience whether this is recognised or not, and whether we are consciously aware of this or not.  Once established, relationships continue to exist beyond the time and space of the individuals influencing future relational experiences.  In addition, a teacher&#8217;s comportment has been found to have a communicative aspect that is felt and sensed by others. A further essential understanding opens the play of relating.  That is, the teacher and student experience their relationship as a play that is unscripted, uncertain, and lived beyond the rules of engagement.  In this play, teachers who are attuned to relationship show a phronesis, or practical wisdom, as they relate moment by moment. The outcomes of this research call into question technicist and instrumental models of teacher education which are presently underpinned by the dominant neoliberal ideology.  Consistent with critical and humanistic approaches to education, this research calls for the humanising of the educational experience through the educating and re-educating of teacher educators and teachers towards essential understandings of relationship.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutic</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Heidegger</field><field name="subject">Gadamer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I understand it well, but I cannot say it proper back: language use among older Dutch migrants in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Crezee, Ineke Hendrika Martine</field><field name="description">The purposes of this study were (a) to examine two groups of healthy older Dutch English bilingual migrants in a New Zealand setting to investigate whether they were showing signs of L2 attrition with accompanying L1 reversion post-retirement, and (b) to identify possible factors which might play a role in the incidence of any L2 attrition and concomitant L1 reversion. Previous research has focused on similar groups of migrants in the Australian context, while New Zealand based research has focused on language shift and maintenance amongst three generations of migrants. The research design involved an analysis of sociolinguistic life, using questionnaires. These included self-assessments of L1 and L2 proficiency at three key times: on arrival in New Zealand, at time of ultimate attainment and post-retirement. Further, an analysis of assessments of respondents&#8217; L1 and L2 proficiency pre-and post-retirement completed by interviewees&#8217; adult children moderated respondents&#8217; self-reports. The findings revealed a considerable overlap between participants&#8217; self-reports and assessments by their adult children. The study also revealed a relationship between participants&#8217; level of prior education and their ultimate attainment in the L2, with those who had come to New Zealand having learned English at Secondary School English very likely to have achieved a &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;very good&#8221; level of L2 proficiency. Conversely, those who had not learned the L2 at secondary school prior to arriving in New Zealand, were less likely to have achieved a &#8220;very good&#8221; level of ultimate attainment as evident both from self-reports and assessments by adult children. The design also included a linguistic analysis of elicited free speech. Data focused on key indicators of age, gender, social class, prior education, occupation and predominant linguistic environment pre- and post-retirement. Free speech was examined for code-switching, response latency and L1 structure in respondents&#8217; spoken L2. Results indicated that a majority of respondents showed minimal if any signs of L2 attrition with concomitant L1 reversion, both as evidenced by their spoken L2 and as indicated by self-reports and assessments by adult children. Any signs of L2 attrition which were found appeared linked to respondents&#8217; level of prior education and L2 proficiency on arrival in New Zealand. Being exposed to a predominantly L1 social environment post-retirement also appeared to result in a lifting of the threshold for L2 lexical items, resulting in a slightly increased response latency in the spoken L2. Three participants said they experienced some problems expressing their healthcare needs to medical professionals, to the extent that they were searching for words. All stated they &#8220;got there in the end&#8221; but needed more time to paraphrase their health needs. Two subjects avoided the use of the L2 during the interview, even when prompted in English. Three respondents engaged in significant codeswitching from L2 to L1 and vice versa, with two engaging in what Muysken (2000) terms &#8220;congruent lexicalisation&#8221;. Adult childrens&#8217; reports indicated that the respondents in question had always spoken in this manner, but to a greater extent now, post-retirement. Overall, a number of the healthy older subjects interviewed for the study were showing some signs of increased response latency and lexical retrieval problems when expressing themselves in the L2, but none to the degree that they were no longer able to communicate in that language.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">First language reversion</field><field name="subject">Second language attrition</field><field name="subject">Code switching</field><field name="subject">Bilingualism in a migrant context</field><field name="subject">Healthcare interpreting</field><field name="subject">Host society attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting the work of global virtual teams: the role of technology-use mediation</field><field name="creator">Clear, Tony</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the role of technology-use mediation in supporting the work of global virtual teams.   The work is set in the context of a longer term action research programme into collaborative computing and global virtual teams, initiated by Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand and Uppsala University in Sweden.  Over the period since 1998, global virtual collaborations involving teams of students from both universities have been conducted annually.  This thesis investigates the 2004 collaboration cycle, in which participants from St Louis University Missouri joined the collaboration.  This was the first triadic collaboration, and covered Northern, Southern and Western aspects of the globe while traversing three widely divergent time-zones.  In spite of the extensive experience in collaboration possessed by the coordinators at all three sites, the results of the global virtual trial were at best mixed.  This repeated experience of dissatisfaction in our global virtual collaborations, in spite of the technology being in place has been a primary motivator for this work.  Why is global virtual collaboration difficult?  What roles and activities are critical?  How can we do it better? These are not issues solely to do with the student actors in the global virtual teams, but more to do with the supporting cast, engaged in &#8220;activities which involve the shaping of other users activities of [technology] use&#8221; (Orlikowski et al., 1995, p.425).  Thus came about my interest in exploring the topic of technology-use mediation. This thesis applies a research framework adapted from DeSanctis &amp; Poole&#8217;s &#8220;Adaptive Structuration Theory&#8221; (1994) by the author.  Initially applied to &#8220;facilitation&#8221; in virtual teams &#8220;Extended Adaptive Structuration Theory (EAST)&#8221; (Clear, 1999a), has undergone further development.  The resulting research framework &#8220;Technology-use Mediated AST (TUMAST)&#8221; is applied here for the first time to investigate technology-use mediation activities performed during the global virtual collaborative trial.  A corpus of data based on the email communications of supporting parties to the collaboration is analysed in depth in this study, applying a combination of grounded theoretic and structurational techniques.  Thus a very rich and firmly grounded picture of the processes of technology-use mediation is built.  This thesis represents the first known in-depth longitudinal study of technology-use mediation in a real global virtual team setting.  From this exploratory study some novel theorizations have resulted.  Methodologically it demonstrates analysis of technology-use mediation applying the TUMAST framework in a manner that captures the richness and evolution over time of these complex activities.  Substantively it proposes a novel theory of &#8220;Collaborative Technology Fit (CTF)&#8221;.  It is hoped that future global virtual team coordinators and researchers may apply the theory in order to map their situation, and diagnose their degree of collaborative alignment on multiple dimensions, thus enabling corrective actions to be taken.  While the work arises in a tertiary education context, it reflects the reality of professionals at work in a global virtual team.  Its application within other domains remains to be proven, but readings from the literature, and personal experience within global virtual software development teams suggest its wider applicability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology-use mediation</field><field name="subject">Global virtual teams</field><field name="subject">International collaborative learning</field><field name="subject">Collaborative technology</field><field name="subject">Collaborative technology fit</field><field name="subject">Technology-use mediated adaptive structuration theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding IS development and acquisition: a process approach</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Laurie Carina</field><field name="description">Computer-based information systems (IS) play an increasingly pervasive and important role in contemporary organisations. Despite decades of continuing research and the development of an extensive prescriptive literature, IS development projects continue to be problematic, with many failing or being seriously challenged. In addition, the IS development environment has changed significantly in recent years, with rapid advances or shifts in technology, increasing devolution of IS responsibility and expenditure to user groups, high levels of packaged software acquisition and customisation, greater outsourcing of IS development, and an increasing emphasis on enterprise-wide and inter-organisational IS. In many cases these changes are interrelated and involve more flexible, ad hoc or non-traditional development approaches. Combined with the fact that at the same time IS have become increasingly sophisticated and integrated, the potential for unpredictable or unintended consequences has also increased. Together, the continued problematic nature of many IS projects and the changing IS development environment, suggest that there is an ongoing need for a fuller understanding of IS development processes and practices. Given the limitations of factor-based, prescriptive studies, an understanding of how contemporary IS development is enacted needs to be grounded in and built upon the cumulative body of research that attempts to understand the complexity and dynamic nature of IS development. Accordingly, this study uses a conceptualisation of IS development as a process in which an IS emerges from a dynamic and interactive relationship between the technology, its social and organisational context, and the negotiated actions of various individuals and groups. The thesis presents the results of an extensive empirical investigation into contemporary ARE development practices based on data collected from New Zealand. The study uses a range of research methods and ultimately develops a sociotechnical process model of IS development as situated action. Following Walsham&#8217;s (1993) emphasis on the content, context and process of IS-related organisational change, the methods used in this study are three-fold. First, an extensive literature review is undertaken to provide a comprehensive synthesis of contemporary empirical knowledge about the content of IS development. Second, a survey is used to collect contextual data about IS development and acquisition practices in New Zealand. Finally, these both support an in-depth longitudinal case study of the IS development process in an organisational setting. The literature review synthesises the results of recent empirical studies of the various influences that shape IS development, using a classificatory framework based around actors, project content, IS development processes, and context. The review shows that, while a number of traditional factors influencing IS development continue to be relevant, other factors have emerged as important as a result of changes to the IS development environment and to IS development practice. In particular, increasing recognition within the IS literature has been given to the relative importance of people and process and of the organisational and environmental context in which IS development takes place. The results of the literature review inform the design of a survey instrument intended to provide an updated assessment of IS development and acquisition practices in New Zealand organisations. A Web-based survey was administered to a sample of senior IS managers in 460 public and private sector organisations with 200 or more FTEs. Based on the 106 usable responses, the results of the survey confirm the ongoing relevance of a number of traditional factors identified in the IS literature as facilitating or inhibiting IS development. However, a number of factors were identified as emerging or increasing in relevance in light of changes in the IS development environment. While the survey provides a useful description of contemporary IS development and acquisition practice in New Zealand, it does not enable a detailed understanding of IS development in action. To address this, an IS project in a large New Zealand organisation was followed in action for over two years. The project involved the development of a sophisticated financial database model using a purchased commercial software package and external consultants. As such, it provides a useful exemplar of development in a contemporary IS environment. The case study illustrates how a seemingly small, well-defined project experienced delays and difficulties as might be expected in larger, more complex projects. It offers insights into the significance of external actors, the importance of full stakeholder participation, the influence of initial characterisations of the nature of the project, and the observance of project management processes. Consideration of the project outcome reveals its multi-dimensional, subjective and temporal nature. A process approach (Markus &amp; Robey, 1988) is employed to structure the analysis of the case study. A combination of temporal bracketing, narrative analysis and visual representation is used to analyse the sequence of social action and organisational processes involved in the project and to develop a process explanation of how and why the particular project outcome in this case study developed over time. Underpinning and informing this analysis is the construction and utilisation of a model of IS development as a situated, sociotechnical process. Drawing on theoretical concepts from structuration theory and the sociology of technology, the model considers the situated actions and practices of various individuals and groups involved in IS development, the ways in which these are enacted within different contextual elements, and the role of existing and new technological artefacts in this process. IS development is characterised as iterative and emergent, with change occurring dynamically from a trajectory of situated interactions (in which meanings and actions are negotiated) and intended and unintended consequences. As a whole, this PhD highlights the changing nature of the IS development environment and the way a complex ensemble of &#8216;factors&#8217; interact to influence IS project outcomes. Common themes emerge around the importance of people and process, and the context in which IS development takes place, while at the same time explicitly including a consideration of technology in the analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative data analysis</field><field name="subject">Process approach</field><field name="subject">Interpretive case study</field><field name="subject">Sociotechnical</field><field name="subject">Situated action</field><field name="subject">Project management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information technology audit: systems alignment and effectiveness measures</field><field name="creator">Nicho, Mathew</field><field name="description">Information technology audit has proven to be a relatively new, less researched and rapidly expanding field among large, medium and even small businesses (commercial and non-commercial organisations). The implementation rate has grown rapidly and presents a huge growth market for audit consultants due to the need for transparency and compliance with regulation (for example: Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the need to be competitive in the marketplace. The audit process is being conducted mainly by consultants following a traditional process but using different proprietary approaches and mostly done manually. The purpose of this study is to present a scientific method to attach a purely measurement focus to the auditing process so as to provide an auditing as well as a quantitative outcome of the performance to the various IS entities that are audited using a novel automated method that can save organisations considerable resources in terms of time, cost and effort. The nature of the topic directed the researcher to three domains of information system (IS) namely studies on IS measurement, IT governance and software engineering. These areas provided information on the nature of IS measurement and the models used; the process of auditing/measurement and the corresponding frameworks used; the principles and methodology of measurement of IS entities; and measurement models used both in the software engineering and information systems domain. The review of the literature gave rise to the research question and the COBIT-GQM (Control Objectives for Information Technology Audit) &#8211; Goal Question Metrics) model. The research question that had emerged out of the four propositions &#8220;How can an IT audit or governance framework be used to measure the effectiveness of IS entities in a scientific manner using customised and goal oriented metrics&#8221; along with the nature of data sought (positivist), guided the researcher to qualitative research using multiple case studies to test the theoretical model (grounded theory) that had emerged out of the literature review. The theoretical model was automated (with a front end interface and a back-end database) and initially tested for usability issues. Then the common COBIT control objective that was obtained through an initial survey was entered into the database along with a set of questions and metrics (developed by the researcher by following the given GQM guidelines). This application that was demonstrated, and given for evaluation in four organisations gave rise to expected and surprising results. While the respondents expressed their desire to incorporate a customised and goal oriented measurement perspective to their IT audit/performance  functions, that would save them time, effort and cost, numerous suggestions were provided that need to be incorporated into the model to make it fully functional. Notable among them are the need to embed a multiple contextual qualifying layer, incorporating benchmarking feature to the model, and the need to link this with the maturity model. These were incorporated into the model and a comprehensive model incorporating all the suggestions was created. The qualitative case study method being used here more to evaluate a theory, provided a sound base for future studies to generate hypothesis that can be evaluated using quantitative survey methods for the model to be generalised. IT auditing being a relatively new, less researched, conventional and high growth oriented field, the use of an innovative, comprehensive, automated and scientific method of audit and measurement method will satisfy the implied need for organisations to incorporate the diverse audit/measurement/ control/standards into one comprehensive method and this research is a major step in this direction. Since the new model is comprehensive and can be automated organisations can economise in terms of time, cost and effort. Irrespective of the nature of economic cycle the need for economising in terms of cost, time and effort is universal for all organisations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology governance</field><field name="subject">Information technology audit and control</field><field name="subject">Goal Question Metrics method</field><field name="subject">Information technology alignment</field><field name="subject">Information systems measurement</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research in information systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of acute and periodic stretching interventions on knee extension range of motion and hamstring muscle extensibility in individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee</field><field name="creator">Reid, Duncan</field><field name="description">Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common condition. The condition causes pain and swelling in the knee joint and as a consequence knee range of motion, particularly knee extension, can be decreased. While a number of studies have indicated increases in knee extension range of motion (ROM) can be achieved following stretching interventions, these studies have been undertaken in young healthy populations mostly. To date, there have been no investigations of stretching as a single intervention in people with OA knee.  Review of Literature: To gain an appreciation of the literature in this area, three structured literature reviews were undertaken. The first examined the efficacy of acute stretching interventions on lower limb joint ROM in young and elderly subjects, the second examined the efficacy of periodic muscle stretching interventions on lower limb joint ROM in elderly subjects and the third examined the efficacy of periodic muscle stretching interventions on ROM in subjects with OA of the knee joint. The results of the first review indicated that there is strong evidence for acute stretching interventions to increase joint ROM in the lower limb of young and elderly subjects. The results of the second review indicated that there is strong evidence for periodic stretching interventions to increase joint ROM in the lower limb of elderly subjects. The result of the third review indicated that there is limited evidence for stretching interventions alone to improve ROM in the lower limb in subjects with OA of the knee joint. As consequence of these findings two studies were designed to investigate the effects of acute and periodic stretching in people with OA of the knee joint. Study 1 Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of an acute hamstring-stretching programme on knee extension range of motion in individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and compare them to individuals of a similar age without OA of the knee. Study Design: A cross sectional study design was used. Participants: Thirty one subjects (16 male and 15 female) with OA of the knee were recruited from the local population (mean age 67.8 yrs SD: 5.0, mass 81.4 kg, SD: 15.2, height 168.5 cm, SD 11.1). Thirty one subjects of a similar age (9 male and 23 female) were also recruited who were otherwise fit and healthy and did not have OA of the knee (mean age 68.8 yrs SD: 5.2, mass 71.4 kg, SD: 13.2, height 163.8 cm, SD 8.1). Method: Hamstring extensibility was assessed by a passive knee extension test using a Kincom&#174; isokinetic dynamometer. Subjects undertook two trials of maximum knee extension. The Kincom&#174; then stretched the hamstrings to a point determined as 80% of the initial maximum knee extension test. Three sets of 60 seconds stretching were undertaken with 60 seconds rest between sets. Two further maximal knee extension tests were performed after the stretching intervention. The variables of interests were maximal knee extension, peak passive torque and stiffness. Analysis: A 2-factor repeated measures ANOVA model was utilised. The alpha level was set at 0.05. Results: There was a significant main effect by time for knee extension ROM, peak passive torque and stiffness (p&lt;0.05). There was no interaction effect between groups across time (p&gt;0.05). Knee extension range of motion (ROM) in the OA group increased significantly from 75.6 (SD: 17.2) degrees to 80.5 (SD: 22.3) degrees after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the non OA group increased significantly from 77.5 (SD: 15.5) degrees to 81.9 (SD: 18.2) degrees after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). The knee extension ROM recorded at 50% of the peak torque level pre intervention for the OA group was 60.3 (SD: 18.7) degrees and this increased significantly to 67.2 (SD 16.7) degrees post intervention (p&lt;0.05). For the non OA group, knee extension ROM at 50% of peak torque increased significantly from 60.1 (SD: 15.2) degrees to 65.8 (SD 16.0) degrees (p&lt;0.05). Peak passive torque in the OA group increased significantly from 18.1 (SD: 9.6) Nm to 22.5 (SD: 12.9) Nm after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the non OA group increased significantly from 21.05 (SD: 11.6) Nm to 22.05 (SD: 12.8) Nm after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). For stiffness, there was a significant interaction effect (p &lt;0.05) between groups across time. The OA group increased significantly from 0.70 (SD: 0.35) Nm/deg to 0.89 (SD: 0.5) Nm/deg after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the non OA group increased significantly 0.78 (SD: 0.36) Nm/deg to 0.82 (SD: 0.42) Nm/deg after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The study demonstrated that knee extension ROM, passive resistive torque and stiffness increased with a single bout of stretching. These results indicate that both elderly subjects and those with degenerative joint disease are able to demonstrate immediate tissue adaptations with acute stretching interventions. This is important as clinicians often prescribe acute stretching exercises in the preparation for other activities such as strengthening and walking programmes. Improving joint range of motion prior to other subsequent activities may be beneficial to those people with OA in particular, as management guidelines for these populations recommend regular exercise to reduce the deterioration of the condition. Study 2 Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a six week stretching intervention to the key muscles of the lower limb, in people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee joint and compare them to individuals of a similar age without OA of the knee. A 12 week follow up was undertaken to see if these effects were maintained following the intervention. This study builds on the effects of an acute stretching intervention as demonstrated in Study 1. Study Design: A randomised control trial design was used. Participants: Forty three subjects (24 OA and 19 non OA) were recruited from the local population (mean age 68.8 yrs SD: 5.0, mass 79.5 kg, SD: 14.6, height 166 cm, SD 9.8). Subjects were randomly allocated by condition to either a stretch group or a control group. Methods: Hamstring extensibility was assessed by a passive knee extension test using a Kincom&#174; isokinetic dynamometer at baseline, following the intervention and at a 12 week follow-up. Subjects in the intervention groups stretched the main lower limb muscles 3 x 60 seconds, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. The control groups did not stretch but received a placebo intervention of interferential current. The variables of interest were maximal knee extension, peak passive torque and stiffness. The following outcome measures were also used to assess activity levels: the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Lower Limb Task Questionnaire (LLTQ) and the Aggregated Locomotor Functional (ALF) score. Analysis: A 3-factor (group x condition x time) repeated measures ANOVA model was utilised. The alpha level was set at 0.05. Results: There was a significant main effect for time and a significant interaction effect for group (stretch and control) by time for knee extension ROM, peak passive torque and stiffness (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant interaction for condition (OA vs non OA) (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the stretch group had 68.9 (SD: 15.5) degrees of knee extension before the intervention and this increased significantly to 76.8 (SD: 14.4) degrees after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). At the 12 week follow up assessment, subjects had a mean of 72.5 (SD: 20.51) degrees. This difference was not significant when compared to the post intervention assessment (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the control group were not significantly different for knee extension ROM following the intervention or at the 12 week follow up (p&gt;0.05). For the knee extension ROM at 50% of the maximum torque level, there was a significant main effect for time (p&lt;0.05) but no significant interaction effect between groups across time (p &gt;0.05). The mean knee extension ROM recorded at 50% of the peak torque level for the stretch group pre intervention was 55.9 (SD: 15.0) degrees and this decreased significantly to 50.8 (SD 12.3) degrees post intervention (p&lt;0.05). The mean knee extension ROM recorded at 50% of the peak torque level pre intervention for the control group was 60.2 (SD: 11.4) degrees and this decreased significantly to 57.1 (SD 11.0) degrees post intervention (p&lt;0.05).  With respect to peak passive torque subjects in the stretch group were 13.2 (SD: 7.7) Nm before the intervention and increased significantly to 19.7 (SD: 9.5) Nm after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). At the 12 week follow up assessment, the subjects in the stretch group generated a mean peak torque of 20.2 (SD: 11.5) Nm. This difference was not significant when compared to the post intervention assessment (p&gt;0.05).   With respect to stiffness, subjects in the stretch group were 0.62 (SD: 0.3) Nm/deg before the intervention and this increased significantly to 0.84 (SD: 0.3) Nm/deg after the intervention (p&lt;0.05). At the 12 week follow up time point, the subjects in the stretch group had a mean stiffness of 0.88 (SD: 11.5) Nm/deg. This increase was not significant when compared to the post intervention assessment (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the control group were not significantly different for peak passive torque or stiffness following the intervention or at the 12 week follow up. There was no significant difference for time or condition for the WOMAC or LLTQ scores. There was a significant main effect for time for both groups for the ALF score (p&lt;0.05), however there was no significant interaction for time by condition (p&gt;0.05). Subjects in the stretch group had a mean ALF score of 23.1 (SD: 3.9) seconds pre intervention and this reduced significantly to 19.8 (SD: 5.4) seconds post intervention (p&lt;0.05). Subjects in the control group had a mean AFL score of 24.8 (SD: 3.1) seconds pre intervention and this reduced significantly to 22.3 (SD: 3.0) seconds post intervention (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The study demonstrated that knee extension range of motion, peak passive torque and stiffness increased in those subjects who undertook the six week stretching programme. Knee extension ROM was not maintained at the 12 week follow up assessment, however peak passive torque and stiffness were. These results indicate that both elderly subjects and those with degenerative joint disease are able to demonstrate long term adaptations with periodic stretching interventions. Functional improvements were also observed following the intervention in the stretch groups and the control groups. As previous studies investigating exercise interventions in subjects with OA of the knee joint have combined stretching and strengthening exercises, this study has provided a clear picture of the effects of stretching alone in this population. However, to gain a more obvious change in function in subjects with OA of the knee joint, the combination of stretching with other exercises such as strengthening, may be required in future studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flexibility</field><field name="subject">Arthritis</field><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Randomisaton and blinding</field><field name="subject">Stiff joints</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic entrepreneurship in New Zealand's state-owned enterprises: underlying elements and financial implications</field><field name="creator">Luke, Belinda</field><field name="description">The concept of strategic entrepreneurship has received increased attention over the past ten years.  Viewed as the intersection of entrepreneurship and strategy, this field of research is populated by conceptual studies which focus mainly on the nature and perceived benefits of strategic entrepreneurship.  Similarly, the study of entrepreneurship in a public sector context has gained increasing support in recent years, but also remains underexplored.  To address these gaps, this thesis considers: What are the underlying elements and financial implications of strategic entrepreneurship in New Zealand&#8217;s state-owned enterprises [SOEs]? New Zealand&#8217;s SOE sector, comprising 17 government-owned, commercially focused organisations, is considered to be a prime subject for this research.  Well known for their implementation of new public management [NPM], many New Zealand SOEs have also been publicly recognised as both innovative and entrepreneurial.  The research question is addressed by first developing a preliminary framework of strategic entrepreneurship from literature on entrepreneurship and strategy.  This framework is then examined in the context of case studies on activity which is entrepreneurial and/or strategic within 12 of the 17 SOEs operating in New Zealand as at 2006.  Transcripts from a series of interviews, and publicly available documents are analysed thematically.  SOEs&#8217; financial statements over a five year period are also analysed. The thesis contributes in two broad areas.  First, much-needed empirical support is lent to the concept of strategic entrepreneurship.  Key elements of strategic entrepreneurship identified include opportunity identification, innovation, acceptance of risk, flexibility, vision, growth, and leveraging from core skills and resources such that existing knowledge and skills are transferred and applied to create new products, services, and markets.  Important supporting elements identified include an open, flexible, and progressive culture, operational excellence, and cost minimisation.  The nature of each of these elements is also investigated.  A detailed understanding of the relationship between strategic entrepreneurship and wealth creation reveals various internal and external factors which may influence the nature and strength of the relationship.  These factors include changes within the organisation, as well as changes in the economic and political environment, and are important influences on the resulting returns realised.  Second, this thesis offers valuable evidence in support of emerging change in the public sector towards the adoption of strategic entrepreneurship.  Support for the value of NPM is provided, with clear evidence of financial returns from New Zealand&#8217;s SOE sector.  Further, a key finding is the structured and systematic approach to entrepreneurial activity within the context of NPM in several New Zealand SOEs.  Such behaviour is referred to in this thesis as new public entrepreneurship. This form of activity offers the potential for competitive advantage and financial gain traditionally associated with entrepreneurial activity, but also limits the respective risks through its structured, systematic approach.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">State-owned enterprises</field><field name="subject">Business entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Government linked companies GLC</field><field name="subject">Case study approach</field><field name="subject">Interpretivist paradigm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovery as the re-fabrication of everyday life: Exploring the meaning of doing for people recovering from mental illness</field><field name="creator">Sutton, Daniel</field><field name="description">The notion of recovery from mental illness has become a significant force in mental health policy, practice and literature. As a process, recovery can been described as the lived experience of personal growth and search for meaning after the onset of mental illness. The following phenomenological inquiry seeks to understand the meaning of day-to-day activities for 13 people in recovery from mental illness. In the recovery literature there has recently been a growing interest in the everyday aspects of recovery. Routine interactions between people and the human and non-human environment have been recognised as being significant in the recovery process. Additionally, there has been a call within occupational therapy literature for research focused on exploring the experience and meaning of different forms of occupation. This study aims to address and add to these areas of interest within the current literature. Recovery narratives were collected from the participants in two phases, using an open ended conversational style of interview. The first phase focused on gathering stories that reflected the lived experience of recovery for eight participants. The recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using the hermeneutic philosophy of Martin Heidegger. In the second phase of interviewing a further five participants shared their stories. In this round the conversations were focused on some of the dynamics of activity and recovery that had emerged as broad themes in the first phase. This allowed further depth to be added to the data and subsequent analysis. The interpretation focused on descriptions of engagement in activity during different periods of the participants&#8217; recovery journeys. It was important to dwell with the stories and allow themes of experience and meaning to emerge. Particular phrases and words were highlighted and their meaning explored if they showed something of the participants&#8217; lived experience. Through a process of writing, reflecting and re-writing the findings were refined and clarified over time. Everyday activity was found to be an important medium for change as well as a recovery outcome in itself. Findings add to existing understandings about occupation as a medium for healing and transformation within the context of recovery from mental illness. In particular, the study highlights the dynamics at play in different modes of doing and the way in which carers can influence the experience and meaning of activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Recovery</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Heidegger</field><field name="subject">Occupation</field><field name="subject">Meaningful activity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imaginative travel: experiential aspects of user interactions with destination marketing websites</field><field name="creator">West-Newman, Timothy</field><field name="description">In this thesis a discursive examination of backpacker attitudes towards and use of a New Zealand tourism website, based on their own accounts of their experiences of using the web for travel, offers a contribution to existing knowledge about human computer interaction. The study enhances current understandings of the processes through which backpackers interact with travel websites by including the social and personal context of their experience.  Analysing interview data on user attitudes and behaviour, it argues the importance of taking into account the use-context of human computer interactions. Placing participants&#8217; interaction with the newzealand.com website within themes of imagination, emotional engagement, and authenticity in experience allows an exploration of such context.  It demonstrates that backpackers&#8217; engagement with websites is shaped not only by their material circumstances but by their attitudes to travel in general, their assumptions and feelings about New Zealand as a place, and as a site for their own experiences.  The research applies usability techniques and methods to observe and inquire into tourists&#8217; experiential interaction with a destination website.  The emotional, affective, reflective and behavioural aspects of tourists&#8217; decision making processes are studied in order to show how websites, as a medium of communication, evoke users&#8217; travel imaginings.  In this way the study contributes to research into tourists&#8217; web-related motivation and behaviour. In addition, by applying discursive, performative, and experiential lenses drawn from travel research to human-computer interaction, it augments current research techniques for studying the social effects of virtual technology and web related human behaviour. The thesis explores themes of representation of place and self in relation to backpacker experiences and frames them in terms of authenticity and trust. It argues that in navigating places, backpackers seek authentic experiences and that this notion of authenticity is mediated by their encounters with other travellers, locals, tourism providers, as well as books, television and the Internet. Websites as travel information sources shape how backpackers think about their tourist experiences; to do this effectively, what the site presents must resonate with the backpacker&#8217;s views on how they think those experiences should be.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experiential</field><field name="subject">User interactions</field><field name="subject">Destination marketing</field><field name="subject">Websites</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between organizational fitness and business performance: specific evidence for SMEs</field><field name="creator">Young, Stuart Ian</field><field name="description">In today&#8217;s technological environment, organizational capabilities for managing change are regarded as important for business survival and growth. In particular, dynamic organizational capabilities have attracted considerable research interest over the past decade. Recently several studies have suggested that dynamic capabilities may be associated with a concept termed organizational fitness. What is not clear in this emerging research stream is whether firms with superior organizational fitness are more likely to prosper than unfit firms. In addition, relatively little attention has been directed toward creating a systemic model of dynamic capabilities that explains organizational fitness. The nature of fitness has been intensively debated in the biological sciences over a period of several decades. A confusing variety of fitness definitions have emerged from this literature. The lack of an agreed definition of fitness has resulted in several streams of research on organizational fitness. As a result of this fragmentation, there has been little progress toward answering the question of how to measure organizational fitness. The fragmentation in organizational fitness literature is problematic, because research into the relationship between organizational fitness and firm performance is not well-advanced. In this study, organizational fitness is defined in terms of organizational capability to produce variation. By defining fitness in this way, the tautological criticisms leveled against existing concepts of fitness are avoided. The definition of fitness proposed here accommodates both an evolutionary learning perspective and a perspective of strategic management, and thus reflects an integrative approach to the concept. A notable feature of the literature exploring organizational fitness is that it has been focused on large corporations. However, a growing body of literature suggests that SMEs are different from large firms and need to be examined in their own right.  SMEs are important contributors to business in most countries throughout the world.  This study addresses that perceived gap in the literature and asks: What relationship, if any, is there between organizational fitness and business performance for SMEs? Theory is developed and tested here by means of a large sample of SMEs in New Zealand. Two distinct aspects of organizational fitness are identified for SMEs. First, survival fitness is associated with generic combinative capabilities. Second, growth fitness is associated with knowledge assimilation and transformation. SME growth fitness and survival fitness are each found to be positively related to business performance under a variety of contexts. Further, an increase of growth fitness and survival fitness provides a means of alleviating selection pressures for SMEs. That is, dynamic capabilities of knowledge assimilation and integration are found to be positively associated with SME business performance.   In contrast to studies that advocate SME development of context-dependent capabilities, the findings of this study suggest an alternative perspective: variable selection pressures can be influenced by SMEs with a high level of survival and growth fitness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SEM Structural equation modeling</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Organisational fitness</field><field name="subject">Variation</field><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">Small to medium sized enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RugbySmart: the development, delivery and evaluation of a nationwide injury prevention programme</field><field name="creator">Quarrie, Kenneth Lincoln</field><field name="description">This thesis represents my research work relating to rugby union from 2000 to 2007. During this time I was the Manager of Injury Prevention and Research for the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU). The main priorities of this role were to increase understanding of risk factors for rugby injury, to implement preventive measures, and to assess the effect of those preventive measures. The thesis is presented as a series of peer-reviewed, published papers. A key concern of the NZRU when I undertook the role was to decrease the number and severity of spinal cord injuries occurring in New Zealand rugby. The first paper is a review of literature of rugby union injuries to the cervical spine and spinal cord. This paper was published in Sports Medicine, and the knowledge derived there from formed an important element in RugbySmart, which was the nationwide injury prevention partnership between the NZRU and ACC. The second paper, which was published in the British Medical Journal, outlines the effect of RugbySmart on serious spinal injuries in New Zealand. Eight spinal injuries occurred in New Zealand in 2001-2005, whereas the predicted number based on previous incidence was 19 (relative rate 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.14). The main reason for the decline was a decrease in the number of injuries from scrums, from a predicted number of nine only one was observed (relative rate 0.11; 0.02 to 0.74). Injury prevention initiatives in New Zealand appear to have been successful in areas beyond spinal injuries. The third paper deals with the effect of RugbySmart in general. RugbySmart was associated with a decrease in injury claims per 100,000 players in most areas the programme targeted; the programme had negligible impact on non-targeted injury sites. The decrease in injury claims numbers was supported by results from player behaviour surveys pre- and post-RugbySmart. There was an increase in safe behaviour in the contact situations of tackle, scrum and ruck technique. The fourth paper, which was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, examines the effect of mandating mouth guard usage on mouth guard wearing rates and ACC dental injury claim rates. The self reported rate of mouth guard use was 67% of player-weeks in 1993 and 93% in 2003. A total of 2644 claims were reported in 1995. There was a 43% (90% confidence interval 39% to 46%) reduction in dental claims from 1995 to 2003. On the reasonable assumption that the number of players and player-matches remained constant throughout the study period, the relative rate of injury claims for non-wearers versus wearers was 4.6 (90% confidence interval 3.8 to 5.6). In New Zealand the tackle is the facet of play associated number of injuries, and over the past decade tackles have overtaken scrums as the cause of the greatest proportion of spinal injuries. To address the lack of knowledge regarding risk factors for injuries in the tackle, a large scale study of tackles in professional rugby matches was undertaken. In 434 matches, over 140,000 tackles were coded. The impact of the tackle was the most common cause of injury, and the head was the most common site, but an important mechanism of lower limb injuries was loading with the weight of another player. Rates of replacement increased with increasing player speed. The resulting paper was published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine. A commonly cited model of injury causation in sport posits that risk factors for injury can be considered as those related to the athlete (intrinsic) and those related to the activity (extrinsic). To examine the extent to which the activities comprising rugby matches at the international level has changed over time the first match in each Bledisloe Cup series from 1972 to 2004 was coded. Increases in passes, tackles, rucks, tries, and ball-in-play time were associated with the advent of professionalism, whereas there were reductions in the numbers of lineouts, mauls, kicks in play, and in mean participation time per player. Noteworthy time trends were an increase in the number of rucks and a decrease in the number of scrums. With the advent of professionalism, players have become heavier and backs have become taller.  A number of articles written to communicate injury prevention messages to rugby union coaches, players and administrators are presented as appendices, along with two peer reviewed papers that closely relate to the thesis, but which I excluded from the thesis proper.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rugby</field><field name="subject">Injuries</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Mouth guards</field><field name="subject">Accident Compensation Corporation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the development of a Creativity Support Tool for advertising</field><field name="creator">Opas, Tommi</field><field name="description">In recent years, there has been a strong interest in developing Creativity Support Tools for many exciting areas of research such as art and music. Yet few such tools have been developed to support creativity in advertising. This is unusual since advertising, like art and music, is a highly creative endeavour of the human mind. The goal of advertising is to transform a communicational objective of a product or a service into a creative idea. A tool that would enhance the development of creative ideas in advertising would be highly beneficial for the advertising industry and possibly shed light on the mystery behind creativity. In this thesis, I developed Creative Pad, a new Creativity Support Tool to assist advertising creative in generating creative ideas for advertising. In developing Creative Pad, I studied advertising creativity and human creative thinking. I developed a framework for analysing the advertising process, in which the process is viewed as having three distinct phases: a message, an idea, and an execution. A significant implication of this view is that the process for developing ideas for new advertisements and the process of executing those ideas and turning them into creative products are independent. Each step is the result of a significant creative process. Creative Pad is developed to assist in the development of creative ideas for new advertisements. To assist this creativity, relevant triggers are needed. Research has shown that individuals with high associative skills produce more creative advertising. Creative Pad supports the associative skills of the advertising creative and exploits the use of the Internet as a dynamic database. It finds words and sentences related to the original communicational objective, providing relevant triggers for the associative creative process in the minds of the advertising creative. Several experiments using Creative Pad were conducted with advertising creative and students with no advertising background. The results show that Creative Pad supports the generation of new ideas in two ways. First, and most important, all the subjects were able to develop interesting new ideas. In particular, the advertising creative were able to design a sketch of the advertisement from ideas generated using Creative Pad. Second, I was able to find a connection between the triggers, the words and sentences selected by the user during the creative process, and the ideas generated. Although the connection might be considered a weak one, it nonetheless demonstrates that a connection exists between the ideas developed by the advertising creative and those suggested by Creative Pad.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creativity support tool</field><field name="subject">Advertising</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Creativity</field><field name="subject">Idea generation</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Web 2.0</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The shaping of decision-making in governance in the New Zealand Public Healthcare Services</field><field name="creator">Mathias, Wanda Lee</field><field name="description">The study explores what shapes decision-making in governance in the New Zealand public healthcare services. It contributes to the understanding of the impact of the beliefs, perceptions and roles of the decision-makers and the tensions in public healthcare services in New Zealand. The focus was on ascertaining the characteristics of the people as individuals and as members of groups, their skills, preparation and the experience required to make governance decisions in healthcare services in New Zealand. The research analysed data from interviews with individuals in senior positions in public healthcare services in New Zealand, focus groups made up from those individuals and observations of formal District Health Board (DHB) meetings. The context for the study is the New Zealand public healthcare services within the DHB model. This study focuses on the organisational and operational aspects of governance from the socio-anthropological viewpoint of Pierre Bourdieu. Bourdieu&#8217;s methodology was chosen as it highlights the interaction of power and the management of tension between individuals and groups in different, but abutting, fields of practice. Using Bourdieu&#8217;s methodology the researcher has placed healthcare services in an economy of political power where the capital individuals and groups bring to an environment is demonstrated through their power and influence within a particular field of practice. In this study the field of practice is governance in New Zealand public healthcare services. The method involved purposive sampling of participants from three DHBs. The participants included appointed and elected members, chairmen, chief executives and senior clinicians from medical and nursing cohorts. The participants identified 22 abstracts which determined the shape of their decision-making. Through analysis and reflection these 22 determinants were organised into groups reflecting the generic principles of governance identified in the literature. The study concludes that decision-making in governance is shaped by the concepts of professional maturity, quality and safety, power and tension and fiduciary duty within the context of structure and time. The scope of governance is connected across healthcare organisations by the tension of power manifested through the capital individuals and groups bring to the interaction or field of practice. The study also found that there are two aspects to decision-making in governance which allow transferability of the concepts of governance across healthcare service organisations. Firstly, governance is decision-making in good faith with independence of mind and with the appropriate skills, diligence and care on behalf of others. Secondly, the structures of governance operationalised in audit, laws, guidelines, codes and principles support the decision-making on behalf of others. Consequently, the rules of decision-making in governance in healthcare services are the same whether the decision is being made in a clinical or corporate environment. They are enacted differently because of the different contexts. The study brings together the determinants in their concept groups into a framework in the context of structure and time. Use of the framework will enable those with governance responsibilities to shape their governance decision-making from an informed and common base which recognises the tensions in the field of healthcare services governance.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Bourdieu</field><field name="subject">Health care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The theory of navigating cultural spaces</field><field name="creator">Nayar, Shoba</field><field name="description">Indian immigrant women are a growing minority group within the multicultural spaces of New Zealand society. Despite Indian immigrants being the second largest, and one of the oldest, Asian immigrant groups to this country, their experiences of settling in a new and unfamiliar environment have been largely overlooked. This grounded theory study using dimensional analysis was aimed at answering the question: &#8216;How do Indian immigrant women engage in occupations when settling in a new environment?&#8217; In-depth interviews and observations of participants performing daily occupations were conducted with 25 Indian immigrant women living in one of three cities/towns located in the North Island of New Zealand. Theoretical sampling with constant comparative analysis was used to guide both ongoing data collection and data analysis. Categories were examined for their relationships and dimensions to arrive at a substantive grounded theory which has been named &#8216;Navigating Cultural Spaces&#8217;. Performing occupations that reflected either the Indian or New Zealand cultures, or a combination of the two, were core elements in how Indian immigrant women settled in New Zealand. These ways of doing everyday tasks have been conceptualised as Working with Indian Ways, Working with New Zealand Ways and Working with the Best of Both Worlds. Working from each of these perspectives, the women sought to Create a Place in which they could &#8216;be Indian&#8217; in a &#8216;New Zealand&#8217; context. In order to achieve the purpose of Creating a Place, Indian immigrant women constantly shifted between the three ways of working; thus, performing occupations that allowed them to reveal as much of their Indian culture as they felt comfortable with at any given time and situation. Their actions were influenced by the people, objects and social spaces that constituted the environment in which they engaged in occupations. The significance of this study is that it reveals how the everyday occupations of Indian immigrant women are constantly modified through their interaction and interpretations of the environment, thus allowing them to move between and within the multicultural spaces of New Zealand society. This gives rise to Navigating Cultural Spaces which frames settlement as an ongoing and dynamic process and challenges the applicability of current models of acculturation in a New Zealand context. It is recommended that future research examines the migration process from an occupational perspective in order to assist with the development of migration policy and support services that best facilitate Indian immigrant women Creating a Place in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Acculturation</field><field name="subject">Indian</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Occupation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leiopelma hochstetteri Fitzinger 1861 (Anura: Leiopelmatidae) habitat ecology in the Waitakere Ranges, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Najera-Hillman, Eduardo</field><field name="description">Declines and extinctions of amphibian populations are a global dilemma with complex local causes, which should be viewed in the context of a much larger biodiversity crisis. As other animal groups, amphibians with restricted distributions, such as island endemics, are thought to be more vulnerable to environmental change and susceptible to population declines. In the New Zealand archipelago, the only four native species of frogs (Leiopelma hochstetteri, L. archeyi, L. hamiltoni and L. pakeka) are classified as threatened. In particular Leiopelma hochstetteri, the most widespread and abundant endemic frog species in New Zealand, now survives only in spatially fragmented populations as a result of direct or indirect human activity. Hence, it is recognised as threatened and fully protected by legislation. In the last fifty years, some L. hochstetteri populations have been studied, providing descriptive information, which may be used to assess the current status (increasing, stable or declining) of previously or never monitored populations. This thesis examines the diet and trophic level, the effects ship rats (Rattus rattus) as well as the distribution and abundance of L. hochstetteri on a habitat-use context, to provide a basis for evaluating conceivable decline-agents, and to establish a platform to design directed conservation strategies. The Waitakere Ranges are considered a Leiopelma hochstetteri conservation management unit, on which L. hochstetteri has been previously studied. This area consists of a series of hills that run roughly north&#8211;south, which are mostly covered in regenerating indigenous vegetation. Today, 60% of the Waitakere Ranges fall within a Regional Park, which together with its surrounding residential areas is afforded protection to minimise the effects of development on the region. The accessibility and conservation character of this area makes it an ideal area for the study of L. hochstetteri populations. As a first step to characterise the diet and trophic level of L. hochstetteri within streams in the Waitakere Ranges, Auckland, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were undertaken on a variety of sympatric terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal species, including adult frogs. These results showed that: 1) aquatic and terrestrial food webs were linked by terrestrial inputs into the stream; 2) invertebrate and vertebrate predators separated well into distinct trophic groups; and 3) L. hochstetteri occupied an intermediate trophic position among predators, with a diet, at least as an adult, comprising terrestrial invertebrates. Shortfin eels and banded kokopu were identified as potential predators of L. hochstetteri, but data for rats were inconclusive. The inconclusiveness of these trophic studies, with regard to the effects of ship rats on L. hochstetteri populations, lead me to evaluate the influence of a seven-year ship rat management operation on frog abundance. To achieve a reliable evaluation, the habitat characteristics that had significant influence on frog abundance were identified. Then, it was confirmed that the study areas represented similar habitats in terms of those variables, and finally the effect of the pest-management activities was evaluated. Presence/absence of pest-management operations did not have a significant effect on frog abundance. These results, together with the results of the diet and trophic level analyses, suggested that ship rats do not represent a significant threat for this frog species, at least in the Waitakere Ranges. The results of distribution and abundance investigations indicated that in the Waitakere Ranges frogs are currently widely distributed, relatively abundant and that recruitment has occurred at least in the last ten years. Additionally, in order to identify associations between habitat characteristics and frog distribution and abundance, reliable and specifically designed monitoring methodologies were developed. Although this frog is known to occur in wet areas adjacent to shaded streams in forested catchments, quantitative ecological data previously did not exist to enable characterisation of its habitat. Here, novel data were reported on the current distribution and habitat requirements of this species in the Waitakere Ranges. Statistical modelling demonstrates frogs most likely occur in small, erosive streams with coarse substrates and cold waters, surrounded by mature or undisturbed riparian vegetation, where higher abundances of frogs may be found in steep areas with stable patches of cobbles and boulders lying against larger stream bed elements within the stream channel. Anthropogenic activities, such as clearing or logging, and upstream disturbances that potentially increase silt input into streams were identified as threats to these frog species. Finally, the habitat-use information gathered during this investigation was utilised to develop a spatial decision support system (SDSS) as a tool to assess the quality and quantity of habitat available to L. hochstetteri populations associated with the Auckland Region. These results have important implications for the conservation of New Zealand native frog species and riparian stream habitat.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Habitat-use</field><field name="subject">Frogs</field><field name="subject">Leiopelma</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Diet</field><field name="subject">Decision support system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pacific business sustainability in New Zealand: a study of Tongan experiences</field><field name="creator">Prescott, Semisi Manisela</field><field name="description">Pacific business sustainability in New Zealand is important for the economic and social wellbeing of the Pacific Island people who have chosen New Zealand as their home. As with many ethnic minorities businesses overseas, Pacific businesses struggle to survive in a foreign commercial environment that is often not aligned to the value systems and customs of their country of origin. This study seeks to determine the key financial and entrepreneurial drivers of business sustainability for Tongan businesses as a specific group within the Pacific Island business sector. The study takes an ethnic specific view of business sustainability drawing on the experiences of twenty Tongan businesses, three Pacific business consultants and the wider Tongan community.  The data was captured in a series of talanoa sessions (a traditional and preferred form of communication based on face to face discussion) carried out in 2006 and 2007. Throughout the study, attention was given to Tongan protocols, cultural nuances and sensitivities to ensure the context in which these Tongan businesses operate was captured. The study concludes by making several contributions to the literature. The first includes the contribution to methodology through to use of talanoa in a business context. The second is the contribution to embeddedness theory through the analysis of specific Tongan business experiences and lastly the empirical contribution to the Pacific Island business literature. The findings have been analysed from a number of perspectives including; financial accounting, business finance, management accounting and business related challenges. The empirical findings highlight that differences in culture and traditional Tongan protocols influence business practice. The impact of Tongan culture on business sustainability is both complementary and inimical. Tongan business sustainability in New Zealand is therefore a product of business practices that incorporate embedded Tongan culture and the western commercial paradigms within which they operate.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tonga</field><field name="subject">Small business</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Talanoa</field><field name="subject">Embeddedness</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving connectionist systems for adaptive decision support with application in ecological data modelling</field><field name="creator">Soltic, Snjezana</field><field name="description">Ecological modelling problems have characteristics both featured in other modelling fields and specific ones, hence, methods developed and tested in other research areas may not be suitable for modelling ecological problems or may perform poorly when used on ecological data. This thesis identifies issues associated with the techniques typically used for solving ecological problems and develops new generic methods for decision support, especially suitable for ecological data modelling, which are characterised by: (1) adaptive learning, (2) knowledge discovery and (3) accurate prediction. These new methods have been successfully applied to challenging real world ecological problems. Despite the fact that the number of possible applications of computational intelligence methods in ecology is vast, this thesis primarily concentrates on two problems: (1) species establishment prediction and (2) environmental monitoring. Our review of recent papers suggests that multi-layer perceptron networks trained using the backpropagation algorithm are most widely used of all artificial neural networks for forecasting pest insect invasions. While the multi-layer perceptron networks are appropriate for modelling complex nonlinear relationships, they have rather limited exploratory capabilities and are difficult to adapt to dynamically changing data. In this thesis an approach that addresses these limitations is proposed. We found that environmental monitoring applications could benefit from having an intelligent taste recognition system possibly embedded in an autonomous robot. Hence, this thesis reviews the current knowledge on taste recognition and proposes a biologically inspired artificial model of taste recognition based on biologically plausible spiking neurons. The model is dynamic and is capable of learning new tastants as they become available. Furthermore, the model builds a knowledge base that can be extracted during or after the learning process in form of IF-THEN fuzzy rules. It also comprises a layer that simulates the influence of taste receptor cells on the activity of their adjacent cells. These features increase the biological relevance of the model compared to other current taste recognition models. The proposed model was implemented in software on a single personal computer and in hardware on an Altera FPGA chip. Both implementations were applied to two real-world taste datasets.In addition, for the first time the applicability of transductive reasoning for forecasting the establishment potential of pest insects into new locations was investigated. For this purpose four types of predictive models, built using inductive and transductive reasoning, were used for predicting the distributions of three pest insects. The models were evaluated in terms of their predictive accuracy and their ability to discover patterns in the modelling data. The results obtained indicate that evolving connectionist systems can be successfully used for building predictive distribution models and environmental monitoring systems. The features available in the proposed dynamic systems, such as on-line learning and knowledge discovery, are needed to improve our knowledge of the species distributions. This work laid down the foundation for a number of interesting future projects in the field of ecological modelling, robotics, pervasive computing and pattern recognition that can be undertaken separately or in sequence.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolving connectionist systems</field><field name="subject">Local modelling</field><field name="subject">Transductive reasoning</field><field name="subject">Spiking neural networks</field><field name="subject">Taste recognition systems</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The measurement of the performance of New Zealand tertiary education institutions and the demand for their services</field><field name="creator">Smart, Warren</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the measurement of performance of New Zealand tertiary education institutions (TEIs) and the demand for their services. This involved analysing the research performance of New Zealand universities, analysing the productive efficiency of New Zealand TEIs and examining the choice of provider by bachelor&#8217;s degree starters. Bibliometric data was used to measure the research productivity of New Zealand universities. This showed that following a fall during the early 2000s, the research productivity of New Zealand universities increased following the introduction of the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF). A multi-dimensional analysis of university research performance between 2000 and 2005 showed that no individual university was top in all four of the performance measures assessed. The overall performance of three universities, Massey University, Lincoln University and Auckland University of Technology, were noticeably below that of the other five universities. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was then applied to input and output data of New Zealand TEIs to analyse their productive efficiency. In 2006, polytechnics that had: low levels of bachelor&#8217;s degree provision, were not regionally based, had a high proportion of subcontracting and were larger institutions, achieved higher levels of pure technical efficiency. The analysis showed that several polytechnics could improve their technical efficiency by reducing their scale of operations. In polytechnics, higher technical efficiency was associated with better financial performance. A number of technically efficient polytechnics struggled financially, indicating that the overall efficiency of the polytechnic sector was not high, or the funding model they operate under is not appropriate. The analysis also showed that decreasing bachelor&#8217;s degree provision, poor financial performance in the previous year, an increase in provision of community education, was associated with higher growth in total factor productivity between 1996 and 2006. The application of DEA to Australasian university data between 1997 and 2005 showed that New Zealand universities performed relatively well in terms of relative pure technical efficiency, compared with their Australian counterparts. However, the total factor productivity of New Zealand universities increased at a lower rate, on average, than that of the Australian Group of Eight and newer Australian universities. The application of DEA to a dataset of the participating TEIs in the PBRF showed that polytechnics had lower technical efficiency, on average, than other TEIs. The choices of bachelor&#8217;s degree starters in 2006 were analysed for evidence of a lack of parity of esteem between university and polytechnic degrees. The results showed that a lack of parity of esteem between polytechnic and university degrees may be influencing student choices. Students from higher deciles schools, with higher secondary school qualifications, Asians, students who travel for study, were all more likely to enrol in a university to start a bachelor&#8217;s degree. There was less clear cut evidence of a lack of parity of esteem between selected groupings of New Zealand universities. However, there did appear to be a lack of parity of esteem between the four older metropolitan universities and the two newest universities, with signs the former were held in higher esteem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tertiary education institutions</field><field name="subject">Research productivity</field><field name="subject">Data envelopment analysis</field><field name="subject">Technical efficiency</field><field name="subject">Total factor productivity</field><field name="subject">Parity of esteem</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ankle sprains: an investigation into patient perceptions and performance of physical tasks following acute ankle sprains using a mixed methods approach</field><field name="creator">Larmer, Peter John</field><field name="description">Introduction: Ankle injuries are among the most prevalent acute musculoskeletal injuries, and are a significant burden on any health system. The interaction of the physiotherapist with the patient and their mutual understanding of impairments, function and recovery are important to achieving a satisfactory return to work and leisure activities.  To date, little attention has focused on this interaction.   There is a need for further exploration of differences and associations between outcome questionnaires that investigate similar domains of pain and function, and whether scores from such outcome measures are related to the patient&#8217;s perception of function and recovery.  Of further interest is whether there are relationships between impairment measures and perceived function, and how actual performance of tasks might influence the patients understanding of their capabilities. To provide a more complete picture of these relationships, a &#8216;mixed methods&#8217; approach using qualitative research methods within a quantitative study was thought to be most appropriate. The overall aim of this thesis was to utilise this research approach to investigate patients&#8217; perceptions of their recovery and elucidate factors important to both therapists and patients that ultimately might enhance their understanding of recovery from an ankle injury. Literature reviews: Three literature reviews were undertaken. Firstly a review of systematic reviews investigating ankle sprains identified a wide variety of management strategies. There was a lack of strong evidence to support any particular management strategy. Hence clinicians are likely to have difficulty setting appropriate rehabilitation plans. Secondly a critical review identified a number of different outcome questionnaires that were utilised to gauge recovery level; however, justification for their selection was often lacking. This review also identified that little emphasis was placed on understanding the patients&#8217; perception of their injury and the rehabilitation process. A final critical review investigated impairment and performance measures and identified four specific areas that were focused upon by clinicians during the treatment of ankle sprains: joint position sense, postural control, strength and performance during function. However, only weak evidence was found for there being a deficit in joint position sense, postural control and strength in the injured limb following an ankle sprain, and inconclusive evidence of deficits in physical performance of tasks related to function.  Methods: Forty participants with an acute sprained ankle were recruited along with their treating physiotherapist. The participants completed a Global questionnaire, the Lower Limb Task Questionnaire (LLTQ) and the Short Form -36 (SF-36) Questionnaire at the initial visit, at discharge and at a six week follow up visit where they also undertook impairment testing involving, joint position sense, postural control and strength along with a functional performance test and selected functional activities. Ten participants were purposefully selected to undertake semi-structured interviews. The treating physiotherapists completed global questionnaires at the initial visit and at time of discharge. An interpretive hermeneutic approach was undertaken to examine the participants&#8217; perceptions. Results: There were equal numbers of males and female participants and the average age of participants was 30.5 years. The relationship between questionnaires for the domains of pain and function varied between low and high degrees of association. The global limitations scores between the participants and physiotherapists were similar at the initial visit, whereas on discharge the participants had a significantly lower score (p&lt;0.05) compared to the physiotherapists. With respect to impairment testing, there was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between the uninjured limb compared to the injured limb for the joint position sense and performance agility hop test. All other comparisons of impairments were not significant (p&gt;0.05). There was no association between questionnaire scores and impairment measures (p&gt;0.05). Additionally there were no significant associations between previous injury and questionnaire scores and impairment measures. Finally in relation to the performance of specific functional tests there was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between the six week follow up LLTQ score and the score following actual performance of the test. The findings of the participants&#8217; interviews identified three key concerns. Firstly, that participants have a limited understanding of questionnaires, and secondly, that there is a difference in understanding of &#8216;recovery&#8217; between the therapist and the patient at time of discharge. Thirdly, there was dissociation between outcome measures and the patient&#8217;s perception of their own recovery. Conclusions: This study revealed a lack of understanding and effective communication concerning physiotherapy practice in relation to ankle sprains. It was apparent that questionnaires purporting to measure similar constructs are at times dissimilar in scores and are not related strongly. Care needs to be taken in selecting and interpreting outcome measures particularly in relation to questionnaires. It was also apparent that caution should be exercised when considering the influence of impairment measures upon function. Physiotherapists should be aware that patients may perceive a lack of confidence in their level of function at the time of discharge. As a result physiotherapists need to incorporate strategies to improve patient confidence in their management plan.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankle sprain</field><field name="subject">Outcomes</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Mixed methods</field><field name="subject">Functional measures</field><field name="subject">Questionnaires</field><field name="subject">Perceived function</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism industry responses to the rise of sustainable tourism and related environmental policy initiatives: the case of Hue City, Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Bui, Duc Tinh</field><field name="description">Tourism is promoted by the governments of many developing countries because it offers the potential for creating jobs, thus generating income for the country and revenue for the government. However, the tourism industry can also be viewed as a destructive force, associated with negative externalities such as the loss of natural landscapes, congestion, and environmental and cultural degradation. These problems are more likely to be exacerbated where there is a lack of well-designed planning and effective management of tourism development. An essential component of any management of tourism is the ability to engage with, and get a positive response from, the tourism industry. There are a wide range of enterprises involved in providing tourist products and experiences, and in many nations, both developing and developed, a large number of these businesses are small and medium in size and tend to operate at a local scale. The informal nature of tourism enterprises in the developing world can make it difficult to spread awareness of tourism policy and to measure moves towards more sustainable performance on the part of the industry. Using the case study of tourism in the city of Hue, this thesis argues that it is essential to understand both what tourism enterprises know about sustainable tourism practice and policy and also how they respond to its adoption, if we are to more fully understand tourism and its links to sustainable economic development. Located on the central northern coast of Vietnam, Hue is well known for its cultural resources and natural beauty, and the province has become a major tourism centre in Vietnam. The city of Hue itself is recognized as having international heritage value and was listed as a world cultural heritage site by UNESCO in 1993. During the last decade, tourism revenues have increased by nearly 35% per annum, and Hue has made great efforts to both stimulate and cater for increasing demand for its tourism products and services. The Vietnamese government has introduced a number of policies designed to enhance environmental quality generally and, more specifically, to improve the sustainability of enterprises in the tourism sector. This thesis examines the degree to which tourism enterprises in the city of Hue are aware of the broad concept of sustainable tourism and of the specific legislation designed to influence the sustainability of their businesses. I examine the structure and make-up of the industry and then analyse whether characteristics such as size, ownership type and sectoral focus play a role in influencing awareness of, and response to, government policy. The research triangulates data-gathering methods: secondary data, literature reviews, semi-structured interviews and an enterprise survey are all used to gain insights into the core research questions. Each method feeds into and is strengthened by the others, and their combination (including 50 interviews and 180 survey responses) provides a robust data set to work from. The findings reveal that many of the firms operating in the Hue tourism industry are characterized by weak institutional practices, low financial capacity, poor facilities and a lack of broader awareness of policies that influence sustainable tourism practice. The tourism industry&#8217;s awareness of general sustainable development issues is low, and much business practice focuses on short-term rather than long-term perspectives. This limits the use of environmentally friendly practices by firms, especially small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs), in their daily business activities.  The study reveals that there is no significant variation in the adoption of sustainable tourism practices according to the size of enterprises, especially if the practices in question are simple and can be introduced with cost savings. However, as the cost and complexity of introducing environmental measures increases, we see a greater ability on the part of larger enterprises to adopt such actions &#8211; partly because they are in a stronger position to bear the short-terms costs of implementing such approaches. There are a wide range of factors that constrain the Hue tourism industry from adopting more sustainable tourism practices. Internal constraints such as limited financial and human resources are combined with external constraints such as increasing cost-based competition, the lack of enforcement of government policies, and limited awareness of sustainable tourism pracitces. All of these factors play a crucial role in shaping the actions of enterprises in relation to sustainable tourism practices and policies. The results of this study also point to the fact that government sustainable tourism initiatives that rely on &#8216;command-and-control&#8217; approaches will have limited effect; instead, a variety of institutional economic instruments offer greater potential to overcome deficiencies in the ability of the market to drive tourism enterprises towards more sustainable business practices. The thesis also argues that it is important to develop approaches that can cope with the special challenges attached to management of sustainable tourism development in destinations that are dominated by SMEs. The thesis contributes to the growing body of theory and literature in sustainable tourism development and tourism-enterprise behaviour. It also makes an important contribution to our understanding of tourism enterprises in the developing world. In particular, the findings add an important layer of understanding to those attempting to develop a more sustainable tourism industry in Vietnam. Specifically, it provides policy-makers with important insights into the ways in which different types of tourism enterprises respond to initiatives that relate to improved business sustainability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable tourism</field><field name="subject">Triangulation</field><field name="subject">Environmentally friendly practices</field><field name="subject">Tourism industry</field><field name="subject">Responses</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local and personalised models for prediction, classification and knowledge discovery on real world data modelling problems</field><field name="creator">Hwang, Yuan-Chun</field><field name="description">This thesis presents several novel methods to address some of the real world data modelling issues through the use of local and individualised modelling approaches. A set of real world data modelling issues such as modelling evolving processes, defining unique problem subspaces, identifying and dealing with noise, outliers, missing values, imbalanced data and irrelevant features, are reviewed and their impact on the models are analysed. The thesis has made nine major contributions to information science, includes four generic modelling methods, three real world application systems that apply these methods, a comprehensive review of the real world data modelling problems and a data analysis and modelling software. Four novel methods have been developed and published in the course of this study. They are: (1) DyNFIS &#8211; Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System, (2) MUFIS &#8211; A Fuzzy Inference System That Uses Multiple Types of Fuzzy Rules, (3) Integrated Temporal and Spatial Multi-Model System, (4) Personalised Regression Model. DyNFIS addresses the issue of unique problem subspaces by identifying them through a clustering process, creating a fuzzy inference system based on the clusters and applies supervised learning to update the fuzzy rules, both antecedent and consequent part. This puts strong emphasis on the unique problem subspaces and allows easy to understand rules to be extracted from the model, which adds knowledge to the problem. MUFIS takes DyNFIS a step further by integrating a mixture of different types of fuzzy rules together in a single fuzzy inference system. In many real world problems, some problem subspaces were found to be more suitable for one type of fuzzy rule than others and, therefore, by integrating multiple types of fuzzy rules together, a better prediction can be made. The type of fuzzy rule assigned to each unique problem subspace also provides additional understanding of its characteristics.  The Integrated Temporal and Spatial Multi-Model System is a different approach to integrating two contrasting views of the problem for better results. The temporal model uses recent data and the spatial model uses historical data to make the prediction. By combining the two through a dynamic contribution adjustment function, the system is able to provide stable yet accurate prediction on real world data modelling problems that have intermittently changing patterns. The personalised regression model is designed for classification problems. With the understanding that real world data modelling problems often involve noisy or irrelevant variables and the number of input vectors in each class may be highly imbalanced, these issues make the definition of unique problem subspaces less accurate. The proposed method uses a model selection system based on an incremental feature selection method to select the best set of features. A global model is then created based on this set of features and then optimised using training input vectors in the test input vector&#8217;s vicinity. This approach focus on the definition of the problem space and put emphasis the test input vector&#8217;s residing problem subspace. The novel generic prediction methods listed above have been applied to the following three real world data modelling problems: 1.	Renal function evaluation which achieved higher accuracy than all other existing methods while allowing easy to understand rules to be extracted from the model for future studies. 2.	Milk volume prediction system for Fonterra achieved a 20% improvement over the method currently used by Fonterra. 3.	Prognoses system for pregnancy outcome prediction (SCOPE), achieved a more stable and slightly better accuracy than traditional statistical methods. These solutions constitute a contribution to the area of applied information science. In addition to the above contributions, a data analysis software package, NeuCom, was primarily developed by the author prior and during the PhD study to facilitate some of the standard experiments and analysis on various case studies. This is a full featured data analysis and modelling software that is freely available for non-commercial purposes (see Appendix A for more details). In summary, many real world problems consist of many smaller problems. It was found beneficial to acknowledge the existence of these sub-problems and address them through the use of local or personalised models. The rules extracted from the local models also brought about the availability of new knowledge for the researchers and allowed more in-depth study of the sub-problems to be carried out in future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Local model</field><field name="subject">Personalised model</field><field name="subject">Predictive systems</field><field name="subject">Real world</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy inference system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the effectiveness of online groups: an investigation of storytelling in the facilitation of online groups</field><field name="creator">Thorpe, Stephen John</field><field name="description">Building relationships in the world of online groups is a recent, exciting and challenging area for the field of group facilitation. Evidence has shown that online groups with strong relationship links are more effective and more resilient than those with without them. Yet, the processes and techniques to effectively facilitate the building of these online relationships are not yet understood and there is scant empirical knowledge to assist practicing group facilitators in this important task. Challenges arise when many of the embodied aspects of inter-personal communication, such as body language, tone of voice, emotions, energy levels and context are not easily readable by group members and facilitators. Many of the well established group processes and interventions that facilitators rely upon in face-to-face situations do not translate effectively or are simply not available in an online group situation. Storytelling, however, presented one approach from the domain of face-to-face group facilitation that might translate well online. Storytelling is well known as an enabler for people to connect at a deeper and an embodied level. It can be highly effective at building strong social ties and group resilience &#8211; right across a wide range of settings. This thesis inquired into storytelling&#8217;s potential for online facilitation practice with the question of how is storytelling beneficial in building relationships in a facilitated online group? Starting with the premise that storytelling will be an effective approach, eighteen facilitators from the International Association of Facilitators (IAF) came together to collectively research the area using a participative approach. The intent of the approach was to involve online facilitation practitioners in the research so that their motivations, ways of looking at things, and questions could have value and that their experiences would be at the heart of the data generated. A variety of online software tools were used including: email, Skype&#8482; conferencing, telephone conferencing, video and web conferencing, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), blogging, online surveys and within the 3-D interactive world of Second Life&#8482;.  The study affirmed that storytelling assisted relationship development across a range of online settings. As anticipated, storytelling aided identity creation; scenario description; describing conflict and to articulate learning edges. The availability of an extra text channel during a primarily oral communication is seen as a potentially valuable contribution to the art of storytelling. In addition, the study offers a challenge to the storytelling field in proposing that direct contact between teller and listener is not always a priori requirement. The blending of roles raises some ethical challenges for online facilitation practice. The also inquiry confirmed that software tool selection was critical for ensuring full participation and buy-in to online group decisions. The 3-D, avatar-based medium of Second Life&#8482; assisted with emotional connections. A range of new opportunities emerged through co-researchers engaging with the research process that inform the practice of group facilitation. They expand the role and horizons of the online facilitator in relation to the wider profession of group facilitation. Reflections are made about the International Association of Facilitators Statement of Values and Code of Ethics for Group Facilitators and IAF Core Competencies and some guidelines for the practice of online facilitation are offered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Online</field><field name="subject">Groups</field><field name="subject">Facilitation</field><field name="subject">Storytelling</field><field name="subject">Relationship development</field><field name="subject">Co-operative inquiry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology based personalized modeling for chronic disease risk evaluation and knowledge discovery: an integrated approach</field><field name="creator">Verma, Anju</field><field name="description">Populations are aging and the prevalence of chronic disease, persisting for many years, is increasing. The most common, non-communicable chronic diseases in developed countries are; cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, obesity, arthritis and specific cancers. Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity have high prevalence and develop over the course of life due to a number of interrelated factors including genetic predisposition, nutrition and lifestyle. With the development and completion of human genome sequencing, we are able to trace genes responsible for proteins and metabolites that are linked with these diseases. A computerized model focused on organizing knowledge related to genes, nutrition and the three chronic diseases, namely, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity has been developed for the Ontology-Based Personalized Risk Evaluation for Chronic Disease Project. This model is a Prot&#233;g&#233;-based ontological representation which has been developed for entering and linking concepts and data for these three chronic diseases. This model facilitates to identify interrelationships between concepts. The ontological representation provides the framework into which information on individual patients, disease symptoms, gene maps, diet and life history can be input, and risks, profiles, and recommendations derived. Personal genome and health data could provide a guide for designing and building a medical health administration system for taking relevant annual medical tests, e.g. gene expression level changes for health surveillance. One method, called transductive neuro-fuzzy inference system with weighted data normalization is used to evaluate personalized risk of chronic disease. This personalized approach has been used for two different chronic diseases, predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease and predicting the risk of type 2 diabetes. For predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease, the National Nutrition Health Survey 97 data from New Zealand population has been used. This data contains clinical, anthropometric and nutritional variables. For predicting risk of type 2 diabetes, data from the Italian population with clinical and genetic variables has been used. It has been discovered that genes responsible for causing type 2 diabetes are different in male and female samples. A framework to integrate the personalized model and the chronic disease ontology is also developed with the aim of providing support for further discovery through the integration of the ontological representation in order to build an expert system in genes of interest and relevant dietary components.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Knowledge discovery</field><field name="subject">Chronic disease risk evaluation</field><field name="subject">Personalized modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audio segmentation, classification and visualization</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xin</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new approach to the visualization of audio files that simultaneously illustrates general audio properties and the component sounds that comprise a given input file. New audio segmentation and classification methods are reported that outperform existing methods. In order to visualize audio files, the audio is segmented (separated into component sounds) and then classified in order to select matching archetypal images or video that represent each audio segment and are used as templates for the visualization. Each segment's template image or video is then subjected to image processing filters that are driven by audio features. One visualization method reported represents heterogeneous audio files as a seamless image mosaic along a time axis where each component image in the mosaic maps directly to a discovered component sound. The second visualization method, video texture mosaics, builds on the ideas developed in time mosaics. A novel adaptive video texture generation method was created by using acoustic similarity detection to produce a resultant video texture that more accurately represents an audio file. Compared with existing visualization methods such as oscilloscopes and spectrograms, both approaches yield more accessible illustrations of audio files and are more suitable for casual and non expert users.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audio</field><field name="subject">Segmentation</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Visualization</field><field name="subject">Time mosaics</field><field name="subject">Video textures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mana W&#257;hine in Information Technology: Ng&#257; Kaiwhatu K&#257;kahu Me Te K&#257;kahu</field><field name="creator">Hamilton-Pearce, Janette</field><field name="description">This thesis argues for an Indigenous women&#8217;s cultural construction of information technology (IT).

The research aim is to identify the key discourses, principles and theories of Mana W&#257;hine for an Indigenous M&#257;ori women&#8217;s cultural construction of IT? IT has the cultural constructs of the dominant society, which design and shape it (Dirksen, 2001; Stewart, 1993).  The herstories of twenty-four Indigenous M&#257;ori women in IT provide lived experiences of colonising, decolonising and indigenising of IT.  The colonial oppression within IT education and the workplace underpin the hegemonic &#8216;geek neo-colonial male&#8217; culture.  Indigenous M&#257;ori women&#8217;s culture is constructed as the &#8216;Other&#8217;.  The Indigenous peoples&#8217; literature disregards gender and white women in IT literature disregard ethnicity, race and colonisation.  The joint effects of being Indigenous M&#257;ori women are fraught with complexity.  For Indigenous women to participate in IT means assimilating into geek neo-colonial and male beliefs maintaining culture-neutral ideology, as a new form of cultural imperialism.  Through such power relations, cultural identity is left at the door when entering IT where M&#257;ori women define themselves as the only lonely, the only Indigenous M&#257;ori woman. The decolonising and indigenising of IT is where M&#257;ori women assert their cultural rights to participate as Mana W&#257;hine in IT &#8211; Ng&#257; Kaiwhatu K&#257;kahu Me Te K&#257;kahu.  In future, research needs to assert that Indigenous women be first beneficiaries of IT (Kamira, 2000b).  Mana W&#257;hine deconstructs colonising and culture-neutral ideologies forming a localised view to indigenise IT for women.  IT cannot be at the expense of Mana W&#257;hine.  For the benefit of our people, children and ourselves, Mana W&#257;hine in IT will always fight for cultural survival.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous M&#257;ori Women</field><field name="subject">Mana W&#257;hine</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Colonising IT</field><field name="subject">Decolonising IT</field><field name="subject">Indigenising IT</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of bank lending in sustaining income/ wealth inequality in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Saliya, Candauda Arachchige</field><field name="description">The purpose of this PhD thesis is to make a contribution to existing knowledge in the field of critical accounting by studying credit mechanisms and their link to income/wealth inequality in Sri Lankan society and the role of accounting technology in facilitating such mechanisms. The literature review revealed that: a) Global inequality is aggravated by the disparity of economic development which is possible only through state intervention; b) Unemployment is considered as a dilemma for economic development in developing countries by most politicians/administrators/researchers; c) In any country, around 60-70 percent of employment is generated by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and; d) Their major problem is access to credit. This research was designed to find out how the credit system works and why certain SMEs do not have adequate access to credit to develop their businesses; to provide employment; to increase the share of national income to the lower income groups; to narrow down the gap between the rich and poor within and between countries. A case study research approach was followed to extract data on real-life experiences of the research participants. Reliability of data was ensured by using various verification techniques and maximum efforts were made to balance the two extremes of validity of the research; internal and external. The extent of representation by the cases and the bank was tested, and judged as high, with 12-14 characteristics common to the Sri Lankan credit culture and banking industry respectively. Marxian critical theories were used for theoretical guidance throughout the research. The three case studies provide empirical evidence for the existence of the discriminatory nature of credit decision-making where two credit applicants were successful but a third credit applicant failed in obtaining credit. It is contended that the two successful applicants were powerful enough to approach a more powerful bank Chairperson and to obtain credit outside the normal credit rules with the support of accounting technology and using masks such as patriotism and social responsibility. The other applicant, who was initially accommodated with credit at the lower level, could not convince the credit decision-makers at the higher level with expensive professionally prepared accounting reports. This applicant was not from an influential social network and could not reach the powerful credit decision-makers informally was rejected through strict application of credit rules. Deep analysis of these facts supports the Marxian claim that credit and exploitation mechanisms work towards concentration of wealth and sustaining income inequality. Credit decisions supply money to influential individuals and it is argued that such economic power enhances the social powerbase of those individuals, which in turn reinforces the propensity to make preferential credit decisions, thereby making them richer. In contrast, a lack of money translates into powerlessness, deprivation and exclusion from social activities for the majority of the poor. In this process opportunities are lost to disadvantaged social groups and this necessarily results in poor people&#8217;s economic status remaining stagnant. These power-driven, discriminatory decision-making systems not only restrict the availability of financial capital for feasible projects, but also deny credit to potential enterprises. Further, wasting resources on unfeasible projects, while ignoring the need for nurturing potentially viable projects, are a double blow to efforts towards employment generation and economic development and therefore, are detrimental to the economic well-being of the general population. These findings provide insight for policy formulators for more productive financial capital mobility systems in Sri Lanka. It is suggested that suitable State intervention in regulating SME financing could remove such credit-related obstacles to economic development, and work towards a fair distribution of economic benefits to the people in Sri Lanka and beyond.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Credit mechanism</field><field name="subject">Employment</field><field name="subject">Income Inequality</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Marxism</field><field name="subject">SMEs</field><field name="subject">Case-studies</field><field name="subject">Credit decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of accounting and accountants: an investigation into how and why these perceptions were formed</field><field name="creator">Wells, Paul K.</field><field name="description">There is growing concern that a widespread perception of accounting and accountants is discouraging individuals with the required skills and capabilities from entering the accounting profession. At the same time, an inappropriate perception may be attracting those who lack the required skills and capabilities. Research suggests that not only are perceptions of accounting and accountants very negative but that they may also be inaccurate and difficult to change. This thesis applies social psychology theory on stereotyping to assist in identifying why these perceptions are resistant to change. Stereotype theory suggests that strategies for changing perceptions are dependent on how and why the perceptions were formed. Through a questionnaire, this study sought to identify the perceptions and through interviews and focus groups, how and why they were formed. A questionnaire, interviews and focus groups were used to collect data from sixty-five people from four distinct groups. These groups included the general public, users of accounting services, young people making career decisions, and accountants themselves. Additional data was collected from a further three accounting educators. The application of stereotype theory has assisted in explaining why common perceptions of accounting and accountants have been so resistant to change and in identifying suitable intervention strategies. This study found that the perceptions people have of accounting and accountants are inaccurate. They are either too specific and hence unnecessarily restrictive and limiting, or alternatively the perceptions are so abstract and lacking in specificity that they are absorbed into a broader level category. In the first instance, a single experience is overgeneralised to represent a participant&#8223;s understanding of accounting. In the second instance, accounting is overgeneralised to represent all activity of the broader category label. That the accounting profession, in general, has appeared to make little effort to correct these inaccurate perceptions and has failed to disseminate more widely the findings from academic research is of concern. Overgeneralised perceptions of accounting and accountants were found to be resistant to change for a number of reasons. Participants who created a very broad category label to represent their abstract understanding of accounting usually lacked the motivation and/or cognitive capacity to add specificity to their understanding. On the other hand, participants who based their perceptions of accounting on single exemplar models lacked an understanding of the skills and capabilities that accountants possessed and how these competencies could serve them. The influence of the high school curriculum was a further reason that perceptions were resistant to change. When members of the wider community had studied accounting at high school, their understanding of accounting was narrowly focused on the scorekeeping role of accounting. The perceptions of people who had studied accounting at high school, both currently and in the past, were the most resistant to change. The following interventions to change the perceptions people have of accounting and accountants are proposed. First it is necessary for the professional associations to articulate clearly the advice from the academic community on how the role of accountants and the nature of accounting have changed and to increase the awareness of these changes among their members. It is then necessary to communicate this information to the public by aligning the diverse range of accounting outputs with individual goals while explaining how accountants&#8223; training has changed to accommodate these more diverse roles. Finally, it is necessary to reconsider how accounting should be taught at high school, providing less emphasis on the scorekeeping role of accountants and increasing the emphasis on how accounting impacts everyday life.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Perceptions</field><field name="subject">Stereotypes</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="subject">Accountants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unilateral conversations: the role of marked sentence initial elements in skilled senior secondary academic writing</field><field name="creator">Meyer, Heather</field><field name="description">This research is a practical attempt to develop academic writing pedagogy at secondary level in New Zealand because from interviews with teachers, personal experience and literature in the professional journal for teachers of English in New Zealand, English in Aotearoa, it appears that this would be a useful enterprise. Literature relating to this, and extending to the related contexts of the UK and Australia has been reviewed. The approach taken is an investigation of top-rated senior secondary writing in subject English, using elements of Hallidayan Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG). The concepts of SFG chiefly drawn upon, namely, Theme and linguistic metafunctions, and their application to the data are presented and explained. This grammatical model was chosen because it allows the interface of grammatical structure and linguistic function to be explored, which in turn permits insight into how the qualities of top-rated writing may be formulated grammatically. This insight may then become part of teaching resources in academic writing by way of both pre- and in-service training material for teachers. Over 100 top-rated English literature essays (graded by teachers) were collected from students, via their schools, so that the data obtained were authentic. Two samples were collected: timed and untimed writing. Each sentence of each essay was typed into one of nine Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, representing locations within the essay. The nine locations were: three introduction locations: initial sentence, medial sentences, terminal sentence; three paragraph locations (all paragraphs in the body of the essays, not introductions or conclusions): initial sentence, medial sentences, terminal sentence; and, three conclusion locations: initial sentence, medial sentences and terminal sentence. The initial grammatical elements and their metafunction(s) for each sentence were categorised. Percentages in each category for each location were calculated so that individual locations could be compared for grammatical and metafunctional characteristics. Grouped locations were also considered where this seemed felicitous; for instance, introductions were compared to conclusions or medial sentences compared to boundary sentences (initial and terminal). Comparisons were also made between the timed and untimed samples. The results showed that some grammatical structures could be associated with particular grouped locations and metafunctional characteristics were not independent of location. The research was also able to suggest grammatical means to achieve metafunctional effects that align with descriptors for writing given by examination boards. For example, clear, logical organisation of writing is highly valued by examination boards. This is achieved by means of elements that perform the textual linguistic metafunction. A variety of grammatical elements to perform this function and their most prominent locations were identified. It is intended that the findings may be a highly directed way to help teachers address some of the writing challenges faced by their students at secondary level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Secondary writing</field><field name="subject">Formal writing</field><field name="subject">Systemic functional grammar</field><field name="subject">Theme</field><field name="subject">Sentence initial elements</field><field name="subject">Linguistic metafunctions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk and resilience: the role of risk and protective factors in the lives of young people over time</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Peter Gordon</field><field name="description">In 1998, 12 students, aged 11-12 years, were identified by primary schools in a socially disadvantaged area of New Zealand as being at risk of negative life outcomes, as a consequence of known adversities in their lives. The students were interviewed, as were their parents and teachers, and they also completed learning assessments and measures of personal and social concerns. The purpose of these evaluations was to identify risk and protective factors in the young people&#8217;s lives, and to make estimations of personal resilience. In 2008, nine of the original study participants, who were now aged 21-22 years and in emerging adulthood, were located and were interviewed again. The assessments addressed the participant&#8217;s current circumstances, and what had happened for them over the last ten years. The interviews also asked the participants to reflect about 12 resilience dimensions that have been identified in the literature (Masten &amp; Coatsworth, 1998) and whether they considered that they were personally resilient. The recent interview data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (Smith &amp; Osborn, 2008). The individual analyses show a rich diversity of life paths and, as well, three sets of themes were identified across the case studies; and they are personal relationships, contexts of development (schooling and education, culture, religion, and jobs and careers), and personhood and identity. A resilience model was derived from the integration of the data from the first and second assessments with contemporary resilience studies and theorising. The central idea of the model is that resilient functioning is determined by the nature and quality of relationships within, and across, developmental settings. As a corollary, it is hypothesised that interpersonal relationships influence individual executive functioning, and emotional regulation in particular; and that these cognitive and affective capacities can translate into goal seeking and other constructive actions. The explanation of the resilience model leads onto recommendations for further research on relationships that enhance personal functioning. There are also suggestions for social policy that follow from the exposition, and some guidelines for professional practice with children and families.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Longitudinal study</field><field name="subject">Risk</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapists' experience of working with suicidal clients</field><field name="creator">Rossouw, Gabriel Johannes</field><field name="description">This study explores therapists' experience of working with suicidal clients. Using a Hermeneutic-phenomenological method informed by Heidegger [1889 &#8211; 1976] this study provides an understanding of the meaning of therapists' experiences from their perspective as mental health professionals in New Zealand. Study participants include thirteen therapists working as mental health professionals in District Health Boards from the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology and psychiatric nursing. Participants' narratives of their experiences of working with suicidal clients were captured via audio taped interviewing. These stories uncover the everyday realities facing therapists and provide an ontological understanding of their experiences working with suicidal clients in District Health Boards. The findings of this study identified three themes. All the participants experienced shock and surprise upon hearing their clients had committed suicide without presenting with signs and symptoms associated with suicidality in their assessment. All the participants experienced the responsibility of assessing suicidal clients and intervening to be a burden. Further, they suffered from guilt and fear of punishment in the aftermath of a client's suicide. They also found themselves in a professional and personal crisis as a result of their experiences and struggled to come to terms with events. This study has shown how these experiences could be understood by uncovering the perspectives therapists bring to working with suicidal clients. I have shown how mainstream prevention and intervention strategies follow on from the misrepresentation and misinterpretation of our traditional way of knowing what it means to be human. I show when therapists discover that phenomena are not necessarily what they appear to be they feel unsettled and confused about their responsibilities and what it means to live and die as a human being. The experience of being a therapist to a person who commits suicide has been revealed in this thesis to leave a profound legacy of guilt, doubt and fear. This thesis proposes that it may be time for the profession to care for its own that therapists in turn may not shy back from caring for and about the vulnerable other.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heideggerian Hermeneutic Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Therapists'</field><field name="subject">Work with suicide</field><field name="subject">Effect of client suicide on therapists</field><field name="subject">Suicide and supervision</field><field name="subject">Institutionalised care and suicide</field><field name="subject">Therapists'</field><field name="subject">Sense of responsibilty and suicide</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakapiri t&#257;tou, hei manaaki tangata, hei manaaki whenua. Effective governance for urban sustainability</field><field name="creator">Webster, Karen Lesley</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of local government elected members to progress urban sustainability, and the views of M&#257;ori leaders&#8217; on governance and sustainability. It is set within a wider context of local government reform and changing expectations of governance and captures a point in time in the evolution of P&#257;keh&#257; and M&#257;ori governance structures in Aotearoa New Zealand. The thesis contributes to the paucity of scholarship in these fields.  Local government has evolved from the early provincial legislatures, to acknowledge Te Tiriti o Waitangi and recognise the importance of sustainable development. The Local Government Act 2002 fundamentally changed the role and purpose of New Zealand local government. At the heart of both Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the LGA was the aspiration for community and M&#257;ori participation in local governance and progress towards sustainable development.  The &#8216;three-house concept&#8217; described in the Raukawa Trustees partnership-two cultures development model (Winiata 2005) and the Community Sector Taskforce (2006) model is reflected in the structure of this thesis. It provides for a P&#257;keh&#257; House, a Tikanga M&#257;ori House and a Treaty House &#8211; a conceptual space where M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; values and practices can come together in mutual respect. The P&#257;keh&#257; House of the thesis establishes a broader role for New Zealand elected members to promote urban sustainability by focusing on cross-sector collaboration and multi-level governance. While multi-level governing was found to be widespread across urban territorial authorities, an elected member focus on collaboration was notably absent. Aotearoa New Zealand&#8217;s urban local authorities had begun mainstreaming sustainable development practices. Environmental management and restoration activity was widespread. Initiatives progressing social and cultural well-being were gaining prominence. The Tikanga M&#257;ori House recognises that the LGA 2002 had failed to bring about transformation of M&#257;ori participation in local government. Where the M&#257;ori voice struggled to be heard, the Act&#8217;s discretionary provisions had tended to preserve the status quo. Two paths to the future are offered: firstly, constitutional change - a new system of local government that recognises the validity of tino rangatiratanga as an equal authority, which could be modeled on the working examples of Treaty-based governance presented in this thesis.  Secondly, improvements to the current system of local government are recommended. They are: - Hui and whanaungatanga, as a path to consensus decision-making. - Iwi authorities be recognised as local authorities, to provide opportunities for urban M&#257;ori to participate in local government. - The status of iwi management plans be lifted, and they be mandatory in the way that a district plan is mandatory. - The mana whenua relationship be strengthened to increase the capacity of mana whenua to consult with tauiwi in their rohe, and exercise kaitiakitanga and manaakitanga. These improvements need to be based on an effective parallel model of M&#257;ori representation, or M&#257;ori wards and seats. The Treaty House presents a case for strengthening a partnerships approach to governance. The effective inclusion of both P&#257;keh&#257; and M&#257;ori communities alike is identified as a prerequisite for further progress towards urban sustainability in Aotearoa New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Urban sustainability</field><field name="subject">Sutainable development</field><field name="subject">Elected member role</field><field name="subject">M&#257;ori</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology, mixed methods</field><field name="subject">Local government</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The motivations and investment preferences of Chinese investors who migrate to New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Su, Roger</field><field name="description">Chinese migrants play a serious role in their destination countries, and through demand, support high values in destination property and financial markets. Therefore, Chinese investors&#8217; investment motivations, preferences and behaviours have a significant impact on the New Zealand economy. The objectives of this research are: to investigate the preferences (what kind of investment assets they prefer) and the motivations (why they chose New Zealand as their investment destination) of Chinese migrant investors. The findings will be a useful element in explaining New Zealand&#8217;s economic development, and in making financial decisions. It also will be important for the development of New Zealand&#8217;s growing finance industry and equity market. The researcher collected data from 20 respondents who are Chinese migrant investors who have made New Zealand their home. The collected data examines investors&#8217; preferences and motivations, such as what kind of investment assets they prefer and the motivations which drive them to invest in New Zealand or elsewhere. Using a grounded theory methodology, the researcher draws some findings from the data analysis. Furthermore, using a constant comparative method, the researcher develops some preferred choices which explain Chinese migrant investors&#8217; investment preferences and motivations. The core findings (called phenomena or categories) of Chinese migrant investors&#8217; preferences and motivations in this study are listed below: &#61656; Home-bias investment behaviour &#8211; that is mainly China and New Zealand &#61656; Following past performance / herding behaviour &#61656; Seeking speculative opportunities &#8211; high return, high risk &#61656; Over confidence &#61656; Taxation evasion &#61656; Financial privacy Considering these core categories, the researcher re-tested and re-analysed all interview data. Two refined themes are drawn: 1. Chinese investors don&#8217;t understand investment; they seek speculative investment opportunities exemplifying non-professional opportunistic behaviours. 2. Chinese investors don&#8217;t take New Zealand as their preferred investment destination until they arrive in New Zealand. Finally, the researcher reconsiders both themes and other inferences, to develop a theory from the ground &#8211; exaggerated Chinese financial investment experiences are relayed to other Chinese, and influence investment preferences and motivations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese investors</field><field name="subject">Motivations</field><field name="subject">Preferences</field><field name="subject">Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Keep Sunday free: social engineering through shop trading hours in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Ann-Marie</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore Social Engineering and how marketing communications may be able to affect it. This research takes a step back from other research in the area and considers the decision makers behind Social Engineering, instead of Social Engineering interventions. One way for stakeholders to influence Social Engineering is through influencing the initial decision of which Social Engineering intervention to use. The influence of marketing communications is considered using diffusion theory, which uncovers how marketing communications diffuse through and influence a decision making group. First, the research uncovers the Social Engineering Decision Making Process. This is the decision making process of Governments for Social Engineering Decisions. The Social Engineering Decision Making Process is the combination of Podg&#243;recki&#8217;s Sociotechnical Paradigm (1990) and Roger&#8217;s Innovation Diffusion Process (2003). The research then explores this framework through its illustration in a retailing context. The Social Engineering intervention chosen for this research is the shop trading hour legislation in New Zealand. The Social Engineering decision studied is the decision to introduce Sunday trading through the Shop Trading Hours Act Repeal Act (1990). An historical analysis explores the Social Engineering of shop trading hours, in line with an Historical methodology and Constructivist and Hermeneutic viewpoint. This narrative is created through document analysis and semi-structured in-depth interviews with five different stakeholder groups from the decision to introduce Sunday trading. The historical narrative also illustrates the Social Engineering Decision Making Process. Lastly, to uncover the influence of marketing communications and the media on the Social Engineering Decision Making Process, a content analysis of marketing communications and media over the time of the decision to introduce Sunday trading occurs. Government discussions and reports regarding the decision are also analysed. If the communications influence the Government discussions, then their themes would be present in Government documents directly following the communications. The results lend support to the Social Engineering Decision Making Process. Results outline the aspects of the legislative process that reflect each stage of the Social Engineering Decision Making Process. Findings also find support for the influence of Marketing communications and media on the Government&#8217;s decision making. The three most effective times for stakeholders to try to influence the process, through either mass or interpersonal communications are also identified.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Social engineering</field><field name="subject">Diffusion</field><field name="subject">Historical marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/888</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential for a novel alcoholic drink prepared from the New Zealand native plant Cordyline australis (ti k&#333;uka)</field><field name="creator">Patel, Minaxi</field><field name="description">Some New Zealand indigenous plants may offer unique qualities that can be used to secure an exclusive niche in the alcoholic drinks market in the same way that Scotch whisky and tequila are strongly identified with the country of origin, Scotland and Mexico. Tequila is a spirit distilled from a fermented agave, dry adapted lily. Agave is in the family Agavaceae, a notable New Zealand member of which is the common cabbage tree or ti k&#333;uka (Cordyline australis). Similarly, to the agave having a fermentable core, ti k&#333;uka has carbohydrate (inulin) content in its young stems and roots that can be hydrolysed in acidic suspensions or by enzyme hydrolysis to yield fructose. The main objective of this thesis was to systematically research the feasibility of the production of a tequila-like spirit from ti k&#333;uka stem, profiling the chemical properties of the spirit with a view of future commercial production of an iconic New Zealand spirit. The initial stage of the thesis focused on extracting inulin from the ti k&#333;uka stem and hydrolysing (by both acid and enzyme) it to yield reducing sugar. The sugar concentration yielded was too low (~ 10 to 15%) to be fermented and distilled economically. Rather, the ti k&#333;uka extract was evaporated to produce flavoured products by the Maillard reaction, a reaction between amino acids and sugars. The flavoured compounds were then infused with potable ethanol. In outline, the dried stem was hydrolysed with an inulinase at 60&#176;C for 1 hour. The pH was adjusted to 10 with sodium hydroxide and evaporated at 60&#176;C for 65 hours. The dried extract was reconstituted with water, centrifuged and the supernatant infused with portable ethanol to yield final different concentrations of 80, 67, 57 and 50%. The ethanol treatments simultaneously extracted flavour and colour to varying degrees. Next, sugars and amino acids were analysed in the ti k&#333;uka stems by liquid chromatography. The most abundant sugar present in the ti k&#333;uka after inulinase hydrolysis was fructose and the dominant amino acids were arginine, leucine, lysine, and aspartic acid/aspargine and glutamic acid/glutamine. Amino acids and reducing sugar were also analysed at different stages of the spirit production. The reducing sugar content decreased during each step of the process. The relative concentrations of arginine, leucine and lysine decreased while that of aspartic and glutamic acids increased during the whole process of making the spirit. Model systems were then used to simulate the reactions taking place between the amino acids and reducing sugar present in the ti k&#333;uka extract. The colour of the models became darker as a function of time, accumulating more brown pigment containing the flavoured compounds. Increasing the pH and concentration of the amino acids in the reaction mixture also increased the browning pigment formation. Dichloromethane and n-pentane and diethyl ether solvent extraction of the spirits and analysis of volatiles by gas chromatography- mass spectrometry revealed that the chemical profiles of the spirits were different from those of the commercial spirits, gin, tequila and whisky. Sensory evaluation was performed on four variations of the spirit, and demonstrated that the creations were consumer-acceptable. The costs and other issues involved in producing and marketing such a spirit were identified, the major selling point being geographical exclusivity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cordyline australis</field><field name="subject">Maillard reaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The alchemy of love: recent graduates' lived experiences of psychotherapy training: a hermeneutic study</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Marilyn</field><field name="description">Most of the research related to psychotherapy is about modality, treatments and therapeutic outcomes. There is little research on the psychotherapists themselves; their subjective experiences, their preparation or personal development. Personal growth, which leads to a developmental level permitting self-reflection and relational ability, is considered by the psychotherapy profession to be an important aspect of the psychotherapist's education. This hermeneutic study focuses on students' experience of personal growth during a formal psychotherapy educational programme. The core of the thesis is the presentation of the students' lived experience during training. Recent graduates of psychotherapy programmes were interviewed and their accounts include the process of personal growth, in what ways the developmental journey was felt to be supportive and containing, ways graduates feel changed, the impact on their lives during and after the training, and the meanings they ascribe to the experience. The particular growth experiences of Maori graduates are to some degree explored, as are the experiences of psychotherapy teachers who facilitate personal development. Themes emerged from data analysis; personal growth did happen, was felt to be positive, and took place as a journey. The growth process was turbulent, painful, yet resulted in positive outcomes for the graduates. Love and relationship were experienced as the most significant catalyst in promoting growth towards key outcomes. It was felt that bicultural learning activities enhanced and supported growth for Maori and non-Maori. The nature and complexity of love is discussed; including the place of love in personal change, psychotherapy and psychotherapy training. The discomfort commonly experienced in the profession around describing the therapeutic relationship as one involving love is highlighted. Possible reasons are given for this, for not using the word love in psychotherapy. Implications for psychotherapy education arising from the research are presented; with questions about, and recommendations for, facilitating personal growth, and the utilisation of love in a more open and conscious manner as a part of psychotherapy training. Currently most preparation of psychotherapists occurs in mainstream academic institutions, with a movement in the profession towards more formal qualifications. It is a challenge for educators and students alike to continue to include in traditional academic structures and processes what is felt to be the essence of psychotherapy; love and relationship, the practice of which requires high levels of personal development.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapists - personal development</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapists' training</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapy students</field><field name="subject">Bicultural</field><field name="subject">Love</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/10</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Obtaining business benefits from IT: factors that influence the adoption of benefit realisation methodologies in New Zealand organisations</field><field name="creator">Kodthuguli, Saritha</field><field name="description">Almost without exception organisations have become reliant on Information Systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT) applications. Although competitive advantage, task efficiency and effective information management are considered to be among the major drivers for investing in IS/IT, recognising, valuing and realising these expected business benefits from their investments has proved to be a complex task for organisations. The track record of the IS/IT industry shows that there are high rates of project failures, budget overruns and cancellations, resulting in the so-called IT productivity paradox. Researchers argue that the current evaluation techniques (primarily financial) are insufficient to identify, track and evaluate benefits obtained through IS/IT projects. Therefore they encourage organisations to employ non-financial techniques that are apparently more suitable for IS/IT investments. There is still much debate, however, concerning the efficiency and effectiveness of the current evaluation techniques in terms of satisfying the IS/IT investment evaluation criteria.Benefit realisation (BR) approaches are among the non-financial techniques suggested by some in order to facilitate organisations to track, identify, measure and optimise business benefits from IS/IT projects. It appears, however, that most organisations worldwide have failed to change their practices, in part due to managerial perspectives and uncertainty of the effectiveness of BR models.The situation in New Zealand in relation to BR is unknown. This research therefore focuses on analysing the perspectives of IT and business/finance managers' towards their current IS/IT practices. Thereby to investigate the influence of three key factors, awareness, use and effectiveness of BR models those were identified from past studies, in New Zealand business context.In order to assess these factors, this exploratory study employed a positivist cross-sectional survey approach and selected five hundred IT-enabled New Zealand organisations across a variety of industry sectors, sizes and localities as the main sample. The results describe local perspectives on current IS/IT evaluation practices and on formal BR models in use. The report further compares and contrasts IT and finance managers' views towards organisations' current IS/IT practices and BR approaches. Finally concludes with recommendations for practice and implications for further research.Although the survey received relatively low levels of response, some preliminary outcomes are evident. The main insight obtained through this study is that among the responding organisations, awareness of formal benefit realisation and use of formal BR models are fairly low. In spite of this low awareness, there is some evidence of the presence of BR practice among nearly one-third of IT respondents and almost half of finance respondents, who indicated the use of in-house developed models. Some of the in-house models encompass important aspects of formal BR approaches. However the extent of their use varies significantly.Many of the responding organisations, in acknowledging their limited awareness of BR, indicated a desire to know more about the formal methods available. Moreover this research's findings are consistent with the similar studies conducted in Australia and UK. Therefore this study emphasises the need for improvement of NZ organisations' current IS/IT practice by incorporating a BR approach in order to better optimise business benefits from IS/IT. This study recommends that organisations identify the missing links in their current practices through a conceptual framework suggested here and to improve their awareness (and likely adoption) of BR in order to better optimise their business benefits and justify their investments in IS/IT.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/12</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tax avoidance: causes and solutions</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Ling (Becky)</field><field name="description">Tax avoidance is attracting more and more attention from the public.

The thesis assesses various definitions of tax avoidance, and then discusses different options for prevention of tax avoidance. In discussing of legislative rules, the thesis reviews the various applicable sections in the New Zealand Income Tax Act 2004, taking into account of leading cases, discusses the development in other jurisdictions, and in particular examines the development of Generally Anti-avoidance Rules in three jurisdictions. The thesis recommends the key elements for design a good tax system which will help to restrict the conditions that make tax avoidance possible for the future development.

As an orthopaedic nurse I had concerns that the validity of orthopaedic nursing as a unique scope of practice was being questioned. In this thesis, the case for orthopaedic nursing is argued, by showing it as a specialty in its own right.A qualitative approach informed by my interpretation of philosophical hermeneutics as articulated by Heidegger (1927/1962) and Gadamer (1976; 1989) was undertaken. Phenomenology seeks to uncover 'taken-forgranted' meanings in everyday experience and hermeneutic research recognises that the historical and cultural horizons of participants and researcher influence the interpretation.Eight nurses working in various orthopaedic settings were interviewed. Data was analysed using the interpretive thematic approach described by van Manen (1990). The nurses' stories from practice yielded two essential themes, 'being part', and 'gaining and maintaining integrity'. These themes interrelate and together reveal meanings and insights about being an orthopaedic nurse. 'Being part', shows the essential nature of relationships between orthopaedic nurses and others. 'Gaining and maintaining integrity' describes the embodied nature of the phenomenon.The overall thematic finding 'seeing the world through orthopaedic eyes' reveals the nature of orthopaedic nursing as a unique scope of practice.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/14</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the supervision of occupational therapists in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Herkt, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to explore the nature and process of supervision of occupational therapists as it occurs in New Zealand. There has recently been an increased focus on supervision by the profession. This study is therefore timely in seeking to describe the phenomenon of supervision. The study had eleven participants with some of the participants agreeing to be interviewed in both capacities those of supervisee and supervisor; this resulted in interviews with eight supervisees and five supervisors. Grounded theory was chosen as the methodology for the study. This methodology ensures that the voices of the participants are heard and that the study remains focused on their understandings and the meanings that they make of the process of supervision. Grounded theory allows for the generation of a conceptual model of the experience. By using the constant comparative method of data analysis a core concept of participating in supervision emerged.Participating in supervision describes a process that is heavily dependent on the quality of the supervisory relationship. It identifies the factors that bring supervisees to supervision and places emphasis on supervisory relationships that allow supervisees to explore the concept of me as a therapist. It highlights the benefits in therapists gaining an understanding of the wider picture in which they practice. It emphasises the significance of contextual factors such as supervision contracts and training, and highlights the issues raised by the type of power the supervisor holds. Positional power was seen by participants to be detrimental to the outcome of supervision whereas social power was seen to empower supervisees and allow a deeper relationship to develop. The trust in such relationships enabled issues to be raised without fear of consequence, or threat to competence. Supervisors were tasked to build on supervisees' strengths but to also challenge supervisees' actions and plans.Supervisees entered supervision believing that they would grow as therapists. For some this was possible and they were able to make the most of supervision. Supervision gave them a safe place to go and to explore what was happening, it was affirming. It empowered them to integrate knowledge, skills and behaviours such that they came away with insights. Importantly supervisees felt inspired. For others, poor relationships and structures resulted in guarding. They felt the need to protect themselves and they began fighting shy of supervision. There was obvious avoidance and frustration with supervision. This study takes us a step closer to understanding the place and value of supervision in occupational therapy in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupational therapists</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/15</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of modernisation theory to phases in Maori development since 1800</field><field name="creator">Moon, Paul</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore the relationship between certain descriptive and prescriptive elements in Modernisation theory, and selected phases in Maori development in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This analysis also extends to consideration of the significance of intentional development, as defined by Michael Cowen and Robert Shenton (Cowen &amp; Shenton, 1996), as the emerging basis for such development.The particular focus within the theoretical framework is on the characteristics and implications of social transformation that are said to accompany rapid economic development - particularly for non-Western peoples living within an emerging Western economic environment. As a corollary of this, consideration is given to the evident conversion from such transitions being unplanned consequences of the forces of economic development, to the increasingly conscious, planned bases for the processes of modernisation being applied to Maori development.This thesis concludes that there has been a discernable intensification in the forces of modernisation impacting on Maori, and that this has been complemented by more deliberate efforts - at a governmental level - to advance this process. One consequence of this trend has been that the alternative models for Maori development have been virtually excluded, even from consideration by successive Governments, and that a singular theoretical model has become the near-universal standard for governmental discourse about this area of indigenous development in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Economic conditions</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Dependency</field><field name="subject">Maori Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/17</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tensions in the toolbox: the meaning of Western acupuncture for New Zealand physiotherapists</field><field name="creator">Kohut, Susan</field><field name="description">Physiotherapists in New Zealand are increasingly learning and practicing Western acupuncture. Western acupuncture as a new and different tool is enhancing and yet challenging physiotherapists practice. This study explores the meaning behind Western acupuncture practice to further understand the implications of its development and possible future direction.Hermeneutic methodology was used because it facilitates the exploration between that which is familiar and that which is unfamiliar. Seven New Zealand physiotherapists qualified to practise Western acupuncture were interviewed about their practice experiences. The data in relation to the phenomenon of inquiry was analysed thematically.The findings revealed a complex array of tensions within physiotherapy because of the differences Western acupuncture brings to physiotherapists' practice. Western acupuncture is a new and useful tool in the physiotherapists 'toolbox'. It is congruent with other physiotherapy practices in that it shares the same scientific neurophysiological foundation. However, the association of Western acupuncture with traditional Chinese acupuncture causes it to be viewed as a complementary medical practice and thus, not completely legitimate as a part of physiotherapy. These tensions are further confounded because the technical rationalist paradigm, upon which physiotherapy is based, values evidence-based practices. The best evidence is perceived to be that gained from the randomised controlled trial. I argue that the randomised controlled trial is poorly suited to the evaluation of complex practices such as Western acupuncture. Such insights also challenge physiotherapy, as a whole, because the available 'evidence' does not acknowledge the complexities of practice involving individual practitioners, their colleagues, the profession, other healthcare professions, patients and the public.The tensions encountered in physiotherapy and Western acupuncture practice have led to a number of recommendations in education, practice, research and legislation. Overall, they suggest a need to develop a more inclusive model of practice development. Western acupuncture is a potentially valuable tool. In order to maximise use of this tool physiotherapy practice understandings need to be extended. This in turn, will assist development of the profession as a whole.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture.</field><field name="subject">Physical therapists - New Zealand.</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/18</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silence speaks volumes</field><field name="creator">Jeurissen, Maree  Jayne</field><field name="description">The continuing failure of our education system to meet the needs of minority group students, who continue to walk through classroom doors in increasing numbers, provided the initial impetus for this research project. Researchers, academics, and school practitioners need to examine carefully 'taken for granted' patterns of talk and behaviour that occur in schools every day, because for many children, these are not effective. This study is situated in a mainstream primary school classroom where children from diverse language and cultural backgrounds work and learn together. The importance of the interaction that occurs between teachers and children is discussed and numerous studies which focus on the role of discourse in students' language learning are critiqued. The fact that students in mainstream primary schools must learn language while using language for content learning, is considered to be of paramount importance, and so discourse that occurred during small group mathematics lessons provided the major source of data for the project. An aspect of this discourse, language functions of student initiated interactions, was examined in depth. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to look beyond the surface level of classroom discourse in an attempt to better understand why children interact as they do, or why they remain silent, appearing to be on the periphery of the learning opportunities which are designed to help them to succeed. Classroom observations and individual interviews provided insights into the complex and competing forces which shape the talk that occurs between students and their teachers. It was revealed that successful students have effective relationships with teachers, regardless of whether or not they share the same cultural background. These successful students are able to deploy a range of thinking and learning strategies. The importance of making the 'culture of the classroom' explicit is highlighted, along with the fact that teachers feel constrained by the demands of an overcrowded curriculum and the need to address individual learning needs of all of their students. Implications for classroom practice along with teacher training and professional development are proposed.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foreign Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/19</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The H-bug epidemic: the impact of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal infection on New Zealand society and health 1955-1963</field><field name="creator">Jowitt, Deborah Mary</field><field name="description">An epidemic of staphylococcal infections occurred in New Zealand hospitals and communities from 1955-1963. The 'H', or 'Hospital Bug', a strain of Staphylococcus aureus characteristic of the epidemic, was resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics. Post-operative patients, the frail elderly and mothers and babies were particularly vulnerable to staphylococcal colonization and infection. This thesis places the H-Bug epidemic in its historical context, discussing the ways in which the government and health professionals responded to the rising incidence of staphylococcal infection, and the major effects of the epidemic on medical and hospital practice. It also examines the impact of persistent staphylococcal infection on women and families in the community. Primary sources provided the basis for this thesis. The H-Bug epidemic has gone largely unrecorded except in contemporary documents. Health Department files and Auckland Hospital Board records as well as newspaper clippings were important sources. The New Zealand epidemic was clearly linked to the global pandemic of antibiotic resistant staphylococcal infection, 1946-1966, through medical literature and archival documents. International medical journals, including the New Zealand Medical Journal, published numerous articles on the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal infection, providing an excellent record of research, case studies, current opinion, and recommended practice. The most valuable contribution to an understanding of the impact and experience of the H-Bug epidemic was, however, provided by the nineteen people who agreed to be interviewed for the study. Interviewees included a wide variety of health professionals and women and their children, all of whom had personal experience or association with the epidemic. In this thesis it is argued that the main focus of the medical response was the prevention and control of hospital cross-infection, both to protect patients and to preserve the public perception of the hospital as a safe venue for care. Although the emergence of resistant strains of staphylococci was widely attributed to the misuse of antibiotics, this thesis contends that the Health Department was reluctant to impose restrictions on medical prescribing and that Health Department official and senior clinicians chose instead to modify hospital environments and clinical practice. Rooming-in was widely introduced to counter the epidemic despite the fact that a trial in 1959, at National Women's Hospital, did not demonstrate a reduction in infection rates among neonates. The concept endured, however, as it held strong appeal for hospital administrators hard pressed to keep wards adequately staffed with trained personnel. It was also supported by women and health professionals who were convinced of the benefits of a close mother-baby relationship from birth. The H-Bug epidemic was eventually resolved by the introduction of the methicillin antibiotics in the early 1960s. As a consequence, confidence in a pharmaceutical solution to infectious disease remained intact until the emergence of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms in the 1980s. The lessons of the H-Bug epidemic had been largely forgotten in the intervening years, ignored until New Zealand clinicians were reminded once again that antimicrobial resistance would inevitably accompany the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and inadequate attention to infection prevention and control.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug resistance in microorganisms</field><field name="subject">Antibiotics</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Hospitals</field><field name="subject">Safety measures</field><field name="subject">Maternal health services</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/21</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lived reality of men who have been violent/violated</field><field name="creator">Bryant, John</field><field name="description">This qualitative research study examines the stories of five men's lived experiences of violence and violation. It is derived from conversations with the men that have been taped and transcribed. These in turn have been categorised into key existential themes and interpreted by myself as the researcher. The process of data collection, transcription and analysis has been performed under strict adherence to the tenets of a rigorous, ethical and trustworthy qualitative approach to undertaking research. Participant's revelations of their unique experiences of violence have been carefully and sensitively interpreted and given meaning through the lens of my personal worldview informed by a philosophical perspective. I have fully acknowledged my own influences upon the proceedings. The methodology that has informed this undertaking is based upon Martin Heidegger's (1927/1962) hermeneutic phenomenology. Phenomenology emphasises the search for raw experience buried in the text and takes me to the heart of men's lived reality of violence. Hermeneutics offers me a way of making meaning out of the subtext concealed within men's stories of violence. Heidegger's philosophy offers me a particular approach for understanding human experience. Van Manen's (1990) existential life world structures guide me towards violence as it is lived rather than as it is thought to be. As such this study emphasises ontological understanding over epistemological examination. The intention of this work is produce an understanding of the impact of violence on people's lives from the unique perspective of those who have experienced it. Its ultimate goal is to use this information to better understand the aetiology of male violence, and, more specifically, five men whose lives have been situated in the world of violence, so that it may be more effectively prevented.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Men</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Violence</field><field name="subject">Violence in men</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/24</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reliability of foot and ankle water volumetry</field><field name="creator">Balasundaram, Jeyakhanthan</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the intra-rater (within day &amp; between days) and inter-rater reliability of foot/ankle water volumetry in healthysubjects.Study design: Repeated measures design with 2 raters.Background: Physiotherapists more often aim to reduce swelling in the acute phase of soft tissue injury. Reduction in swelling will hasten the healing process. Therefore swelling forms an important outcome measure that is worth studying during the healing process to determine the efficacy of the intervention. Though there are different methods available to measure extremity swelling, water displacement method is widely used in physiotherapy studies. Although water volumetry has been used to assess the reduction in swelling over time, there is paucity of reliability studies that have assessed the between-days reliability.Methods: Thirty normal subjects with asymptomatic ankles were measured by 2 raters. Three repeated foot volume measurements were performed by each of the rater using water volumetry during a single test session. The same procedure was repeated approximately at the same time on the 3rd day and 5th day following the 1st measurement day by the same raters on the same subjects. The raters were blinded to each other's measurements. The order for rater's volumetric measurement on each subject on each day was determined by a random chart produced by SPSS. The reliability was measured in terms of systematic bias (Paired t test &amp; Bland &amp; Altman's plot), absolute reliability (Limits of Agreement [LOA] &amp; Standard Error of Measurement [SEM]) and relative reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC]).Results: There was no systematic bias between any of the trials within day/between days or between raters. The intra-rater reliability within day as calculated by ICC; LOA and SEM were 0.99, &#177;10ml and &#177;3.5ml respectively and for between days reliability the values were 0.99 (ICC), &#177;20ml (LOA) and &#177;7ml (SEM) and for interrater reliability the values were 0.99 (ICC), &#177;13ml (LOA) and &#177;5ml (SEM). The results demonstrated that water volumetry method was highly reliable within day and between days for both the raters; and highly reliable between raters.Conclusion: Water volumetry is a highly reliable method for measuring foot/ankle volume repeatedly on different days. The random error range in milliliters (ml) as estimated by the absolute reliability indices provides the practical use of this method in a clinical/research setting.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankle - wounds and injuries - measurement - evaluation</field><field name="subject">Foot - wounds and injuries - measurement - evaluation</field><field name="subject">Edema - measurement - evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/26</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Luminosity and illusion in the Bardo</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Mark</field><field name="description">This is a creative practice-based photographically researched project that is contextualised by a written exegesis.

The Bardo of life is also relevant as it pre-ordains the visual context of the experiences within the dying, death and rebirth Bardos.Through the medium of photography, my methodology and practice are reflective of two fundamental ideas. These are: Luminosity and Illusion. They are supported by my research into the phenomenon of the 'Near Death Experience' and the Jungian concept of the conscious and subconscious mind. These states of reality are explored in relation to the Tibetan Book of the Dead's concept of the Bardo. My focus is to photograph the four elements of Earth, Fire, Air and Water as mediums familiar to all human beings and relate these in context to the Tibetan Book of the Dead's description of entering the Bardo of death. Illusion and luminosity are discovered by 'seeing' these within the four elements, and are related in context to the Tibetan Buddhists' belief of an after-death reality. This transition from the dying process into the unknown Bardo of death is supported by the familiarity of these four elements in life, and the mind's notion of reality.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Luminosity</field><field name="subject">Illusion</field><field name="subject">Buddhism</field><field name="subject">Bardo</field><field name="subject">Death</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/27</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The waiting room: an art investigation of site in abeyance</field><field name="creator">Vickers, Sharon</field><field name="description">This art project explores issues of unoccupied space.

An in-depth analysis of the phenomenon was completed, with the aim of evoking insights and developing understandings about the lived return-to-work experience. As this research was situated within the critical paradigm, the process of seeking, securing and sustaining employment was viewed in terms of power relationships, and through the multiple positionings of psychiatric disability, employment status and social capital.An unstructured interview process was used to explore the return-to-work experiences of eight purposefully selected informants with a history of mental illness and prior illness-related offending. They were living in the community and had returned to part or full-time employment, which they had sustained for at least six months. The gathered data was interpreted using hermeneutic analysis. This process revealed a number of themes, which were clustered into related groups, under eleven essential overarching themes. Freire's (1972) critical social theory was used to add critical depth to the findings.The findings reveal that returning to work exposes people who are affected by mental illness to an array of challenges and personal opportunities. People who have a forensic psychiatric history can encounter complex employment barriers related to stigma and misunderstanding. Therefore, the selected critical hermeneutic design provided a congruent framework with which to view the informants' quest to seek, secure and sustain employment. Despite significant obstacles, securing employment provides opportunities for individuals to test their skills while engaged in meaningful work activity. The acquisition of work skills can result in individuals' experiencing a strong sense of self-satisfaction. The experience of being bolstered by personal accomplishment often co-exists with, but is not necessarily negated by, difficulties that arise on-the-job.As there is scant reference to forensic rehabilitation within the mental health vocational literature, this study may be a timely contribution. It may also be used to add depth to the knowledge base within the field of mental health rehabilitation, in particular the specialised areas of forensic rehabilitation and vocational practise. Therefore, it may be a positive precursor to further discussion and analysis regarding work and education outcomes from the unique forensic psychiatric perspective.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hermeneutic analysis</field><field name="subject">Unstructured interviews</field><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Return to work</field><field name="subject">Work skills</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/29</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Game analysis in Rugby Union</field><field name="creator">Agnew, Marcus</field><field name="description">Due to rugby's increasing level of professionalism, rugby union performance analysis is in a rapid state of evolution. Coaches, media, administrators and players are demanding greater access to more detailed analysis of team and player performance. Owing to the dynamic nature of the game and high frequency of events, nobody can adequately recall all aspects of the game; therefore performance analysts are playing an increasingly important role in rugby. The ability of analysts to meet this demand is being enhanced by technological advancements world wide, including the integrated capabilities of digital video, computer systems and video analysis software. Most analyses are conducted post-match by reviewing video footage and coding events of interest. Sound methodological approaches exist to develop performance indicators, which, if appropriately collated, can be used to create performance profiles indicative of player and/or team abilities. Sufficient data should be collected to ensure valid profiles, which can then be compared against population norms for more objective interpretation. Rugby research has focused on a range of performance indicators related to game structures and tactical aspects, including lineout tactics, differences between winning and losing performances, which side of the field try scoring predominates, and the number of passes per try. Research has included analysis of the world's top teams to assess the effect of law changes on the game and rates of foul play across different competitions. Despite the range of detailed analysis in the literature, there is a need for a structured account of all logical units of play, defined and quantified in accordance with coaching language and concepts. Player interactions, and off the ball player formations, also present future research potential.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IT and sport analysis</field><field name="subject">Information technology and sport</field><field name="subject">Game coding</field><field name="subject">Synthesis of game structure in rugby</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/30</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning to do, learning to be: the transition to competence in critical care nursing</field><field name="creator">Fielding, Sandra</field><field name="description">Making the transition to an area of specialist nursing practice is challenging for both the learner and staff who are responsible for education and skill development. This study uses grounded theory methodology to explore the question: "How do nurses learn critical care nursing?"The eight registered nurses who participated in this study were recruited from a range of intensive care settings. The criteria for inclusion in the study included the participant having attained competency within the critical care setting. Data was collected from individual interviews. The findings of this study developed during the coding and comparative analysis process, and subsequently theoretical sampling was used to further explore the identified concepts.This study found that nurses' focus on two main areas during their orientation and induction into critical care nursing practice. These are learning to do (skill acquisition) and learning to be (professional socialisation). The process of transition involves two stages: that of learning to do the tasks related to critical care nursing practice, and the ongoing development of competence and confidence in practice ability. The relationship of the learner with the critical care team is a vital part of the transition to competency within the specialist area.This study identifies factors that influence the learner during transition and also provides an understanding of the strategies used by the learners to attain competency. These findings are applicable to educators and leaders responsible for the education and ongoing learning of nurses within critical care practice.

Little appears to be published on the phenomenon of taboo language and its teaching implications for adult ESL/EFL students learning conversational English. This study aimed to investigate the attitudes and opinions of 80 ESOL teachers from 10 language schools in Auckland, New Zealand, towards the use of Taboo English in society and their attitudes towards teaching about taboo language to adult learners of conversational English. The project used a questionnaire designed to elicit a combination of both qualitative and quantitative data. Results showed that Taboo English was a valuable aspect of ESOL teachers' linguistic repertoire and that both males and females used taboo words in complex and diverse ways to communicate ideas quickly and efficiently. One of the key findings of the study contradicted the typical stereotype that females are more conservative in their taboo use than males. Another major theme that emerged was the linguistic prejudice towards teaching about Taboo English in the second language classroom. The vast majority of ESOL teachers in the study displayed little, if any, enthusiasm for teaching about taboo words to adult learners of conversational English despite acknowledging that taboo words are frequently heard in society today. This study concludes that Taboo language is an undeniable reality of English language use and that ESOL teachers, preparing adult learners to understand everyday language they will be exposed to in the 'real' world, need to address Taboo English to some degree. By not addressing this controversial language, teachers are insufficiently preparing learners to become empowered communicators in English.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Obscene words</field><field name="subject">Swearing</field><field name="subject">English Language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/35</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mrs Gallagher, Acts of disobedience: performance and installation in rural New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Findlay, Jules Julie Ann</field><field name="description">This art project examines aspects of New Zealand rural culture through the experience of a fictional performer, Mrs Gallagher. She questions the instrumental approach of agribusiness production, both as it enframes her domestic/farm helper role and the farming of animals. She uses the practices of everyday life, domestic crafts and appropriated materials of agribusiness to draw attention to the traditional ideological boundaries between the human/animal and assigned gender roles.Employing the tactics of 'making do', Mrs Gallagher uses inventive play to produce new forms that cross the domestic/agribusiness boundary. It is her aim that her acts of intervention and these hybrid forms will promote a more mindful use of technology and greater recognition of the continuity and difference that exists between humans and nature.All objects will be presented in site-orientated installation. Evidence of Mrs Gallagher's intervening acts is witnessed and documented using time-based media by a collaborative performer, the cultural theorist K.

The purpose of this study is to show that whanau is not only a social grouping belonging to Maori society, but an aspect of cultural identity central to the future development of Maori. Whanau is a concept belonging to Te Ao Maori, and the development of this concept has been challenged through the history of Aotearoa by external cultural influences and internal responses to these influences. These influences include Western paradigms and societal norms introduced through colonisation and leading to the modern perception that whanau is a mirror image of the concept of family.Modernisation, as an example of a Western developmental theory is applied in this study to demonstrate the impact of an ethnocentric notion on the concept and experience of whanau - culturally, socially, economically and spiritually. It is observed by the writer that whanau remains central to strategies for development as a people notwithstanding this experience. This observation required that the study explore the key elements retained by whanau, for the concept of whanau to have achieved sustainability. Although the effects of external influences have impacted on the structural, functional and relational aspects of wh&#257;nau, it is evident in the findings from this study conducted with descendents of Ngati Te Oro that the practice of whanau as a cultural grouping was significant to retaining a cultural identity. This finding has strengthened the position that there are specific contributing aspects towards a secure whanau identity that provides the foundations as well as the vehicle to progress the development of Maori.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Family relationships</field><field name="subject">Kinship</field><field name="subject">Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">Whanau</field><field name="subject">Kupu</field><field name="subject">Maori Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/37</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mode of entry observations for environmental based INVs (International New Ventures)</field><field name="creator">Hogg, David</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the risk and internationalisation practices of International New Ventures (INVs) in the environmental sector. The purpose of the research is to make observations regarding the manner in which environmental INVs manage risk when internationalising.The literature review focuses upon the published literature that relates to INVs, risk and risk management, mode of entry and the environmental sector. Section one of the literature review provides the characteristics of what constitutes an INV. Section 2 provides a review of the risk literature, this allows the differences between Multi National Enterprise (MNE) and INV risk and risk management to be reviewed. Section 3 takes the international business risks mentioned in section 2 and relates them to the mode of entry literature (i.e. the internationalisation of firms). The final section of the literature review is used to justify the investigation into the water pollution and control sector of the environmental industry. The research question is 'What strategies do environmental INVs use when entering new international markets?' The research question is broken into five specific research questions and addressed using the Repertory Grid process. The Repertory Grid process is used as it can turn the tacit knowledge held by the participants into explicit knowledge. The results show areas of convergence and divergence between practice and academia. The results also suggest new issues that need to be considered when firms internationalise. This culminates in the observations made in regard to the way environmental INVs manage risk when internationalising.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interpretive paradigm</field><field name="subject">Porter's five forces</field><field name="subject">Competition</field><field name="subject">Traditional internationalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/38</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of service delivery: the difference between front-line employees' and customer's perception of the service delivery within the New Zealand real estate industry</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Vicki</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to investigate the difference between front-line employees' perception of service versus the customer's perception of the service delivery within the New Zealand Real Estate Industry. This research examines the service perception of the service delivery within the real estate industry using an exploratory study, pre-test and a survey. The lack of knowledge within real estate particularly around the importance of services has been a major motivator for this research. In reviewing the literature, a substantial amount of literature was available on service delivery however there was a gap in the literature on the service delivery in the real estate industry. This research addresses this gap through analysing the real estate industry, focusing on the Auckland market. Four dimensions of service were identified using SERVQUAL. Findings from the factor analysis showed that employees and clients have different perceptions of service. The management implications are wide and will positively impact the industry. For the industry, increasing service delivery will ensure the industry gains a more professional image and standing within New Zealand business.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer services</field><field name="subject">Customer relations</field><field name="subject">Consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Real estate agents</field><field name="subject">Real estate business</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/40</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual communication design strategies: multidisciplinary human-centred approach in branding and marketing</field><field name="creator">Yu, Jenny</field><field name="description">This research study is focused on the buying behaviour of modern consumers. The literature indicates that modern consumers are sophisticated, discerning and are less loyal to a particular brand than they used to be. Consumers today are more concerned with buying a product that not only meets their needs but also provides them with pleasurable experiences. There are many ways to explain buyer behaviour; however for this thesis storytelling, dream theory, and "Lovemarks" have been used to examine the usefulness of the selected theories to the visual communication design industry. The research has focussed on an homogeneous product (bottled water) as a vehicle to establish whether all the plans and strategies in recently published literature can be trusted and be used for design strategies for planning a marketing campaign. The reason for doing this is to establish some new knowledge that could contribute to the design industry in terms of criteria for branding, marketing and design strategy in visual communication design. An extensive secondary research of the literature has been made to inform this study. Primary information has also been gathered by using carefully designed and comprehensive materials involving professional interviews, and a major case study of bottled water has been conducted, which includes a field study, focus groups and surveys. Information and raw data generated by the research have been analysed either quantitatively or qualitatively. The result generated by this study is not conclusive, however, pointing to the fact that the buying behaviour of consumers is complex and variable. There was also little agreement among the professional interviewees in terms of the role of human behaviour and its application in the design campaign.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand name products</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Advertising</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/41</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;ori leadership: what role can rugby play?</field><field name="creator">Te Rito, Patrick R</field><field name="description">Despite considerable interest driving prominent studies over many decades' leadership theory and research remains one of the least understood topics. Leadership is still mysterious and complex. This study is a journey of discovery designed to explore the complexities and prominence of leadership as it exists in New Zealand. The journey began with a literature review metaphorically represented as three poles of knowledge. The first pole focused on M&#257;ori (ordinary, of this land, native people of New Zealand) and M&#257;ori culture where leadership is highly valued. The second explored sport and in particular rugby, which enjoys celebrity status amongst M&#257;ori and New Zealanders. The final pole reviewed organisational studies and literature on leadership.The study pursued perceptions of male M&#257;ori rugby players concerning leadership, from a M&#257;ori, rugby, and New Zealand perspective. The research approach employed by this study is based on the principles of grounded theory, kaupapa M&#257;ori methodology and its Western cousin, ethnomethodology. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with nine prominent past and present M&#257;ori rugby players. By focusing on this demographic, this study was able to examine M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; leadership styles, similarities and differences; highlight key cultural characteristics and strengthen arguments claiming a relationship exists between the three poles of knowledge. This approach enabled a review of those beneficial and advantageous qualities considered to have an impact on leadership in New Zealand.Findings from interviews revealed relationships do exist between the three poles of knowledge. The values or concepts wh&#257;nau (family, extended family), responsibility, collectivism, and tu&#257;kana/t&#275;ina (elder/leaders to younger/novices) relationships were identified as central qualities of M&#257;ori leadership. Collectivism is expressed as concerns of wh&#257;nau. Reciprocity was embodied in relationships of tu&#257;kana/t&#275;ina with rugby being a vehicle that enhanced both and encouraged leadership development. Findings combined with evidence from literature prompted discussion aimed at three different audiences: leadership theorists; M&#257;ori, and; rugby audiences.

However there are concerns about the patterns of use and the rising incidence of alcohol and drug related risks such as; hospital admissions, domestic abuse, and alcohol and drug related convictions. As a result alcohol and drug use among Maori is a major threat to their health and well being. Consequently there is a need for models that are culturally appropriate to effectively address the problem. In New Zealand there is an increase in the use of customary Maori values, beliefs and practices in the treatment of Maori with substance abuse. This has also involved the integration of Western approaches and treatment modalities that are beneficial to Maori. However, the main purpose of the research is to give credence to Te Toi o Te Matariki model within the clinical setting. It is anticipated that the outcomes will inspire confidence in cultural model of practice in personal growth and development for Maori people who present with substance abuse. Te Toi o Te Matariki model is examined in the context of the Te Ara Hou residential drug and alcohol programme, a service provided by Raukura Hauora o Tainui (RHOT) in Auckland. The analogy is "to ascend or achieve to the highest point of the Whare Wananga (house of learning) so that the best view or position in the world is gained." It demonstrates three stages of continuous layers and has been developed in accordance with the key principles of the whakapapa (genealogy) paradigm of Te Kore, Te Po and Te Ao Marama.

Vipassana meditation focuses on developing sensitivity to body sensations, which are understood to accompany all emotion experiences; experienced meditators can feel in their own bodies physical sensations that reflect the experience of a person in close proximity. An aim of the research was to discover whether their meditation practice had enabled the participants to use this ability in their work with patients. The study focuses on psychotherapists' lived experience during clinical hours, and enquires about how they direct their attention to their body sensations, and to the relationship with patients. The study explores links between the practice of Buddhist meditation and the evenly-suspended attention recommended by Freud, and further developed by Bion in his psychoanalysis without memory or desire. Because I was interested in many aspects of therapists' lived experience, I chose the methodology of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, 2003) as a framework for analysing the data. I drew on philosophical underpinnings offered by Heidegger and van Manen. The study showed that the participating psychotherapists were helped by their meditative training to develop a sensitive receptivity to their own physical sensations and emotion experience, predisposing them to be aware of limbic resonance with their patients' emotional and physical experiences. Some participants focused their meditative awareness on the ebb and flow of closeness and distance between themselves and their patients, in an orientation to psychotherapy that can be described as relational mindfulness.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychotherapy - religious aspects - Buddhism</field><field name="subject">Psychiatry and religion</field><field name="subject">Meditation - Buddhism</field><field name="subject">Meditation - therapeutic use</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/44</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the adoption and usage of internet banking: a New Zealand perspective</field><field name="creator">Podder, Braja</field><field name="description">Although the offering of financial products and services over the Internet by banks and financial institutions continues to spread, reports on Internet banking show that the adoption and usage of such services by consumers are low. Further, relatively little empirical research has been carried out to examine factors influencing users' adoption or use of Internet banking services, particularly in New Zealand. Hence, there is a need to identify relevant factors that influence New Zealand's bank customers' intentions to use Internet banking. This research used two commonly applied and empirically supported models of information technology adoption to achieve this objective. In this study, Davis's (1989) technology acceptance model (TAM) is extended by two external variables, namely risk and self-efficacy. The second model used is a reduced version of Moore and Benbasat's (1991) perceived characteristics of innovation (PCI) model, without the image and voluntariness constructs. A questionnaire was used to conducting a postal survey of 1000 individuals in Auckland, New Zealand. Out of 163 responses received 157(15.7%) were usable and with this data both research models were tested.The results reveal that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, self-efficacy, relative advantage, compatibility, and result demonstrability have a significant association with intention to use Internet banking, while risk, visibility and trialability are not significant. Both the modified TAM and PCI models used in the study have a similar explanatory power of slightly over 20% of the variance in intention. In the TAM model, perceived usefulness and self-efficacy are significant variables, while compatibility is the only variable significant for the PCI model. Further, results indicate that users' perceptions of various aspects of Internet banking are more positive than non-users' perceptions, except for risk.The results of this study indicate that both TAM and PCI have low capabilities in explaining the variances in users' intention to adopt or use Internet banking services. Therefore, further studies are recommended to examine the performance of these models in Internet banking studies and also to improve the prediction power of these models by incorporating additional constructs. Although risk is found to be insignificant in this study, considering results of prior studies, further studies are required to examine its influence on intention.For banks point of view, banks should consider launching campaigns to demonstrate the usefulness and benefits. Once users perceive that advantages outweigh disadvantages, they are more likely to adopt or use Internet banking. Additionally, banks must make continuous effort to understand consumers' requirement and design and deliver their products and services in such a way that it is consistent with customers' requirements, beliefs and the way customers are accustomed to work. Banks website should facilitate customers with a 'one stop comprehensive financial' service. Banks can arrange hands-on training for prospective users to enhance their self-efficacy or may pay additional interest on online-deposit accounts (can be access through Internet only). Besides promoting services, banks need to invest in staff education and training and be equipped with advanced computer technology.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet banking</field><field name="subject">Information Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/45</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The curator's room: visceral reflections from within the museum</field><field name="creator">Osborne, Michelle Anne Louise</field><field name="description">In the way of museums, certain things have been collected and assembled for a display, a truth, in the form of a private room in which resides the dream world of the curator. Then, as the visual expression of this inner space deepens, they are carefully taken apart, always with respect for the original. Yet the work is not shaped by the hand of a conservator destined to abandon the imagination in favour of a trail of physical evidence. Nor does it reflect the conventional rationalist sensibilities of a museum worker who, by suppressing a poetic understanding of the world is confined by "cold language" (Frame 1992 p.45) and remains caught inextricably in the web of colonial thinking.Here the imagination is truth (Einzig 1996) and an understanding of the nature of this inner space the key to the locked door. The Anthropologist and the Archaeologist, indeed a whole host of disciplinary specialists may come knocking, but it is the artist that gains access to the curatorial spirit. Compelled as much by a love of the museum profession as a crisis of European consciousness (Spivak in Harasym 1990), objects are assembled for an inner journey to a place where shadow and sunlight chase each other across the landscape (McQueen 2000). This is the dialectic space of both curator and artist, of the rational and the irrational, of inside and outside, and of disciplinary devotion and betrayal.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art exhibition</field><field name="subject">Space</field><field name="subject">Artist</field><field name="subject">Curator</field><field name="subject">Museum</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/46</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of assessed writing requirements at undergraduate level in the humanities</field><field name="creator">Turner, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses play an increasingly important role in supporting non English speaking background students in their academic studies. Such courses have traditionally prioritised writing as the most significant literacy requirement (Johns, 1981). This prioritisation of writing reflects the perception that expertise in writing is an indication that students have acquired the cognitive skills demanded for university work (Weigle, 2002). It also reflects the fact that the majority of assessment tasks, which tend to drive student learning (Schwartz &amp; Webb, 2002), require some form of writing. For EAP courses to be effective, curriculum design needs to be informed by knowledge of current academic discourse demands and writing requirements in relevant discipline areas. Analysis of previous studies indicates that written assessment tasks vary between discipline areas. Findings also suggest that the most frequent assessment types vary over time as theoretical approaches to assessment change. This suggests the need to investigate the discipline-specific demands faced by different student cohorts enrolled on EAP courses. Some studies have identified the need for students to develop the skills involved in interpreting task instructions, as well as addressing the relevant topic and meeting the specific assessment requirements (Gravatt et al., 1997 and Carson, 2001). A key impetus for this study relates to this finding and was the fact that students enrolled on EAP courses were having difficulties interpreting instructions and marking criteria provided for some assessments in discipline-specific papers. The aims of this study were three-fold. The first was to investigate and analyse the type and form of written assessment tasks and related requirements, in three undergraduate courses. The second was to investigate lecturers' perceptions and intentions in producing these tasks. Thirdly, the study aimed to investigate and describe students' understandings and experiences of the same tasks. The study therefore involved a triangulated methodology in terms of data collection. The three methods employed were analysis of assessment documents, semi-structured interviews with the lecturers concerned, and questionnaire surveys of students enrolled on the three papers. The results of the study reinforce the findings of earlier studies in that there are considerable differences between discipline areas in assessment types and in the levels of associated cognitive demands. Although the study identifies what appears to be a new assessment type at undergraduate level - the 'literature review' assignment - lecturers' expectations for this assessment appear to vary between discipline areas. The differences identified appear to be influenced by lecturers' perceptions of the role of assessment, which in this case seem to be limited to the concept of assessment as the certification of learning, and as being predominantly summative in function. Furthermore the study shows that a significant proportion of student respondents found the majority of assessment instructions difficult to understand, and that only one of the papers provided assessment criteria. The findings suggest that the absence of explicit marking criteria appears to disadvantage non-English speaking background students in particular. The conclusions of the thesis focus primarily on the dual, 'critical pragmatic', role of EAP practitioners in seeking to inform curriculum design and also to influence assessment practice; the implications of the study for the university's assessment and academic literacy policies and their implementation; the implications of the findings for EAP curriculum design, and suggestions for future research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academic writing</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/48</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the conflict resolution questionnaire</field><field name="creator">Henning, Marcus</field><field name="description">Many questionnaires used in the measurement of conflict are expensive and difficult to obtain. In addition, instruments of this kind are usually associated with diagnosis rather than intervention and education. The present thesis evaluates the recently developed questionnaire that is easily accessible through the Internet, the Conflict Resolution Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ was developed as a measure of the conflict resolution ideas presented by Weeks (1994), and Fisher and Ury (1991). It has been used to measure a person's ability to create mutually beneficial resolutions to conflict for all participants. In addition, the CRQ items measure respondents' perceptions regarding how often they engage in certain conflict-related behaviours, and their level of awareness regarding conflict issues. The CRQ is also designed to promote understanding of conflict, and has been used as an educational tool. Participants were asked to fill in the CRQ alongside an established questionnaire, the Rahim Organisational Conflict Inventory, part two (ROCI-II) (Rahim, 1983a). The responses of 338 participants to the CRQ and ROCI-II were statistically analysed. Hypotheses were tested regarding the CRQ's reliability and validity. CRQ reliability was statistically appraised through exploration of internal consistency and split-half reliability scores. CRQ validity was examined by evaluating the CRQ in terms of content, construct and concurrent validity. Establishing content validity was a qualitative process. Corroborating construct validity essentially relied on factor analysis procedures. Decisions regarding CRQ's concurrent validity were based upon correlation measures between the CRQ and the ROCI-II, which was used as an established standard measure of conflict. The results confirmed that two of the McClellan's (1997c) factors were reliable and that the CRQ had content validity. There was marginal support of construct validity, whereby from the factor rotation it was shown that two of the CRQ factors were matched by their derived counterparts. In addition, the results showed modest support for concurrent validity based on the comparisons of three CRQ factors against two factors from a well-established questionnaire. These findings also lend support for the methods of conflict resolution presented in the works of Weeks (1994) and Fisher and Ury (1991).A modified version of the CRQ is presented, the 'CRQ-II'. A posthoc analysis suggests that the CRQ-II can satisfy psychometric requirements, although further research is recommended to confirm the CRQ-II. Practice implications regarding the development of the CRQ-II are discussed, and future research considerations are explored.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conflict management</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/49</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lesbian mothers: queer families: the experience of planned pregnancy</field><field name="creator">Bree, Caroline</field><field name="description">Lesbian-identified women are choosing to become parents in increasing numbers.

Purposive sampling identified ten lesbian-identified mothers and conversational interviews with the participants yielded rich data about the phenomenon of inquiry. Thematic analysis of the data was foregrounded by a discussion of the socio-political context.A number of findings emerged from the study. Careful pre-conceptual planning reflected a highly responsible approach to parenting. The women's partners felt uncertain about their parenting role and experienced a lack of acknowledgement by the wider community. Despite legal access to assisted fertility, the participants usually sought an involved father for their child. Lesbian mothers expressed a preference for a lesbian midwife and all experienced homophobic attitudes from healthcare professionals. Queer families included mothers and their partners, fathers and their partners, children, families-of-origin, and close friends.Recommendations from the study include the provision of safe and supportive workplaces for lesbian-identified midwives, the use of inclusive language such as partner and parent, acknowledgement of the woman's partner as a co-parent, midwifery resources featuring same-sex parents and midwifery education covering diverse family forms.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lesbian mothers</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Birth control</field><field name="subject">Gay parents</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/51</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The journey towards employment for Chinese early childhood student teachers: a case study</field><field name="creator">Heald, Denise J</field><field name="description">The topic of this thesis stems from my interest in finding out whether a partial early childhood Certificate qualification could procure employment in early childhood centres for Chinese student teachers, which could then eventuate in Permanent Residency status. Employment in early childhood centres is currently being driven by the need to comply with Ministry of Education requirements which state that centres need to have fifty per cent of their teachers fully qualified and registered by 2007. The literature surrounding the employment experiences of Asian immigrants to New Zealand reveals negative outcomes, and discrimination is cited as one of the causes of this. However, early childhood education in New Zealand espouses a strong philosophy of cultural diversity and inclusive practice.The employment experiences of seven Chinese early childhood student teachers are documented in this thesis using a qualitative mixed-method approach involving Case Study as the overarching methodology/method, supplemented with Narrative Inquiry and Documentary Analyses to collect and analyse the data.The main findings of my research were: there are obstacles that this ethnic group faced in gaining employment relevant to their qualification - this was a negative, but not unexpected outcome. The second major finding was that, despite the over-arching philosophy of early childhood education in Aotearoa/New Zealand, I found that there were several areas where the participants of this study were vulnerable to 'discrimination'. This was predominantly in the form of unfair practices and included: interview experiences; relief teaching; employment contracts; and payment issues. The participants of this study were also vulnerable in other ways. In order to enrol in further study to become fully qualified, they need to achieve a high IELTS (International English Language Testing System) level.A third and much more positive outcome was that participants who found employment did so through practicum placements, networks of friends, and with those centres that were accepting of 'cultural difference'. All of these findings were to some extent largely congruent with the literature on immigration experiences of 'migrants'.Further research needs to be undertaken on this topic by myself, and others in this field, in particular, how International Students are 'protected' in Aotearoa/New Zealand. I found that there was a 'loophole' in the Immigration Points Table and that International Students are possibly being encouraged to enrol in Early Childhood Certificate programmes in the belief that they will find employment and eventually Permanent Residency status. This research shows that this is not always the case.In addition to this, further research needs to focus on the views of centre owners and staff, with regard to employing Chinese early childhood educators; the views of Chinese parents with regard to their perspective of Chinese teachers and lastly, in the area of relief teaching. In the conclusion several recommendations for changes to policy and practice at the tertiary level are raised.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early childhood teachers</field><field name="subject">Asian teachers</field><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Culturally competent care</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">Immigrants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/52</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epicardial pacing in New Zealand (1977-2002)</field><field name="creator">Searby, Karen Ann</field><field name="description">Reviews of clinical practice for paediatric pacemaker implantation and follow-up are necessary to provide an evidence-base for future policy and practice in this field. Epicardial pacing data available through Green Lane Hospital, New Zealand's (NZ) primary referral centre for paediatric cardiac surgery and pacemaker implantation, was reviewed with the following aims:  Assessment of pacemaker lead performance over time in relation to the type of epicardial lead implanted - steroid-eluting (SE) and non steroid-eluting (NSE).  Determination of the survival rate of epicardial leads. Identifying factors predicting or associated with lead failure.A database of pacing and sensing thresholds and lead impedance data at implant, 2, 6 and 18 weeks and 6 monthly intervals thereafter, was compiled and the prevalence and timing of complications in relation to lead type, location and implant route determined. In total 192 leads (155 SE, 37 NSE) were implanted in 96 patients (52 male) aged 3 days to 71 years (y) (median 1.7y), 74 patients were &lt; 17 years of age at implant. Congenital heart defects were present in 82% of patients. Follow-up (f/u) was possible for 180 leads. Mean f/u duration for the 150 SE leads was 3.1y (2 weeks - 8.8y) and for the 30 NSE leads was 4.5y (2 weeks - 27y).SE and NSE pacing thresholds were similar at implant. NSE pacing thresholds peaked at 6 weeks post implant and remained significantly higher than SE leads throughout f/u in surviving leads, although the difference was small at 2 and 4 y. SE and NSE leads had similar ventricular sensing thresholds and lead impedances throughout the study period.Survival at 5 years for all leads was 61% (66% for SE leads and 41% for NSE leads). Primary causes of failure in the leads receiving f/u were exit block and lead fracture. The occurrence of exit block was significantly higher (p&lt;0.0001) in NSE leads (57%) compared to SE leads (5%). Lead fracture occurred in 15% of leads with the highest fracture rate at 2-3 y post implant. Patient age and weight at implant, gender, previous cardiac surgery, lead polarity, indication for pacing and implant route were not predictors of lead failure. NSE leads were 6 times more likely to fail compared to SE leads (p &lt;0.0001).The main study findings were: SE leads maintain lower pacing thresholds and a reduced incidence of exit block compared to NSE leads. It is therefore recommended that SE leads be developed which can penetrate fibrosed, scarred or fatty epicardial surfaces. Where SE lead use is contraindicated, alternative surgical techniques for SE lead placement should be attempted rather than implanting NSE leads. Lead fracture is a significant complication of epicardial pacing in paediatric patients. Using stronger bipolar leads implanted by the subxiphoid route may reduce the risk of fracture. Medium term survival (5 y) of SE epicardial leads is acceptable and therefore the continued use of these leads is recommended, particularly in young patients, allowing their veins to be saved for transvenous leads later in their life.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiac pacemakers</field><field name="subject">Cardiac pacing</field><field name="subject">Cardiac Pacing, Artificial</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/54</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MICE and local economic development in New Zealand: defining a role for the web</field><field name="creator">Lau, Kam Hong Chloe</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how information and communication technologies (ICT), particularly the World Wide Web (Web), can contribute to the role that Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Conventions, and Exhibitions (MICE) properties play in local economic development (LED).

The emergence of the new information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the context of transnational capitalism precipitates the co modification of information, communication and knowledge. This process is obscured by the ideological construction of techno-futurism. Techno-futurism is a combination of technological determinism and futurism that appropriates notions of progress. In the pages which follow, historical analyses of this ideology inform the subsequent critique of knowledge economy discourse. In New Zealand knowledge economy discourse contained techno-futurist elements and deflected attention from the global absorption of national capitalism. In this context the Catching the Knowledge Wave Conference (KWC), held in Auckland in the first days of August 2001, is examined. I argue that the instigators and organisers of the conference were enmeshed within the business culture of finance capital and ICTs. Textual analysis of keynote addresses reveals the ideological dimensions to knowledge wave and knowledge economy talk. These dimensions are; entrepreneurialism, knowledge as (economic) progress, and globalism.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Technological</field><field name="subject">Innovations</field><field name="subject">Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/56</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The window: an experimental short film about a man who lives his life in darkness</field><field name="creator">Jain, Priti</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the potential of typography as a significant visual element in the narration of a short film.

Further research has shown large performance benefits in sprint and endurance power (7 - 9%) when cyclists combined explosive single-leg jumps with cycling-specific high-intensity interval training during a competitive season. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the jumps to the gains in performance in competitive cyclists in a randomized control trial.The training protocol for the control group was based on previous experimental work in which the control group (n=8) completed cycle specific interval training followed by a series of explosive single-leg jumps. The experimental group (n=7) carried out the same cycle specific interval training but did not participate in the explosive single-leg jumps. While the current study did not use a true control group, the investigation was carried out in the knowledge that a combination of high intensity interval cycling and explosive single-leg jumps causes changes positive changes in performance. Participants took part in 10 x 30-min sessions consisting four sets of high intensity intermittent cycling (4 x 30-s maximum efforts at 50 - 60 min-1 alternating with 30-s recovery). Between each set of 4 x 30 s sprints the control (ballistic) group carried out one set of explosive single-leg jumps (20 for each leg), while the experimental (continuous) group cycled for 20 s at 50 - 60 min-1.Before and after the training period all cyclists completed an incremental peak power test for assessment of VO2max, lactate threshold, exercise economy and peak power, a 30 s Wingate sprint test and a 20 km time-trial. Relative to the control group the percent mean changes (&#177;90% confidence limits) in the experimental group were: power at 4-mM lactate, -4.2 (&#177;6.3); VO2max, -3.1 (&#177;3.7); mean time-trial power, -0.7 (&#177; 4.7); peak incremental power, -1.7; (&#177;5.0); power at 80% max heart rate, -2.8; (&#177;5.6); Wingate peak power, -4.2; (&#177;7.8). We conclude that high-intensity training may improve performance but the combination of high-intensity training and explosive resistance training in the competitive phase is likely to produce greater gains in trained cyclists than high intensity cycling alone.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competitive cycling</field><field name="subject">Randomized controlled trials</field><field name="subject">Performance gains</field><field name="subject">High intensity interval training</field><field name="subject">Explosive single-leg jumps</field><field name="subject">Training protocols</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/58</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation study of intangible business relationship value measurement</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Annie Liqin</field><field name="description">Both marketing researchers and practitioners realise that having customer relationships that enhance a firm's competitive advantage is an important strategic issue and that there is a need for relationship value measurement. But the research on relationship value measurement is limited, especially from a seller's perspective, despite numerous calls for it. The reason for the limited research might be that the nature of customer relationships is complex, largely intangible, and long-term oriented. Baxter and Matear's (2004) study directly addresses the issue of the measurement of the intangible part of the value of a business-to-business relationship from a seller's perspective. Synthesising an intellectual capital model into the relationship marketing literature, Baxter and Matear (2004) propose an intangible relationship value (IRV) model for assessing the value of the intangible part of the resources that sellers gain through their relationships with their business buyers. The IRV model has been empirically tested and supported in New Zealand's manufacturing industry. The current study replicated Baxter and Matear's (2004) study in order to further assess the validity of the IRV model and its scales. Exploratory factor analysis was used first to identify the dimensionality of the IRV. Then the four aspects of construct validity - reliability, and convergent, discriminant, and nomological validities - were examined. The exploratory factor analysis of the focal relationship value items in the questionnaire found six first-order dimensions of the IRV. As expected, these six first-order value dimensions are the same as in the Baxter and Matear (2004) study: competence, attitude, intellectual agility, relationships, organisation, and renewal and development. Further exploratory factor analysis of the summated scales of these six first-order values found two higher-order value dimensions: the human intangible value dimension and the structural intangible value dimension. Thus the dimensionality of the IRV model is supported in the current study. The exploratory factor analysis retained 36 out of the initial 42 measures developed by Baxter and Matear (2004). These 36 retained measures include 20 of the 22 measures in Baxter and Matear's (2004) final purified scales. The validity of these 36 measures was then further investigated. The reliability examination found that the measurements of the six first-order IRV constructs are reliable in the current study. Evidence was also found for the convergent and discriminant validities in the measurements of the human and structural intangible value, the convergent validity in the measurement of the IRV, and the nomological validity of the IRV construct. Thus, the 36 measures retained in the final results of the current study are valid for the respondents in the current study. The findings suggest that Baxter and Matear's (2004) intellectual capital approach to measuring IRV is appropriate. It has potentially provided a way to assess intangible value in relationships. Based on the dimensions and the measures provided by the IRV model, sellers can systematically assess the potential IRV of their current and potential customer relationships, and make their strategic decisions on how to manage these customer relationships accordingly.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship value</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Value measurement</field><field name="subject">Intangible value</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/60</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental techniques to determine the Young's Modulus of the trachea</field><field name="creator">Hermawan, Vera</field><field name="description">In addition to its usefulness in modeling and simulation processes, the modulus of elasticity is an index which is highly used in biomedical identifications and tissue characterizations. For many composite and viscoelastic materials an "accurate modulus" is an idealistic hypothesis and an "equivalent modulus" is normally of a high biomechanical significance. The composite shape of the trachea, which consists of the smooth muscles and cartilage rings, renders the fact that an equivalent modulus is in place for many applications. In this paper three in-vitro nondestructive testing techniques are presented to determine the Young modulus of elasticity of the trachea and the results are compared with the standard uniaxial state of stress method. These techniques are based on: (1) simulating the trachea as a pressurized vessel and deducing a special relationship between the pressure and the radial strain; (2) using two hydrophones and studying the variation in acoustic transmittance caused by the presence of the trachea in a water-bath; (3) considering the trachea as a thin cylindrical shell and determining the resonance vibration response.

It focuses on the lived experience of therapists and the different meanings made of what is experienced. The purpose of this research is to bring into the light spiritual experiences of therapists and how they are experienced in the therapeutic process. It contributes to current debate about spiritual experience in the day- to- day practice of psychotherapy. The methodology of phenomenological hermeneutics is chosen as it provides the means to study therapists' lived experience. The study is guided by the philosophical thinking of Heidegger, Gadamer and Van Manen.The findings of this study reveal different types of spiritual experience. These include non-ordinary states of consciousness where there is a feeling sense of being beyond the boundaries of linear time and space. Experiences involve noticing subtle body feelings before they manifest in everyday consciousness. They include hearing and seeing phenomena that may normally be overlooked or disavowed in psychotherapy. The findings show therapists' ability to notice, explore and utilize subtle body phenomena was a combination of their own capabilities, their spiritual practice, and years of experience as therapists. The therapist's body appeared to be like a doorway into experiences that had transformative effects on both therapists and clients. The meanings made of experiences reflected therapists' spiritual and cultural beliefs. These beliefs meant that therapists are attuned to something bigger than everyday identity that gave meaning and purpose to the work and was a rich source of wisdom and guidance, comfort and a sense of being held in the work.  Specific attitudes and qualities of presence are revealed that reflect therapists' spiritual beliefs. Participants described experiences that emerged out of the context of the therapeutic relationship but could not be explained clinically. The findings show therapists' world views, their spiritual and cultural beliefs and capacity to experience the unknown, bring a richness and diversity of meanings to the therapeutic relationship that includes the wider contexts of culture and the environment.  This study explores current thinking about spiritual experience in psychotherapy and its effects on the therapist. It raises issues for further discussion relating to the role of therapists' spiritual experience in contemporary psychotherapy.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychotherapists</field><field name="subject">Interpretative methodology</field><field name="subject">Unstructured interviews</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Dreams and synchronicities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/64</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fate of vitamin C in commercial fruit juices</field><field name="creator">Nagra, Surinder</field><field name="description">Vitamin C occurs in relatively high concentrations in fresh and processed fruits and vegetables but is found to a lesser extent in animal tissues and animal-derived products. Nearly 90 % of vitamin C in the human diet is obtained from fruits and vegetables but this can be indirect by way of commercially prepared fruit juices. These juices are often enriched with vitamin C which has been synthetically prepared. There is a wide range of such juices on the New Zealand market, and they are a significant source of dietary vitamin C for many in the population. The focus of this research is on the Keri range of juice products.The present study monitors the fate of vitamin C during storage of Keri juices up to the best-before date, and under a range of other storage and consumption situations. Two methods were adopted for determining ascorbic acid (AA, the chemical identity of vitamin C). These were the titrimetric method, which is based upon the reduction of the dye 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol by AA in acidic solution, and liquid chromatography, which is used to separate AA from its immediate oxidation product dehydroascorbic acid. In the latter method these two analytes can be measured independently. The liquid chromatography was less successful than the simpler titrimetric method, so most of the work was done by titration. However, the concentration of dehydroascorbic acid, which has vitamin C activity in vivo, remained uncertain. Moreover, the titrimetric method could not be applied to juices with high purple anthocyanin concentrations, like blackcurrant, because the colour change at the titration end point could not be detected. pH adjustment to change colour was ineffective, and decolourisation with charcoal led to the rapid and complete destruction of AA. The concentration of AA in Keri juices at the time of manufacture were always much higher than claimed on the labels. Storage for up to nine months at room temperature resulted in a loss in AA of between 37 and 68 %, depending on the juice and exposure to fluorescent light. However, the time of storage was a much more dominant factor than light exposure. The kinetics of loss, straight lines, were most easily explained by an aerobic model of AA degradation from oxygen diffusing across the polyethylene tetraphthalate bottle wall. Overall, the label claims made were defensible in terms of the best-before date, because it took at least 100 days of storage before the AA concentration in the most susceptible juices fell below the claimed value. This is because these drinks are fast moving consumer goods and storage beyond 100 days is unlikely. (Nonetheless, the supplier (Keri Juice Company) has since adopted its new unitised method of formulating juice. This has resulted in an initially higher concentration of vitamin C as compared to the juices under investigation.) In the nine months storage experiment there was some evidence for the presence of dehydroascorbic acid in blackcurrant drinks, but not in another three juices. Pasteurisation during preparation of these drinks resulted in up to 7 % loss of AA, probably due to oxygen dissolved in water, and accelerated by heat of pasteurisation. Higher temperatures in later storage also accelerated losses. Progressive exposure of juice to air during simulated consumption of 3 L bottles over a week also accelerated losses. Finally, exposure to sunlight in a diurnal temperature environment accelerated losses five-fold higher than in total darkness. Filtration of ultraviolet light approximately halved the loss due to sunlight. Overall however, it can be concluded that AA in the Keri range of juices is very resistant to degradation of AA.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commercially prepared fruit juice</field><field name="subject">Titration</field><field name="subject">Liquid chromatography</field><field name="subject">Vitamin C loss</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/67</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene selection based on consistency modelling, algorithms and applications</field><field name="creator">Hu, Yingjie (Raphael)</field><field name="description">Consistency modeling for gene selection is a new topic emerging from recent cancer bioinformatics research. The result of classification or clustering on a training set was often found very different from the same operations on a testing set. Here, the issue is addressed as a consistency problem. In practice, the inconsistency of microarray datasets prevents many typical gene selection methods working properly for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In an attempt to deal with this problem, a new concept of performance-based consistency is proposed in this thesis.An interesting finding in our previous experiments is that by using a proper set of informative genes, we significantly improved the consistency characteristic of microarray data. Therefore, how to select genes in terms of consistency modelling becomes an interesting topic. Many previously published gene selection methods perform well in the cancer diagnosis domain, but questions are raised because of the irreproducibility of experimental results. Motivated by this, two new gene selection methods based on the proposed performance-based consistency concept, GAGSc (Genetic Algorithm Gene Selection method in terms of consistency) and LOOLSc (Leave-one-out Least-Square bound method with consistency measurement) were developed in this study with the purpose of identifying a set of informative genes for achieving replicable results of microarray data analysis.The proposed consistency concept was investigated on eight benchmark microarray and proteomic datasets. The experimental results show that the different microarray datasets have different consistency characteristics, and that better consistency can lead to an unbiased and reproducible outcome with good disease prediction accuracy.As an implementation of the proposed performance-based consistency, GAGSc and LOOLSc are capable of providing a small set of informative genes. Comparing with those traditional gene selection methods without using consistency measurement, GAGSc and LOOLSc can provide more accurate classification results. More importantly, GAGSc and LOOLSc have demonstrated that gene selection, with the proposed consistency measurement, is able to enhance the reproducibility in microarray diagnosis experiments.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gene selection</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Bias</field><field name="subject">Reproducability</field><field name="subject">Cancer bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">DNA microarrays</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/69</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of consumer knowledge in consumer evaluations of brand extension</field><field name="creator">Ma, Yun</field><field name="description">This study examines the effects of two types of consumer knowledge, product and brand knowledge, on consumer fit perceptions between an extension and its parent brand, so as to further investigate the role of consumer knowledge in brand extension evaluations.

Pain in labour has been extensively researched from the woman's perspective, but less has been explored in relation to the midwife and her approach to pain. The way in which the midwife works with a woman and her pain in labour is the focus of this qualitative study, using Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenology. This philosophical approach seeks to uncover or illuminate aspects of the midwife's practice which are frequently taken for granted in their everydayness. Seven midwives, including both independent practitioners and hospital-employed, were interviewed. Their narratives were analysed to uncover the meaning of the way in which midwives work with women and their pain in labour. The findings of this thesis suggest that midwives work by interpreting the woman's pain. Before the pain begins, they 'leap ahead' to help them anticipate the pain and how they will confront it. During labour, midwives give pain meaning by translating its purpose in that context. They 'leap in' when required, sometimes using 'self as an intervention. Midwives interpret women's pain through their understanding of lived time. They know how the perception of time passing changes depending on the setting for labour or the amount of anxiety and pain the woman is experiencing. Midwives use time in their work. They break it down to help a woman focus on a single contraction rather than looking too far ahead toward the unknown. Time can be a midwife's friend when the arrival of the baby replaces the urgent need for pain relief. It can also be her enemy if her interpretation of a woman's pain differs from the woman's perception. The memory of pain may persist for the woman, after labour has finished, with a backlash for the midwife. Some midwives believe in the process of birth and the woman's ability to labour with such conviction that they gain a woman's complete trust. At her most vulnerable time, they encourage the woman to call upon inner reserves and be truly empowered by her experience.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwives</field><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Pain</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/72</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using information and communication technology to facilitate supply chain management in the New Zealand construction industry</field><field name="creator">Wang, Ye</field><field name="description">The New Zealand construction supply chain today is inefficient. From a literature review it is found that non value adding activities including waste of time and materials are caused by islands of information with ineffective communication between supply chain participants. This represents an opportunity for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to provide a strategic supply chain management model for the industry enabling interaction and shared information between all parties. To evaluate the performance of ICTs in the New Zealand construction supply chain, this thesis uses as a case study newly launched software---BlueSky. BlueSky was developed by the Building Integration Software Company located in AUT Technical Park. BlueSky was designed to integrate the fragments of the current information flow of the chain from architect through to the end property owner.   Supporting Data was gathered by distributing a structured questionnaire designed to find the opportunities and inhibitors for utilizing ICTs to facilitate the synthesis of the chain. 200 responses were received. The study was funded by a TEC grant. The BlueSky case study is based on two pilot sites; one is an architectural design company and the other is a master contractor company in Auckland. The case study also evaluated the potential problems which may bring risks to supply chain members and provide possible recommendations for future research.  The study found from the results of the questionnaire that a significant shift in the mindset of participants of the supply chain will be necessary in terms of collaboration and team work if mutual benefits are to be achieved.  It is found that in the two pilot sites BlueSky did make a significant difference in terms of reduced cost, accuracy of information, improved documentation management, and overall increased speed and clarity of information.  In the wider community of the industry as a whole considerable education is needed to break down mistrust between members. In general each member appears to be determined to secure the best result as individuals rather than considering the overall outcome for the whole chain. This reluctance to co-operate is coupled with a reluctance to utilize ICTs. Recommendations are made to overcome this mindset.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supply chain</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="subject">Business communication</field><field name="subject">Information and communication technologies</field><field name="subject">Construction industry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/74</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being constrained and enabled: a study of pre-registration nursing students ethical practice</field><field name="creator">Johns, Susan</field><field name="description">This study uncovers the experience of being ethical from the perspective of pre-registration nursing students. Using the qualitative methodology of phenomenology, specifically that outlined by van Manen, it seeks to show how students act ethically within everyday practice.Ethics is vital to any health related profession and the growing complexity of New Zealand's health care system requires more responsibility for ethical decision making in nursing care. Providing nursing care is an ethically charged undertaking and despite ethics taking an increasingly important place in nursing education few studies show the contextual nature of ethical practice from the perspective of students. This study aims to partly redress this situation.In this study I have interpreted the experiences of twelve pre-registration students. Using seventeen stories shared by the student participants, my personal understandings and literature, the meaning of being ethical has been illuminated. Three themes emerged from the interpretation. These include 'keeping things 'nice'', 'being true to yourself' and 'being present'. This thesis asserts that the overarching theme within these themes is that of 'being constrained and enabled'. Being constrained shows the experiences of students as they live through the tensions of being and doing as they strive to be ethical. Being enabled shows the experience of self-determination. Finally the study maintains that the shaping of ethical practice for undergraduate students may be enhanced when their reality is positioned and valued within educational processes.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing students</field><field name="subject">Nursing ethic</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/75</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What influence does brand image and brand reputation have towards achieving a sustained competitive advantage in the sports apparel industry?</field><field name="creator">Sweeney, Brett</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research was to investigate the contribution of brand image and brand reputation towards the creation of a sustained competitive advantage (SCA) in the sports apparel industry. The literature review indicates that intangible resources are more likely to be sources of SCA because they are invisible and difficult to copy. In addition, brand image and brand reputation are recognised as two of the most important intangible resources. However, the relationship between brand image, brand reputation and SCA has not been sufficiently explored. A comparative case study of three leading sports apparel brands Adidas, Puma and Canterbury Clothing Company was conducted. Data were collected supporting a triangulation collection method of secondary data sources as well as interviews with a senior manager from each of the brands and two focus groups conducted with consumers. Data analysis involved a six-step coding process, also known as thematic analysis. Subsequent analysis identified three elements that influence both brand image and brand reputation. Sponsorship, product quality and media were found to influence how consumers perceive a firm's brand image, and over time this brand image is believed to create a brand reputation. Furthermore, findings suggest that brand image will potentially lead toward a competitive advantage (CA) and brand reputation can potentially lead towards a SCA. These elements are underpinned by eight propositions and are presented in a proposed model.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/76</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fiji 2000 coup: a media analysis</field><field name="creator">Gounder, Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of both the local and international media during the May 2000 coup, to determine whether the coverage was fair and to suggest solutions for the future. It will first discuss and compare literature that has been written on the Fiji coups, focusing on literature on the media and the coups in particular. According to Fowler (1991) the role of a journalist is to collect facts, report them objectively and present them fairly and without bias in language which is designed to be unambiguous, undistorting and agreeable to readers. However, in most times this is not the case. A thematic content analysis will be done on news articles that appeared in The Fiji Times, The New Zealand Herald and The Australian to find common themes during the coverage of the crisis. A lot of criticism of the both the local and international media&#8217;s role during the May 2000 coup emerged after the crisis. Critics included editors and journalists of the local and international media and political and historical analysts who knew the &#8216;real reasons&#8217; behind the coup and did not see this being reported. A summary of interviews with journalists and editors who covered the coup, both local and overseas, will give an insight into their thoughts and reactions during the coup. It will also determine whether the journalists suffered from the Stockholm syndrome. The Stockholm syndrome describes the behaviour of kidnap victims or people who associate a lot with the captors, and who over time become sympathetic to their captors. The name is derived from a 1973 hostage siege in Stockholm, Sweden when at the end of six days of captivity at a bank; several kidnap victims actually resisted rescue attempts, and afterwards refused to testify against their captors. During the Fiji coup, apart from Speights supporters, journalists were the only ones who spent a lot of time with the coup leader either at press conferences or staying at Parliament to get good stories. As a result, some journalists began to &#8216;sway&#8217; towards Speight or began to experience the Stockholm  syndrome which was reflected in their stories. The thesis concludes that a few journalists in Fiji did suffer from the Stockholm syndrome. It also concludes that a crisis manual is needed for media organisations in Fiji to avoid the same mistakes being repeated as in the last three coups. The overseas media on the other hand need to attach themselves to the local media to avoid parachute journalism and inaccurate reporting. Overseas media organisations need to assign special reporters to Pacific Island affairs to understand the culture and other complex issues which would help in reporting their issues fairly and accurately.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Coup d'&#233;tat, 2000</field><field name="subject">Press coverage</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/77</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New sport teams and the development of brand community</field><field name="creator">Grant, Nigel</field><field name="description">The professional sport market and its established teams offer consumers a service and experience that is typically high in social identification, emotional involvement (Underwood, Bond &amp; Baer, 2001) and a sense of community or social belonging (Heere &amp; James, in press). The strong social attachment to a sports organisation and its brand is proposed here to closely resemble the concept of a brand community (Mu&#241;iz Jr &amp; O'Guinn, 2001). For newly-established teams without a considerable history, along with having to compete with their established competitors, there is generally a lack of consumer identification or emotional investment in the team.This study aimed to investigate newly-established teams within the New Zealand sports market with two specific research questions: 1) What issues affect the development of a new sports team brand, and 2) Do managers of new sports teams use antecedents of brand community or social identification in their branding strategies, and if so, how?A qualitative, case study approach was used; featuring both interviews with managers of three newly-established New Zealand sports teams and direct observations of their stadiums. Findings suggested that the managers believed that existing image and awareness, audience nature, win-loss record, quality of the team or competition, and a lack of history were the main issues affecting the development of their brands. Respondents largely considered the antecedents of a brand community as important, with the exception of history. Promotion of these antecedents was largely absent from each of the team's branding strategies. Along with providing a detailed review of brand community literature, this thesis provides recommendations for managers of new teams on how to develop and position branding strategy toward the long-term goal of creating a community around their team brand.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Branding</field><field name="subject">Sport marketing</field><field name="subject">Brand community</field><field name="subject">Sports management</field><field name="subject">Consumer identification</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/78</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The leadership experience of first line nurse managers working in the Cook Islands: a qualitative descriptive study</field><field name="creator">Iro, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">A qualitative descriptive approach was undertaken to explore the leadership experience of seven first line nurse managers working in the Cook Islands.  For the purposes of this study first line nurse managers are those nurses working as a charge nurse in a hospital, nursing supervisors, chief public health nurse, and nurses working autonomously in the outer islands of the Cook Islands.  Nurses in these roles are in key positions to influence the practice of others and set the standard of practice and culture of a unit.  The participants were recruited if they were currently employed in any of these positions.  The seven participants were all Cook Islands women who received their undergraduate nursing education in the Cook Islands. The purpose of the study was to describe their leadership experience, to raise an awareness of their role, and to make recommendations to support and improve the preparation of nurses for leadership roles in the Cook Islands.  Through face-to-face interviews, the participants' stories were audio taped and transcribed verbatim.  Six of the seven transcripts required translation from Cook Islands Maori to English and this was conducted by the researcher who is fluent in both languages.  Content and thematic analysis of the data revealed a spiritual, emotive and intuitive theme in the participants' leadership experience.  The findings of the study revealed the self confidence of these nurses to manage in this role despite being challenged by management issues and the lack of preparedness for the role.  The supportive network established within their staff, their family and the people around them has provided the impetus to continue to 'serve' their people.  The findings also revealed that these nurses recognised the need to continue to learn and develop themselves and their staff.   The findings of this study have significance for nurses aspiring to be nurse leaders in the Cook Islands or other Pacific Islands and rural communities.  A key stakeholder in this study is the Cook Islands Ministry of Health, as insights and awareness gained can contribute to an appropriate preparation and support programme for nurses working in its organisation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative descriptive study</field><field name="subject">Leadership theories</field><field name="subject">Self-awareness</field><field name="subject">Professional relationships</field><field name="subject">Life long learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/79</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lightness, sustainability, design: framing product design</field><field name="creator">Boult, Martin</field><field name="description">To design anything with lightness in mind is perhaps a contradiction in itself. To impose upon the designer such a factor from the outset of a brief surely creates a burden or limitation in the consideration of materials and form. However, the focus of this research project is to examine and apply lightness in a range of contexts or conditions. The aim is to explore the singularity of each condition; then to discuss the paradox and contradictions that are often present in new products that continue to predominate with a duplicitous emphasis on aesthetics and form. For the purpose of exploration of lightness, a series of products will be created to expose the paradox that exists in deploying a strategy such as lightness in singularity, without considering broader implication of product design on the environment, economy and society. These 3D outputs comprise the practice based component of this research, the balance to be a written exegesis. The genuine crisis of sustainable design is the need to design to construct a point of view on design - a paradoxically futile position that is directly linked to the challenge of engaging in true sustainable product design practice. This paradox will be investigated through a range of Sustainable Product Design strategies, examining the irony that exists in producing more goods and services to solve the problems of a world already oversupplied with the 'stuff' of humankind.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Light</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Paradox</field><field name="subject">Society</field><field name="subject">Sustainable</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Product</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/80</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudinal shifting: a grounded theory of health promotion in coronary care</field><field name="creator">Watson, Sheona</field><field name="description">Current New Zealand health policy encourages collaborative health promotion in all sectors of health service delivery. The integrated approach to the acute management of coronary heart disease in a coronary care unit, combining medical therapy and lifestyle change, supports clinical health promotion. The aim of this study was to use the grounded theory approach to discover the main concerns of nurses' promoting health in an acute coronary care setting and to explain the processes that nurses used to integrate health promotional activities into their practice. Seventeen registered nurses from three coronary care units within a large metropolitan city in New Zealand were interviewed. Data were constantly compared and analysed using Glaser's emergent approach to grounded theory.The main concern for nurses promoting health within coronary care was ritualistic practice. In this study, ritualistic practice concerns the medically-based protocols, routines, language and technology that drives nursing practice in coronary care. This concern was resolved via the socio-cultural process of attitudinal shifting that occurs over time involving three stages. The three conceptual categories, environmental pressures, practice reality and responsive action are the main components of the theory of attitudinal shifting. In environmental pressures nurses experience a tension between specialist medically-dominated nursing practice and the generalist nursing role of promoting health. In practice reality, nurses become aware that the individual needs of patients are not being met. This causes role conflict until the nurse observes colleagues who role model possibilities for practice, working with patients to promote health. Responsive action sees the nurse engaging in self-development, also focusing on the nurse-patient relationship, thereby enabling active patient involvement in individual health-promoting decisions.The findings from this research have implications for nursing practice and education. With the increasing specialisation in nursing practice, these findings may be of interest to nurses working in delegated medical roles where the reality of everyday practice precludes nurses from undertaking their essential nursing role. Health care facilities also need to ensure that there are opportunities for the personal and professional development of nursing staff. The place of health promotion within nursing undergraduate curricula needs to be examined, as many nurses found that they were ill prepared for undertaking health promotional activities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Glaser</field><field name="subject">Coronary care nursing</field><field name="subject">Health promotion</field><field name="subject">Health policy - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/81</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The game is not the same: a history of professional rugby in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Martin, Gerard John</field><field name="description">Rugby, an intensely physical team game that emphasised the contribution of players of disparate skills and strengths, was ideal for New Zealand's early European pioneers. It also suited the nature of the indigenous people. Rugby club competitions and provincial matches provided a significant social fulcrum and a means of playing out regional rivalries. Arduous, but ultimately successful rugby tours to Britain and Ireland, brought Pakeha and Maori together and helped to shape the young colony's self-image. New Zealand's commitment to its national game became instrumental in rugby's steadily growing international popularity.Although rugby had significant commercial appeal, it remained an amateur sport in deference to its British originators. Nevertheless, New Zealand's hosting of the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 coincided with the development of global media networks. By the third Rugby World Cup tournament in 1995, substantial commercial interest in the game meant that a transition to a professional structure was inevitable. Rugby appealed to media conglomerates needing new televisual product that would attract subscribers to growing pay-TV networks.Although the introduction of professionalism was a major commercial success, the commercial imperatives imposed allowed rugby to be dominated by those with the most financial and player resources. As a consequence, New Zealand's traditional advantages were diluted. This generated considerable tension between New Zealand's professional game and its amateur grassroots level that has been rugby's traditional base. While supplying the game's players and supporters, grassroots rugby has been the level of the game most vulnerable to the negative impact of professionalisation.To generate the income to adequately fund the game's grassroots, it is critical that New Zealand's leading teams remain among the world's best. However, the professionalisation of rugby has made winning far more difficult than ever before. New Zealand rugby's challenge is to mitigate the commercial imperatives that place it at a significant disadvantage in the international game.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rugby football</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Professional sports</field><field name="subject">Television and sports</field><field name="subject">Communication studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/82</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of breathing pattern retraining on performance in competitive cyclists</field><field name="creator">Vickery, Rachel L</field><field name="description">The increased work of breathing associated with intense cycling has been identified as a factor that may negatively affect cycling performance.  The aerodynamic position, abnormal respiratory mechanics either at rest or during exercise, and the development of a tachypnoeic breathing pattern are factors known to increase the work of breathing.  Breathing pattern retraining aims to decrease the work of breathing by delaying the onset of dynamic hyperinflation and the recruitment of accessory breathing muscles.  To date no studies have investigated the performance, physiological and perceptual consequences of manipulating breathing pattern in trained cyclists.  Purpose:  The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of breathing pattern retraining on 20-km time trial performance and respiratory and metabolic measures in competitive cyclists.  Method: Twenty-four competitive male cyclists (age 37.7 &#177; 8.6 years, mean &#177; SD; peak 4.34 &#177; 0.47 L&#183;min-1) were match paired on 20-km time trial performance and assigned at random to either an intervention group (breathing pattern retraining; N = 12) or control group (N = 12).  20-km time trial performance, pulmonary function and the physiological and perceptual response during a maximal incremental cycle step test were assessed pre- and post-intervention.  The intervention group underwent four weeks of specific breathing pattern retraining using exercises designed to reduce dynamic hyperinflation and optimise respiratory mechanics.  The control group attended the laboratory once a week during this period and performed a 10 minute sub-maximal ride wearing a biofeedback breathing harness.  The control group was led to believe the purpose for their participation was to investigate the effect that maximal exercise had on breathing pattern, and to test the reliability of the breathing harness.  There was no attempt to modify the breathing pattern of the control group.  Data were analysed using an MS Excel spreadsheet designed for statistical analysis.  The uncertainty in the effect was expressed as 90% confidence limits and a smallest worthwhile effect of 1.0% was assumed.  Results:  The intervention group showed substantial improvements in 20-km time trial performance (-1.5 &#177; 1.1%) and incremental power (3.2 &#177; 3%).  Additionally, breathing frequency (-13.2 &#177; 8.9%; -9.5 &#177; 8.4%), tidal volume (10.6 &#177; 8.5%; 9.4 &#177; 7.6%), inspiratory time (10.1 &#177; 8%; 9.4 &#177; 7.7%), breathing RPE (-30 &#177; 33.9%; -24.7 &#177; 28.1%) and leg RPE (-27.9 &#177; 38.5%; -24.7 &#177; 28.2%) were all positively affected at lactate threshold and lactate turn point.  No positive changes were observed in the control group for 20-km time trial performance (0.0 &#177; 1.0%), incremental power (-1.4 &#177; 3.5%), breathing frequency (-1.6 &#177; 8.0%; -2.0 &#177; 7.9%), tidal volume (0.9 &#177; 7.2%; 2.9 &#177; 9.4%), breathing RPE (16.1 &#177; 50.2%, 24.8 &#177; 43%) or leg RPE (13.4 &#177; 39.6%; 19.9 &#177; 43.2%) .  Conclusion: These results provide evidence of the performance enhancing effect of four weeks of breathing pattern retraining in cyclists.  Furthermore, they suggest breathing pattern can be retrained to exhibit a controlled pattern, without a tachypnoeic shift, during high intensity cycling.  Additionally, these results indicate breathing pattern retraining attenuates the respiratory and peripheral perceived effort during incremental exercise.

This research identifies human and cultural factors that will explicitly direct the future design of an Information Systems design and development project. Current systems and approaches come from a western/euro-centric perception of the world (Locus), but much of the data that are to be stored in the system come from unique tribal sources (Demotic). These approaches, the Locus and the Demotic, oppose each other on what to store, how it should be stored and how it may be retrieved. The approaches are the result of cultural patterns that have evolved and raise issues about the treatment of data in information systems. Issues are argued against the work of Foucault and are subsequently addressed before the data that is gathered for the study are analysed. The work of Foucault is adopted and key concepts are arrived at: Kotahitanga/Herkunft, the representation of subtle, singular, and sub-individual marks that may connect and link a person to others, forming a dense network that is difficult to unravel; Hei Ahua/Entstehung, the exact essence nature of something; and, T&#175;imatanga/Ursprung, the state held at the moment of arising. These establish a framework for the analysis of data. Foucault identifies two types of person, the Genealogist and the Historian. In the study these types are used to represent the approach taken by the Locus and the Demotic. They are contrasted against each other throughout the study to show how their approaches differ in vital ways. The process of comparing and contrasting the Genealogist and the Historian includes qualitative analysis and symbolic interactionism. The ethnographic analysis method, symbolic interactionism, is used to analyse primary data sources. Qualitative analysis is used to analyse secondary sources. Together, they are used to derive a cohesive set of 38 symbols that are recognisable as factors in the development of the information system. The 38 symbols are aggregated to arrive at 29 human and cultural factors in the whakapapa process. The factors can be used to guide the development of an information system for managing complex data structures.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people) - Genealogy</field><field name="subject">System design</field><field name="subject">Whakapapa - Kupu</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/84</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The modern journeyman: influences and controls of apprentice style learning in culinary education</field><field name="creator">Emms, Simone Maria</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the shift from traditional on-site industry education (apprentice style learning) to tertiary education in academically-centred institutions, with particular emphasis on professional culinary education. With the deceptively seamless transition of numerous crafts and trades from their traditional apprentice/journeyman training and education schemes, into the tertiary education sector - from the late 1960s up until today - a crack had been created in the education process. The government had acknowledged that the possible 'confusion' and 'drop back' in traditional training schemes and apprenticeships had, to some extent, been a case of confusion or misinterpretation on the part of trade and industry and new trainees. Particularly, when the general comprehension of the 'newly' altered Education Act, New Apprenticeship Act and government-promoted shift of autonomous industry bodies to a centralised State controlled system had been largely ineffective, there was an observable decline in the traditionally mentored and educated crafts and trades. The investigation extends beyond the recent 'symptoms' of changing government Acts, extensively developing (global) tertiary education and evolving industry education responsibility to explore the deeper influences and controls of change which have brought us to where we are today. This exploration will cover a diversity of education history, government policy, industry renovation and significant world events which have changed the path of the modern journeyman and professional craft and trade education. Within the New Zealand context, little research has been found or published on this particularly involved theme [the Modern Journeyman and professional culinary education], which, by its absence has contributed to a wide chasm of unanswered enquiries and uncertainties, which now needs to be investigated. This treatise explores three key areas of 'power and control' within the arenas of politics, education and industry education. These are considered through the multi-perspective lenses of critical social science, existentialism and postmodernism. Specific attention is paid to the practical aspects of the evolving (culinary) Journeyman and the seemingly repetitive patterns of 'power and control' that have emerged from the multifarious disciplines and time-frames. Throughout the development of Western European education and the advancement of craft and trade (knowledge and practices), there has been a question of value, ownership and 'privilege' attached to who, how, where and what can be taught and learnt. And in many cases the State has either stepped in to regulate the process - as a matter of civil duty, or has taken over the process - as a form of social and ideological control. In the case of the Culinary Journeyman, the New Zealand tertiary system and the shifting authorities of professional knowledge and practice, the price which may eventually be extracted for the targeted control of education practice (mentored/apprenticed learning) and professional knowledge development, may be more than the cost of an admission to a professional tertiary cookery course in the future.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cookery</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Apprentices</field><field name="subject">Hospitality industry</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Cooks</field><field name="subject">Training of</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/85</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hesitating performance</field><field name="creator">Harris, Brent</field><field name="description">This research project participates in the genre of Performance art. It explores performativity in relation to Emmanuel Levinas' formulation of two interlacing modes of language, the ethical saying and the ontological, political said. The saying is of my originary, ethical relation to the other person that constitutes me, whereas the said is the mode of 'content', knowledge, and ontology. The project suggests that at least two registers of performativity pertain to the saying. One is in Simon Critchley's description of the saying as performative, prior to any decision to perform. In regard to another meaning of performativity, I propose that a political signification of art may be what Levinas calls a "reduction" of the said that 'performs' a showing of the saying. To perform a showing of the saying, would, in a Levinasian engagement, be to make apparent the ultimate interruption by ethics of ontology and politics, thus pointing to a constitutive non-closure of the political like that theorized by Jacques Derrida and by Critchley. Such a non-closure of the political is tentatively linked with critiques of Nicolas Bourriaud's Relational Aesthetics such as Claire Bishop's which draw on Jacques Lacan's notion of the subject. Performances explore the notion of the "reduction" of ontology resourced by Derrida's formulation of Levinas' later writing style as involving a s&#233;riature; serial and heterogeneous interruptions of the said1. The project has unfolded in a series of performance pieces, and will conclude with a final performance in March 2007. This exegesis articulates the major provocations for the project, contextualises the project with regard to selected art practices, and documents and discusses the major performance pieces.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance art</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Emmanuel Levinas</field><field name="subject">Jacques Derrida</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/86</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling a Real Time Operating System Using SpecC</field><field name="creator">Nukala, Akilesh</field><field name="description">In today's digital (electronics) world, people's desire for electronic goods that ease their life at work, and leisure is increasing the complexity of the products of the embedded systems industry. For example, MP3 players for listening to music and cell phones for communicating with people.The gap between the hardware and software parts of embedded systems is being reduced by the use of System Level Design Languages (SLDL) that can model both hardware and software simultaneously. One such SLDL is SpecC.In this thesis, a SpecC model of a Real Time Operating System (RTOS) is constructed. It is shown how RTOS features can be incorporated into a SpecC model. The model is used to develop an application involving a robot avoiding obstacles to reach its destination. The RTOS model operates similar to the actual RTOS in the robot.The application includes a testbench model for the robot, including features such as interrupts, sonar sensors and wheel pulses, so that its operation closely resembles the actual robot. The sensor model is programmed to generate the values from the four sensor receivers, similar to the behaviour of the sensors on the actual robot. Also the pulses from the wheels and associated interrupts are programmed in the model so that it resembles the interrupts and wheel pulses present on actual robot.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SLDL</field><field name="subject">SpecC</field><field name="subject">RTOS</field><field name="subject">Robot</field><field name="subject">Obstacle avoidance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/87</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is the meaning of supervision for mental health support workers? A critical hermeneutic inquiry</field><field name="creator">Sutcliffe, Robin</field><field name="description">Supervision is a process employed by health professions with the general aim of resourcing and educating workers and protecting clients. The purpose of this study was to uncover the meaning of supervision for mental health support workers (MHSW) in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Mental health support work is a non-clinical role, the aim of which is to support people who are or have been experiencing mental illness or disability. It is based on a philosophy of 'recovery' which aims to empower mental health service users and enhance their sense of personal agency. Four people employed as MHSW were interviewed both individually and in groups about their experiences of receiving supervision. Transcripts of the interviews were interpreted using a critical hermeneutic methodology.Critical hermeneutics is informed by critical social theory and is concerned with uncovering the implicit and explicit power dynamics embedded within social relationships and structures. Critical social theory proposes that reality is socially constructed and that this construction occurs through dialogue. That notion is incorporated into this study by considering the impact of the inquiry on the participants and the researcher and the contribution to the evolving traditions of MHSW and supervision of MHSW.The participants of this study all value effective supervision as a process that supports them while they support their clients. A relationship based on trust, reciprocity and mutual respect and which is held within clear and overt boundaries is experienced as supportive and enhances the quality of engagement. A supportive supervisory relationship impacted favourably on other supervisory functions such as skill development. Effective supervision was also found to contribute to personal, cultural and professional identity and to be empowering for MHSW.The study concludes that supervision is a dynamic process that all of those who participate in whether as service user, support worker, supervisor, manager or other stakeholder, are contributing to. It proposes that as MHSW occurs within a new paradigm the supervision of support workers must also be located in this paradigm. A definition of supervision in this paradigm is alluded to in the words of one of the participants of this study, "supervision is far more than supervision."</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/88</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The stakeholder value and pedagogical validity of industry certification</field><field name="creator">Hitchcock, Leo</field><field name="description">In December 2004, at the SoDIS&#174; (Software Development Impact Statements) symposium in Auckland, an industry certification as a method of credentialing teachers and analysis of SoDIS was mooted.  SoDIS, a process of ethics-based risk assessment and analysis of downstream risk to project and software stakeholders, including the public, is currently in the process of progressing from prototype to commercial product.  Certification was proposed to ensure the integrity of the process and the quality of service to stakeholders.Certification sponsored by industry, commercial organisation, or professional association (collectively referred to as industry certification, or certification) has been a form of credentialing for over half a century.  Industry certification was adopted by the IT industry when Novell, Inc. began testing and certifying IT industry and IT network professionals in 1986 (Cosgrove, 2004; Novell, 1996).  Global certification testing centres were established in 1990 by Drake International (now Thomson Prometric) (Foster, 2005).During the 1990s, industry certification became a veritable juggernaut: a "multi-billion dollar business" (Cosgrove, 2004, p. 486), an industry that has arisen in its own right (Adelman, 2000) and driven by several dynamics (Hitchcock, 2005).  In 2000 there were over 300 discrete IT certifications with approximately 1.6 million individuals holding approximately 2.4 million IT certifications (Aldelman, 2000). The total number of available certifications is impossible to quantify (Knapp &amp; Gallery, 2003).  Many academic institutions both at tertiary and secondary level are integrating industry certification, especially IT certification, into their curricula.Is industry certification, however, a pedagogically robust form of credentialing?  Does it have value to its stakeholders?  Is it an appropriate form of credentialing for the SoDIS process?  This research, using both Phenomenography and Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) as a joint methodology, focuses on the experiences of actors with the phenomenon of industry certification and extracts both the essence of the understanding and perceptions of the value and validity of industry certification, and the essence of industry certification itself.Due to the vast amount of literature found describing industry actors' perceptions of and experiences within the phenomenon, the research is predominantly literature-based.  Further data was collected from interviews with a small, purposive sample of industry certification holders and employers, with the research further informed by my own experiences within the domain which is the focus of the research.  The methodology paradigm is interpretive: the research aims to interpret the social construction that is the phenomenon of industry certification.While this research does not attempt to single out specific industry certifications to determine their value or pedagogical robustness, the findings suggest that, in general, well designed and well administered certifications with integrity and rigour of assessment processes, are indeed pedagogically sound, with significant value.  The research identifies both benefit and criticism elements of typical certifications, along with elements of the various certification programmes categorised into standard (typical), and more rigorous (less typical) certification programmes.The research develops and presents a paradigm for building an appropriate vendor  specific or vendor neutral certification programme that is pedagogically sound with value for its stakeholders.  The contrasts and complementary aspects of industry certification and academic qualifications are highlighted. It is therefore concluded, and supported by data from the interviews, that such a credential is indeed appropriate for teachers and analysts of SoDIS.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)</field><field name="subject">Phenomenography</field><field name="subject">IT industry</field><field name="subject">SoDIS (Software Development Impact Statements)</field><field name="subject">Professionalism</field><field name="subject">Credentialing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/90</field></doc><doc><field name="title">All dolled up and no place to go</field><field name="creator">Trussardi, Gabriella</field><field name="description">This body of work is the result of practice based research, culminating in a collection of five garments featuring pictorial prints, created through digital sublimation printing&#185;.

It reiterates that becoming a refugee was not a matter of choice, but for those in refugee situations it was imperative to seek refugee status for their survival. This study focuses on the housing experiences of the Auckland Somali resettled refugees and seeks to identify the effect of housing policy and provision in Auckland. It also demonstrates the links of housing to employment, education and health. Refugees face considerable resettlement challenges based on differential factors such as ethnocentrism, immigration status, household composition and socio-economic conditions. These barriers are exacerbated by a lack of English language proficiency, a variety of educational backgrounds and unfamiliarity with institutional practices, especially during their early years of adaptation as relative newcomers to New Zealand.The vulnerable position of this group in housing markets requires up to date information to increase the provider's awareness of housing experiences and their impact on the resettlement process. In turn, an increased knowledge allows evidence-based decisions for appropriate intervention, policy, and strategy developments to facilitate optimum resettlement outcomes. Policy formulation and effective implementation must focus on the identification of suitable services to address the specific barriers experienced by this group. The empirical evidence supports previous findings that there were close correlations between the participants housing experiences that are the types of housing they occupied and their income.The study developed and implemented a Participatory Research Design involving a case study approach with multiple data collection methods. The primary field data was collected from focus group participants through a workshop of qualitative discussion and a survey.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resettled refugees</field><field name="subject">Housing experiences</field><field name="subject">Resettlement</field><field name="subject">intergration</field><field name="subject">Somali resettlement in NZ</field><field name="subject">Participatory research design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/93</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of cooling circuit duration on formation of solidification shrinkage in A356 casting automative wheels</field><field name="creator">Lee, Rafael Jung Hoon</field><field name="description">Low Pressure Die Casting (LPDC) process is one the most common casting process to produce structural automotive components, such as alloy wheels and suspension components. It has been identified that cavity filling and solidification process are two most critical aspects to produce premium quality casting components.During the solidification process of casting alloy, it is a well known phenomenon that metal experiences volumetric shrinkage due to its density difference between liquid and solid phase. When this volumetric shrinkage is not properly compensated, then a casting defect commonly known as solidification shrinkage occurs. The solidification shrinkage has very detrimental effects on structural integrity required for premium quality casting such as aluminium alloy wheels.Literature and practical experiences of foundry men show that it is critical to achieve unidirectional solidification pattern by avoiding an isolated hot spot in order to minimise the solidification shrinkage. However, it is found that the geometry of industrial casting applications is often constrained by other design factors that would not naturally avoid these isolated hot spots. The subject of this research, aluminium alloy wheels, is not excluded from this constraint.In aluminium alloy wheels, an isolated hot spot is commonly observed in an area known as rim and spoke junction due to its geometry constraints. Consequently, the solidification shrinkage is commonly experienced, which is undesirable due to its detrimental effects for the structural integrity of alloy wheels. In order to minimise the solidification shrinkage, forced cooling method is applied to avoid an isolated hot spot. The control of this forced cooling is achieved by cooling media, flow rate of cooling media and duration cooling circuit. Foundry experiments in industrial environment were conducted producing aluminium alloy wheels using commercially treated A356 (Al-Si) alloy, where different durations of cooling circuit were used to understand the sensitivity of solidification shrinkage formation to the duration of cooling circuit. This was followed by metallurgical structure analysis and numerical modelling to suggest the sensitivity of cooling circuit duration in controlling solidification shrinkage.The major finding conclusion of this research is that control of the shrinkage formation is not very sensitive to the duration cooling circuit. It is suggested that as casting solidifies initially from the mould wall, it retracts away from the cast-mould interface due to thermal contraction. Consequently, air gap is formed between casting and mould interface, creating an effective thermal resistance layer. Thereafter, heat transfer across the cast-mould interface is not sensitive to the change in the cooling channel which is a distance to the cast-mould interface.Some limitations of numerical modelling and metallurgical analysis were also identified during this research and recommendations were made to improve the accuracy of local hot spot prediction in production of aluminium alloy wheels. More specifically, numerical modelling of the effect of grain refinement and use of non homogeneous material property (particularly fraction of solid) for rapidly chilled area. Fraction of eutectic rather than secondary dendrites arm spacing is a proper microstructure parameter that can be used to locate the hot spot.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automotive components</field><field name="subject">Alloy casting</field><field name="subject">Solidification shrinkage</field><field name="subject">Geometrical constraints</field><field name="subject">Hot spot prediction</field><field name="subject">Cooling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/95</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dwelling in architecture: design for a house for two strangers.</field><field name="creator">Hanlen, M A</field><field name="description">This exegesis seeks to explicate the current Masters project Dwelling in Architecture.

Mobile Internet, a fast-growing technology that combines the Internet with mobile devices, has recently become popular. It is predicted that the convergence between mobile networks and the Internet would become the next generation of network architecture, and mobile IPv6 is likely to emerge as the most efficient and cost-effective instrument to achieve "anywhere and anytime" fast Internet and resolve the problems of worldwide mobility management. This research project reviews mobile Internet competition and the market mix in New Zealand, both major players and minor players being involved. The researcher also investigates the requirements of the mobile Internet deployment model from two perspectives: the market and the consumers. Finally the connection between end user services (for example, mobile Internet) and convergence (for example, network convergence and technology convergence) are examined in the research study conducted.The researcher applies a multi-case study strategy to conduct the research project and interview is adopted as the major research technique in order to collect research data. Several organizations which deploy mobile Internet services in New Zealand are chosen as participants, with the aim of offering both personal insights and business views to the research questions and objectives.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile internet</field><field name="subject">Deployment models</field><field name="subject">Network convergence</field><field name="subject">Multi-case study</field><field name="subject">Wireless technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/97</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of game specific task constraints on the outcome of the water polo shot</field><field name="creator">Wende, Katrina van der</field><field name="description">Recent research has highlighted that information-movement couplings are unique to the constraints of the task, environment and performer. This recent research implies that skills should be developed in practice environments that are reflective of those found in competition. Representative environments should also allow the performer to attune to specifying information essential for success of a skill. However, in water polo, shooting practice is often conducted without the presence of a goalkeeper or defender. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of game-specific task constraints on the ball speed, accuracy and technique of the water polo shot. Ten male competitive level water polo players performed a total of forty shots comprising ten shots in each of four conditions from the 4m-penalty line. Conditions included all combinations of goalkeeper and defender (absent or present). Three Sony mini-digital cameras (50Hz) were placed perpendicular to the movement, giving rear, overhead and a right sagittal view. Ball speed was measured using a Radar-gun (Stalker Pro, USA). For each condition, means and standard deviations were determined for all outcome measures (shooting accuracy and ball speed) and technique variables. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the effect (p&lt;0.05) of the goalkeeper and defender individually as well as in combination on the dependent variables. Cohen's effect sizes were also used to determine the magnitude of the difference between conditions. The presence of a defender resulted in a significant increase in lateral trunk flexion at ball release, decreased the duration of the shot and selected swing sub-phases (i.e. pick-up to top of back swing time) and significantly altered the placement of the ball in the goal. When the goalkeeper only was present, this resulted in decreases in total shot time and pick-up to top of back swing time and significantly altered the placement of the ball in the goal. The presence of the defender and goalkeeper in combination brought about a moderate effect, decreasing the ball speed, significantly decreasing the success of the shots, scores achieved and significantly altering the placement of shots. Forward swing distance and selected swing sub-phases (i.e. total shot time, pick-up to top of back swing time, forward swing start to midway and forward swing start to release) were also significantly decreased in the presence of the defender and goalkeeper. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining appropriate task constraints during water polo shooting practice. In effect the removal of the defender and goalkeeper leads to the development of inappropriate information-movement couplings. Specifically, the presence of the defender and/or goalkeeper lead to reductions in the durations of selected swing sub phases, resulting in changes in the relative coordination and timing of the water polo shot. These findings indicate that in order to facilitate the development of this specific shooting skill, coaches should structure practice to replicate the perceptual information available during competition.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water polo</field><field name="subject">Sports - Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Sport Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/98</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing and implementing a user-centred intranet organisational culture, communication and knowledge management</field><field name="creator">Thorn, Warwick</field><field name="description">The research recorded in this thesis tells the story of developing and implementing a user-centred intranet in the organisation where I work in a senior management position. My management support of the process led to adopting a networked model in our organisation, and also to my embracing the role of communications management.The organisation in which I work has a high rate of change and an entrepreneurial culture which is sometimes chaotic. This challenging environment was a good testing ground for the project, which sought to explore a number of propositions affirming the value of user-centred intranets.Developing and implementing the intranet encouraged collaboration amongst staff members. The intranet became a new channel of communication, which usefully enhanced the staff's ability to share and find out what was going on, who did what and how to contact them. My interventions as a manager, which occurred in parallel with the technological development of the intranet, led to spin-off organisational improvements such as an improved collaborative reporting system, the restructuring of the organisation manual files, and the establishment of a collaboratively-focussed full monthly staff meeting. Developing and implementing a user-centred intranet was a dynamic way to effect change in the organisation and orient it towards a networked organisational model, one which is communication rich, both collaborative and participative.The project was driven by my belief that a user-centred emphasis in intranet design is necessary in today's knowledge-based global economy, where there is a high rate of change. The networked organisational model should be embraced as a flexible model catering for change by promoting organic and dynamic networking within an organisation. This environment is communication-rich and collaborative, and a user-centred intranet is a communication channel well suited to support this model.A user-centred intranet should not be seen merely as an organisational artefact, but also as the a process of developing and implementing it will open up an organisation's culture, communication, and knowledge management in a participatory way. However, the degree that this will be achieved depends on a number of factors. For instance, the leaders of an organisation need to embrace a networked organisational model, encouraging and resourcing communication management for a culture of participation and collaboration.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intranets (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into 5-lobe lung modelling</field><field name="creator">Vuong, Xuan Tung</field><field name="description">To understand how the input impedance of the respiratory system relates to pressure and volume airflow of the airway branched structure, this thesis focuses on developing a mathematical model of the branched airway including trachea and branching airways. The 5-Lobe lung model is developed mathematically and experimentally. A computer model is constructed in the MathlabTM programming environment. It accounts for the effects of airways with varying cross-sectional area, flexible wall properties, and the bronchial tree within the lung using the mathematical methods developed in previous researches. The terminal impedances are determined by proposed idealized lobe models. A range of frequencies up to 256 Hz are tested on this model. Cases of study on obstructions by varying lung stiffness from healthy to unhealthy conditions are investigated.Mathematical model is validated by experiment investigations on the mechanical lung simulator, which is built in Diagnostic &amp; Control Research Centre at Auckland University of Technology.

Two years later, this number has more than doubled to 13%.  Are the Priority Club guests contributing to leverage the hotel's profitability? This research is aimed at answering the question if the continuous increase in the number of Priority Club guests staying at the Crowne Plaza Auckland Hotel is an opportunity for the property to effectively optimise its revenue generation performance.  The study is essentially focused on assessing the ability of the loyalty programme to generate revenue to the hotel. The Priority Club Rewards is a demand-based, revenue-orientated marketing strategy which is predominantly aimed at 1) promoting and attracting its 30 million members worldwide to stay at the company's extensive portfolio of hotels as well as 2) to entice the club members to spend money on the hotels' services and facilities.  In return for their loyalty, these customers are entitled to receive benefits that correspond to their membership level. From a revenue management perspective, the programme exists to strategically help hoteliers not only to achieve higher occupancy levels through repeat visits from the club members but to also leverage the hotel's revenue generating performance through encouraging its members to not only stay in suites and club rooms but also to use the property's services and facilities more regularly.  In other words, the objective of the Priority Club Rewards is to help hoteliers attract customers to their properties and at the same time encourage them to spend money whilst onsite. It was found that the Priority Club programme is fulfilling its first core objective, which is to bring more customers to the Crowne Plaza Auckland property.  Hence, this research is predominantly focused on assessing the rewards programme's ability to also assist the Auckland hotel to increase profitability.  The objective of this project is to analyse whether or not the increasing growth in the number of club members staying at the property can also be interpreted as a growth in the hotel's revenue generation performance. Firstly, a thorough review of the literature was conducted in order to identify any previous academic work that specifically analysed the relationship between the areas of revenue management and loyalty marketing.  However, no extensive previous research was found that effectively analysed how these two fields interact with each other, particularly in the hotel industry.  Nevertheless, research from Internet articles and other web-based media resources was highly beneficial to the success of this research. There were two data collection processes employed in this research: a Priority Club Survey identified the needs and preferences of the club members when staying at the Auckland hotel and, secondly, a Spending Pattern Analysis was conducted based on the hotel guests' account statements.  The results from these two research methods were then carefully analysed and interpreted in order to achieve an accurate set of resourceful conclusions and recommendations.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Revenue management</field><field name="subject">Rewards programme</field><field name="subject">Business strategy and attraction</field><field name="subject">Hotel services</field><field name="subject">Loyalty programme</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology engineering: the brain gene ontology case study</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yufei</field><field name="description">The emergence of ontologies has marked another stage in the evolution of knowledge engineering. In the biomedical domain especially, a notable number of ontologies have been developed for knowledge acquisition, maintenance, sharing and reuse from large and distributed databases in order to reach the critical requirements of biomedical analysis and application. This research aims at the development of a Brain Gene Ontology by adopting a constructive IS methodology which tightly combines the processes of ontology learning, building, reuse and evaluation together. Brain Gene Ontology is a part of the BGO project that is being developed by KEDRI (Gottgtroy and Jain, 2005). The objective is to represent knowledge of the genes and proteins that are related to specific brain disorders like epilepsy and schizophrenia. The current stage focuses on the crucial neuronal parameters such as AMPA, GABA, CLC and SCN through their direct or indirect interactions with other genes and proteins. In this case, ontological representations were able to provide the conceptual framework and the knowledge itself to understand more about relationships among those genes and their links to brain disorders. It also provided a semantic repository of systematically ordered molecules concerned. The research adopts Prot&#233;g&#233;-Frames, which is an open source ontology tool suite for BGO development. Some Prot&#233;g&#233; plug-ins were also used to extend the applicable functions and improve knowledge representation. Basically, the research discusses the availability and the framework of the constructive Information System research methodology for ontology development, it also describes the process that bridges different notions of the brain, genes and proteins in various databases, and illustrates how to build and implement the ontology with Prot&#233;g&#233;-Frames and its plug-ins. The results of the BGO development proved that the constructive IS methodology does help to fill in the cognitive gap between domain users and ontology developers, the extensible, component-based architectures of Prot&#233;g&#233;-Frames significantly support the various activities in the ontology development process, and through explicitly specifying the meaning of fundamental concepts and their relations, ontology can actually integrate knowledge from multiple biological knowledge bases.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological data</field><field name="subject">Constructive approach</field><field name="subject">Knowledge modelling</field><field name="subject">Bioinformedical database</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modern women or tree-hugging hippies? A Foucauldian discourse analysis of the New Zealand media's representation of waterbirth.</field><field name="creator">Ashcroft, Shelley</field><field name="description">This study has identified the discourses surrounding water birth and analyses how these discourses are utilised by the media in New Zealand to represent water birth. The philosophical approach that underpins the study is that of philosopher Michel Foucault and his theory on discourse, power and the subject. His framework is used in a discourse analysis to reveal three main discourses: the scientific medical discourse, the natural birth discourse and the dive reflex discourse. Data used for this study consisted of 30 newspaper articles containing the word 'water birth' collected over a five-year period (2000-2005) from New Zealand's eight main broadsheet newspapers. Analysis was a two-part process: Foucauldian discourse analysis and a media discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1995b).Firstly, the discourse analysis showed the subject and the power positions each discourse offered women for positioning themselves in that discourse. The literature and texts revealed Foucault's theory on power relations and resultant subjectivity within institutions and how waterbirth within institutions is disciplined, surveilled, excluded and circulated. The second part of the analysis revealed how the media chooses to deploy the three identified discourses that represent waterbirth  in New Zealand. This textual analysis followed the framework of Fairclough's (1995b) media discourse analysis, showing media strategies that are used to promote the discourse deemed to be ideologically significant by the media outlet. Textual analysis identified that the scientific medical discourse contests waterbirth as an unsafe, unproven practice that puts babies' lives at risk. This discourse categorises women who choose waterbirth as unsafe, irrational, alternative, tree-hugging hippies who favour perceived benefits of waterbirth for themselves above the safety of their baby. The natural birth discourse contests that waterbirth is a safe practice that has encountered few problems since its emergence as a validated birthing practice in the late 1980s. It promotes waterbirth as having multiple benefits for both mother and baby and as a way of enhancing the physiological process of birth through non-intervention. The dive reflex discourse underpins the issue of babies drowning when born into water. This discourse details a reflex that suppresses the normal breathing mechanisms in neonates at birth. Literature debates its existence and troubles the overall trustworthiness of such a reflex to prevent a baby drowning when born into water. It is this discourse that sways people's views and positioning on the overall discourse of waterbirth.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Water birth</field><field name="subject">New Zealand media</field><field name="subject">Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Ideologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The future of history: cultural heritage tourism in Guangdong</field><field name="creator">Huang, Lu</field><field name="description">This thesis studies aspects of cultural heritage tourism in China. Relevant secondary tourism data in relation to tourist receipts and income generated from tourism activities are provided so as to present the different developmental state of the world and Chinese cultural heritage tourism. The thesis identifies that although many academic tourism researchers have discussed the cultural heritage issues, there is a gap that no English paper is available to identify the differences between current English and Chinese academic tourism studies in relation to cultural heritage issues. Cultural heritage issues studied by the current Chinese academic tourism researchers are limited to the World Heritage Sites inscribed by UNESCO, and local significant cultural heritage sites are left untouched. In this case, the English and Chinese literature in relation to cultural heritage, management and tourism product issues are reviewed and the gap that no English literature is available to discuss the different academic foci is filled. Secondly, a local cultural heritage site, Chen Ancestor's Temple, located in the southern part of China, is selected as the case study so as to challenge the current Chinese cultural heritage tourism study focus. A new direction which advocates the Chinese academic tourism researchers to turn their focus on local significant cultural heritage sites is established. To examine the current cultural heritage tourism in Chen Ancestor's Temple, two research methodologies are employed so as to gather first hand data. Quantitatively, a survey of tourist behaviors--before, during and after visitation of Chen Ancestor's Temple is conducted so as to supplement the statistics available and get to know more about Chen Ancestor's Temple current tourism development. Qualitatively, the in-depth interviews are conducted so as to investigate the issues of five stakeholder groups in relation to the development and management issues of Chen Ancestor's Temple. Themes are identified from the issues concerned by the five stakeholder groups and some recommendations are thus made.In all, this thesis compares the existing cultural heritage tourism literature in English and Chinese so as to advance the overall state of knowledge. The study of Chen Ancestor's Temple makes a further advance by establishing a new direction for Chinese academic tourism scholarship so as to focus towards locally significant cultural heritage sites.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural property</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Heritage tourism</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowing reality: psychotherapists' and counsellors' experiences and understandings of inexplicable phenomena while working with clients</field><field name="creator">Rosenberg, Linde</field><field name="description">This hermeneutic phenomenological study explores eight psychotherapists' and counsellors' experiences and understandings of 'inexplicable' phenomena that sometimes occur when working with clients.The purpose of the study is to stimulate thinking about these experiences and bring them into conversation within the psychoanalytic community.The findings emerging from this research reveal that inexplicable phenomena may occur when therapists and counsellors are in an 'open', meditative state in which the boundaries between self and the world seem lessened and time and space are experienced differently. The phenomena may take many forms, including the apparent knowing about events that are later reported by clients, which it would not have been possible to 'sense' in the usual way, and the seeing of semi-solid forms, which may be static or moving.The meanings made of the experiences vary according to different spiritual and theoretical worldviews but, invariably, the experiences are interpreted as receiving a communication from, or being attuned to, the unconscious mind or a spiritual intelligence or source of knowledge. This is discussed in relation to psychotherapeutic, phenomenological and spiritual literature.

Currently most waste is discarded, and this represents a potential loss of both resources and revenue, unless an alternative use for this waste could be developed. Waste types were first identified, then quantified, first seasonally, then annually, to provide an estimate of total industry-wide waste production. Possible uses for this waste were then identified. Little investigative research has been undertaken on identifying alternative uses for mussel industry organic waste. The uses of organic waste as organic fertilizers, and the economic benefit of adding treated waste products to cement mix to improve its compressive strength and thermal insulation, are two primary objectives of this dissertation. The possibility of using mussel shell in agricultural liming as a substitute is also explored. The potential value of pre-grade waste as an organic fertilizer was explored by addition of decomposed tissue to tomato seedlings and by monitoring plant development and condition. Growth of treatment and control seedlings was monitored by counting the number of branches, stem heights, leaf numbers and total biomass. Analyses prove Perna canaliculus pre-grade organic waste has the potential to be exploited as an expensive, effective organic fertilizer, whereas Mytilus galloprovincialis pre-grade organic waste may not. Moreover, there is further potential to develop P. canaliculus pre-grade organic waste into an odourless, chemically stable fertilizer product. The potential value of post-grade waste in cement mixes to improve compressive strength was explored by addition of shell aggregate to cement mix. Analyses indicate that, as an aggregate, mussel shell has little to no structural potential, but does have latent thermal insulating properties. Recommendations are made to: - Separate Perna and Mytilus pre-grade waste products. - Further explore the thermal insulating potential of mussel-shell concrete. - Further explore techniques for treatment of Perna pre-grade waste as a fertilizer. - Further explore the use of crushed mussel shell as a potential limestone or sand substitute for agricultural,                                 construction and engineering purposes. - Explore markets for Mytilus potential export, to reduce pre-grade waste production and problems of resettlement.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mussel fisheries</field><field name="subject">Environmental studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity in a sample of New Zealand professional employees</field><field name="creator">Badland, Hannah M</field><field name="description">Physical activity is now a key strategy for preventing or minimising numerous chronic diseases. Worksites are an ideal location to promote regular physical activity. For workers, a large portion of waking hours is spent at work where numerous opportunities exist to accumulate physical activity. Consequently, the aims of this thesis were to: 1) systematically review worksite physical activity literature, especially in the New Zealand context; 2) identify the contribution of worksite activity to total activity levels, and the correlates contributing to physical activity levels for professional occupations; and 3) objectively measure physical activity changes with point of decision prompt visibility in professional worksites. Accordingly the thesis incorporated one systematic review and two separate studies.Effect sizes calculated in an analysis of previous worksite physical activity health promotion studies show inconclusive evidence for increased employee retention and job satisfaction, and no evidence of reduced absenteeism or productivity increases. A major criticism of worksite research is that many unvalidated and unreliable designs are used, limiting study efficacy. Research initiatives need to identify the determinants of physical activity for different occupations, ethnicities, and gender in New Zealand worksites.Study 1 (N=56) consisted of participants wearing two pedometers over a three-day block, and subsequently completing a Three-Day Physical Activity Recall (3DPAR). A moderate, positive Spearman correlation (r=0.28) existed between the METs (3DPAR) and total pedometer values. Contributions of (mean + SD)worksite (14 283 +4761), non-work (12 516 +4 172), and total (26 798 +8 933) pedometer values were analysed. The sample was divided into tertiles according to total step counts. The high activity group (HAG) achieved more physical activity outside the workday (56%) when compared to the lowest activity group (LAG) (29%). Physical activity correlates were identified using binary logistic regression and simple correlation analyses. Relationships between physical activity and active transport, manual work, sport and exercise, and individual exercise were shown.Study 2 evaluated the National Heart Foundation (NHF) point of decision prompts for increasing physical activity levels in professional worksites. Forty-six participants (27 men and 19 women) wore two pedometers for three days, over four occasions to monitor changes in physical activity. The study was a crossover design with Worksite 1 receiving the treatment for three weeks, followed by a six-week wash out period, then a three-week control. Worksite 2 was given the control prior to the treatment period. Results indicate that the NHF point of decision prompts were ineffective at increasing objectively measured work and total physical activity levels, showing trivial positive (0.04) to moderate negative Cohen effect sizes (-0.79). When point of decision prompts were visible in the worksites overall mean step counts decreased. On the basis of these findings, the NHF's point of decision prompts had no effect, or were potentially detrimental to physical activity.Nevertheless, both studies were limited by some traditional worksite design problems, including low participation and sample contamination. However, by incorporating an objective measure of physical activity (pedometers) and a robust study design, these findings are the first objective measures of worksite physical activity, and the effects of point of decision prompts in a confined sample.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Physical fitness</field><field name="subject">Professional employees</field><field name="subject">Employee health promotion</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ethnography of children with dyspraxia participating in gymnastics</field><field name="creator">Hessell, Stephanie Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis describes three boys diagnosed with dyspraxia and their whanau (families and extended families) as they enter and become part of a community gymnastics group in a city in New Zealand. The study builds on literature that has defined dyspraxia in terms of dysfunction, but generally failed to resolve the disorder. Through the social perspective of health and well-being, participation of children and adults with disabilities has been explored in terms of the person and the environments in which they participate; however, the influence activity itself has on participation has not been thoroughly described. There has been a growing interest in the participation of children with disabilities in recreation and leisure activities and this study provides an in depth cultural perspective of such participation in New Zealand context. This study aims to answer the question "What do children with dyspraxia and their whanau do in a gymnastics group, and what does it mean to them to participate?". The overarching question is "What is the culture of a community gymnastics group in which children with dyspraxia participate?". Ethnographic methodology is employed to ensure that the participants' perspectives, including the beliefs, values and meaning that their participation holds is portrayed, while the associated activities and behaviours are also captured. As the boys with dyspraxia and their whanau entered the gym, they built on their previous experiences to make sense of what they needed to do and what meaning the environment held. I had not planned on the boys being integrated with an established group, but on the first night they spontaneously joined in with a noncompetitive, mixed age, boys group. The parents perceived the Club as professional, while the boys were initially intimidated. Fortunately, the equipment, which made the gym look like a playground, enticed the boys to participate. To shift the boys from their initial perception of the gym being a playground, the coaches used two styles of An Ethnography of Children with Dyspraxia Participating in Gymnastics coaching to support and encourage  their participation, while suppressing behaviour that did not fit with the norms of the Club. The boys needed to develop gymnastics skills and fit into the group to become gymnasts. The boys succeeded in fitting into the group by both developing skills and adapting their behaviour, while the type of boys without dyspraxia, the style of coaching afforded, the range of equipment and the activity of gymnastics itself meant that some of their initial difficulties were accommodated and they were seen as group members. The participants developed values and beliefs about what the boys participation in the group meant. Having fun and developing confidence and fitness were highlighted, while the social aspects (making friends and the whanau experiences) were also seen as important. The parents and coaches felt that the boys' experiences in gymnastics had an impact on them that would transfer to the world beyond the gym. This study contributes a qualitative perspective on the participation of children with disabilities in a sports occupation, with a focus on the cultural context of their participation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apraxia</field><field name="subject">Motor ability in children</field><field name="subject">Motor learning</field><field name="subject">Movement disorders in children</field><field name="subject">Gymnastics for children</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison between media representation of Asian international students and their own accounts of experience in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Qin, Xiaomei</field><field name="description">This research takes as its starting point the role of the media as a major influence on the way people understand and interpret events, focusing on media coverage of Asian international students in New Zealand. The thesis investigates the differences between media accounts of Asian international students and students' own perceptions of their experiences, using both quantitative and qualitative methods.This topic has become one of high community interest since 1999 when the New Zealand Government changed its education policy to encourage the expansion of the export education industry, leading to the number of international students increasing rapidly. Many of these students are teenagers and come from non-English-speaking Asian backgrounds to study in universities, colleges, high schools and private institutions in New Zealand. As well as the obvious effects on the New Zealand economy, the presence of these students has also influenced New Zealand culture. For example, many international students have homestay experiences with New Zealand families. This meeting of different cultural backgrounds introduces both sides to different value systems, lifestyles, beliefs and customs. This cultural diversity not only challenges international students to adapt themselves to New Zealand society, but also provides an opportunity for native New Zealanders to understand the incoming cultures. For Asian international students in particular, this process can be problematic and their behaviours have been closely scrutinised by the media.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Students, Foreign</field><field name="subject">Asian students</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of human activities on stream water quality: case studies in New Zealand and Germany</field><field name="creator">Doyle, Paul Norman</field><field name="description">Three case studies explore the effects of human activities on coastal streams and review measures to control the negative consequences of human activities. The first case study, an urban and a rural/forested stream in New Zealand, measured descriptors of water quality, including nutrients, dissolved oxygen and bacterial indicators of faecal contamination. The urban and rural catchments have stream-water qualities that fail to meet standards for fish life or bathing. Of the five sites studied, only one catchment, which had a substantial forest component (50%), had bacterial counts which meet the Australian Recreational Water-quality Guidelines for Secondary Contact (Faecal coliforms and enterococci, ANZECC, 2000) and the New Zealand Interim Guidelines for Freshwater Bathing (Escherichia coli, MofE, 2000). Only one site (which was downstream of a sediment-detention dam) had water clarity which met the Ministry of the Environment's (MofE, 1994) guideline for contact recreation.The results from this New Zealand case study indicate that the absence of riparian vegetation altered the temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen regime, that livestock increased levels of nitrate, turbidity and bacteria indicators of faecal contamination and that urban land use increased peak flows, peak-flow turbidity and bacterial indicators of faecal contamination and decreased base flows.The second case study, of a stream in the former Deutsche Demokratische Republik (East Germany), measured a similar suite of parameters and compared the German stream's 2001 water quality with records from 1991 (directly after the reunification of Germany). Measured levels of total nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and dissolved oxygen all showed significant improvements between 1991 and 2001. Stricter controls and regulations are thought to be the cause.The final case study reviews plans for an urban residential development in the catchment of the New Zealand rural/forested stream. Degraded sections of the stream could actually be improved if the development is sensibly managed. However, the sensitive nature of the receiving environment (a marine reserve) requires that measures be taken to avoid or mitigate any deleterious effects. Plans by the relevant authority, the North Shore City Council, are a major step forward from the unsustainable development of the neighbouring catchment. Still, more needs to be done. Ten recommendations have been made to ameliorate the potential negative impacts of the development.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rivers</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Pollution</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Travelling space: locating in-between</field><field name="creator">James, David</field><field name="description">This art project concerns itself with the notion of travelling space as a continuous state of experience perceived by a traveller, in contrast to something that has previously taken place.

It followed the discussion regarding the new direction for the broadcaster to follow a more public service role. The data gathering was conducted through to post Charter implementation and captured the uncertainty surrounding the shift in policy. Although the aim of the TVNZ Charter was to raise the standards of public service broadcasting the introduction of this new policy was marked by confusion as to how this would be achieved, funded and monitored.The TVNZ Charter was introduced with the prescription that TVNZ find a balance in achieving public service needs in television as well as maintaining the revenue from advertising. This was because the government was not willing to provide sufficient funding for a non-commercial service and hence the result was always to be a hybrid model. It was frequently emphasized that Charter programmes should rate well and there was strong stress on the importance of retaining and attracting audiences.The core changes leading to the introduction of the TVNZ Charter owe their origins to the major policy turning point of 1989/1990, when broadcasting was deregulated in New Zealand. The free market provided programmes with a focus on entertainment and the previous dictum that they should also educate and inform was no longer spelled out in the Broadcasting Act. As only one of the traditional principles of television was being satisfied, there was a measurable decline in programmed diversity and it is argued, quality. The freedom of deregulation allowed TVNZ to pursue the goal of earning as much advertising revenue as possible. Therefore, the TVNZ Charter was hailed as a significant change of direction to ensure that public service needs were met.Even though it can be argued that many positive changes have resulted since the TVNZ Charter was mooted, it is argued that the drive to reposition TVNZ as a public service broadcaster seems to have resulted in a very diluted form of public service broadcasting. A major shift in direction has been compromised by a fear that significant changes in programming would result in a dramatic loss of vital advertising revenue.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Television broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Public service broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Broadcasting policy</field><field name="subject">Government funding vs advertising</field><field name="subject">Local content</field><field name="subject">New Zealand broadcasting history</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice determinants of donors giving to charities</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Fraser</field><field name="description">The research applied multi-criteria decision-making analysis to donor decisions regarding the choice of a particular charity in order to identify which donor attitudes are significant in the giving decision.

This thesis is aimed at designing a dependable finite element analysis (FEA) model of the vocal folds for frequency and dynamic analysis and for calculating the impact stress between the vocal folds during glottal closure. A three-dimensional model with irregular geometry and a layered structure was designed. The measured viscoelastic properties of the vocal-fold mucosa and the transverse isotropic elastic properties of the vocal fold muscle are applied to the model. The boundary conditions are assumed to be fixed on lateral, anterior and posterior surfaces based on anatomical structure analysis. This model is symmetrical about the right and left vocal folds.The frequency and dynamic characters are presented using the software ABAQUS. The FEA model is validated by both experimental modal analysis (EMA) model results and in-vivo experimental results from the literature.In the vibration analysis, the eigenfrequency and eigenmode of the FEA model are determined. The model results compare well with the experiments performed on a silicone vocal fold model. The eigenmodes show the vibration direction at different excitation frequencies. In the closure process, the closure and collision dynamic results are obtained. The results show that: (1) the closure process is independent of the subglottal pressure; (2) the glottal opening amplitude and closing velocity vary approximately linear with the subglottal pressure; (3) the maximum impact stress occurs on the mid area of the inferior surfaces; (4) the impact stress is approximately linear with the subglottal pressure; and (5) the impact stress will cause vocal fold tissue damage when the subglottal pressure is over 800 Pa.It is anticipated that the model will help to identify voice disorders such as vocal-fold paralysis and vocal-fold nodules.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Voice</field><field name="subject">Larynx</field><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Take away stories</field><field name="creator">Burgetsmaier, Patricia</field><field name="description">This project questions and examines the impact of 'take away' culture on our society's lifestyle.

However, few studies exist which have investigated the effects of acute short-term Cr supplementation on appropriately simulated soccer-specific performance.Aims.  To determine the reproducibility of a 90 minute soccer-specific performance test and to subsequently examine the effects of acute short-term Cr ingestion (1 week) on soccer-specific physical performance. Study design.  Two experimental designs were adopted for this thesis.  For study one, a test-retest design was used to determine the reliability and validity of the Ball-sport Endurance And Sprint Test (BEAST).  Two trials of the BEAST were performed, separated by five to seven days.  For study two, a randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design was adopted to determine the efficacy of acute short-term Cr supplementation (seven days) on soccer-specific performance, using the BEAST protocol.Methods.  Twenty male amateur soccer players volunteered to participate in the study.  For study one, the test-retest reliability of several soccer-specific performance measures obtained during a modified version of the BEAST was quantified using the standard error of measurement (Van Cutsem, Duchateau, &amp; Hainaut) (or typical error) (Hopkins, 2000), coefficient of variation (CV), and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC).  For study two, the cohort was split and subjects randomly allocated to one of two groups (Cr supplementation and Placebo) on a matched-pair basis.  The Cr group (mean age 25.4 &#177; 4.5 years, mean body-mass 79.3 &#177; 10.5 kg) ingested 20 g of Cr and 8 g of glucose powder per day for seven days, whereas the placebo (mean age 26.7 &#177; 4.6 years, mean body-mass 80.8 &#177; 8.6 kg) group ingested 20 g of corn-flour and 8 g of glucose per day for seven days.  The effects of acute short-term Cr supplementation were analysed by repeated measures ANOVA.  In addition, effect sizes (ES) were calculated and entered with the associated p-value into Hopkins' spreadsheet for determination of the ES confidence limits (95%) and the chances that the true effect was substantial (i.e. ES &#8805; 0.2).  Clinical/practical inferences were made accordingly.Results.  Study 1: The BEAST protocol had good reliability (high ICC values, relatively low coefficients of variation, low noise to signal ratios) and face validity (HR, VO2, distances covered, duration, and movements performed in the BEAST were all similar to those reported in actual soccer matches).  Study 2: Performance of the four major physical measures (12 m sprint, 20 m sprint, circuit time and vertical jump) during the BEAST deteriorated during the second half relative to the first half for both Cr and placebo groups, indicating a fatigue effect associated with the protocol.  HR and body-mass values also decreased for both groups during the 90 minute protocol.  However, there was no statistically significant differences between the groups for these four measures  or for body-mass, HR or VO2max values, suggesting Cr had no substantial effect (relative to placebo) on improving physical performance (or reducing fatigue).  When the effects were assessed for the whole 90 minute BEAST protocol, all effects showed a negative trend and, correspondingly, the chances of a detrimental effect were greater than the chances of a beneficial effect.Conclusions:  The 90 minute BEAST protocol had good reliability and face validity making it a suitable soccer simulation and performance protocol with which to investigate the effects of Cr supplementation on soccer performance. However, no significant (statistical or clinical) effects of acute short-term Cr supplementation on soccer performance were observed suggesting its potential use as an ergogenic aid for soccer players is questionable.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creatine</field><field name="subject">Soccer</field><field name="subject">Supplements</field><field name="subject">Acute</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Simulated</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Muscle power after stroke</field><field name="creator">Stavric, Verna A</field><field name="description">Stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide.  It often leads to mobility limitations resulting from deficits in muscle performance.  While reduced muscle strength and rate of force production have been reported, little is known about the power generating capability of people after stroke and its relationship to mobility.  Research in other populations has found that measures of muscle power may have a greater association with activity performance than do measures of muscle force alone.  Consequently, in an attempt to optimise power, investigators have focused on identifying ideal parameters within which to train for power.  One such parameter is the identification of the loading level at which maximal power is generated.  Literature reporting optimal loads from both young athletic and healthy older populations has yielded mixed results, making the applicability to a hemiparetic population difficult.  The purpose of this study was to investigate muscle power performance at differing loads and to determine at what load muscle power is best elicited in hemiparetic and age and gender matched control groups.  A secondary aim was to ascertain whether there is a relationship between the muscle power values obtained and activities such as gait, stair climbing and standing from a chair.  Twenty nine hemiparetic volunteers and twenty nine age and gender matched controls were evaluated.  Involved and uninvolved legs of the stroke group and a comparison leg of the control group underwent testing.  Leg press muscle power was measured using a modified supine leg press machine at 30%, 50% and 70% of a one-repetition maximum (1-RM) load.  Participants were positioned on the leg press machine and asked to push, with a single leg, as hard and as fast as they could.  Data was collected via a mounted force platform and a linear transducer connected to a platform on which the participants lay.  From these, power was able to be calculated.  The activities were timed while being performed as fast as possible.  The results showed that peak muscle power values differed significantly between the involved, uninvolved and control legs.  Peak leg power in all three leg groups was greatest when pushing against a load of 30% of 1-RM.  Involved leg peak power tested at 30% of 1-RM (Mean:240; SD:145 W) was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than the uninvolved leg (Mean:506; SD:243 W).  Both the involved and uninvolved legs generated significantly lower peak power (p&lt;0.05) than the control leg (Mean:757; SD:292 W).  Correlations were found between the involved leg peak power and gait speed and involved leg peak power and stair climbing (r=0.6-0.7, p&lt;0.05).  No correlation was found between paretic leg peak power and chair stands. The control group leg peak power demonstrated significant associations with the performance of all three activities.In summary, there were significant differences between the involved and the uninvolved leg in power production after stroke.  As well, there are significant differences between the uninvolved leg and the leg of those not affected by stroke.  Power was related to a number of activities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Older adult</field><field name="subject">Muscle power</field><field name="subject">Activity performance</field><field name="subject">Muscle strength</field><field name="subject">Cross-sectional design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What's it like being us : stories of young New Zealanders who experience difficulty learning</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Sheryn A</field><field name="description">This narrative inquiry examines the stories told by eight young New Zealanders who have experienced specific difficulties with learning. At the time of being interviewed, they were aged from 9-14 years and participating in regular school classes. For the purposes of the study, being a student was identified as a key occupational role and failing to achieve tasks associated with this role was viewed as failure to achieve role competency. The issue of learning difficulties has been extensively researched but rarely from the perspective of young people. A primary goal of the study was to obtain young people's perceptions of the experience of learning difficulties. This is consistent with international moves to obtain the views of young people through research. Narrative interviewing procedures were used and participants were invited to talk about the things they enjoyed doing and felt they are good at doing, as well as the things they had trouble doing. They proved to be capable informants and provided a rich range of narrative data. Interviews were audio taped, transcribed and interview transcripts were synthesised into a story format. Each participant had the opportunity to check their story and give their final consent to its use as data in this thesis. As part of the analytical process, core narratives were constructed to capture the essence of each participant's story, their unique narrative voice, relationship with others and fundamental message. These narratives are presented in full, introducing participants as characters in their own story and revealing the nature of the stories told. In addition, thematic narratives drawn from the stories have been collated into three key categories, which relate to self and learning efforts, relationship with the social world and being occupational. The narrative analysis found that learning difficulties occurred as a negative interruption in the progressive course of participants' story, with the potential to compromise their sense of identity and well-being. However, the study also found that when participants chose to characterise themselves in relation to occupations or roles in which they felt most successful, they were able to express a more positive and holistic identity than that of being "learning disabled". Furthermore, in the context of an occupational narrative that included their talents and abilities, learning difficulties were not necessarily the determining factor in how life was for them or where their lives might go. The implication of the study's findings relate to the importance for young people of not only experiencing competency in significant occupations and roles, but also being seen to be competent. This underpins a positive sense of identity and well-being, which is likely to link to their future. They need to understand for themselves and for those around them to understand, that it is possible to be intelligent yet have trouble with basic numeracy and literacy skills. Empathetic adults have a vital role to play in providing the information, opportunities and supportive context in which young people develop an understanding of their occupational competencies and become competent human beings. There is a place for further narrative research with young New Zealanders; there are many stories from other perspectives yet to be told. Ongoing research conducted through an occupational lens is needed to understand the way in which young people with learning difficulties develop, or fail to develop, an understanding of themselves as competent occupational beings and how this supports or constrains their transition through adolescence into adulthood.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children's experiences of learning difficulties</field><field name="subject">Specific learning difficulties</field><field name="subject">Occupational identity</field><field name="subject">Narrative research</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological response to sport-specific aerobic interval training in high school male basketball players</field><field name="creator">Stone, Nick</field><field name="description">It has been shown that a high level of aerobic fitness is important for athletes participating in intermittent (team) sports. The majority of studies investigating the effects of traditional and sport-specific aerobic interval exercise on physiological measures and performance have involved field-based team sports. In some instances the effectiveness of sport-specific aerobic training has been questioned. To date, no study has investigated the influence of a sport-specific training approach in the sport of basketball. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a basketball specific endurance circuit on improving measures of aerobic fitness. Methods: Ten male high school basketball players, age 16.4 &#177; 1.2 years, ranked by fitness level and randomly assigned to a training group (N = 6) or control group (N = 4) participated in the study. The sport-specific aerobic endurance training replaced the fitness component of regular training and was performed during the competitive season. The sport-specific training consisted of interval training using a basketball specific endurance circuit, four times 4 min at 90-95% HRpeak with a 3 min recovery at 60-70% HRpeak, twice per week for 6 weeks. During this time the control group performed regular basketball training. Results: For both the training and control groups the actual mean training intensity for total training duration were 77.4 &#177; 2.9% HRpeak and 74.1 &#177; 6.7% HRpeak, respectively. The actual mean training intensity during the work intervals in the training group was 84.1 &#177; 2.3% HRpeak. There were no clear differences between effects of the two training approaches for measures of maximal oxygen uptake (3.3%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 19.3%), running economy (-3.3%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 14.2%), repeated sprint ability (0.6%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 5.7%) and anaerobic power maintenance during the repeated sprints (-13.7%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 49.0%). However, a clear non-trivial effect on sub-maximal heart rate was observed (-7.3%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 2.0%) suggesting a beneficial training effect after training. Some evidence for attenuation of speed (-1.8 to -2.8%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 3.4 to 5.7%) and power (-1.7%; 90% confidence limits, &#177; 17.1%) was apparent. Conclusion: Although clear changes in sub-maximal HR responses were observed in the training group, the data in the present study suggests that a basketball specific endurance circuit has little effect on other laboratory and field-based measures of aerobic fitness. In fact, the basketball specific endurance circuit may lead to reduced improvements in jumping and sprinting performances.  Further research is required to clarify the effect of aerobic training approaches on basketball-specific fitness and performance.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aerobic</field><field name="subject">interval training</field><field name="subject">sport-specific</field><field name="subject">running economy</field><field name="subject">repeated sprint ability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the thesis/dissertation writing experiences of Mandarin-speaking Masters students in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chang, Evelyn Chiungying</field><field name="description">This study explores the perceptions of Mandarin-speaking Masters students involved in the thesis/dissertation writing process. As Mandarin-speaking students form a sizeable part of the EAL [English as Additional Language] postgraduate cohort in New Zealand, it is important to explore their experiences. The aim of the proposed study is to provide an opportunity for these learners to express issues that are pertinent to them in this area. The study recruited 37 Masters Students from five universities to participate in the survey; 6 of these participants volunteered to be interviewed. Two aspects of the participants' perceptions were examined: the acquisition of academic literacy in English and the role of the supervisor in relation to their thesis writing. Findings indicated that students had underestimated how difficult it would be to study at this level in a foreign language and in a new sociocultural environment. They also indicated that the language assistance provided by supervisors was perceived to be very helpful and that mutual understanding and personal interaction between supervisors and students is crucial for successful supervision. However, better structured academic and pastoral support is required from the host universities. In addition, participants placed great emphasis on their personal growth and learning. The significance of the study lies in its cross-cultural accounts of the underlying complexities involved in EAL thesis writing. Findings underline the need for New Zealand universities to recognise the importance of cross-cultural awareness and its role in fostering campuses that are interculturally friendly.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban voodoo: an ambiguity document, seeking to record the disruption of language through imitation</field><field name="creator">Paraone, Israe</field><field name="description">Urban Voodoo mimics semiotic phenomena, which constitute language and functions as a system of signs that intra-act ambiguously within their own system.  This project explores the link between the ambiguous signs of the worm, what looks like a mimesis of icons/symbols, and the way in which simulations are caught up in semiotic implications.  Urban Voodoo, which followed on from my earlier Project Iroiro, developed language precursors from the study of the marks of the worm, creating different patterns and styles, and generating language-like effects. Using this system of signs, my project explores the idea that humans are part of a system operated by language, and examines the notion that language itself may be disrupted. To explore this, my project is about layers of competing imprints, about 'languages' tagged into spaces occupied by several graffiti artists within a local skate park.  Urban Voodoo acts as a new Graffiti system. In mimicry, organisms make themselves resemble others or their environment. Icons 'look like' what they represent; simulation proposes 'to be' what it suggests. These concepts of assimilation and representation will be explored to understand and interrogate the power balance of language systems, starting with a specific local situation, the skate park.

Through works of art this project explores possibilities for the visual signification of this information. My interest is in exploring ways in which these qualities can be recovered by creating representational codes of the unseen, which evoke a potential for an inclusive language. My enquiry focuses on sound with particular emphasis on 'voice' as a way in which to explore these concepts through visual means. Voice is considered as something which projects or articulates or otherwise could be described as 'speaking'. For example voice is considered in relation to thought, and also the human experience of sound in space. This includes sound generated by self, intrinsic and extrinsic to the body. Voice plays two roles - one as a space from which to retrieve the unseen, and the other as a drawing tool - a way in which to represent what seems unrepresentable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language</field><field name="subject">Voice</field><field name="subject">Sound</field><field name="subject">Visual</field><field name="subject">Human</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's destination image and the Chinese outbound market : a comparative study between the Beijing (north) and Guangdong (south) markets</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Chengcheng</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the similarities and differences between northern and southern Chinese markets (in this case, the Beijing and Guangdong markets) in relation to New Zealand's destination image, from both visitors' and tour guides' perspectives. Destination image issues focused on information source and cultural factors, as well as their interrelationships. The purpose of this research is to achieve a better understanding of the Chinese outbound market as well as the heterogeneous market characteristics in order to provide insight for the New Zealand tourism industry. This research involves both interviews with visitors and tour guides based on a grounded theory methodology. Analysis of the interviews was based on two research themes: factors influence New Zealand's destination image at different stages, as well as the Chinese regional market difference in relation to destination image. Interviews were also focused on two stages of destination image formation: pre-visit images and in-destination images. Difference between Beijing and Guangdong markets on the research themes during the different stages were explored and analyzed. Research findings showed that destination image is influenced by both the information source and the cultural factors for Chinese tourists. Moreover, regional difference existed in China in particular their perceptions about New Zealand, preferences and personal values. Most tourists consider pre-visit image is essential; however, New Zealand's image in China was not very impressive and effective. Before visitation, New Zealand's destination image is influenced heavily by information available in China. The way tourists search for information and the image they were attracted for coming to New Zealand between Beijing and Guangdong were different. During-visit impressions of New Zealand were considered by majority of the tourists to be better than their expectations. However, due to their different cultural backgrounds, Beijing and Guangdong tourists have different reactions to New Zealand's products, which can be reflected through different shopping behaviours, and different demands and satisfaction levels. Overall, segmenting the Chinese outbound market into regions is recommended for future marketing, in order to attract more visitors by providing more suitable products.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism - New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Tourism - China.</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of teacher bilingualism</field><field name="creator">Martin, Derek</field><field name="description">This study introduces themes and trends apparent from notable research and literature regarding the value and usefulness of bilingual teaching methods in the ESOL classroom, and the perceptions of ESOL managers and teachers regarding these, both from an international and a New Zealand perspective. From this, a shortage of awareness and research in the New Zealand context was identified, which created an opportunity for further research. The study aimed specifically to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of Auckland based ESOL-school professionals regarding the value of teacher bilingualism and the use of other languages in the ESOL classroom. The basic method employed was a survey involving the distribution of questionnaires to 60 Auckland language school teachers and 20 Auckland language school managers, and included both qualitative and quantitative type questions. The study probed the foreign language skills and overseas work experience of the managers and teachers, and investigated whether these factors had influenced their perceptions regarding the value of teacher bilingualism and the use of other languages as an ESOL teaching tool. The study identifies the perceptions of Auckland ESOL professionals regarding these issues and analyses further differentiating factors likely to have influenced these perceptions. It identifies differences of opinion between managers and teachers and investigates reasons for these. The study analyses the linguistic composition of the Auckland language school clientele and considers implications for the industry resulting from the identified perceptions of ESOL professionals. Finally, the study offers suggestions for further future research, in the interest of improvement and enhancement of the industry.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bilingualism</field><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Communication in education</field><field name="subject">Foreign languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'culture of practice' of Ministry of Education Special Education occupational therapists and physiotherapists</field><field name="creator">Simmons Carlsson, Carolyn</field><field name="description">Occupational therapists and physiotherapists have increasingly moved into mainstream school-based practice in Aotearoa/NZ over the last ten years, however little is known about what underpins their practice worldview in today&#8217;s climate of inclusive education. This ethnography addressed the question: what is the culture of practice of occupational therapists and physiotherapists in the Ministry of Education, Special Education? In search of participants&#8217; emic perspectives of their culture, the ethnographic lens was used to inform the design of this study, which is situated theoretically within interpretive constructionism. Thirteen experienced Ministry of Education, Special Education occupational therapists and physiotherapists participated in this study. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviewing was used with eight therapists and a second email interview format was used with a further five therapists. Data were supplemented by complete-member-researcher observations in the field, as well as journal notes and written archival material from the organisation. Data analysis followed an ethnographic evaluative framework (Katz, 2001, 2002) and a cultural constructs framework, drawn from literature pertaining to ethnography and culture. The findings in this study reveal that the culture of practice of Ministry of Education, Special Education therapists is emergent. This culture is strongly embedded in organisational culture as well as the Aotearoa/NZ Government&#8217;s mission towards building an inclusive society. Findings from this study also reveal that contrary to the expectation that therapists may step into the organisation and be .fit to practice. in the education sector, this is indeed not the case. Therapists must be enculturated and supported in order to develop their understandings of the education system and what this demands of their school-based practices. Even given the support of therapy-specific induction, supervision and mentoring, the transition into the education model is huge. Because this, findings strongly point to the need for the organisation to support therapists&#8217; enculturation by offering formal, therapy-specific induction programmes. For the group in this study, theirs is a culture of inclusion, collaboration, consultation, teaming and inclusive practice. Furthermore, it is a culture that values students being students, with passionate aspirations towards fostering and enabling student learning and participation in schooling. To effect such change related to notions of inclusive education, the higher order task of the culture and, therefore the group&#8217;s practice, is one of brokering inclusion as agents for societal change. Within this, there is recognition that new entrant Ministry of Education, Special Education (MoE-SE) therapists must shift their traditional practice understandings and ways of being when working in the education sector to unshackle biomedical model perspectives. They must shift their worldview of school-based therapy.  Through this study, occupational therapists and physiotherapists are offered an exemplar of what this shift might look like. It also provides a practice exemplar of what it is like to practice in a different paradigm and of environmental practice. Lastly, the findings from this study challenge the occupational therapy and physiotherapy professions, practitioners and lecturers alike, to shift beyond entrenched biomedical perspectives and to take up the staff of occupational practice. Moreover, they challenge the professions to be true to the pursuit of activity and participation outcomes for the clients, whom they all serve. This study therefore provides a tool to help ease transition. It also provides a clear way to articulate the extent of the shift from biomedical model to occupational practice in school-based practice. Further research is required related to capturing the students&#8217; voice in relation to Ministry of Education, Special Education therapy services and how they experience the culture. The range of potential studies remains great, given the paucity of local research related to school-based therapy practice and inclusive education. Studies into teachers&#8217; and parents&#8217;  experiences are warranted, as are studies which explore the experiences of M&#257;ori therapists and M&#257;ori clients. It may be interesting to compare therapists. Cultures across practice contexts, such as the special schools, and between health and education sectors. It may be helpful to look at whether therapists do find it useful to have MoE-SE practice explained in cultural terms. An outcomes-based study would help provide practice-based evidence for what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Other studies might address issues such as: when inclusion is achieved, what does it achieve educationally and socially or is harm done when therapy services shift away from dealing with impairment and what is the long-term personal outcome to the student when this occurs. Lastly, a study that addressed whether embracing the culture of practice actually makes a difference in the long term for students would be valuable.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computerised detection and classification of five cardiac conditions</field><field name="creator">Gao, George Qi</field><field name="description">An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a bioelectrical signal which records the heart's electrical activity versus time. It is an important diagnostic tool for assessing heart functions. The interpretation of ECG signal is an application of pattern recognition. The techniques used in this pattern recognition comprise: signal pre-processing, QRS detection, feature extraction and neural network for signal classification. In this project, signal processing and neural network toolbox will be used in Matlab environment. The processed signal source came from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database which was developed for research in cardiac electro-physiology.Five conditions of ECG waveform were selected from MIT-BIH database in this research. The ECG samples were processed and normalised to produce a set of features that can be used in different structures of neural network and subsequent recognition rates were recorded. Backpropagation algorithm will be considered for different structures of neural network and the performance in each case will be measured. This research is focused on finding the best neural network structure for ECG signal classification and a number of signal pre-processing and QRS detection algorithms were also tested. The feature extraction is based on an existing algorithm.The results of recognition rates are compared to find a better structure for ECG classification. Different ECG feature inputs were used in the experiments to compare and find a desirable features input for ECG classification. Among different structures, it was found that a three layer network structure with 25 inputs, 5 neurons in the output layer and 5 neurons in its hidden layers possessed the best performance with highest recognition rate of 91.8% for five cardiac conditions. The average accuracy rate for this kind of structure with different structures was 84.93%. It was also tested that 25 feature input is suitable for training and testing in ECG classification. Based on this result, the method of using important ECG features plus a suitable number of compressed ECG signals can dramatically decrease the complexity of the neural network structure, which can increase the testing speed and the accuracy rate of the network verification. It also gives further suggestions to plan the experiments for the future work.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrocardiography</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of how product involvement affects brand loyalty</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Nigel</field><field name="description">David Aaker (1992) suggests that brand loyalty leads to brand equity, which leads to business profitability. Brand loyalty makes a critically valuable contribution to competitive advantage. Marketing costs render it expensive to introduce new customers and loyal customers are less likely to switch brands. High brand loyalty is an asset that lends itself to extension, high market share, high return on investment and ultimately high brand equity (Gounaris &amp; Stathakopoulos, 2004). Understanding the drivers for brand loyalty is the first step to understanding how to influence them and thus increase profitability. The wider body of literature (Iwasaki &amp; Havitz, 1998; LeClerc &amp; Little, 1997; Park 1996) suggests that product involvement, particularly high product involvement is a critical antecedent to brand loyalty. Traylor (1983) and Martin (2004) argue that low involvement products are also significant. Quester and Lim (2003) published a paper that empirically tested the relationship between product involvement and brand loyalty. They hypothesized that high involvement would lead to high brand loyalty and vice versa but their research showed that low involvement products could have high brand loyalty too. Further analysis of the literature shows support for product involvement as an antecedent to brand loyalty but still the nature and scope of this relationship remains uncertain. Therefore this research sets out to replicate and extend Quester and Lim's study. To extend the body of literature this research selected cars and batteries from Mittal's (1989a) predetermined list of product categories to represent high and low involvement products. The research then sourced Kapferer and Laurent's (1985b) seminal Consumer Involvement Profile as a basis for the product involvement scale for the survey. The CIP scale breaks product involvement down to five antecedents; interest, pleasure, sign, risk probability and risk importance. Similarly, Dick and Basu's (1994) work formed the basis of the scales as they related to brand loyalty. Dick and Basu suggest that brand loyalty consists of both behavioural and attitudinal components, which in turn consist of cognitive, affective and co native antecedents. These variables formed the basis of the survey used for empirical testing. Data was collected and analysed using factor and multiple regression analysis. Data analysis returned five factors for product involvement for cars and four for product involvement for batteries where Quester and Lim (2003) only returned four factors for both categories. This research also returned all three factors for cars and two for batteries, suggesting that the subjects of this research were able to discern the subtleties of the antecedents to brand loyalty where Quester and Lim's were not. Finally, the research tested these factors for regression correlations to identify links between pleasure, sign and risk probability and brand loyalty for cars and interest/pleasure, sign, risk probability and risk importance for batteries. The analysis shows that these findings explained more than 53% of the variances for batteries and more than 71% of the variances for cars suggesting that product involvement makes a significant contribution to brand loyalty. While these findings lend support for product involvement as an antecedent to brand loyalty, sign value is the only construct that shows a consistent correlation. Thus there is still an opportunity for more academic research. For marketers the message is clear, sign value or ego involvement shows a clear correlation with brand loyalty. Any attempt to grow brand loyalty must at least acknowledge this issue.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Euthanasia: a Foucauldian analysis</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Tracey</field><field name="description">The topic of this study, euthanasia, has become a modern-day issue that challenges some of societies traditionally held beliefs towards death and dying. This study drew upon the theoretical insights of Michel Foucault to provide a discursive analysis of the term euthanasia, and the issues surrounding the "right-to-die". It involved an analysis of primary texts from; nursing, general, and legal literature as well as the media between the years 2002-2004. Drawing upon data researched, the study analyses the main discourses regarding the practice of euthanasia for terminally ill individuals. The two competing discourses that emerged were what I have termed the sanctity-of life-discourse and the right-to-die discourse. The aim of the study was to uncover the discourses understanding of "truth" regarding the right-to-die. The analysis revealed that a small percentage of cancer sufferers (5%) die with their pain insufficiently treated and the right-to-die discourse claims that no individual should have to suffer needlessly, asserting the individuals right to autonomy. Directly opposing this is the sanctity-of life-discourse which states all life is sacred and nothing can justify euthanasia as an acceptable practice in society. My findings indicate the need for effective palliative care and pain management when caring for the terminally ill individual. The legal, ethical and moral implications of euthanasia are many and this study discusses the effects these may have on health professionals involved with the care of terminally ill patients. The study revealed an increasing deployment of the right-to-die discourse in the media and revealed concerns regarding the nursing professions lack of preparation to deal with euthanasia if it becomes a legal option in end of life care.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Euthanasia</field><field name="subject">Moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">Terminally ill</field><field name="subject">Pain</field><field name="subject">Right to die</field><field name="subject">Life and death, power over</field><field name="subject">Palliative treatment</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Masqueulinities</field><field name="creator">Woods, Christopher Huia</field><field name="description">The research is specifically concerned with the notion of the military masque as a projected extension of the history of masqueing behaviour evident in gay men's attire.The creative outcome of the project is a collection of five interchangeable masques, an animated poetic work and a series of photographic images.This exegesis therefore, seeks to contextualise the created artifacts. In doing this it posits a historical and critical framework that considers the hyper-masculine1 and its relationship to gay men's masqueing.21 In this exegesis hyper masculinity is taken to mean an exaggeration of stereotypical male beliefs and behaviors through an emphasis on virility, strength and aggression and dress codification.2 Frye (1957), in his Anatomy of criticism offers a useful definition of masque as I frame it in this thesis. The term may be understood as "a species of drama in which spectacle plays an important role and in which the characters tend to be, or become aspects of human personality, rather than independent characters" (pp. 365-7).

The research was initiated from the experience of nursing children in the context of a rehabilitation centre and wondering how acute care nurses promoted a child's recovery after a severe unintentional injury.Many avenues were used to search international and New Zealand literature but the scarcity of literature related to what acute care paediatric nurses do was evident. Therefore this research has the potential of informing the speciality practice of acute care pediatric nursing.Nursing children in the acute care ward after a severe accident is complex. It encompasses nursing the family when they are experiencing a crisis. It is critical that the acute care nurse monitors and ensures the child's physiological needs are met, and the nurse "works with" the child to maintain and advance medical stability. Nursing interactions are an important part of "working with", communication is the essence of nursing. This research has focussed on the nurses' social processes whilst caring for the physical needs of the child and interacting with the family and multidisciplinary team when appropriate.An effective working-relationship with a nurse and family is founded on trust. Trust is an accepted part of our day-to-day lives and how to develop a trusting working-relationship with the child and family has not been explored prior to this research. Grounded theory methods supported the process of exploring the social processes of "building trust" whilst "working with" families in a vulnerable position. Nurses rely on rapport to be invited into a family's space to "work with" and support the re-establishment of the parenting role. The "stepping in and out" of an effective working-relationship with a family is reliant on trust. Nurses build trust by spending time to "be with", using chat to get to know each other, involving and supporting the family to parent a "different" child and reassuring and giving realistic hope to help the child and parents cope with their changed future.A substantive theory of the concept of "building trust to work with" has been developed using grounded theory methods. The theory has been conceptualized using the perspective of seven registered nurses working in paediatric acute care wards that admit children who have had a severe traumatic accident.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pediatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Pediatric intensive care</field><field name="subject">Trust</field><field name="subject">Acute Disease - nursing</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping the self-portrait: navigating identity and autobiography in visual art</field><field name="creator">Joe, Damen</field><field name="description">The thesis Mapping the Self-Portrait: Navigating Identity and Autobiography in Visual Art is a practical project.

The focus is on issues related to representation of that world to self through image-based narrative. Central to the creation of these worlds is imagery published in various public access media such as television, the internet, print publishing. Although filtered and interpreted personally, because of their ubiquity and familiarity, these images collectively constitute representation of our culture. Our construction of the world (the way we represent it to ourselves) is contingent on our encounter with such images.Sited within the milieu of a media-fixated age, the project aims to deal with our desire to make sense of the litter of images that people our visual horizon. The project seeks to employ these images as objects of direct experience and to consider the subjective frameworks and cultural narratives through which they are filtered.The work will play on the desire to make relational sense of images, often by invoking narrative.

In other words, the supplier decides which customer is worth treating as a key customer, without involving the customer in this decision, or vice versa. As a result, even resource-consuming key account customers might move to competitors if they do not value the relationship in the same way as the supplier and see an opportunity to save costs by switching sources. This study develops a better understanding of value in B2B relationships. It investigates the segmentation methods currently used in relationship management and develops a new approach that brings the value perspectives from buyer and seller together. The major contribution of the research, however, is to test the proposition that congruency of the value expectations of buyer and seller will optimize the relationship strength.In the literature there seem two general approaches, the hard and the soft. This research combines these measures to form a single, cohesive measurement of congruency of relationship value, from the perspective of both partners in the relationship. There is a lacuna in the burgeoning literature on relationship management, where trust is often inadequately represented in the research, and where reciprocity of value between relationship partners is often omitted. This research addresses this critical, yet under-researched, issue.

Research is a central element of any strategy to ensure that the inequalities of today will not be experienced by Maori children of the future. Kaupapa Maori research has been at the forefront of the indigenous challenge to Western research practices which continue to frame Maori as the 'other' and victim blame by measuring differences to non-Maori and then attribute identified negative differences to Maori deficit. A kaupapa Maori framework validates Maori realities and enables the development of research processes that are based on a Maori worldview and endorse Maori values and beliefs. Proponents of distinctly Maori research methodologies have questioned the appropriateness of ethical review processes that are based on Western concepts of ethics that they contend are incongruent with Maori cultural values and beliefs. Maori ethical issues identified in the literature that arise from this interface have similarities with indigenous ethical themes of respect, control and reciprocity. This qualitative research study was based on a kaupapa Maori approach. The research addressed two main research questions: whether the current system of ethical review in New Zealand is responsive to Maori and how can tikanga Maior inform Maori research ethics. Primary data for this study was drawn from interviews with Maori members of ethics committees and analysed thematically. The major conclusion of this study was that the current ethical review process is limited in its responsiveness to Maori. The research found that Maori values were generally marginalised within ethical review processes that are based on universal ethics derived from a Western value base. A number of key ethical issues for Maori are not addressed appropriately within the current system of ethical review due to the limited parameters, in Maori terms, of the review process. It is essential that Maori issues and concerns be addressed in order for Maori to benefit from the activities of the research sector. Differences exist between Maori and Western concepts of ethics and the inclusion of tikanga Maori within the ethical review process could lead to a more transparent and responsive evaluation and greatly enhance the quality of ethical review of health research in New Zealand. The development of a Maori ethical framework that describes the principles of tikanga Maori and their application within the context of research ethics could provide a culturally appropriate framework for ethical review. Such a framework would address ethical issues of significance for Maori in research. The establishment of a National Maori Ethics Committee and the development of a parallel Maori ethical review pathway would further enhance Maori responsiveness.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Research</field><field name="subject">Methodology</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Research</field><field name="subject">Hauora</field><field name="subject">Kupu</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loss before life begins: the invisible babies and their invisible deaths</field><field name="creator">Rose, Tina</field><field name="description">My experience of baby loss was an isolated learning experience and the main objective of my research was to help better resource other women who may find themselves lost in the system caring for women when their babies die. Particularly, I wanted to highlight and possibly remedy the invisibility of women and their babies that die between 12 and 20 weeks gestation. Loss Before Life Begins was written as four journalistic articles with one of the goals to be that all or some of the articles achieve publication in a mainstream New Zealand magazine. I focussed all the research on the last 20 years, beginning in 1985. Firstly, because it coincides with the establishment of Miscarriage Support Auckland, the first group of its kind in New Zealand. Secondly, because it ensured that the participants' stories would be relevant in the current context of how baby loss is treated by society, the media and the health system. Each article had a specific purpose and aim. Firstly, The Language of Loss investigated the background of our popular understanding of baby loss, including the legal categorisations of baby loss in different gestational periods. It also included research into the language commonly used by health professionals working with women whose babies have died. Quotes from the five women who were participants in the thesis were interwoven in the article. Their stories illustrated the effects of insensitive language on a woman's experience, and the perception of care and treatment received by health professionals. Then I reviewed all mainstream media articles published in New Zealand from 1985. This disclosed the lack of articles about baby loss, and the general dearth of practical information provided when stories did appear. Secondly, And Mother Makes Me was the narrative of the five women's stories interviewed about their babies' deaths between 12 and 20 weeks gestation. I discovered that this timeframe is 'invisible' because women under 20 weeks are not part of the obstetric system, and are cared for by nurses instead of midwives. These mothers are invisible, as are their babies' deaths. Article three, The 'System' and the People Working In It encompasses the sometimes conflicting views of four leading health professionals. Possible explanations for why women whose babies die under 20 weeks are treated differently to women whose babies are considered stillborn were included. Conflicting views about the importance of the media's role emerged. Small changes in the use of medical language by health professionals were outlined. Finally, possible reasons for society's difficulty with the concept of death, and specifically the difficulties when a woman's baby dies before its life has begun were uncovered. The fourth and final article, The Way It Is and The Way It Could Be summarised the background reading; media analysis from the last 20 years; the themes from the five women's stories; and the array of health professionals' views. Included are a number of specific meaningful ways that health professionals, media outlets and society can better support the invisible women when their babies die. These include updating medical language printed in brochures; including fact boxes in editorials; giving women and their families an opportunity to talk about their losses; and reviewing 'the system' that allows women who lose babies between 12 and 20 weeks to be cared for by nurses instead of midwives.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Miscarriage</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinant attributes of customer choice of banks, supplying mortgage products</field><field name="creator">Kotykhov, Mikhail</field><field name="description">The following research study attempts to identify the determinant factors, affecting the customer choice among alternative suppliers of mortgage products.

Neuromuscular function was measured using maximal voluntary isometric contraction force and voluntary activation. Total neuromuscular fatigue, central neuromuscular fatigue and peripheral neuromuscular fatigue was measured during a 90 second sustained maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the quadriceps muscle.Results: The fatigue profile of stroke participants differed from that of control participants. Stroke participants demonstrated less total neuromuscular fatigue (U=41.00, p=.026) and less peripheral neuromuscular fatigue (U=14.00, p=.000) than the control participants. While stroke participants did demonstrate greater central neuromuscular fatigue than control participants, this finding was not statistically significant (U=80.00, p=.817).Conclusions: Statistically significant differences were found in the performance of people with mild to moderate physical disability following stroke on measures of neuromuscular fatigue when compared to age, weight and height matched healthy adults.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease</field><field name="subject">Neuromuscular fatigue</field><field name="subject">Repeated measures block design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Last man hanging</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Robyn Joan</field><field name="description">This project involves the retelling of a historic New Zealand story using a system of multiple narrations.

The major component of this research is the creative text, Last Man Hanging. This is a book of pictures and type that retells the story of the trial and death of Walter James Bolton; the last man hanged in New Zealand. Its narrative discourse involves the orchestration of relationships through a compendium of characters, architecture, artifacts, environments and typography. The book integrates narrative voices that may be grouped into two often-conflicting positions; the story as it appeared in newspapers at the time, and the writer's personal consideration of an alternative series of events and emphases. Though an argument of tellings the book suggests a different verdict to that established by the courts in 1956.Finally, the exegesis contextualises both works.

It does not follow a strictly premeditated path or a rigid time line. An intuitive, organic approach is adopted instead, to complement cultural traditions, taking time to build understanding, trust and respect.  A collection of contemporary fashion garments and textiles is produced, inspired by yet distinct from these traditional textiles. The collection is synthesized i.e., it combines elements of tapa and kalamkari to form a coherent whole. This collection has contemporary relevance, while retaining the traditional handcrafted component of tapa and kalamkari. The investigative and creative process that culminates in the Poly'nAsia collection is documented in this exegesis.

The challenges in solving MCPO problems are related to the interdependencies that exist among the parameters and constraints that may be applied to the solution.This thesis examines the MCPO problem to construct a model that captures essential parameters to be solved using optimization algorithms. The purpose of the model is to make it possible that a solution for an MCPO problem can be generated automatically. A software application has been developed to provide a framework for validating the model.The development of the software has uncovered a host of geometric operations that are required to enable optimization to take place. Many of these operations are non-trivial, demanding novel, well-constructed algorithms based on careful appreciation of the nature of the problem.For the actual optimization task, three algorithms have been implemented: a greedy search, a Monte Carlo method, and a Genetic Algorithm. The behavior of the completed software is observed through its application on a series of test data. The results are presented to show the effectiveness of the software under various settings. This is followed by critical analysis of various findings of the research.Conclusions are drawn to summarize lessons learned from the research.

These were compared with those in control sites, where the rodent populations had not been manipulated. The arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps set in young podocarp-broadleaf, mature kanuka and mature taraire forested sites, and each treatment site was matched with two control sites. Data was collected monthly from all nine sites from December to May, 2005-06. In kanuka forest, data collected during December to May, 2004-05 has also been used.Rodent populations and possum populations were monitored during the course of the study. Tracking tunnel indices indicated that rat numbers were lower in the treatment sites than the control sites during 2005-06, and that rats were low in abundance at the treatment sites, apart from the occasional spike in numbers, in the three years prior to the start of this research. Mice tracking indices were relatively high at some specific sites, mainly in spring and autumn. Evidence indicated that possum abundance was low in both the treatment and the control sites.Ground weta were more abundant at the kanuka treatment site than the control sites in 2005-06, but were rarely found in the podocarp-broadleaf and taraire forest types.  Carabid beetles were trapped in greater numbers in podocarp-broadleaf and kanuka forest treatment sites in 2005-06, than in their respective control sites, and an increase in carabid beetle abundance was recorded between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 sampling seasons at the kanuka treatment site. Prowling spiders were more abundant at the podocarp-broadleaf treatment than at the control sites. Cave weta abundance at the podocarp-broadleaf and kanuka treatment sites was similar to their respective control sites. The arthropod abundance data from the taraire forest sites was confounded by many differences between the treatment and the control sites, which may have masked any effects caused by the suppression of rodent numbers at the treatment site.Ground weta and cave weta in the larger size classes appeared to be selectively preyed upon by predators, however, it was unclear whether rodents were entirely responsible because stoats and cats are also known to target larger arthropod prey, and their presence was not monitored.Ground weta in kanuka forest, carabid beetles in kanuka and podocarp-broadleaf forest and prowling spiders in podocarp-broadleaf forest are identified as potential indicators for monitoring the effects of rodent control in the Waitakere Ranges.This study was limited by a lack of knowledge of life histories and basic ecology of the arthropods. Further research at these sites is required to establish the long term population patterns of the arthropods.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Possums</field><field name="subject">Rats</field><field name="subject">Mice</field><field name="subject">Ground Weta</field><field name="subject">Cave Weta</field><field name="subject">Carabid beetles</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arguments, argumentation and agreement: a symbolic convergence study of the Lake Omapere Project</field><field name="creator">Ruth, Newport A</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is the construction of a shared vision for the environment.  Specifically, the purpose of this research was to examine the construction of shared vision between different rhetorical communities for the Lake Omapere Restoration Project.  In this investigation, I applied Bormann's (1972; 1983) symbolic convergence theory to the communication processes of the Resource Management Act (1991).  The intended outcome of this research was to gain further understanding of the communication processes in place within the Resource Management Act 1991 in order to foster a more holistic, bicultural approach for the development of Aotearoa New Zealand*.  My premise was that shared understanding through storytelling could be a useful tool for producing equitable bicultural environmental decisions. This research is concerned with how that shared vision is created rhetorically.  It is based on the theoretical understanding that language constructs people's social reality (Escobar, 1996; Pearce, 1989).  The literature review established that people make sense of the material world through language, deep emotional connection to the land and decision-making processes.  This discussion of the different ways people come to view the material world provided the background for the central research question.  The primary research question that guided the investigation was how do different rhetorical communities construct shared vision for the environment?  In order to answer this question data were collected using archival records retrieved from the Northland Regional Council.  The analysis of the data involved the application of Bormann's (1972; 1983) symbolic convergence theory to the construction of shared vision for the polluted condition of Lake Omapere in Northland.  The fantasy theme analysis of the texts revealed two fantasy themes personifying Lake Omapere: first, the story of the dying lake, followed by second fantasy theme of the salvation of the lake.  These two fantasy themes provided the rhetorical ground for the evolution of shared rhetorical vision for the restoration of the wellbeing of Lake Omapere.  Following Bormann (1972; 1983), the study showed that symbolic convergence theory accounts for the irrational as well as rational aspects of positive collaborative action for the environment.  This research has contributed to knowledge by showing that Bormann's (1972; 1983) symbolic convergence theory is a useful framework for explaining the process by which different rhetorical communities construct shared vision.  The fantasy theme analysis approach was specifically designed for this research.  Burke's (1966) "hexed" pentad was used in the initial stages of analysis to determine the elements of the fantasy themes.  This study showed that construction of shared vision encompasses at least three forms of communication: consciousness creating, raising and sustaining.  The study also contributed further questions as to the nature of the resulting shared vision.  This study shows that the democratic dialogue that is produced from sharing stories can result in justice.  The emergence of shared vision produced a new reality and an altered worldview where kaitiakitanga** has become a crucial focus for the future of Lake Omapere.  The restoration of the wellbeing of Lake Omapere through establishing kaitiakitanga is now a rhetorical reality and will shape future decisions made regarding the management and restoration of the lake.  The implications involved with incorporating the indigenous spiritual relational perspectives in legislation are a crucial concern for environmental decision-making both locally and internationally and further application of symbolic convergence theory research in this area is recommended.* Aotearoa New Zealand combines both the M&#257;ori and English names and is used in this thesis to acknowledge the bicultural intention of environment resource management.** Stewardship.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">Collaboration with Maori and evironmental projects</field><field name="subject">Cultural respect and considerations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotion and function: rethinking display and shelving</field><field name="creator">Leong, Kong Pei</field><field name="description">A product can embrace emotional qualities as well as functional qualities. Emotional qualities include fun, beauty, delight, surprise and any pleasure of the senses, such as sight, touch, smell, hearing and taste. In the literature of the past decade considerable emphasis has been placed on the less tangible emotional attributes a product conveys. Designing to satisfy human emotion has become one of the main design considerations for today's society. A product should not be designed to satisfy only the functional needs of the users but must also satisfy their psychological and emotional needs. This project is focused on exploring empathic design to develop an emotional display system to fulfil users' desires, aspirations and provide pleasurable experiences. Empathic design is an experience and emotion driven design that aims to enrich users' lifestyles, pride and pleasure, and adds value to the product. Five prototypes were evaluated through a questionnaire survey, focus groups and interviews regarding their emotional and functional qualities. While the resultant findings were not entirely conclusive, the evaluations have clearly indicated that the emotional qualities of a product are of significance to the users. Emotional qualities add pleasure and value to a product. Using these findings as design criteria, the designer proposes a series of new conceptual designs that are more empathic to the users' emotional needs.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of ethanol, honey, milk and essential oils as potential postharvest treatments of New Zealand grown fruit.</field><field name="creator">Lihandra, Eka Manggiasih</field><field name="description">Brown and Penicillium rot (blue and green mould) are the most common postharvest diseases in New Zealand, causing significant postharvest fruit losses. Current practice uses fungicides to control the postharvest diseases; however there are perceived health risks associated with the use of such chemicals. Recently, there has been substantial interest in chemicals that are considered Generally Regarded as Safe or GRAS and natural products as alternative postharvest treatments to replace currently used fungicides. In this study, ethanol (GRAS chemical) and the natural products honey, milk and essential oils (lemon, lemongrass, manuka and orange) were assessed as potential alternative treatments to replace the currently used fungicides on both peaches and oranges. In pilot studies ethanol was applied to the fruit by either vapour or dipping (30 seconds or 1.5 minutes). Honey, milk and essential oils were applied by dipping at 30 seconds. Essential oils were also tested using a microtiter assay. Exposing fruit to ethanol vapour proved effective at inhibiting fungal growth, but impacted negatively on fruit quality. Peaches that were exposed to 70% to 100% ethanol vapour were protected against fungal infection for up to 30 days when stored at either 4&#186;C or room temperature.  This is compared to two days for untreated peaches and three days for fungicide -treated peaches. However, the ethanol-treated peaches suffered from severe browning. In contrast, 20% ethanol protected peaches for ten days when stored at 4&#186;C and two days at room temperature. The fruit that were exposed to 20% ethanol did not brown as a result of the treatment. Oranges that were exposed to 20%, 50%, 70% and 100% ethanol vapour were protected from fungal inhibition for 30 days at both 4&#186;C and room temperature, but they too suffered from severe browning. Dipping was not as effective as vapour at protecting against fungal infection, but had a little effect on fruit quality. Peaches dipped in 20% to 100% ethanol were completely rotten by ten days when stored at room temperature, but the peaches experienced little to no browning. Untreated and fungicide-treated fruit were protected for one day and two days, respectively. Milk and honey do not appear to have potential as postharvest treatments. Peaches that were treated with 20%, 50% and 100% whole milk and 50% manuka honey showed greater degree of fungal infection compared to untreated peaches after both room temperature and 4&#186;C storage. At room temperature, peaches that were exposed to 20%, 50% and 100% milk were completely rotten at eight days, compared with ten days for untreated peaches. In contrast, at 4&#186;C, peaches that were treated with 100% milk were completely rotten at 30 days, while only a slight fungal infection observed on untreated fruit. Similar to milk, honey-treated peaches were also completely rotten at 30 days at 4&#186;C storage.In vitro (microtiter) assay of the essential oils showed that orange and manuka oils appeared to be effective only at high concentrations. In contrast, lemongrass and lemon oils appeared to be effective even at low concentrations. Of the essential oils tested in the in vivo assay, lemongrass and lemon oils have the greatest potential. Oranges that were exposed to 0.05% lemongrass oil, 0.25% and 0.5% lemon oil were protected for 30 days when stored at 4&#186;C or room temperature. They provided the best antifungal activity compared to the other concentrations of all four essential oils tested as well as fungicide treatment for 30 days. Of all the treatment tested, 0.05% lemongrass oil, 0.25% and 0.5% lemon oil appeared to be the most promising treatments. However, these treatments need to be tested for antifungal effects, fruit quality, flavour and nutritional effects in large scale experiments before they can be applied as replacements to currently used fungicides. Also, essential oils are complex compounds; therefore it would be of interest to determine the active compound(s) of the lemongrass and lemon oils.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Postharvest treatments</field><field name="subject">Fruit</field><field name="subject">Essential oil</field><field name="subject">Honey</field><field name="subject">Milk</field><field name="subject">Ethanol</field><field name="subject">Biological control</field><field name="subject">Food preservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physical power pre-requisites and acute effects of resisted sled loading on sprint running kinematics of the early acceleration phase from starting blocks</field><field name="creator">Maulder, Peter Scott</field><field name="description">The ability to perform well during the sprint start and early acceleration phases of sprint running is critical. Many forms of training interventions are utilised to give a sprinter a competitive edge over their opponents in these particular phases. Despite this fact, there has been limited research on the technical and power type training strategies appropriate to improve sprint kinematics and the associated sprint performance in the sprint start and early acceleration phases. PURPOSE: To determine the best sprint start and early acceleration phase kinematic determinants, investigate the effect that load has on the kinematics of the sprint start and early acceleration performance and to determine how various physical characteristics may influence both resisted and unresisted sprint running. METHODS: Ten male track sprinters (mean &#177; SD: age 20 &#177; 3 years; height 1.82 &#177; 0.06 m; weight 76.7 &#177; 7.9 kg; 100 m personal best: 10.87 + 0.36 s {10.37 - 11.42 s}) attended two testing sessions. The first session required the athletes to sprint twelve 10 m sprints from a block start under unresisted and resisted (10% &amp; 20% body mass) sled conditions. The second session required each athlete to complete an anthropometric assessment (height, mass, 3 bone lengths, 2 bone widths) and a variety of vertical (squat jump, countermovement jump, continuous straight legged jump) and horizontal (single leg hop for distance, single leg triple hop for distance) jump tests (3 trials each). Centre of gravity, joint and segment kinematics were calculated from 2D analysis utilising a kinematic analysis system (Ariel Performance Analysis System, U.S.A.). Means and standard deviations are presented for kinematic and performance measures. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients were employed to establish relationships between sprint start (block) performance variables and 10 m sprint performance. A linear regression analysis was used to quantify the relationships between the dependent variables (start performance and 10 m sprint time) and selected kinematic independent variables. ANOVA's with repeated measures were used to determine if there was a significant interaction between the kinematics under the various loaded conditions. A stepwise multiple regression and linear regression analysis were used for the prediction of unresisted and resisted sprint times from anthropometrical and functional performance measures. RESULTS: Mean horizontal block acceleration was identified as the start performance variable with the strongest relationship to 10 m sprint time. The most significant kinematic predictors of mean horizontal block acceleration were a large horizontal block velocity, short start time, and low thigh angle of the front block leg with respect to the horizontal at block takeoff. Sprint time over 10 m was best predicted by a large mean horizontal block acceleration (sprint start performance), increased angle of the front arm shoulder at step takeoff, and increased angle of front upper arm at step takeoff. Sprint start kinematics significantly altered as a result of resisted sled towing were start time (increase) and push-off angle from the blocks (decrease). Step length, stance time and propulsion time significantly increased, whereas flight time and flight distance significantly decreased under loaded conditions. A load of 20% body mass was revealed to be the better training load to utilise during resisted sled sprinting, especially for athletes who performed faster than 2.10 s for a 10 m sprint from a block start. The countermovement jump exercise was a strong predictor of both 10 m and 100 m sprint time. The continuous straight legged jump test was revealed to be a good predictor of resisted sprints over 10m.CONCLUSION: Consideration should be given to the technical training aspects of sprint start performance and forceful arm movements during step takeoff for improving sprint start and early acceleration sprint performance from starting blocks. These technical training aspects should also be supplemented with resisted sled towing with a load of 20% body mass and countermovement jump training to improve sprint ability.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sprinting</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The price of spiritual and social survival: investigating the reasons for the departure of young New Zealand-born Samoans from a South Auckland Samoan Seventh-day Adventist Church</field><field name="creator">Tunufa'i, Laumua Fata</field><field name="description">This study seeks to determine the reasons for the departure of New Zealand-born Samoans from a South Auckland traditional Samoan Seventh-day Adventist church.

The results of this study strongly indicate that the church atmosphere was neither conducive nor promising, but very antagonistic to developing New Zealand-born Samoan young people's spiritual and social journeys. Consequently, the situation at church made these young people look elsewhere for social and spiritual survival. An analysis of the data suggests that the church can reverse the problem of departure by putting in place an active and effective system whereby the concerns and ideas of New Zealand-born Samoans as well as other youths are shared, heard, and rightly understood by the elders and the leadership of the church.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samoans</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Christianity and culture</field><field name="subject">Pacific Islanders</field><field name="subject">Cultural assimilation</field><field name="subject">Social Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Envy amongst psychotherapists in a psychotherapeutic community: a hermeneutic inquiry</field><field name="creator">Land, Crea M</field><field name="description">My research explores the lived experience of envy amongst psychotherapists and between psychotherapists in a psychotherapeutic community in New Zealand. It focuses on bringing the experience of envy out of hiddenness and into language.It then explores the understandings and the possibilities of meanings that these experiences have. Previous literature on envy has for the most part discussed the clients' envy for the psychotherapist, and very little has been written about the therapists' envy for the client. My research turns the focus to the psychotherapist as it looks at their envy for each other.As I was interested in the therapists' lived experiences of envy, I chose hermeneutic phenomenology as the methodology to explore these. I drew on the philosophical underpinnings offered by Heidegger, Gadamer and van Manen.What arose from my in-depth conversations with psychotherapists is that while envy is an experienced phenomenon that is for the most part not spoken, the powerful feelings that it evokes have great impact on both those who envy and those who are envied. Envy showed up as arising in a relational context, with perception, time and anxiety as contextual determinants. These, along with the findings of the lived experience of envy as a binding between self and other, as threatening to self and other and as a means of connecting with self and other, are some of the essential points discussed in my thesis.This study provides a starting point for a further exploration of the experience of envy amongst psychotherapists as well as envy's impact on who we are in ourselves and how we are with each other, both personally and professionally.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychotherapists</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Envy</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand hotel industry: the role of image as a medium influencing company's competitiveness and customer loyalty  towards brand</field><field name="creator">Binkowska, Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis evolves around image and its significance while developing customers' loyalty and increasing company's competitiveness in a highly competitive market. The topic is studied in-depth from the organisational perspective and delves into the differing motivations of hotel operators towards shaping favourable image as well as examining how the hotel's image affects customer loyalty and helps the company to increase its competitiveness. Finally, it analyses and compares which public relations tools are the most effective in the process of image creation and developing customer loyalty. From this perspective image becomes a central issue impacting company's future growth, performance and finally success. The research was conducted on the Auckland international hotel chains. Auckland hosts numerous conferences and events that drives demand for accommodation and in a way, creates a conducive environment to hotel operators for future expansion. Thus, hotels compete strongly with one another constantly looking for a competitive advantage by growing their customer base. My thesis outlines the hotels' management efforts and analyses their strategies in the context of changing customers' demands and market trends.With respect to methodological issues, my thesis is based on a qualitative approach and follows an interpretivist paradigm. The research background has been delineated as have been my respondents' profile to provide additional information about the organisation they represent. The research findings described at the end of this thesis document how important image is for a modern hotel and what initiatives should be followed to ensure success. Image and loyalty are closely interrelated as positive image affects customers' loyalty. In order to achieve a balance between sustaining a competitive advantage and increasing loyal customer base a number of managerial implications have been discovered. Detailed analysis of these findings may help the companies to establish a more favourable position in the global market and create mutually beneficial relationships which further help the organisation to grow.Having aimed at exploring the importance of image as a medium that affects company's competitiveness and customers' loyalty towards brand, this study has provided some useful indications for hotel companies as to what should be undertaken to gain loyal customers and improve company's performance on the market.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Loyalty</field><field name="subject">Brand</field><field name="subject">Auckland hotel industry</field><field name="subject">Business competitiveness/competition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The merging of fact and fiction binaries within suicide</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Paul Steven</field><field name="description">This explorative research examines a contemporary representation for suicide.

Three of the stomachs were empty. All other samples consisted almost entirely of cephalopod beaks. A total of 23,223 cephalopod beaks (10,647 upper and 12,576 lower), representing at least 36 species in 17 families were found in the remaining 16 stomachs. Non-cephalopod remains in the stomachs of sperm whales stranded in New Zealand included limited quantities of fish, salps, crustacean exoskeletons, a copepod, some wood and sand.The present investigation represents the most comprehensive study of the diet of sperm whales in New Zealand since the early 1960s. The results show that oceanic squid of the families Histioteuthidae, Cranchiidae, Onychoteuthidae and Octopoteuthidae are the most common remains found in the stomachs of sperm whales stranded on New Zealand beaches, with the families Onychoteuthidae, Histioteuthidae, Octopoteuthidae and Architeuthidae being the most important by estimated weight in whale diet, and the families Cranchiidae, Pholidoteuthidae and Ancistrocheiridae secondarily so.The beaks of three cephalopod species thought to be restricted to Antarctic waters (Kondakovia longimana, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni and Psychroteuthis glacialis) were found in 12 of the stomachs, suggesting these whales had recently migrated into New Zealand from more southern feeding grounds. The amount of local cephalopod beaks in the stomachs suggests some of the stranded sperm whales did not feed much within New Zealand waters in the days prior to stranding.The beaks of Taningia danae, Octopoteuthis megaptera, Octopoteuthis sp. 'Giant' and Lepidoteuthis grimaldii are illustrated and described. Oblique and lateral illustrations of the lower beaks are given, as well as sections of the rostrum, jaw angle, shoulder and lateral wall, to show the major identifying features for each of the species.Squid are an important component of food chains in the Southern Ocean and they act as both high-level predators and prey for apex predators. Therefore, seasonal fluctuations in their abundance must have cascading effects on the diets of apex predators. With increasing global fishing effort, and with cephalopods representing over 4% of the global annual catch, there are competing interests between the ocean's top teuthophagous predators and the fishing industry.Uncertainty of the effects fisheries have on the marine ecosystem has stimulated numerous research studies in recent years. However, despite the economic and ecological importance of cephalopods, there are few ecological studies on them or their significance in the trophic systems of the deep-sea and their life cycles and distribution patterns are only now beginning to be understood. Additional dietary studies that investigate the cephalopod composition and size-class structure in the diet of predators are needed to assess their importance in deepsea food webs, and the potential impact that deep-sea fisheries might have on associated and dependant species, namely apex oceanic predators.The results of this study provide the first significant insight into the diet of the sperm whale, one of the most important apex predators in New Zealand waters.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dietary analysis</field><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">Sperm whale biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of acupuncture on alpha-motoneuron excitability</field><field name="creator">Chan, Alexander Kam Shing</field><field name="description">The analgesic effect of acupuncture is well known.

Essential for the evaluation of Chinese acupuncture treatment is the availability of a reliable and valid measurement. However, currently there is no appropriate measurement instrument validated within traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) concepts and frameworks. Objective is to develop and validate a TCM questionnaire as a health status instrument for TCM assessment in patients with OA of the hip and knee. Methods The TCM questionnaire was developed from TCM theory and clinical experience. The questionnaire was examined by experts, for content and faces validity and pre-tested on a volunteer sample of three subjects. The developed questionnaire was validated on a convenience sample of ten subjects from six different clinical settings in Auckland region. The practitioner or receptionist from the selected clinical sites handed out the questionnaire package to their patients who fulfilled the study criteria. Each patient (subject) completed the questionnaire on their arrival and the re-testing questionnaire at a two-week interval. The reliability of the questionnaire was estimated by examining the internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha statistic) and test-retest reliability (Intra-class correlation coefficients). The content validity of the questionnaire was examined by literature review, interviews with patients, and experts' judgement. The construct validity was estimated by the methods of known groups, correlations between scales, and correlations with the SF-36 health survey. The success of the grouping or scaling of the questionnaire was estimated by examining the item (i.e. question) internal consistency and item (i.e. question) discriminant validity. Results The TCM questionnaire scales corresponded to the "eight principal syndromes", "ten questions", and "eight patterns of OA" within TCM concepts and frameworks. Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was above .70 for all scales on both occasions of the first test and the second test. Test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient) for each scale was also above .70 for all scales, except the exterior (EXT) scale, which was .44. Moderate associations were found between the age of subjects and the scores of the interior (INT) scale and summary (SUM) scale. There was a significant difference between the groups of use and non-use of on-going medication in the EXT scale scores on the first test, p = .012. However, this significant difference was not found on the second test. As expected, strong or moderate associations were found between the TCM questionnaire and SF-36 comparable scales. Conclusions The TCM questionnaire was developed within TCM concepts and frameworks. The questionnaire contains 23 items with two main scales (the EXT scale and the INT scale) and one additional scale (the SUM scale). It takes approximately five minutes to complete and is entirely self-administered. Results from this pilot study indicate that this TCM questionnaire might have adequate reliability and validity. Therefore, the questionnaire has potential usage as an outcome measurement instrument for the assessment of TCM in the patients with OA of the hip or knee. For this application to be possible, the questionnaire needs further development and validation with a larger sample of patients who have a variety of OA conditions.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicine, Chinese</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis</field><field name="subject">Pelvic bones</field><field name="subject">Knee</field><field name="subject">Medicine, chinese traditional</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fatal cycle</field><field name="creator">Steer, Laurie</field><field name="description">This art project focuses in a voyeuristic way on the fatality and futility of war.

The subject of knowledge transfer is undisputedly important because knowledge is the essence of competitive advantage. In addition, multinational organisations are believed to be more effective at facilitating inter-firm knowledge transfer. The theoretical framework of this thesis is based on four constructs of knowledge transfer: motivation to transfer knowledge; richness of communication channels; absorptive capacity and organisational context. The research uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore these constructs. The research confirms the positive relationship between these constructs. Importantly, it highlights three knowledge transfer levels namely: pooling; assimilation; application and integration of knowledge into the multinational organisation. The research shows that knowledge must move through each of these levels if the focus is knowledge creation, these levels not to be treated as isolated but in fact overlapping. The research also found that high levels of espoused motivation are not always supported by proactive knowledge transfer behaviours. It demonstrated that at a certain level of knowledge transfer encouragement becomes less important than other motivational factors. Importantly, the multinational needs to manage knowledge transfer. To do this, the nature of knowledge must be considered and there needs to be an understanding that ad hoc knowledge transfer patterns can inhibit knowledge being transferred to where it may be needed. The research highlights how important it is for multinational inter-firm knowledge transfer to begin with the individual and then move to the organisation. The individual needs to have the necessary attitudes and ability to understand the benefits. Also, they need to understand that knowledge is not transferred through acceptance alone, but needs to be implemented. This means the multinational must provide strategic direction and structure that facilitates the movement of knowledge across the multinational organisation. Knowledge transfer routines must be managed to allow knowledge to move to where it can create unique knowledge because it is this unique knowledge that can be a strategic benefit to the organisation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multinational organization</field><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Knowledge creation</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dance and stillness: a phenomenological hermeneutic inquiry into the experience of stillness: presented through the medium of dance performance and written exegesis</field><field name="creator">De Leon, Jennifer</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the subject of stillness: specifically the stillness that occurs in the midst of movement, turbulence or chaos. It is found in the midst of movement and can also be conceived as that which frames, or holds all movement. A principal focus of the thesis is to distinguish the therapeutic value of this stillness.The research methodology is hermeneutic phenomenology. Within this framework a choreographed dance work and written exegesis comprise and are equal parts of the whole. The choreography for the dance work employs a neo-classical-contemporary technique particular to the choreographer. A story and a journey are presented - providing a vehicle for the central theme of the thesis - stillness within movement, to be best elucidated. A Christo-centric philosophy and worldview are ground of the work.The dance work is choreographed on and presented by four dancers. These four dancers and four 'watchers' are the research participants. As the dance work evolved it was presented 'in process' and the participants interviewed subsequent to the showings. These interviews were not psychotherapy sessions, so data about interventions, process and outcome does not appear. Rather information was sought about the essence of the danced / watched experience, with particular attention being given to the felt experience of stillness. Data gained from these interviews constitutes the findings of the research.The findings show that the particular stillness exampled in this dance work is therapeutic, and therapeutic experience for the individual participants was realised. The data suggests the stillness was experienced in a number of different ways.These include: a personal relationship with chaos, the significance of relationship with each other, the particular relevance of design and time in the individual's life, the meaning of authenticity, the relevance and meaningfulness of symbolism, and the personal understanding of awareness, focus and release.This research shows that we who are psychotherapy clients, practitioners, and people of all walks would greatly benefit through including into daily life this 'stillness immanent within movement.'</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dance</field><field name="subject">Movement</field><field name="subject">Choreography</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Time</field><field name="subject">Stillness</field><field name="subject">Authenticity</field><field name="subject">Symbolism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GIS model for assessment of land use and urban development effects on stormwater runoff: Puhinui Catchment case study</field><field name="creator">Krpo, Ana</field><field name="description">As local authorities are becoming more interested in the assessment of pollutant loads, this study offers a Geographic Information System (GIS) model for assessing nonpoint source of pollution for two scenarios: the current and ultimate stage of urbanization. The Puhinui Catchment, Manukau City, has been used as a case study in developing and testing this model. This catchment has all the attributes of a "typical" urban area and gives a good representation of the effects of land use on the receiving waters of Puhinui Stream and its estuary. Annual mass contaminant loadings were calculated by firstly assessing the physical characteristics of the Puhinui catchment (case study catchment) and secondly describing the nature of storm water quality and calculating the annual mass contaminant loadings.GIS is used to multiply the annual runoff volume by a mean pollutant concentration to acquire an average annual pollutant load. The annual runoff volume is calculated from the drainage area, runoff coefficient and annual rainfall. To calculate the total mean pollutant load, the pollutant loads for all land use types within the catchment are summed and the process is applied for each pollutant. This GIS model determines the connection of typical pollutant concentrations with land uses in the catchment and offers a characterisation of nonpoint source pollution in that catchment. This model can be used for, identifying catchment areas that contribute considerably to the pollution of waterways, determining the appropriate treatment of the storm water runoff for particular sub catchment, storm water quality improvement prioritization and cost-benefit analysis, selecting locations for water-quality monitoring stations, improvement in maintenance practices, assessment of proposed development environmental effects.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">Urban runoff</field><field name="subject">Storm sewers</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Pollution</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A familiar villain: surveillance, ideology and popular cinema</field><field name="creator">Brown, Felicity Adair</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the representations of surveillance in mainstream cinema. Using ideology critique it will show how filmic illustrations of monitoring depoliticize the relationship between surveillance and structural relations of power.In order to provide a foundation for this inquiry, a political economy critique of surveillance will be undertaken in four areas. Focusing on the workplace, consumer surveillance, urban policing and intelligence gathering, this thesis will contextualise surveillance as historically relevant and intimately connected with modern constructs such as the nation-state, military power and capitalist economic organisation. In recent years, the role of surveillance has been intensified in response to the challenges posed by globalization, the restructuring of capitalism in the 1980's and 90's and the declining legitimacy of nation-state governments. These developments are both aided by, and in turn promote, pervasive networks of surveillance. Driven by risk management and other forms of economic reasoning as organisational logic, developments in information communication technologies accelerate surveillance capabilities rendering them more invasive and intense. In this way, surveillance can be conceived of as complicit with prevailing relations of power on a macro, sociological level.In order to show how mainstream cinematic representations of surveillance ideologically obscure this relationship, this thesis begins with an overview of 30 popular films. It then moves to a comparison of four recent Hollywood portrayals of surveillance with the four areas of political economy critique identified above. This analysis will reveal that these films have a tendency to focus on sentimental themes such as individual heroism, antagonist versus protagonist struggles and romantic subplots, in a way which deflects attention from collective experience with surveillance webs. More pertinently, the narrative structures of these films feature dichotomies between malevolent and benevolent monitoring, aligning legitimate and benign surveillance with the state. At the same time, the accompanying imagery of surveillance devices fetishizes monitoring, deterministically glorifying technology as a powerful and omniscient force. The overall effect is to depoliticize monitoring as a natural part of the fabric of everyday life.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion pictures - political aspects</field><field name="subject">Privacy, Right of</field><field name="subject">Power (Social sciences)</field><field name="subject">Intelligence service</field><field name="subject">Electronic surveillance</field><field name="subject">Communication studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consumer evaluations of brand imitations: an investigation</field><field name="creator">Su, Sasa</field><field name="description">Brand imitation is viewed as an infringement of the imitated original brand. (Zaichkowsky, 1995). Although brand managers and researchers have looked into ways to fight against imitations, these are still prevalent in today's market. Researchers have found that one of the major reasons for the growing volume of imitations has been consumer demand. Thus, rather than studying ways to reduce imitations, it is first important for brand managers and researchers to understand why consumers would knowingly buy imitations. The major issue is to understand how consumers evaluate brand imitations. Several studies have explored factors that might have an influence on consumer evaluations of brand imitations. However these findings are limited. For example, similarity of the imitation to the original brand is an important factor in consumer evaluations. However, very little research has studied this aspect. Thus, this research is motivated to further investigate the influential factors of consumer evaluations of brand imitations. This study replicates d'Astous and Gargouri (2001), a study that examines a comprehensive set of factors that might influence consumer evaluations of brand imitations. The purpose of this study is to re-examine their hypotheses in various product categories, with a focus on luxury brands. Moreover, this study has extended the d'Astous and Gargouri (2001) study by investigating product similarity which had not been previously explored. However, hypothesis testing did not completely support the hypothesized effects. The results indicate that consumers who purchase luxury brand imitations are heavily influenced by the price and store image. The results show also that the factor of product similarity is unimportant to a customer purchasing imitator brands.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand choice</field><field name="subject">Brand name products</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Destruction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) and aliphatic hydrocarbons in soil using ball milling</field><field name="creator">Magoha, Happy Steven</field><field name="description">This study involves the use of ball mill as a mechanochemical reactor in the destruction of environmental contaminants. Although the technology has the potential to be used for a wide range of organic contaminants, this study focused on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) and aliphatic hydrocarbons. There are different methods for the remediation of the environmental contaminants such as biological, chemical and thermal techniques, most of which are costly. The ball mill is less costly as it involves low technology and little or no other chemicals seem to be needed to give complete destruction of the substances investigated. The mill is relatively easy to construct and can be made in different designs and dimensions to fit its intended purpose i.e. they can range from a laboratory scale to a very large industrial mill for the continuous processing of tonnes of material at a time. The process can be sealed so pollution from the mill is easy to control. In this study two classes of environmental contaminants were investigated. PAH's are common by-products of combustion and are found as contaminants in many soils. The other compounds investigated were the larger aliphatic hydrocarbons. These were chosen as being representative of the evaporated residues from fuel spills or leaks. A laboratory scale centrifugal ball mill with capacity of approximately 200 g was used for the study. The PAH's investigated were naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene. The aliphatic hydrocarbons n-eicosane and n-octacosane were used as the model compounds for hydrocarbon residues. Different soil types (scoria, clay soil, silica sand and slag) were spiked with a known amount of these contaminants. The ball milling was done under different milling conditions i.e. with different ball ratio and with different milling duration. In some experiments there was an addition of materials such as a potential free radical trap or metals to investigate the effect on the mechanochemical reaction. The samples were analysed using an ultrasonic extraction method (EPA METHOD 3550C) with GC and GC-MS analysis of the extract for the quantification of the residual contaminant in the soil and identification of possible secondary products and reaction intermediates. It was found that high destruction efficiency was achieved using milling times of between 120 and 150 minutes and high ball to soil ratios for example 7:1 ball mass to soil mass ratio. Also it was found that different type of soil had an influence on the mechanochemical reaction. A silica matrix was found to have a better destruction rate compared to scoria and clay soil. It was also found that the PAH compounds were more rapidly destroyed by ball milling than were aliphatic hydrocarbons. The addition of BHT was found to reduce destruction rate of both PAH's and aliphatic hydrocarbons. This suggests the mechanism of destruction may involve a free radical mechanism. Aluminium metal was observed to have no significant effect in the destruction. The presence of lubricants such as waxes in the contaminated soil appeared to inhibit the mechanochemical reaction although the mechanism is still uncertain. From this study it was concluded that, the ball mill has considerable potential as an effective, low cost method for the destruction of certain environmental contaminants.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">Pollutants</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two becoming one: immigrant Indian women sustaining self and well-being through doing: a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">Nayar, Shoba C</field><field name="description">Using a grounded theory methodology, this research sought to describe the occupational change process Indian women experience as they settle in a new environment, with a focus on how they sustain their sense of self and well-being. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with eight women of Indian origin who had immigrated to New Zealand within the past five years in an attempt to generate theory about the processes that these immigrants' experience. A constant comparative analysis revealed a central change process, Two Becoming One, which encompassed three interconnecting occupational processes. The first process women experience is Oh God, Where Did I Come?. In this process, where the environment is new and unfamiliar, the women feel compelled to do familiar activities that they know they can accomplish, thus increasing confidence and supporting well-being. The second process, Being In The Change, sees the women learning more about their new environment and engaging in new occupations, while continuing to hold on to doing familiar activities. A New Zealander with an Indian Soul finds the women doing more as they embrace a strengthening sense of self and well-being and strive to build their future in a new land. Central to these three processes is the core category Two Becoming One. This process is a commentary on the women's journeys of integrating the demands of two cultures, each with its own unique environment and ways of doing things, while supporting a healthy sense of self and well-being throughout the experience. The study findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay that occurs within a person-environment-occupation interface. Situating the findings within current literature reveals the limitation of previous understandings of the person-environment-occupation dynamic, in relation to people performing in an unfamiliar environment. With an increasing trend of immigration worldwide, this study brings to light the importance of understanding the bearing that environmental context has on occupation and the resulting impact for persons' sense of self and well-being. Further research in this area is required to gain deeper awareness of the ways in which people interact with their environment over time, and the resultant effect on occupation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women immigrants</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Women, East Indian</field><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Code-switching and identity on the blogs: an analysis of Taglish in computer mediated communication</field><field name="creator">Smedley, Frank</field><field name="description">This study analyses the code-switching variety Taglish (Tagalog-English) in personal weblogs written by Filipino bloggers.The main research questions are set forth in chapter one: why do writers of weblogs code-switch in contexts where there is no specific addressee and hence no turn taking, and why is 'this' particular language chosen at 'this' juncture in the weblog narrative?Chapter two gives an overview of relevant code-switching theory and research, and focuses especially on the sociolinguistic dimensions. In particular, the markedness model of Myers-Scotton is reviewed with respect to the notion of code-switching itself as an unmarked choice. This sets the stage for introducing Taglish as a normal and unmarked phenomenon for many Filipinos.Chapter three presents the socio-political and linguistic background in the Philippines. This give a backdrop for a focus on the evolution and status of Taglish.The problems associated with the presentation of self in Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) are examined in Chapter four and then the unique characteristics of weblogs are explored with respect to their purpose and genre.Chapter five looks at the design and methodology employed and emphasises the qualitative nature of the research and the sampling method as purposive. The main corpus of 25 extracts were analysed using frameworks which bring important perspectives to bear on the use of code-switching in the construction and negotiation of identity. These frameworks are: the referee design dimension of Bell's audience design model with its emphasis on initiative style shifts to project different identities; discursive psychology which highlights the use of language to position self and others; and narrative psychology with its stress on people's use of narrative to seek coherence of self and life-experience. These frameworks are combined with Bakhtinian notions of polyphony, dialogism and heteroglossia.Chapter six gives the detailed results of the analysis of seven weblogs which typify the findings of the corpus. Code-switching on these weblogs highlights the creative end of language use. However, it is a creativity tempered by the realities of Bakhtinian heteroglossia. The heteroglossic nature of the code-switching, in seemingly monological texts, is implicated in how the bloggers negotiate and construct social identities by positioning themselves and others in the ongoing narrative flow. In that the code-switching is extremely plentiful in this non-oral environment, it poses a serious challenge to the attempts by some conversational analysts (e.g., Li, 2005) to claim that code-switching can only really be explicated in terms of the systematics of an interaction taking place. The research seeks to stay within the spirit of CA by suggesting that even in a seemingly monologic form, interaction may be reconceived as heteroglossia covertly present in all language and overtly manifest in switching. Thus switching is not merely a product of how speakers attend to the orderly production of conversation, but also a product of how they attend to the inherent heteroglossic nature of language and exploit their linguistic repertoire maximally to make their communication as effective as possible, and to construct and negotiate multiple identities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blogs</field><field name="subject">Tagalog language</field><field name="subject">Code switching (Linguistics)</field><field name="subject">Foreign Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of consumption values on motorcycle brand choice</field><field name="creator">Gaskill, Adam</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to identify the brand choice moderators that influence consumers' choice of one brand over another. This research examines the influence of five consumption values on brand choice behaviour within the New Zealand market for new road motorcycles using stepwise discriminant analysis. The greater variety of brands, forcing consumers to make more brand choices combined with the large financial value of some brands was the major motivator for this research. In reviewing the literature a gap emerged relating to brand choice behaviour for durable goods. This research addresses this gap through using the durable goods category of road motorcycles.

One of the key issues in this area relates to the training load that would best facilitate strength and power adaptation. Heavy loads (&gt;60-70% 1RM) have been traditionally used for maximal strength development by facilitating changes in neural function (strength) and muscle size (hypertrophy). However, many studies have now found lighter load (&gt;45%1RM) training equally effective in improving both strength and hypertrophy. Similarly, many studies have found heavy load training effective in enhancing various measures of power though lighter loads (e.g. 45% 1RM) are thought to maximise the mechanical power output of muscle. Realising that adaptation depends upon some interaction between the mechanical, hormonal and metabolic stimuli, examining these responses would enhance our understanding of the underlying determinants of strength and power, and thereby improve strength and conditioning practice. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the mechanical, hormonal and metabolic responses to equal volume light and heavy loading schemes. Eleven males (mean 26.6 &#177; 6.7 years; mean 79.0 &#177; 8.1 kg) with a minimum of 12 months weight training experience each performed two exercises (Smith squat and supine squat) at a light (45% 1RM) and heavy (88% 1RM) intensity. The light scheme consisted of eight sets of six repetitions, with six sets of four repetitions performed in the heavy scheme. Rest periods of three and four minutes respectively were used. Saliva sampling was used to determine the hormonal (cortisol and testosterone) and metabolic (lactate) responses. Samples were collected at rest (pre-), immediately after the first exercise (mid-), at the conclusion of the second exercise (P0) and every 15 minutes thereafter for one hour (P15, P30, P45, P60). Mean values for all variables were analysed with a paired sample T-test. Chances that the true effects were substantial (% and qualitative) were also calculated. No significant (P&gt;0.05) difference in total forces was found between schemes; however, the light scheme produced significantly greater total time under tension (36%), total work (37%) and total power output (115%). Total impulse (38%) was the only variable found to be greater in the heavy scheme. A decrease in testosterone (TST) was observed in the heavy scheme (-4 to -29%) with no significant changes found across the light scheme (1 to 12%). Cortisol decreased in the light (-6 to -30%) and heavy (-14 to -44%) schemes until P45. An increase in the TST/cortisol ratio was observed in both the light (17 to 49%) and heavy (2 to 44%) schemes. Both loading schemes resulted in similar increases in lactate (0.3 to 1.0nmol/l). Equating two schemes by volume resulted in differential responses, many of which favoured the lighter scheme in terms of mechanical, hormonal and metabolic outputs. These findings suggest that load or intensity employed may be not as important as initially proposed and that other factors (e.g. volume, technique) may explain the similar strength and hypertrophy adaptation reported in studies comparing light and heavy schemes.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Isometric exercise</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resident perceptions of event impacts: Taupo and Ironman New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Buch, Tina</field><field name="description">In New Zealand the development and promotion of sporting events is becoming increasingly popular, due in part to the role of sport in building the nation's identity, the economic benefits, and a growing awareness of the importance of health and fitness within the community. Given this increased popularity it is important that the impacts of these events upon the local 'host' communities be understood. Social impacts have been given more and more attention in recent years by event researchers, due to the recognition that the long term sustainability of such events can only be achieved with the approval and participation of residents. This research addresses these issues in the context of Taupo, New Zealand using the case of Ironman New Zealand.This thesis adopts a mixed method approach using interviews (n=7), participant observation, and a web-survey (n=111). The findings confirm that it is vital to investigate and understand impacts of events on host communities. The findings are also consistent with theories identified in the literature in terms of the nature of social impacts on host communities. The overall results indicate that residents are aware of both the positive and negative impacts of Ironman New Zealand. Respondents highlight positive impacts such as economic benefits, exposure of Taupo, community togetherness, and the encouragement of sports, yet they also recognize negative impacts such as inconvenience from traffic congestion, and road closures. Accordingly, the community was grouped into three distinct clusters with positive, negative and ambivalent perceptions, and were labelled 'Lovers', 'Pessimists' and 'Realists'. The findings further suggest that the use of web-surveying for community research is still in its infancy and needs further development enabling it to be used as an effective tool. Finally it is proposed that small to medium scale sporting event hosted in regional communities may contribute to a sense of community and to the creation of social capital. Further research is needed to confirm this proposition.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resident perceptions</field><field name="subject">Sporting events</field><field name="subject">Community participation</field><field name="subject">Social impacts</field><field name="subject">Web-survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anticipatory lower limb muscle activity during a turning task</field><field name="creator">Ngan-Hing, Lisa</field><field name="description">Two experiments were undertaken. The objective of Experiment One was to identify the lower limb muscles that were most frequently active during the early period of a step turning task for further testing in Experiment Two. In Experiment Two participants undertook multiple trials of a step-turning task, 30 and 60&#176; to the left and right of midline, at a self-selected pace in response to a visual cue. There were five objectives to Experiment Two. Firstly, to identify the predominant order in the onset of foot movement so that anticipatory muscle activity could be defined for this task. Secondly, to identify whether there is a consistent temporal order in movement onset between the head and the feet. Thirdly, to identify whether and how consistently anticipatory lower limb muscle activity is present bilaterally. Fourthly, to assess whether there is a consistent sequence in the onset of anticipatory muscle activity among muscles active in at least 80% of trials. The final objective was to identity whether there was a consistent temporal relationship in the onset of the anticipatory muscle activity present in at least 80% of trials, with the onset of head and foot movement. Study Design: A repeated measures design was used. Background: Anticipatory lower limb muscle activity in gait initiation and forward stepping studies has been reported to be consistently present, and associated with initial and important balance responses. Falls during turning are associated with a high incidence of hip fractures in the elderly population. The presence of anticipatory lower limb muscle activity turning has not been previously reported. Participants: There were five participants in Experiment One, and ten in Experiment Two. All were between 18 and 40 years of age and did not have neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, or severe visual loss. Results: In Experiment One, four muscles were consistently active bilaterally, during the early period of step-turning and were: tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, biceps femoris and gluteus medius. In Experiment Two the ipsilateral foot moved before the contralateral foot in 68% of trials towards the left, and 79% of trials towards the right. The onset of head movement consistently occurred before the onset of foot movement during turns towards both directions. The percentage of trials in which the four muscles were active in an anticipatory manner was low bilaterally, ranging from 12 to 38% of trials. Objectives that involved the further analysis of muscles active in at least 80% of trials were unable to be completed. Conclusions: During a step-turning task young healthy adults predominantly move their ipsilateral foot before their contralateral foot. The consistent onset of head movement prior to that of the feet, indirectly suggests that the visual system might influence the temporal onset of the feet. The low levels of anticipatory muscle activity during step-turning suggest that the lower limbs are not involved with the initial balance responses for this task thus making it inherently different to gait initiation and forward stepping.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gait in humans</field><field name="subject">Human locomotion</field><field name="subject">Leg - Movements</field><field name="subject">Leg - Muscles - Physiology</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barriers to strategy implementation: a case study of Air New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tan, Yii  T</field><field name="description">The ability to implement strategies successfully is important to any organisation. Despite the importance of the implementation process within strategic management, this is an area of study often overshadowed by a focus on the strategy formulation process. This thesis concentrates on the strategy implementation process, investigating barriers to strategy implementation. A research framework called the Organisational Minefield was developed to represent the importance of the implementation process to organisations. In contrary to most studies available in strategic management, this research included participants from all levels of the organisation.To identify barriers to strategy implementation, a case study of Air New Zealand was conducted. This involved focussed interviews with 28 participants from the Network and Revenue Management Department of Air New Zealand. Other sources of data such as research articles and secondary company data sources were also used.The findings revealed that: participants from different levels of the organisation have unique perceptions of the implementation process; implementation variables could become roadblocks that undermine the implementation process; these barriers can be overcome if managers are perceptive to the organisation's current situation; and the Organisational Minefield framework presented verified the significance of the role of barriers in the implementation process. The findings add two additional barriers to implementation, namely leadership and power. It was also discovered that the participants acknowledged that these two barriers will impede or enhance the success of Air New Zealand. This was backed by the level of commitment and loyalty shown by the participants, which brought Air New Zealand one step closer to unravelling the mysteries of the implementation process.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic implementation</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Change management</field><field name="subject">Implementation variables</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Touching a sensibility: a photographic exploration of haptic experience</field><field name="creator">Turner, Allen Julie (Jules)</field><field name="description">Touching a sensibility will attempt to locate the exchange when the living body physically touches the world.

Paradoxically, there is also a high prevalence of low birth weight in this population. Throughout life, factors associated with these abnormalities reflect genetic, environmental and lifestyle patterns.World-wide, the Indian population is largely non-meat-eating which could compromise the quantity and quality of the diet in macronutrients (proteins) and micronutrients (vitamin B12). Vitamin B12 has been suggested to increase the risk for the metabolic syndrome (dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension and central adiposity). Factors measured in this pilot study designed to examine the differences between meat-eating and non-meat-eating Indian preadolescent girls were body composition, dietary food and nutrient analysis, physical activity patterns and biomarkers of diet and metabolic syndrome.Six non-meat-eating (9.8&#177;0.9 y) and six meat-eating (10.0&#177;0.6 y) Indian preadolescent girls participated in the two weeks study. Mothers and their daughters in each group had followed the same dietary pattern from birth. Anthropometry, hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance and resting energy expenditure were measured. Biomarkers associated with one carbon metabolism; serum B12, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and folate were measured. Inflammatory markers; high sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were measured. Serum lipids, fasting glucose and haematological parameters were measured. Time spent in sedentary activities and dietary information was extracted from seven day physical activity and food diaries respectively.There was an overall trend towards higher values for the non-meat-eaters as compared to the meat-eaters in body fat percent (29.7&#177;6.6 vs. 29.0&#177;6.2%, p = 0.85), and waist to hip ratio (0.89&#177;0.12 vs. 0.84&#177;0.07, p = 0.37) but the meat-eaters weighed more (31.2&#177;5.5 vs. 33.3&#177;9.6kg, p = 0.65). Compared to British reference ranges, girls in both groups had a higher BF% of 29&#177;6% which was 34 percentile points above the British median (McCarthy et al., 2006) adjusted for age.Both groups spent 21 hours each day in non-moving/sedentary activities. Dietary consumption of vitamin B12 was higher in meat-eaters compared to non-meat-eaters (2.5&#177;0.8 vs 1.8&#177;0.6&#956;g.day-1, p = 0.11). Serum vitamin B12 was substantially higher in the meat-eaters (543&#177;212 vs. 232&#177;95 pmol/L, p = 0.01) with lower serum concentrations of MMA (0.2 &#177; 0.1 vs 0.3 &#177; 0.2 &#956;mol/L, p=0.3). Serum folate was adequate in all girls ranging from 16.5-45.0 pmol/L, which was within the normal reference values. Two non-meat-eating girls were vitamin B12 deficient (&lt;170pmol/L). These differences were associated with high fibre and less protein intake in the nonmeat-eaters (30&#177;8 vs. 20&#177;7 g day-1; 64&#177;12 vs. 66&#177;11 g.day-1).The initial findings in this pilot study provide early evidence that risk factors for metabolic disease associated with body composition, diet and activity are accumulating in preadolescent Indian girls. Imbalance in one carbon metabolism is clearly a factor to be considered. In those with a low consumption of meat and/or animal products, B12 monitoring, dietary recommendations and if necessary supplementation should be considered and where possible intervention before pregnancy (as for folate) be a priority. New Zealand Indian people would be a priority group.It is time for serious action in this area of health so that the risk accumulated through an imbalance in nutrition and physical activity is reduced and the health of those as yet unborn is improved.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pre-adolescent girls</field><field name="subject">Indians</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Dietary patterns</field><field name="subject">Meat eaters</field><field name="subject">Vegetarians</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitor setups for IT helpdesk workers: a comparison study</field><field name="creator">Whalley, Sarah Marie</field><field name="description">In the hectic world of an IT helpdesk with an ever increasing number of applications and tasks on the go, managing the intricacies of how to navigate these is a cause of frustration for helpdesk workers. I had noticed while working on a helpdesk that the workspace area - particularly the monitor setups that IT helpdesk workers have to use - makes doing their job difficult. The number of applications open, the number of tasks on the go at once and the added pressure of customer contact, all call for applications and data to be accessed quickly - but the set up of the users workspace generally does not allow for this. The main objective of this research is to compare the difference between the use of a single screen, a dual screen and the new Multi-Layer Display (MLD) and the complications of having multiple applications and multiple monitors operating at one time for IT Helpdesk Workers. This research looked at how the users' monitor setup influenced the performance, efficiency, satisfaction, ergonomics and learning of the participants.The research showed that there was a clear dislike of the current set up of single screens; all participants felt that the single screen setup limited what they could do at once and it rated the least favourite of all. The dual and MLD screens showed positive outcomes for increasing multi-tasking abilities and raising users' perceived performance and satisfaction levels. The added screen real estate of both the dual and MLD over the single screen meant that users consistently had more information available to them 7which enabled them to complete tasks quicker, monitor other applications for incoming jobs, easily transfer data from one application to another and multi-task more effectively. While there were some minor ergonomic concerns and learning difficulties with the unique features and utilities of the both the dual and MLD monitors, participants still preferred to use these setups over the single screen.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IT personnel</field><field name="subject">Computer monitors</field><field name="subject">Dual screen</field><field name="subject">Multi Layer Display</field><field name="subject">Job performance</field><field name="subject">Ergonomics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/196</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of cyclic loading on the extensibility of human hamstring muscle-tendon units in vivo</field><field name="creator">Dombroski, Erik</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of cyclic loading on the extensibility of hamstring muscle-tendon units in vivo.Study Design: A test-retest randomised controlled trial with repeated measures was undertaken.Background: Stretching has been commonly promoted to increase the passive extensibility of the muscle-tendon units, yet the mechanism behind its proposed effects remains ambiguous. In vivo studies of stretching have mostly been limited to the viscoelastic characteristic of stress-relaxation. Few studies have investigated the characteristic of creep. Animal and cadaver in vitro creep experiments have consistently shown increases in the length of the soft tissues, with associated changes in their resistance and stiffness. These results however, might not be representative of human muscle-tendon units under in vivo conditions. Additionally, those in vivo human studies that have investigated creep phenomenon have contrasting results. To date, no known in vivo study has examined passive cyclic loading of human hamstrings to a constant load level.Method: Using a repeated measures design the extensibility of the hamstring muscles were assessed by a passive knee extension test (PKE) to maximal stretch tolerance using a KinCom&#174; dynamometer. Those participants in the intervention group underwent 45 continuous passive cyclic loadings as the KinCom&#174; dynamometer moved the knee joint into extension until torque reached 85% of maximal passive resistance torque measured in the passive knee extension test. The control group sat quietly relaxed during the intervention period. Measurements of hamstring passive extensibility using the PKE test were repeated at the end of the intervention.Results: Following the intervention, the PKE test showed for the cyclic loading group there was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in both maximal passive resistance torque (mean 23%) and knee joint angle (mean 6.3%). A significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in passive resistance torque (mean 11.8%) when re-measured at the baseline position of maximal passive knee angle was observed. A significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) was found for passive stiffness over the final 10% of the knee torque-angle curve. No significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was found for passive stiffness for the full (100%) of the torque-angle curve. Of the control group, no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) were observed for all variables of the PKE test. Analysis of cycle one compared to forty-five of the cyclic loading intervention procedure showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in both passive knee joint angle (mean 5.2%) and passive stiffness (mean 28.6%) over the final 10% of the knee joint torque-angle. No significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was found for passive stiffness across the full (100%) knee joint torque-angle.Conclusion: The findings of the current study demonstrated that after cyclic loading the hamstring muscles lengthened and became stiffer over the final gained range of knee joint motion. Although the current study cannot determine the mechanism behind the changes in the variables of interest, these findings do provide some evidence that most likely a combination of altered stretch tolerance and local mechanical effects within the muscle-tendon unit, i.e. creep lengthening were responsible.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stretching exercises</field><field name="subject">Knee</field><field name="subject">Muscles</field><field name="subject">Tendons</field><field name="subject">Hamstring muscles</field><field name="subject">Exercise science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of extrusion conditions on "Die Pick-Up" formed during extrusion of aluminium alloy AA6060</field><field name="creator">Peris, Robbie G</field><field name="description">Extrusion is a continuous solid state deformation process which is widely used in the aluminium industry. The demand for aluminium extrudates are growing and extruders are pressurized to extrude products as fast as possible without lowering the quality of the product. Important extrusion parameters and conditions are exit temperature, extrusion speed and alloy composition. It is widely accepted in extrusion industry that extrusion surface defects increase when the extrusion speed and exit temperature are increased for a constant alloy. One of the major surface defects is the so-called die pick-up and it is presently uncertain if increase with extrusion speed (from a low 25m/min) would result in an increase of the number of die pick-up defect.Die pick-up appears like a scratch mark or comet on the surface of the extrudate which damages the appearance. Previous research suggests that second phase particles, eutectic reactions (555&#176;C - 600&#176;C), extrusion process conditions and die conditions may influence the cause of die pick-up. However the influencing factors for die pick-up are not well established.The research started by determining the lowest melting temperature for AA6060 alloy as this temperature limit the highest temperature above which incipient melting starts. This temperature corresponds to the eutectic melting temperature for AA6060 alloy. Eutectic melting was only detected above 610&#176;C and therefore the exit temperature could be increased to a maximum of 610&#176;C. For an AA6xxx alloy system the lowest melting temperature is 555&#176;C if Mg2Si and excess silicon were present. However as Mg2Si may have fully dissolved into the solid solution, no  reaction can take place.A preliminary investigation was conducted to study the characteristics of the newly installed extrusion control and monitoring system. Through this study the relationship between the set extrusion speed and the actual extrusion speed was established. It was found that the actual extrusion speed was lower than the set extrusion speed and was further complicated by the capacity limit of the extrusion pressure. Exit temperature measurements were accurate, however it was measured about 1m away from the die exit. Experiments were carried out to estimate the exit temperature drop and hence the exit temperature measurements were corrected accordingly.Thus, the aim of the present research was to establish the relationship between die pick-up and extrusion conditions (extrusion speed, exit temperature and die condition) and to propose the likely formation mechanism for die pick-up.In this research AA6060 alloy was used and was extruded at 25m/min, 30m/min, 35m/min, 40m/min and 45m/min. The exit temperature was found to increases from 542&#176;C to 567&#176;C. Three types of die pick-up was identified which were named as normal pick-up, die line pick-up and lump pick-up. Normal pick-up occurred regardless of the extrusion speed and exit temperature; however the amount of normal pick-up did not increase when the extrusion speed was increased. Die line pick-up occurred when the extrusion speed was 45m/min and appeared only on the die lines. Lump pick-up is not significant since it was very rare.AA6060 (0.4%Mg and 0.5%Si) alloy has about 0.27% excess silicon and therefore at 555&#176;C, Mg2Si particles react with aluminium and excess silicon to form liquid. However normal pick-up and die line pick-up still occurred at temperatures lower and higher than 555&#176;C and therefore it confirms that eutectic reactions do not influence formation of pick-up. Therefore die pick-up is most likely to be caused due to a mechanical process rather than a metallurgical process.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extrusion defects</field><field name="subject">Die pickup</field><field name="subject">Aluminium alloy</field><field name="subject">Surface defects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening to New Zealand nurses: a survey of intent to leave, job satisfaction, job stress, and burnout</field><field name="creator">Daniels, Anne</field><field name="description">Human and financial costs generated by nurse shortages, within a context of increasing numbers of patients requiring nursing care, demonstrate the potential significance of this study which aims to identify work related factors contributing to New Zealand nurses' intent to leave the job. Two hundred and seventy five usable paper and pencil surveys (Response rate = 68.8%) from a random sample of 400 nurses employed in one New Zealand District Health Board were used to explore intent to leave the job. Three research questions directed the description of levels of job satisfaction, job stress, and burnout found in nurse participants, correlations between the three variables, and the identification of variables predicting intent to leave the job through regression analyses. Levels of job satisfaction were high, job stress was low, and burnout was average. Specifically, lack of opportunity to participate in organisational decision making, control over work conditions, control over what goes on in the work setting (key Magnet Hospital characteristics) were not evident, and with pay rates, were the main sources of job dissatisfaction. Workload was the most frequently experienced source of stress by nurse participants. Twenty-five per cent of nurse participants reported high levels of intent to leave the job. Correlations suggested that reductions in job satisfaction influenced increases in job stress and burnout. Job stress was associated with increases in emotional exhaustion. Emotional exhaustion was influenced by eight job satisfaction, job stress, and burnout subscales. Five subscales (professional opportunities, praise and recognition, interaction opportunities, extrinsic rewards, lack of support) explained 26.2% of the variance in nurse participant's intent to leave. Issues of power and control were associated with job dissatisfaction, job stress and burnout in nursing practice. However, predictors of intent to leave the job suggest a growing realisation by nurse participants that postgraduate education and nursing research may provide the tools to create positive change in the health care environment and make nursing visible, valued and appropriately rewarded.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nurses</field><field name="subject">Job stress</field><field name="subject">Employment</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance appraisal of administrative staff in a tertiary institution: usage and perception</field><field name="creator">Naming, Aileen</field><field name="description">There is little empirical evidence relating to how university administrative employees view the performance appraisal process (Analoui &amp; Fell, 2002).

From the research findings, the researcher prepared a set of recommendations for AUT Human Resource department. The recommendations were intended to assist in making AUT performance appraisals more meaningful and relevant to administrative staff, and foster a better awareness of the benefits of undertaking the process. This study was a partial replication of the Analoui and Fell study undertaken in the UK. Like the study being replicated, this current study was also exploratory basic research adopting a triangulation method. This consisted of the positivistic methodology adopting the cross-sectional survey - structured closed questions questionnaire; the phenomenological methodology using an explanatory case study whereby audio-taped semi-structured interviews were conducted; and the use of researcher (myself) as research instrument. AUT documents relating to performance appraisal were also reviewed. Ethics approval was sought from AUT Ethics Committee. The Analoui and Fell questionnaire and interview guide were modified to suit the AUT context. The sample consisted of 543 staff members. The return rate of the staff survey was 20 per cent.The study found that there was no evidence that the respondents wanted the process discontinued even though comments from those who had been through a Performance and Development Review (P&amp;DR) and Formative Appraisal (FA) indicated a range of both positive and negative experiences. Respondents felt that they were adequately prepared and that they were involved in the pre-appraisal process. In terms of performance appraisal as a motivational tool, few respondents felt that the process motivated them. There was evidence that FA was beneficial in helping with career development. The stated main purposes of AUT performance appraisal were: to assist in administrative (pay increase and promotion), and developmental (training) decisions, with the latter purpose being secondary. Recommendations resulting from the current research findings include: (1) that the current process should be evaluated, and (2) appraisers and appraisees should undertake training prior to an appraisal. On-going research should be undertaken to find out how administrative staff in the wider NZ university sector view the process. To follow-on from the current research, a longitudinal study should be undertaken of administrative staff reactions immediately after an appraisal. Research should also be undertaken to investigate if administrative staff will associate completion of the performance appraisal process which includes the setting of goals with an increased work overload.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Rating of</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breaking the silence: a critical analysis of integrating a community level intervention model within a domestic violence public awareness campaign in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Batistich, Christina</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns domestic violence in New Zealand. Its aim is to help find effective ways of preventing domestic violence in our homes through community level public education/awareness interventions. Domestic violence has a damaging effect within a large number of New Zealand households; the primary aim of this thesis is to contribute research to the efforts in New Zealand directed at preventing domestic violence.This thesis situates domestic violence within both a sociological and theoretical framework as well as within the context of New Zealand public education campaigns. Central to this thesis is a critical analysis of one particular community level public education and awareness intervention that was implemented in the United States throughout the 1990s. The core community-level principles of this US project have been analysed with regard to the suitability of integrating them into a hypothetical domestic violence public awareness campaign in New Zealand (one that would aim to help victims seek appropriate help from their situation).This US community level intervention was called the AIDS Community Demonstration Project (ACDP), its aim being to increase HIV risk reduction behaviours amongst at-risk people within the community. It is acknowledged throughout this thesis that the risk of HIV infection and the nature of domestic violence are very different issues although both are key health issues. However, the analysis of the ACDP was chosen predominantly because of the broad community focussed principles that it followed. The core research question of this thesis is as follows: Are the broad principles used within the ACDP suitable to be integrated into a victim-based domestic violence public awareness campaign in New Zealand? If so, to what extent? If not, why?My critical analysis has been informed by qualitative interviews with key experts in the field of domestic violence prevention in New Zealand. This critical analysis has highlighted a number of key elements in the complex task of domestic violence prevention and discusses the measures needed to sustain an abuse-free New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family violence</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Social Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition knowledge of New Zealand premier club rugby coaches</field><field name="creator">Zinn, Caryn</field><field name="description">In a club rugby union environment, sports nutrition information is frequently delivered to players by the central team figure, the coach. Rugby coaches in New Zealand undertake negligible formal nutrition training to become a coach, and the development of their knowledge base remains their responsibility. There is currently no literature on the nutrition knowledge level of New Zealand coaches. Internationally, literature on coaches' nutrition knowledge and dissemination of that knowledge is scarce. Research to date has used questionnaire techniques to quantify coaches' knowledge. These questionnaires have not been assessed for their psychometric properties. As such, a true measure of knowledge cannot be guaranteed from any of these contemporary studies. Therefore, the aims of this thesis were: 1) To design a nutrition knowledge questionnaire satisfying adequate statistical measures of validity and reliability; 2) To utilise the validated questionnaire to investigate the nutrition knowledge level of these coaches 3) To investigate whether or not New Zealand premier club rugby coaches provide nutrition advice to their athletes and the factors affecting this; and 4) To investigate the factors that predict coaches' knowledge. 	Study 1 involved designing a questionnaire that satisfied acceptable psychometric criteria of validity (content and construct) and reliability (test-retest). It was designed by an expert panel of sports dietitians and distributed to five groups, dietitians, university business staff, and nutrition, business and fitness students, selected for their expected variation in sports nutrition knowledge. Construct validity was high as indicated by significant mean knowledge score differences between the groups (p = 0.0001). Dietitians and nutrition students achieved significantly greater mean scores than the remaining groups. The questionnaire was administered a second time to the business staff and the dietitians to assess test-retest reliability, for which two methods were used. The first method involved a Pearson's product-moment correlation, and demonstrated acceptable reliability (r = 0.74-0.93), aside from the fluid sub-category (r = 0.52). The second, and more robust, method involved a percentage calculation of questions answered in an identical manner on both test occasions. A good test-retest concordance was achieved, with 81.2% duplication of responses of all questions. The findings of this study indicated that the questionnaire was suitably valid and reliable to determine the sports nutrition knowledge of New Zealand premier club rugby coaches. In Study 2, coaches (n = 168) completed the validated questionnaire, received by Internet, linked via e-mail, or (in case of inaccessibility), standard mail. Coaches responded correctly to 55.6% of all knowledge questions. Those who provided nutrition advice to their players (83.8% of the group) obtained a significantly greater knowledge score, 56.8%, than those who did not provide advice, 48.4% (p = 0.008). The study also examined the factors determining nutrition knowledge level. Significant relationships were identified between total knowledge score of all coaches and their qualifications     (p = 0.0001), their own knowledge rating (p = 0.0001), whether or not they underwent nutrition training (p = 0.002) and whether or not they provided nutrition advice              (p = 0.004). It can be concluded that New Zealand premier club rugby coaches are inadequately prepared to impart nutrition advice to athletes and could benefit from further nutrition training.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Rugby football coaches</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealanders making advance directions: a discourse analysis</field><field name="creator">Wareham, Pauline</field><field name="description">Advance directives (ADs) convey consumers' wishes about accepting or refusing future treatment if they become incompetent. The issue of making a particular AD, more commonly referred to as a living will, is the focus of this thesis. The typical direction of the living will is that life-sustaining activities such as the provision of mechanical ventilation should be withheld so that a person may die what is hoped to be a 'peaceful death'. Clearly the whole basis of the thinking behind the recognition of ADs is that patients' wishes should prevail. ADs have been championed by some as a means of preserving both dignity and autonomy at the end of life in the face of increasing medical advances in technology to preserve life indefinitely. ADs are seen as a means of promoting peace of mind in will-makers, of allowing carers and family to honour the person's wishes and of stimulating communication between all involved parties.While at present there is no statutory right for people in New Zealand to make ADs, it is considered they have rights to do so in common law as consumers of health and disability services in this country. Little is known about the views of New Zealanders making ADs or their justification for doing so. This small qualitative study, using a discourse analysis approach after Potter and Wetherell (1987), aimed to investigate how the participants justified making ADs. Six people were interviewed and the transcriptions were analysed identifying three dominant interpretative repertoires and three corresponding subject positions.The findings indicated that the participants positioned themselves: as independent self-determining individuals who knew when they were ready to make ADs after witnessing undesirable deaths of close family members; as judges of knowing when inappropriate treatments lead to undignified deaths; and as concerned parents who want to relieve their families of uncertainty in the future when making surrogate end-of-life decisions for them. Witnessing a prolonged family member's death in the past was a contributing factor to the participants making ADs. The participants' recall of these events led them to make their wishes known in advance so that their families, in turn, would not have to go through a similar experience at the terminal stages of their lives. The overarching motivations for formalising ADs was to avoid having life artificially prolonged by receiving life-sustaining treatments as well as the desire to die a dignified death.This study highlights the need for healthcare professionals to value the importance of advance planning with well adults before they lose the capacity to give informed choices at the end of life. The taking of a values history as part of this advance planning may inform family and healthcare professionals about peoples' general values and at the same time confirm and record end-of-life choices for future reference.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Advance directives (Medical care)</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual abuse prevalence and association with adverse labour and birth outcomes</field><field name="creator">Fyfe, Elaine Maria</field><field name="description">In the past decade there has been growing recognition that a sexual abuse history may manifest during health care examinations. More recently, awareness has been raised about a possible link between a history of sexual abuse and traumatic labour and birth. It is theoretically likely that the intimacy of labour and birth for women with a history of sexual abuse may trigger post-traumatic stress symptomatology. In this cross sectional study, a survey method was used to establish prevalence of sexual abuse and to measure obstetric outcomes, birth experience and birth trauma in a cohort of women who have recently given birth and to test whether there are associations between sexual abuse and birth outcomes. Eighty-five women whose 3&#189; to 5 year old children attend kindergarten participated. Lifetime sexual abuse was found to be a common experience for study participants. One out of every three women disclosed an experience of sexual abuse in her lifetime. A history of sexual abuse was not associated with adverse labour and birth outcomes; however women with a positive sexual abuse history were more likely to report postnatal depression. A quarter of the women had PTSD symptoms but overall, women had positive birth experiences and felt well supported. Many women are able to overcome traumatic abuse experiences and successfully cope with birth, an event that may potentially replicate the dynamics of sexual abuse. Further research is needed to identify women who may be at high risk for traumatic birth experiences. Undertaking screening for sexual abuse in the antenatal period in a safe environment may provide reassurance for women and enable identification of those women at high risk for abuse related traumatic birth experiences.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult child sexual abuse victims</field><field name="subject">Labor (Obstetrics)</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiential learning in journalism education: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">Boyd-Bell, Susan</field><field name="description">Teaching journalism in tertiary institutions presents challenges, including how students learn to work in teams under the sort of pressure that characterizes workplace journalism. This thesis is a case study of how a group of students at AUT University, in Auckland, experienced taking responsibility for producing four editions of a student newspaper as part of their journalism training. Based on a series of individual student interviews, before, during and after their experience, this research suggests that the key factor in their learning was their being allowed, to a large extent, the power to make their own decisions about the appearance and content of their product, while still being charged with the responsibility of ensuring it reached a highly professional standard. The realities of life as a journalist, including recognizing the frequent need to prune, tighten or re-angle stories - even to reject them - and the vital role of co-operative teamwork, unparalleled in their other journalism studies, were driven home.The two tutors, interviewed after the last edition, put some of the student observations into context and provided insights into the discipline involved, as teachers, in maintaining training as a priority, while ensuring production to deadline of a series of reputable and legally safe newspapers.This case study suggests that while there are contrived aspects that cannot replicate a "real" newsroom - such as the students' assignment to editorial roles without the status of real editors or chief reporters - the learning experience resulted not only in advances in the students' technological skills but significant development in their critical thinking about the profession they were due to enter.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Journalism education</field><field name="subject">Experiential learning</field><field name="subject">Problem-based learning</field><field name="subject">Student empowerment</field><field name="subject">Student newspaper</field><field name="subject">Structured interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Commercialising national identity: a critical examination of New Zealand's America's Cup campaigns of 1987, 1992 and 1995</field><field name="creator">Evans, Bryn</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses forms of New Zealand national identity constructed in conjunction with successive America's Cup campaigns in 1987, 1992 and 1995. It is argued that New Zealand national iconography was appropriated by government and corporate interests and utilised as a mechanism for corporate capital accumulation and legitimation.The first New Zealand challenge was set against a background of neo-liberal policy reform initiated by the fourth Labour government in 1984. The comprehensive economic and social policy implementation had multiple negative effects for New Zealand's political economy. This thesis undertakes a comprehensive analysis of these effects and argues that the commitment to neo-liberalism resulted in both the means for a New Zealand America's Cup syndicate and the necessity for an event which could obscure New Zealand's economic decline. National identity was reformulated through America's Cup nationalism to incorporate the values of neo-liberalism.As a result of the entrenchment of neo-liberal values, the needs of corporate interests and state enterprises to define citizens as consumers concluded in the commercialisation of culture. This thesis argues that the pursuit of effective corporate branding strategies led to the appropriation of symbols and images of national identity by corporate interests. The 1992 and 1995 America's Cup challenges represent the convergence of the discourses of sport, media and capitalism under the shared agenda of capital accumulation and legitimation. This convergence was structured around a commercialised conception of national identity which bore little relation to the social and economic reality experienced by many New Zealanders.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">America's Cup races</field><field name="subject">Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Special events</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">Communication studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth participation with local councils: a snapshot of office reflections involving young people in decision-making</field><field name="creator">Peteru, Paul Seilala</field><field name="description">The study incorporates work carried out by the Auckland Regional Child and Youth Engagement Project (ARCYE). The ARCYE project is part of the Auckland Sustainable Cities, 'Investing in Child and Youth Development' (ICYD) work strand which began in 2003 and was completed in June 2006. The researcher interviewed officers of the seven cities and district councils in the Auckland region and the Auckland Regional Council, all of whom had a child and youth focus within their organisation. The interviews examined the drivers for youth participation from a local government perspective. They shared their experiences in engaging youth to participate in Council sponsored or supported initiatives. The objective was to find out what the benefits of youth participation were for Councils and also for the participating youth. The research supports the proposition that for the Auckland region's economic growth to be sustainable, the next generation of leaders, skilled workers, entrepreneurs, educators and parents must be critically involved in today's discourse concerning the region's development. Therein is the rationale for local government to engage young people. The research posits that the 'whole of government' (central government and local government with community) focus on investing in child and youth development is not random. Rather it is a strategic effort to prepare young people to become responsive to their region's growth and development. The downstream benefits may see engaged youth as a captive audience being open to influence from adults. The value or benefit of including young people in decision-making opportunities therefore needs to be carefully considered within a context of young people's apparent diminished status within society. Youth participation with local councils needs to be real: Young people participating and contributing to the improvement of their communities. As a corollary youth rights within an adult-controlled and managed society requires careful monitoring to minimise the exploitation of young people by adults.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Local government</field><field name="subject">Auckland Region</field><field name="subject">Citizen participation</field><field name="subject">Maori Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Triage codes: a predictor of nursing care time in the emergency department</field><field name="creator">Gabolinscy, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis explores triage code as a predictor of direct nursing care time, thus its potential usefulness in a model for calculating and allocating nurse requirements in emergency departments. A framework for nursing work is proposed. This framework is based on the works of O'Brien-Pallas, Irvine, Peereboom, and Murray (1997) and Houser (2003). It suggests that the structures of environmental complexity, nursing characteristics, patient nursing complexity, and patient medical condition and severity, impact on the processes of direct and indirect nursing care to affect patient outcomes. A prospective, non-experimental study was undertaken to examine the relationship between direct nursing care time and triage code. Six potential confounding variables were selected for this study: length of stay, age, ethnicity, sex, complaint type, and discharge category. Data were collected for 261 visits over a three day period in one New Zealand emergency department. Patient visits averaged 200 minutes. The mean direct nursing care time per visit was 49 minutes. On average, patients with more urgent triage codes, longer length of stay, or who were not discharged, received more direct nursing care. The model developed predicted 49% of variation in direct nursing care time (p &lt; .05) related to triage code (16%), length of stay (31%) and disposition category (2%).Further exploration of the proposed framework has potential to develop a model allowing managers to identify nurse staffing required for optimal nursing care in emergency departments.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency nursing</field><field name="subject">Critical Care</field><field name="subject">Methods</field><field name="subject">Nurses instruction</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information and communication technology in Auckland hotels: context and impact</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Ann</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to identify how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) affects business processes and service delivery within hotels and how ICT interacts with strategic issues confronting hotel managers. The areas of exploration were: 1) the business context of ICT; 2) the main role of ICT in day to day business; 3) ICT's impact on service delivery to hotel guests; and 4) the role of ICT in the future.As the study was exploring the General Managers' (GMs) perceptions, interviewing was selected as the most appropriate data gathering method. The sample covered a range of Auckland hotels which differed according to location, size and quality. Semi-structured interviews were used to facilitate the comparison of data between interviewees. Common themes and concepts were identified which were compared to the demographic characteristics of the hotels as well as previous research detailed in the literature.The contextual issues identified were staff availability and retention, competition (particularly price wars resulting from discounting), and location and infrastructure issues. Only half the GMs interviewed identified benefits from ICT in the day to day operation of their business. All of them described challenges or disadvantages posed by ICT. The impact on service delivery to guests was viewed more positively but there were still misgivings about the potential barriers which ICT created. There was a strong view that staff were of overwhelming importance to service delivery. Finally, envisioning the future, ICT was perceived as having the ability to make a strong contribution to business development but this ability would be constrained by staffing problems. Analyses of the findings suggest that ICT has a dual role of gathering management data and providing guest services, and GMs appear unaware of how this dual role contributes to the challenges posed by ICT. Similarly, there was limited awareness of the interaction between human agents in a business, the organisational structures, and ICT.The business implications of these findings suggest that GMs would benefit from being aware of the roles of ICT and addressing the needs of staff for a clearer understanding of how their role, and the ICT that supports it, fits into their broader operation of the business.This study is the one of first to examine the impact of ICT in New Zealand hotels, and, in particular, how this interacts with the broader social issues, and offers insights into the areas of potential conflict and ways to manage the impacts of ICT in hotels.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured interviews</field><field name="subject">Management perception</field><field name="subject">Service delivery</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The modern nomad in New Zealand: a study of the effects of the working holiday schemes on free independent travellers and their host communities</field><field name="creator">Newlands, Kenneth John</field><field name="description">Tourism is often described as having arisen from the Grand Tour of the young aristocracy of the eighteenth century who travelled around Europe for a period of a few years to further their education. Adler argues that, rather than seeing the development of tourism as an evolution from the young aristocracy to the adoption of the tour by the middle classes, the young travellers of today can also be traced back to tramping "a well institutionalised travel pattern of working class youth" (1985, p.335). The modern day Working Holiday is taken by a wide cross section of many societies travelling for a variety of purposes. The Working Holiday Schemes discussed are reciprocal arrangements between New Zealand and sixteen other countries (as at May 2003) that allow young people to work and holiday in each other's countries, for up to a year. The aims of the research are to discover who these visitors are, what work and holiday experiences they have, their motivations for coming to New Zealand and also to compare the intentions of the schemes, as outlined in policy found in cabinet briefing papers, with the actualities of the scheme, as reported by Working Holidaymakers, employers and community members. The study uncovers the background to policy decisions in the tourism / immigration domain. No research has been carried out on the Working Holidaymakers coming to New Zealand or about the policies that support this movement. It will be argued that Working Holidaymakers contribute both as a source of labour to many industries and as significant consumers of tourism product. Consequently this research is of interest to the academic community, government and industry groups including the horticultural and broader farming industry, tourism sectors such as hospitality, accommodation, transport, attractions and activity providers, and to a lesser extent training and educational institutions. The research focuses on the characteristics of a convenience sample of Working Holidaymakers. The thesis is supported by a small case study that explores the schemes from the perspectives of host communities and employers. During the period that the research was undertaken the number of countries involved and the number of working holiday visas increased significantly. During 2005, 36,000 visas were made available to suitable applicants from twenty-five countries. The growth in the numbers of Working Holidaymakers suggests that it is time to review the policy formation about Working Holiday Schemes and challenge the traditional definition of a tourist as a non-worker. Recommendations are made for improving the schemes, contributing to policy decisions and to for a wider interpretation of the term tourist.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employment in foreign countries</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Menace or moral panic? Methamphetamine and the New Zealand press</field><field name="creator">Wallace, Carla-Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis, presented as a collection of articles, journalistic in its tone, is titled "Menace or Moral Panic? Methamphetamine and the New Zealand Press". Within the collection, evidence and background information is presented that supports a claim that a moral panic fitting Stanley Cohen's classic model occurred between 1999 and 2004.This moral panic was also identified using Stuart Hall's definition of a moral panic outlined in his mugging study published in 1978 as well as the more contemporary model of Goode and Ben-Yehuda (1994). Jock Young's theory of The Deviance Amplification Spiral is also addressed and can be applied to this collection when considering the close 'symbiotic' relationship that our press here in New Zealand have with our police force. In looking at this particular subject it is vital that we look at how drugs and drug use play a role in the media. Also as part of the backgrounding for this collection it was of critical importance to find whether a moral panic happened anywhere else in the world in relation to methamphetamine. Two previous moral panics about methamphetamine are featured in this collection as part of a case study presented in "Ancient Anecdotes meet Modernity: Drugs and the Rise of Methamphetamine" in which between the years of 1989 and 1996 America passed through two moral panics brought on to a considerable extent by a mixture of media hype and political opportunism. By including a foreign case study we can begin to see how the New Zealand methamphetamine situation had similarities to the American example, making identification of New Zealand's moral panic more definitive. Giving verification to the claims, a lengthy analysis of twenty-five samples from the New Zealand press is also featured in this collection. By looking at the way the stories from the samples developed identification of the various stages of the moral panic become more visible. The last article in this collection investigates, using expert interviews, if there is enough evidence to support the claim that methamphetamine may be a menace to New Zealand society, but that the extent of that menace may be exaggerated by a moral panic brought on by our media and fuelled by our police force.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methamphetamine abuse</field><field name="subject">Drugs and mass media</field><field name="subject">Moral conditions</field><field name="subject">Deviant behavior in mass media</field><field name="subject">Press</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Where is she? A female manager's place in Australian and New Zealand hotels</field><field name="creator">Mooney, Shelagh</field><field name="description">This study seeks to answer the question of what significant barriers are present for  women managers in the organisational structure of hotels in Australia and New  Zealand that impedes their progress to top management positions. Women seem to be  under-represented at senior management levels in hotel companies and this  exploratory research endeavoured to find out why this is the case.The research was carried out in conjunction with a major international group  represented by more than 30 hotels in both countries. It consisted of an online survey  sent to the hotel group's female supervisors and managers and a series of 18 follow  up interviews. There was a high response rate to the survey and from respondents  wishing to be interviewed. Issues arising from the research included organisational  culture, the Old Boy Network, geographical mobility, role models, and the pathway to  General Manager.The research concluded that for female managers aspiring to proceed up the career  ladder in Australian or New Zealand hotels, it would be difficult for them to combine  family life and career in the same manner as their male colleagues. There were also  negative aspects of hotel culture and organisational practices that disadvantaged  women at various stages of their career life cycle. If hotels companies wish to retain  more women, they need to review whether their organisations consist of 'opportunity  'structures' (Scully 2003) or 'inequality regimes' (Acker 2006) for women.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hotel industry</field><field name="subject">Female managers</field><field name="subject">Organisational culture</field><field name="subject">Career progression for women</field><field name="subject">Barriers for women</field><field name="subject">Australasia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying post-critical approaches to refugee-centred education</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Maria</field><field name="description">It is the existence of trauma and its associated responses that categorize refugees as different from other migrants. These circumstances create significant and complex special needs which this thesis suggests should be addressed (initially) on resettlement programmes. Because of the high vulnerability of refugees as a consequence of previous losses and their exposure to sustained deprivation, empathy must be a primary requisite of teachers who are responsible for delivering these programmes. This thesis enquires whether the teaching methodology and approach for refugee resettlement programmes, however, should entail more than just an empathic disposition and indeed whether educational programmes should seek to address the unique and very special needs of refugees through the imparting of 'critical' skills and strategies. Furthermore, the thesis investigates the various educational theories and approaches that appear to have particular correspondence with the unique needs of refugees.The six-week period at the Mangere Refugee Reception Centre represents a significant moment in the lives of refugees. It is for many the turning point from their traumatic past to a future of hope. During this 'renaissance' period, the Centre for Refugee Education under the auspices of AUT University, offers an education programme for all quota refugees. It is this programme, in particular, that forms the focus of this thesis; however the principles and recommendations have wider ramifications and could (with modifications) equally apply to refugee provision in the wider sector. The broad aim of this thesis is to investigate what it is that refugees need on arrival in New Zealand and the extent to which the content and methodology of the orientation programme offered to refugees can be enhanced to better support and prepare refugees for the transition into New Zealand society. A teaching approach heavily nuanced by the post-structural appropriation of critical theory is discussed and it is proposed that this approach in conjunction with collaborative, participatory and constructivist elements could form a 'refugee-centred approach' which has the potential to more effectively and appropriately address the specific needs identified as pertaining to refugees. An oft-heard criticism of 'critical theory' and its many renderings is that it is 'too theoretical' and difficult to implement. This thesis argues that the post-structuralist interpretation can, indeed translate into practice and suggestions for its pedagogical implementation represent a key outcome of this research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Needs of refugees</field><field name="subject">Resettlement in New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Centre for refugee education</field><field name="subject">Mangere refugee reception centre</field><field name="subject">Critical theory</field><field name="subject">Post-structural approach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the effect of a civics information intervention on the participation of year 13 students in the 2004 local body elections in North Shore City</field><field name="creator">Baillie, Pamela</field><field name="description">Young people in the Western world demonstrate that they have little connection to democratic processes through their increasing absence from the polls at election time. This trend is evidenced in New Zealand where the secondary school curriculum has little content concerning electoral and political processes. Low voter turn-out is particularly prevalent in the triennial local body elections where only a small proportion of all eligible voters participate.This research is based within two North Shore City secondary schools and has two objectives. The first to establish the current understanding of Year 13 students of the local authority, its activities, governance and decision-making processes and the second to assess the effect of this information on the election activity of the participants. Following the provision of this information to the selected classes and after 2004 local authority elections, the same classes completed questionnaires to ascertain whether their participation (voting and non-voting) in the elections was affected by this intervention. A post-election focus group of non-school-based newly eligible voters enabled some qualitative inquiry into rationale and attitudes.The findings indicate a wide degree of ignorance and reinforce the current political situation where young people see no relevance to them of local authority politics. The research highlights the need to engage young people in civic matters and increase their ownership of and involvement in the democratic process.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young people</field><field name="subject">Youth</field><field name="subject">Local government elections</field><field name="subject">Voting</field><field name="subject">Civic participation</field><field name="subject">Democracy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching or being taught: the experience of foreign teachers in China</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Manting</field><field name="description">The research recorded in this thesis examined the experience of eight foreign teachers who have taken up residence in China as teachers of oral English language. The study grew out of my reflections on my own challenging, yet rewarding, journey as an international student in New Zealand, and aimed to investigate and unfold the reality of foreigners living and working experience under the influence of traditional Chinese culture, specifically in Pan Yu district, Guang Zhou City, Guang Dong Province. I was interested to find the cultural differences that the teachers struggled to accept or understand. I wondered whether the foreign teachers would reshape their personal beliefs and values, especially about teaching, because of the cultural differences they encountered in China. A sample of eight foreign teachers, from Australia, America, Canada and New Zealand, took part in semi-structured interviews in which I hoped to capture critical incidents in their inter-cultural experience. I was also able to undertake two observations of classroom practice. The data collected was then analysed using Boyatzis' (1998) system of thematic analysis. The research found that participants had similar experiences during their residence in China. For instance, the majority of participants showed a long period of cultural adoption and they all defined their experience as challenging. All participants refused to reshape their moral beliefs about teaching in response to traditional Chinese culture, but that they all, to some extent, eventually adjusted to a Chinese way of thinking. However, issues that direct connected to their own cultural heritage remained unchanged. An interpretation of the findings was that perhaps, on one hand, while the environment and cultural difference initiated various forms of difficulties, on the other hand, participants are trying to reset their personal limits. Most likely, their desire to introduce their Chinese students to a different style of learning convinced them to hold on to personal beliefs about effective teaching and learning, hoping to pass this on to a new generation of Chinese. My research, however, focused on only very small proportion of foreign teachers in China. Further research should be pursued with an expanded focus, to find the potential of the implementation of cultural awareness programmes and support groups for foreigner.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese education system</field><field name="subject">Foreign teachers of English</field><field name="subject">Cultural differences</field><field name="subject">Intercultural experiences</field><field name="subject">Hofstede</field><field name="subject">Pan Yu District</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Association of ABO, Lewis and Secretor phenotypes and genotypes with Neisseria gonorrhoeae</field><field name="creator">Perry, Elizabeth Holly</field><field name="description">Previous studies of association of ABO phenotypes with gonorrhoea have shown contradictory results. Despite the interdependencies, none have examined the combined effect of ABO, Lewis and Secretor phenotypes. Furthermore, none have used genotyping to confirm phenotyping. This study is ground-breaking in this regard, and illustrates how such an association study should be performed. STUDY DESIGNS AND METHODS: The study examined 175 individuals who tested positive for gonorrhoea, and 211 individuals who tested negative for gonorrhoea. Strain typing was not performed. The following blood grouping methods were performed on the study participants: ABO phenotyping Lewis phenotyping, and genotyping of selected samples Secretor genotyping Chi-square and p values were used to examine whether or not there is an association of ABO, Lewis and Secretor blood group related molecules with gonorrhoea infection. RESULTS: Neither random statistical analysis of data sets, nor statistical analysis of data sets arranged by blood group, yielded a statistically significant association of ABO, Lewis and Secretor phenotypes and genotypes with Neisseria gonorrhoeae that could not be refuted when the data was disaggregated for ethnicity. The study did show a statistically significant difference in the incidence of the partial secretor phenotype (26.7%) in the gonorrhoea positive population and the incidence of the partial secretor phenotype (15.4%) in the gonorrhoea negative population, when all ethnic groups were analysed together. However, when the data was disaggregated for ethnicity, the p values were no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION: There is no association of ABO, Lewis and Secretor phenotypes and genotypes with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Nevertheless, this study still has merit, because, to the author's knowledge, it is the first time a study of these human blood groups with a disease has been performed correctly.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenotype</field><field name="subject">Gonorrhea</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the effect of stretching frequency on range of motion at the ankle joint</field><field name="creator">Trent, Vanessa</field><field name="description">Stretching is a widely prescribed technique that has been demonstrated to increase range of motion. Consequently it may enhance performance and aid in the prevention and treatment of injury. Few studies have investigated the frequency of stretching on a daily basis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of stretching frequency on range of motion at the ankle joint. The detraining effect was also investigated after a period without stretching. Thirty-one female subjects participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to a control group who did not stretch a group who stretched two times per week (Stretch-2) or a group who stretched four times per week (Stretch-4). The stretching intervention was undertaken over four weeks and targeted the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Each stretch was held for duration of 30 seconds and repeated five times. Prior to the intervention (PRE), dorsiflexion was measured using a weights and pulley system that passively moved the ankle joint from a neutral position into dorsiflexion. After the four week stretching period (POST), dorsiflexion was measured once again to determine the change following the stretching programme. Following a further four week period where no stretching took place (FINAL), dorsiflexion was measured to determine the detraining effect. Electromyography was used to monitor the activity of the plantarflexors and dorsiflexors during the measuring procedure. The results of the study showed a significant increase in ankle joint range of motion for the Stretch-4 group (p&lt;0.05) when comparing PRE and POST measurements. The Stretch-2 and control groups did not show significant differences (p&gt;0.05) between PRE and POST measurements. When comparing the PRE and FINAL measurements of the Stretch-4 group, no significant differences were recorded (p&gt;0.05). The POST and FINAL measurements were significantly different (p&lt;0.05). After the detraining period the Stretch-4 group lost 99.8% of their range of motion gains. The present data provide some evidence that the viscoelastic properties of the muscle stretched were unchanged by the four week static stretching programme. The mechanism involved in the observed increase in range of motion for the Stretch-4 group is possibly that of enhanced stretch tolerance of the subject. Further research is required to support this conjecture.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankle</field><field name="subject">Stretch (Physiology)</field><field name="subject">Stretching exercises</field><field name="subject">Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Joints</field><field name="subject">Range of motion</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Ankle joint</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of neck manipulation on excitability of the motor cortex</field><field name="creator">Simmonds, Marian</field><field name="description">Neck manipulation is commonly used in the management of some musculoskeletal disorders to reduce pain and improve movement. There is, however, little understanding about the underlying mechanism. Recent research has alluded to a neurophysiological mechanism mediated through supraspinal pathways in the central nervous system, that may alter motor activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of neck manipulation on the excitability of cortical motoneurons by means of activating corticospinal pathways to the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle in an active motor system using the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique.Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited by TMS and recorded in 20 normal subjects using established procedures. The peak-to-peak amplitude of MEPs were measured both before and after C6/7 manipulation and before and after neck positioning. Both interventions were applied to the normal subjects in random order on two different days. MEPs were recorded immediately after the intervention, then seven minutes and 14 minutes later to assess the time course of the effect. Five neck pain subjects participated in the manipulation experiments. The effects of manipulation, resulting in joint cavitation, were also explored. Two trials were undertaken before the intervention and these served as control measures. MEP data was represented in two ways. Firstly, 40 MEPs were averaged over 120 seconds; secondly, 15 MEPs were average over 60 seconds. A percentage change calculation was used to express the data relative to the baseline. Alterations in cortical excitability before and after manipulation were analysed by repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the MEP data, and percentage change scores.Cortical neurons projecting to FCR were significantly facilitated up to 60 seconds after the manipulation of the non-painful segment, relative to baseline values and the positioning control. A small but significant latent increase in excitability was also observed 15 minutes after manipulation. The response to manipulation of the painful cervical segment was significantly different from that of the non-painful segment. When manipulation of the painful segment did not result in joint cavitation, an inhibitory effect was observed. In contrast, however, cortical motoneurons were facilitated when joint cavitation was associated with manipulation.In conclusion, motor activity is enhanced with neck manipulation when cortical motoneuron excitability is measured by TMS in human subjects performing a voluntary contraction. This may explain the clinically observed improvement in spinal motion and motor control with spinal manipulation. Further, joint cavitation may be important in signifying the success of the joint manipulation. The excitatory effect on cortical motoneurons is probably mediated through a transcortical pathway by means of the activation of muscle afferents with the manipulative thrust.These findings assist in understanding the neurophysiological mechanism underlying the effect of spinal manipulation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neck</field><field name="subject">Manipulation (Therapeutics)</field><field name="subject">Motor Activity</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alienation theory and its relationship to contemporary Arte Povera practice</field><field name="creator">Conger, Elizabeth C</field><field name="description">In this Exegesis I explore the rehabilitation of marginalized materials through a sculptural practice.

Understanding design as an enfolded process of production, distribution, mediation and consumption, three threshold moments are identified as occurring within the European settlement period: the internationalisation of commodity production and consumption; the emergence of import substitution; and the deregulation of the market. While production has formed an element in the design of ceramics in New Zealand, it is contended that greater significance lies in both the trade and the mediation of these commodities and in particular in the way these have influenced local consumer choice. Emerging from this study, a series of key binaries become apparent: between the metropolitan centre and the frontier; between state and business; and between the traditional and the progressive. Likewise, the positioning of design within the institutionalised sites of power-or its absence from them-has been a prime force both in the development of manufacturing industry and in determining the nature of the consumer market.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ceramics</field><field name="subject">Arts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand design history</field><field name="subject">New Zealand material culture history</field><field name="subject">Crown Lynn Pottery</field><field name="subject">New Zealand international exhibitions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's experiences of traditional Chinese acupuncture treatment for threatened preterm labour</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Anneke</field><field name="description">Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of neonatal mortality and morbidity in New Zealand and overseas. Neonatal intensive care is the most expensive item in the national health budget.  The human cost to the child and the family is significant.  In the last twenty five years there has been no reduction in the preterm birth rate despite major advances in neonatal and obstetric care. The aim of this study is to describe and explore the experience of women who had received traditional Chinese acupuncture treatment for threatened preterm labour.  I explore the perception of acupuncture as an effective treatment to stop preterm labour, prolong the pregnancy or prevent preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy, where risk factors are present.  This is a descriptive and exploratory case study using a multiple case study design.  A purposive sample was selected of five retrospective cases of women who had had a previous preterm birth experience and who had used acupuncture for threatening preterm labour in a subsequent pregnancy.  Data was collected from the women using interviews, observations and review of midwifery and acupuncture case notes.  The data was analysed using content and thematic analysis and also principles based on the philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine. The key finding of the study is that the five women at risk all completed a full-term pregnancy. They all noticed that the signs and symptoms usually associated with threatening preterm labour went away when they had acupuncture. They also experienced a number of significant improvements to their general health and wellbeing.  All five were totally happy with the outcomes and the entire acupuncture experience.   When intervention is required, acupuncture based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine appears effective as a treatment strategy in preterm labour.   Few studies have been done in this area.   Further research is needed so that women can be offered choices and healthcare professionals can have confidence in acupuncture as a treatment strategy for threatening preterm labour.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture</field><field name="subject">Labor, Premature</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The smooth + the striated: the home as a locale of cyberspace</field><field name="creator">Lee, Fang-Ching</field><field name="description">The home is a material place of routine and isolation.

I am interested in the home as a locale of cyberspace in regard to the relationship between attaching and detaching, territorializing and de-territorializing, the smooth and the striated. My experimentation is about frozen moments in day-to-day situations. Through experiments with light, materials and installations, I intend to draw out a tactile perspective on cyberspace and domesticity. In terms of materials, I am particularly interested in the residues in everyday life. Light and materials are considered to be tactile as well as visual. Performativity, Heuristics and Active Documentation are my main methodological approaches. My work does not seek to fix a solution, but open up an area of ongoing discovery. The physical makings are the ignition for later developments. Once the installation has been set up, the performativity is transferred to the audience. The surrounding space becomes activated because of the energy released by the audience's engagement. Heuristic use of intuition and informal experience was applied in my working process to discover imperceptible traits of materials and daily situations. Active Documentation helps me to re-consider, re-negotiate, reflect and renew my work throughout the project. In this way, hidden codes can be brought out to the surface.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Home</field><field name="subject">Cyberspace</field><field name="subject">Smooth texture</field><field name="subject">Striated</field><field name="subject">Shifting boundaries</field><field name="subject">Residues</field><field name="subject">Information technology and art</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experience of novice hospital play specialists in their early months of employment</field><field name="creator">Kayes, Marianne</field><field name="description">This study explores the day-to-day lived experience of eight novice hospital play specialists in New Zealand, during the early months following their appointment. Hospital play specialists come from a background in early childhood teaching and work as members of paediatric healthcare teams to support development and coping in hospitalised children and young people. Participants' stories were gathered in face-to-face interviews and were then analysed using an interpretive approach informed by Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenology. Throughout the reflective process of the study, I have sought to show the vividness of the participants&#8217; unique experiences whilst revealing the deeper understandings that lie below. This study shows that experiences as a novice matter to the subsequent development of professional identity as a hospital play specialist. The participants' early impressions of tile world of a hospital are shown in the findings to be those of strangers arriving in a foreign country, struggling to survive and to achieve a sense of belonging. Despite initially feeling lost and vulnerable, they are revealed as resourcefU1 in coping with change, and resilient in acquiring new skills, finding support, building relationships, and adapting their practice. Inclusion within healthcare teams, and recognition of their knowledge and skills by the participants and by their healthcare colleagues, contribute to participants' successful transitions from novice to competent practitioners. There are implications in this study for team leaders, managers and hospital play specialists regarding recruitment and support, such as ensuring that those employed show the flexibility needed for this role and are the11 provided with suitable early information and induction programmes Alongside this is the need for a focus on professional development and improved processes of communication, and inclusion of new staff members within the healthcare team.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Recreational therapy for children</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of heat treatment atmosphere on hardening of surface region of H13 tool steel</field><field name="creator">Au, Dominique</field><field name="description">The cost of an aluminium extrusion die accounts for 35-50% of the total extrusion cost, hence it is important to understand the kinetics of extrusion die heat treatment.  The main objective of die heat treatment is to increase the surface hardness so the surface wear property can be enhanced, which extends the die service life.  Before the die material is case hardened by processes such as nitriding, the material is first heat treated to certain hardness.  Thus the aim of this investigation is to understand the kinetics of carbon diffusion during steel austenitzation because it is significant to steel hardness property.H13 hot work tool steel, a well known material used as a die material for its superior mechanical and hardening properties, was used for the analysis of carbon diffusion during austenization.  Samples made of H13 steel were subjected to four different atmospheric conditions: heat treatment without atmospheric control, heat treatment with stainless steel foil wrapping, pack carburization heat treatment and vacuum heat treatment.  Three treatment time ranges were also applied for the carbon diffusion modelling.  Some samples were further treated by gas nitriding to establish the effect of carbon content on the gas nitriding performance.It was found that decarburization occurred when atmospheric control did not take place during the heat treatment process.  Through the carbon diffusion analysis, at austenitizing temperature of 1020&#186;C, the equilibrium surface carbon content at 1020&#186;C was 0.157wt%, with activation energy of carbon in H13 steel of 20,200cal/mol, and carbon diffusivity at 1020&#186;C was 1.97x10-8cm2/s.This study also proved that proper stainless steel foil wrapping on the heat treating material could restrict decarburization process, resulting in a constant hardness profile as vacuum heat treatment does.  However the tempering characteristic between this two heat treatment methods are different to each other.For the pack carburization heat treatment, it was noted that the samples suffered from decarburization at early stage of heat treatment as carbon monoxide level was not adequate for carburization process.Results from the gas nitrided samples showed that the thickness and the hardness of the nitrided layer was independent to the carbon content in H13 steel.  After 2 rounds of gas nitriding process, further nitriding seemed to have no significant effect on the hardness and thickness of the nitrided layer.  Furthermore, the white layer was not observed in the nitrided samples which were heat treated without atmospheric control.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="subject">Quenching</field><field name="subject">Microhardness</field><field name="subject">Chemical activity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photographic estrangement: the measure of distance in photographic relationships</field><field name="creator">Olsen, Claire</field><field name="description">This research project investigates how estrangement is manifested within the photographic image, and how levels of estrangement establish conditions for the relationships between the subject, viewer and artist.

The images in this body of work tread the line between typological portraits and tentative encounters with strangers. These encounters/images do not suggest personal identity but question what it is to be a photographic subject.

Little work has examined muscle changes that occur with knee joint osteoarthritis. Much of this work has centred on strength deficits, while little work has examined the effect of joint pathologies, such as osteoarthritis, on the fatigue resistance of the muscles associated with an affected joint. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative fatigue-resistance characteristics of the vastus medialis in subjects with and without knee joint osteoarthritis, as well as the ability to predict endurance times in these groups, using high spatial resolution electromyography and a sub-maximal isometric endurance test. Twenty-six subjects with unilateral knee osteoarthritis and seventeen subjects with no known knee pathology were evaluated. All subjects performed initial tests to evaluate maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), voluntary activation levels, and true maximum force (TMF). Endurance time was assessed during an isometric quadriceps contraction at 50% of the true maximum force. Surface electromyography (sEMG) data was collected from the vastus medialis muscle of the quadriceps group during the endurance test. MVC tests showed that the affected leg of the group with osteoarthritis was significantly weaker (p &lt; 0.05) than the unaffected leg. Voluntary activation data showed that subjects with osteoarthritis presented with significant bilateral deficits (p &lt; 0.05). TMF data showed a significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) true potential for force generation in the affected compared to the unaffected leg of the osteoarthritis group. Endurance time data showed no significant difference between groups. Electromyography data showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) between the affected and unaffected legs in initial values of Median Frequency (MDF), Mean Power Frequency (MPF) and Conduction Velocity (CV), the percentage change in CV and the relative rate of change in the frequency band between 5 and 30Hz (FB1). Finally, significant correlations were seen between endurance time and the relative rate of change of MDF, MPF and CV calculated over the initial thirty seconds of the endurance test. There were no significant correlations from either leg of the group with knee joint osteoarthritis.It can be concluded from this study that there are differences in strength measures, and in the sEMG signal collected from the vastus medialis muscle of the affected and unaffected legs of subjects with knee osteoarthritis. It appears likely that the differences observed in the sEMG signals were related to a decrease in the representation of type-2 muscle fibres in the vastus medialis of the affected leg. Furthermore, these changes in the behaviour of the signal appear to indicate an improvement in the relative fatigue resistance of the affected leg in relation to the unaffected leg of the group with knee osteoarthritis.Moderate success was seen with the prediction of endurance time in control subjects in the current work using a short duration (30-second) endurance test. This relationship was not seen in either the affected or unaffected leg of the subjects with knee osteoarthritis. Further investigation utilising different sEMG collection and analysis techniques in this area may improve prediction of endurance time in unaffected and affected subjects.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knee</field><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growing through adversity: becoming women who live without partner abuse: a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">Giles, Janice R</field><field name="description">Abuse of women by male partners is a significant social problem in New Zealand. Ten participating women, whose experiences span more than fifty years, provided interviews focused on their recovery from partner abuse but including the broader context of their lives. Grounded Theory methodology with a feminist perspective was applied in conjunction with Grounded Theory methods. The study identifies GROWING THROUGH ADVERSITY as the basic psychosocial process of recovery from an abusive relationship. GROWING THROUGH ADVERSITY has three inter-related core categories: FINDING A PATH BEYOND ABUSE concerns experiencing abuse and finding safety; GETTING A LIFE is about interactions with the social world; and BECOMING MYSELF involves personal growth and development. In the first of five phases, FALLING FOR LOVE, women commit to the relationship with unexamined, traditional beliefs in gender ideals. When the partner becomes abusive stereotyped meanings of relationship require compliance as the price of 'love', or result in shame and self-blame. In phase two, TAKING CONTROL, coping strategies of resistance and compliance fail. Seeking help for themselves, or the relationship, results in finding other perspectives and new contexts of meaning, prompting participants to overcome personal, social, and safety constraints to separation. Phase three includes the distress and difficulty of SECURING A BASE. In the fourth phase, MAKING SENSE OF IT, participants seek both explanation and meaning for their experience. By the fifth phase, BEING MYSELF, participants have constructed new meaning systems and integrated into wider social contexts. They have become women who live by their own values, without partner abuse.

The vast majority of these studies have been carried out with British and Australian undergraduate students, primarily first year students. These studies focused on specific factors using models of inventories or questionnaires.As a postgraduate student, my interest in tertiary education and my working background as a staff member in a Chinese university has led me to the present research. From my point of view, knowledge is constructed rather than transmitted. Students have their own characteristics in the process of constructing their own knowledge due to their diverse educational and life experiences. Thus, it is not appropriate to categorise them in certain fixed stereotypes. For understanding their learning experiences and exploring the factors which influence their approaches to learning, it is necessary to have interactions with them in order to gain in-depth insights.This researcher used interviews on the basis of an investigation of the factors influencing learning from a sample of postgraduate students in a New Zealand university. The interview data was discussed with participants, other postgraduate students as well as some lecturers within the school. Common themes across participants were identified. In addition, the factors within each participant's interviews were presented to show the unique characteristics of the individual postgraduate students.The findings from this study showed that the influence of students' prior knowledge and learning orientations was important and this supports the literature in this field. The contextual factors which include lecturers, choice and integration of courses, and assessments were found to affect students' approaches to learning and responsible for the variability of learning orientations. Consistent with other studies, work responsibilities, financial problems and family commitments were found to have an impact on approaches. Lecturers' preferred teaching and research styles and students' expectations of lecturers' support were found to be significant factors with regard to students' approaches to learning.This study explored the factors that influence postgraduate students' approaches to learning, especially at the individual level. The findings have significance for understanding students' learning and improving the quality of learning. Lecturers might be aware of the diversity of students' characteristics and adopt appropriate teaching strategies for enhancing students learning. The school administrators and programme leaders might want to create a more positive environment for lecturers' better teaching practices. Postgraduate students in the similar situations may confirm the factors that influence their learning approaches and assume higher personal academic responsibilities for their learning.In my future study, the lecturers teaching conceptions and factors that influence their teaching approaches will be investigated for mutual understanding between lecturers and students. Alternatively, further study might replicate the present research with a sample of postgraduate student in my home country (China) to identify the similarities and differences.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Graduate students</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Locating interiority: text, image, identity, and the domestic</field><field name="creator">Cunniffe, Paula Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates ideas of interiority and thought in relation to the building of self identity.

Small tourism enterprises (STE) lie at the heart of the industry and form a major part of the tourism sector.  Characterised by flexible organisational structures and small size, STE are well positioned to respond to a growing demand for unique personalised visitor experiences.  Information and communications technologies (ICT) enhance access to information, improve the efficiency of business activities and promote networking between businesses, community and travellers at the local, regional and international level.Western Southland is a predominantly rural region in the far south of New Zealand. Promoting the development of a cohesive tourism industry in the Western Southland region will benefit individual operators, their communities and the region as a whole. Using the case of Western Southland, this study explores the profile and characteristics of STE; their perceptions of the value of networking and collaboration, and their attitudes towards and use of ICT.  Also considered are the implications of STE attitudes and behaviour in relation to the New Zealand Tourism Strategy and the New Zealand Digital Strategy goals in shaping regional development.  A variety of business and community stakeholders are part of the broader case study contributing a rich understanding of the dynamics of the region.  A mixed method approach is used to collect data through a series of semi-structured interviews and a survey. Key findings show that limited planned networking is occurring and there is a need to increase STE awareness of the benefits of collaborative activities in order to promote active engagement with other STE.  Existing networks are found to be largely informal and embedded in the social and cultural context of communities.  The level of ICT use by STE varies, and considerable support is required to encourage operators to upskill.  National development goals promote ideals of sustainable communities and businesses, and are aligned with what operators envisage for their region.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism SME networks</field><field name="subject">Small and medium enterprises</field><field name="subject">Tourism strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Tourism business networks and ICT</field><field name="subject">Rural tourism in New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Community based tourism development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of water immersion, active recovery and passive recovery on repeated bouts of explosive exercise and blood plasma fraction</field><field name="creator">Wilcock, Ian</field><field name="description">Optimising recovery post-game or post-training could provide a competitive advantage to an athlete, especially if more than one bout of exercise is performed in a day. Active recovery is one common method that is thought to enhance the recovery process. Another recovery method that is gaining popularity is water immersion. The objective of this thesis was to analyse whether these two recovery methods provided greater recovery from explosive exercise than passive recovery. A physiological rationale that may explain the possibility of enhanced recovery with water immersion was initially investigated. The literature surrounding active recovery, water immersion and passive recovery on strength, cycling, running and jumping was then examined. Following these reviews an experimental study was conducted investigating the effects of water immersion, active recovery and passive recovery conducted after repeated bouts of explosive exercise. The rationale for active recovery post-exercise is that during intense exercise, fluid from the blood is forced into the working muscles due to the increase in mean arterial pressure, which increases muscle volume and decreases blood plasma fraction. Active recovery reduces this exercise induced edema and, with an associated increase in blood flow throughout the body, may increase the metabolism of waste substrates produced during exercise. Researchers have observed this increased substrate metabolism with reductions in post-exercise blood lactate accumulation following active recovery. Water immersion would appear to cause a similar physiological response to active recovery without the need to expend extra energy. When a large portion of the body is immersed, hydrostatic pressure acts on the body's fluids within the immersed region. Fluids from the extravascular space move into the vascular system reducing exercise-induced increases in muscular volume and reducing soft tissue inflammation. Additionally, blood volume increases and is redistributed towards the central cavity, which in turn increases cardiac preload, stroke volume, cardiac output, and blood flow throughout the body. Cardiac output increases in relation to the depth of immersion and have been observed to increase by as much as 102% during head-out immersions. These cardiovascular responses occur without any increase in energy expenditure. If extra-intravascular fluid movement is enhanced, then the movement and metabolism of waste substrates could increase. Observations of increased post-exercise blood lactate clearance with water immersion would support this theory. Most methodologies studying the performance benefits of active recovery and water immersion suffer many limitations. These limitations often consist of the experimental time schedule not replicating what is likely to occur in a practical situation, no isolation of water temperature and hydrostatic pressure effects, and lack of a sport-like exercise consisting of repeated expressions of explosive power. Light-intensity active recovery and water immersion do not appear to be detrimental to performance, but neither does there appear to be enough evidence to claim they are beneficial. Effects of active recovery and water immersion would seem to be trivial to small, with any benefits more likely following multiple bouts of high-intensity exercise and recovery or following muscle damaging exercise. There may be a link between blood plasma fraction and performance, however, evidence is inconclusive. Given these issues and limitations the aim of this research was to investigate whether combinations of active recovery, water immersion and passive recovery could maintain peak power and work during subsequent bouts of explosive exercise. We also investigated whether there was any difference in subjects' blood plasma faction and perceived fatigue between the recovery modes. A cross-over experiment was conducted on seven subjects over four weeks. On the same day of each week subjects performed three sessions of maximal jumping, each two hours apart, followed by a different recovery method. Each jump session consisted of three sets of 20 maximal jumps repeated every three seconds, with a minute's rest in-between. Immediately following the jumping subjects performed 10 minutes of either (A) active recovery on a cycle ergometer followed by seated rest, (I) immersion to the gluteal fold in 19&#176;C water followed by seated rest, (AI) active recovery followed by immersion, or (P) seated passive rest. Jumping was conducted on an instrumented supine squat machine that allowed the measurement of total peak power and total work. Pre-jump, post jump and post-recovery blood was taken and the percentage of blood plasma fraction calculated. Perceived leg fatigue was also measured at these times. Observed differences in total peak power and total work between the recovery modes were non-significant. No differences were observed in the change of blood plasma fraction between the recovery modes or perceived fatigue. One reason for any lack of difference between the recovery modes may have been the brevity of the recovery time. Research that has observed significant benefits of active recovery and water immersion compared to passive recovery have used recovery times greater of 15 minutes or more. Additionally, changes in blood plasma fraction between active recovery, water immersion and passive recovery have not been apparent until at least 10 minutes post-recovery in previous research. Alternatively, rather than brevity, it may be that active recovery or water immersion simply does not provide any benefit to performance recovery. Overall there is a meagre amount of research into active recovery, water immersion and passive recovery. Further research that incorporates a variety of exercise and recovery protocols is required.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise - Physiological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Blood plasma.</field><field name="subject">Aquatic exercises - Therapeutic use.</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical factors that influence staff retention in an acute perioperative environment</field><field name="creator">McClelland, Beverley</field><field name="description">There are a number of factors recognised as significant for nursing staff retention. These include, a lack of organisational care, bullying (commonly referred to as horizontal violence), and high workload acuity. However, there does not appear to be any indication that these factors influence the retention of nurses within the speciality of acute perioperative nursing. A descriptive study using postpositivist methodology and triangulation of methods was designed to answer the question: What are the critical factors that influence staff retention in an acute perioperative environment? Forty-eight (n = 48) perioperative nurses answered a questionnaire in relation to individual needs, provision of nursing care and administration and management. Four (n = 4) nurses subsequently participated in a focus group interview that explored in more depth, the survey data related to the following characteristics: Educational opportunities; Level of workload acuity; Rostering flexibility; Management; Established policies/Quality assurance; Graduate orientation programs and Professional relationships in an acute perioperative setting. Data analysis revealed that &gt; 90% of respondents agreed that these characteristics are important for job satisfaction and influence staff retention in an acute perioperative environment. A sense of belonging appears to be the most important theme that emerged from the qualitative data. Job satisfaction and staff retention are attained when nurses have a sense of belonging in the workplace. To achieve these, nurses need to identify barriers, develop their communication and leadership skills and determine the ideal professional practice model. The themes (Figure 5), "Finding time" and increased "sick leave", in relation to workload acuity are new findings that provide a platform for future research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nurses</field><field name="subject">Supply and demand</field><field name="subject">Surgical nursing</field><field name="subject">Perioperative Nursing</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work life balance: a Maori women's perspective</field><field name="creator">Harris, Ngaire Te Aroha</field><field name="description">Spending time at work, with family/whanau, and communities takes up a large proportion of Maori women's lives. Finding a balance can often be complex and challenging, due to surrounding environmental influences that are continually changing.  This thesis explores those challenges, and considers whether 'being Maori' affects the way they manage their lives around the dimensions of work family/whanau and community.The study interviewed Maori women over 20 years of age, in paid work, and who were active members in two urban Maori communities of Auckland, namely Te Whanau o Waipareira Trust and Manukau Urban Maori Authority.It was anticipated that information gleaned could be used to consider positive strategies to facilitate the better management of their time given the constraints imposed on them by modern existence without compromising their cultural obligations as Maori actively involved in their communities.Overall, it was found that being Maori does have an affect on how the women manage their lives around work, family/whanau, and community. A number of factors are identified that help balance work and everyday life including whanau and community support as well as individual strategies and personal assistance. For example, flexible employers that valued Maori beliefs and culture helped reinforce and facilitate the achievement of this balance. Similarly, quality childcare was invaluable. Further research is suggested as to how Maori women balance competing priorities from community and whanau demands.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paid employment</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="subject">Whanau</field><field name="subject">Urban Maori</field><field name="subject">Community involvement</field><field name="subject">Flexibility in employment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graphic film: a new genre of moving image</field><field name="creator">Sheffield, Adam T</field><field name="description">Over the past three years I have engaged in a search for a form of moving image that would serve as a medium to contain, express and communicate my concerns and ideas. My initial investigations led me to motion graphics but as my understanding of moving image broadened I came to the conclusion that the models I was examining did not fit this genre, they are something new and do not have a definition.  There are conflicting ideas about what the term motion graphics means. For the purpose of clarity, I adopted Matt Frantz's definition as a start point: "designed, non-narrative, non-figurative based visuals that change over time." Motion graphics is often considered a component of a larger moving image work or a filler element between two larger works. For example, the opening moments of a film or television programme, or a swirling abstract that forms a background for an interstitial between programmes. I require a description of a moving image type of that can be used as a guide to making work. Research into the field of moving image work made by designers was conducted with grounded theory employed as the principle methodology. This research has revealed a moving image type that I refer to as "graphic film". During the past year I have identified its key characteristics. I have explored and tested the boundaries of this new genre by constructing graphic film and comparing it to previously defined forms of moving image. The outcome of this project is a comprehensive description of what graphic film is and its ten primary characteristics. This project can serve as a guide for other graphic designers who wish to make work of this type.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion graphics</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Film</field><field name="subject">Construction deconstruction</field><field name="subject">Planar space</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Desperately seeking a national identity : an examination of narrative in the Heartland television series and its influence in defining New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">Smith, Philippa</field><field name="description">Television permeates our daily lives. Ninety seven per cent of New Zealand households have a television set and the average watching time is estimated at 20 hours per week (Grimes and Tyndall, 1999). This exposure to television has been recognised as an important factor in the way we see and identify ourselves as a nation - how we seek to find signs and symbols that construct a shared identity and culture that make us New Zealanders and distinguish us from other nations.Using narrative theory combined with critical discourse analysis this thesis aims to show that, even in factual programmes, stories can be constructed that convey messages of nationhood and belonging, creating and recreating a national identity that present New Zealanders in a positive way and seek to bind them as a nation.Three episodes of the television series Heartland, a popular documentary in the mid-1990s that explored the people and lifestyles in different locations around New Zealand, were selected for analysis focusing on narrative structure, the social actors and the role of the narrator. Critical discourse analysis was employed to look at the connection between language, image and text, and discursive practices as well as the relationship the text has in a socio-cultural context.The analysis found that the programmes followed a similar narrative structure to that of a fictional story involving changes in states of equilibrium that created a sense of concern or anxiety associated with what it means to be a New Zealander. However the subsequent resolution of these anxieties combined with the entertaining role of the programme presenter Gary McCormick and the involvement of social actors, resulted in a version of New Zealand's national identity being represented as a reality through a positive discourse of the population working towards a socially and culturally harmonious society.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National characteristics</field><field name="subject">Nationalism</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heavy metal concentrations in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas</field><field name="creator">Perera, Percy</field><field name="description">Heavy metals present in high concentrations in aquatic habitats are bioaccumulated within the tissues of intertidal organisms. The chemical analyses of animal tissues and sediments provide an indication of bioavailability of heavy metals in the environment. Monitoring of the coastal pollution using organisms is widely practiced all over the world.Chemical analysis of the tissues of Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and river sediments were used in this study to monitor the environmental concentrations, of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc of shallow coastal areas near to the river mouths of Mahurangi, Awaruku, Waiake, Taiorahi and Wairau. All of these river mouths are situated along the northeastern coast of Auckland. Each month, during the period of November 2002 to October 2003, three replicate samples of oysters, and sediments were collected from each of the river mouths for analysis. Three additional replicate samples of oysters were collected separately, in each month in order to calculate the condition index of oysters. Oyster tissues and sediments were analysed with Inductively Coupled Atomic Plasma Emission Spectrometer to detect the concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc.The highest level of copper and zinc concentrations in the oyster tissues was observed in the river mouth of Wairau. Wairau river mouth receives water from heavily urbanised and industrialised catchments. A higher concentration of cadmium was observed in the oysters of the river mouth of Mahurangi than in the oysters in the other sites. The reason for this difference could be due to the heavy use of cadmium contaminated fertilizers at the pasture lands situated around the Mahurangi estuary. Therefore, the relationship between the land use of the catchments and the degree of pollution of the estuarine habitats could be established from the data obtained from this study. Higher concentrations of heavy metals were found in the sediments of Waiake, Taiorahi and Wairau compared to the sediments of Mahurangi and Awaruku. Significantly higher level of copper was observed in the sediments of Awaruku. However no clear co-relation was found between heavy metal concentration in oysters and in sediments. Variations of the condition of oysters were closely related to seasonal changes of the life cycle of the oysters. No clear relationship was found between the condition of the oysters and the heavy metal concentration of the river mouth habitats.This study provides evidence that Pacific oysters are good organisms to use as bioindicators of environmental heavy metal levels in shallow coastal waters. The results of this study suggest a clear relationship between the heavy metal concentration in river waters and the land use of the catchment areas of those rivers. The results may be useful in management strategies of the northeastern coastal areas of Auckland.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oysters</field><field name="subject">Oyster culture</field><field name="subject">Pollution</field><field name="subject">Heavy metals</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acute effects of weight training on softball throwing velocity</field><field name="creator">Sheehy, Kevin M</field><field name="description">The short-term enhancement of physical performance known as post-activation potentiation could be exploited in the design of sport-specific training sessions. The purpose of this study was to compare the potentiation of softball throwing velocity following two kinds of resistance-training session: a control session consisting of traditional heavy-load sets, and an experimental "Pmax" session consisting of sets of loads selected to maximise the mean power output during explosive bench presses.  Both sessions included plyometric medicine ball chest passes.  Eight male softball players of premier grade, with at least 2 yr experience of resistance training, performed the two sessions in a crossover fashion, with 30 min recovery between sessions. Softball throwing velocity was measured with a radar gun immediately before and at 2-min intervals 4-10 min after each session. Percent effects on throwing speed were analyzed via log transformation, and t statistics were used to make magnitude-based inferences with respect to the smallest important change of 2%. The average throwing velocity increased between pre and post tests for both treatments; the average increase was a substantial 2.3% (0.5 to 4.1%).  Throwing velocity after Pmax training was a trivial 0.4% slower relative to that after heavy-load training (90% confidence limits -1.2 to 1.9%). There was a greater change in throwing velocity by 10 min post treatment than by 4 min post treatment; the change by 10 min was 5.0% (3.2 to 6.7%) for the Pmax training session and 5.3% (2.1 to 8.6%) for the heavy-load session. These effects were almost certainly beneficial for throwing speed, but the difference between them was unclear (-0.3%; -3.7 to 3.1%). The mean change between 4 and 10 min for both treatments combined was 5.1% (90% confidence limits 3.6 to 6.7%). The short-term enhancement of throwing performance following heavy-load and Pmax training sets has implications for the design of softball warm-up routines. There is also the potential for softball players to use such training to improve their throwing velocity during games.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Softball</field><field name="subject">Weight training</field><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="subject">Improved throwing performance</field><field name="subject">Post activation potentiation</field><field name="subject">Pmax</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's experience of severe early onset preeclampsia : a hermeneutic analysis</field><field name="creator">Cowan, Joyce</field><field name="description">Preeclampsia is a complex, baffling and unpredictable syndrome. The condition affects the lives of approximately one in every twenty pregnant women. Most cases are mild but some are serious enough to threaten the life of mother and baby. Medical research has yet to identify a cause, and the search for a cure continues. Delivery remains the only method of resolving this dangerous complication of pregnancy and may need to be effected before the foetus has become mature enough to avoid the risks associated with preterm birth. Women's experience of preeclampsia has received little attention in midwifery and obstetric literature. This hermeneutic phenomenological study has been designed to answer the question "What is women's experience with preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation?" Eight women who had experienced severe preeclampsia were interviewed. Their narratives are analyzed to uncover the meaning of the lived experience of preeclampsia from diagnosis to postpartum recovery. Three data chapters reveal some of the ways that preeclampsia reveals itself as the disease progresses. The findings of this study indicate that there are many atypical presentations of preeclampsia and that sometimes early "showing" goes unrecognized. The woman may in fact feel better as the disease progresses. Late diagnosis leaves the woman and her family shocked and may compromise foetal and maternal safety.  Having preeclampsia changes the reality of pregnancy and early parenting for a woman. Emotional consequences are significant and include an increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder. The unpredictable manner in which preeclampsia first "shows itself" is analyzed in the first data chapter and the following two chapters explore the way in which a woman's life may be thrown out of control by diagnosis and management of the disease. Paradoxically, women with severe preeclampsia often lose continuity of care with their midwife at a time when they most need the support of a familiar and trusted professional. Provision of continuity creates a challenge for the midwife when the woman's care is taken over by secondary services. Innovative ideas to enhance the safety and holistic quality of care for women with preeclampsia are discussed.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Preeclampsia</field><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reactive milling of organic compounds</field><field name="creator">Li, Ying Yu</field><field name="description">Persistent organic pollutants are a well-known threat to the environment. Substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated organic compounds in contaminated soil and groundwater can have severe and long-lasting effects on health in animals and humans. There is an urgent need for the development of safe technologies for their effective removal. Originally developed for mineral processing, mechanical treatment by ball milling is an extremely versatile technique for the degradation of toxic compounds. Reactive milling can rapidly destroy organic compounds without producing hazardous wastes. Complete breakdown of the organic molecules is achieved after relatively short milling times. Successful tests were conducted on polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), DDT, DDD, DDE, Dieldrin and hexachlorobenzene with a conversion yield in the of greater than 99% (Hall et al., 1996; Monagheddu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2002; Tanaka and Zhang, 2003; Pizzigallo et al., 2004; Nomura et al., 2005; Bellingham, 2006).In this study reactive ball milling was used to investigate the destruction of two classes of persistent organic pollutants environmental contaminants. The compounds studied are either known environmental pollutants or simple analogues. These were chosen as being representative of pollutants to investigate the pathway using ball milling destruction and in most cases were relatively small molecules so that the intermediates could be more easily identified. The first class of compounds was polycyclic aromatic compounds. Some smaller members of this class such as naphthalene, anthracene were investigated. The second class of compounds were some analogues of environmentally hazardous hydroxylated and halogenated compounds such as chloronaphthalene, bromonaphthalene, 1- naphthol, 2-naphthol and pentachlorophenol under reactive milling using GCMS analysis of the degradation pathway. Destruction efficiencies greater than 99% have been achieved for a number of organic compounds. Several different intermediates have been identified during the milling degradation. There was also some evidence from this study that halogens could be transferred between compounds during milling. The final products of the milling destruction of these compounds are an amorphous carbon residue and inorganic chloride or bromides. It was proposed that large amounts of halogens could be found however the results showed that small amounts detected. At early stages of milling a number of intermediate breakdown products were detected which were destroyed on extended milling. The core objective of this research was to clarify the reaction mechanisms pathways used of more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic organ halogen compounds. This study is a part of a long-term research project on the destruction of toxic organic compounds by reactive milling.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organic reaction mechanisms</field><field name="subject">Organic compounds - Reactivity</field><field name="subject">Environmental chemistry</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Passionate dedication: a qualitative and descriptive study of nurses' and hospital play specialists' experiences on a children's burn ward</field><field name="creator">Isaac, Dorothy</field><field name="description">A qualitative descriptive approach was undertaken to explore the experience of eight registered nurses and two hospital play specialists who care for children hospitalised with burn injuries. The research participants were recruited from a paediatric ward that offers centralised specialty care to children with burns. Collected through face-to-face interviews, the participants' stories were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim using a process for analysis informed by van Manen, (1997b).Emerging out of the data was the over-arching theme of 'passionate dedication' that shows the nurses and hospital play specialists genuine compassion and commitment to meet the needs of the children with burns. The findings of the study reveal that the participant's dedication is shaped and determined by a dynamic process that involves having professional integrity and in-depth knowledge of caring for children and burn management. The nurses and the hospital play specialists have a common understanding of what their role entails and the skills required to provide quality care and support to the children and the children's family. On a personal and professional level the participants encounter several challenges in this care context that are physically and emotionally overwhelming. Despite becoming overwhelmed the participants are revealed as being resourceful and resilient in their aptitude to find ways that enable them to cope and get through.This study supports international literature that suggests that caring for children with burns is equally rewarding, as much as it is physically and emotionally demanding. The implication in this study for the organisation is to seriously consider issues regarding productivity and efficiency of the workforce with acknowledgement that nurses and hospital play specialists cannot do this emotional work without effective systems of support in place. With the help of team leaders, managers and educators, the organisation will need to consider ways to monitor the job satisfaction of their staff. Furthermore, reinforce existing comprehensive measures, such as mentorship and clinical supervision programmes to encourage the retention and well-being of all staff, at all stages of their career on the children's burn ward.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paediatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Play specialists</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Burns</field><field name="subject">Qualitative methodology</field><field name="subject">Descriptive study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PTCR effect in La2CO3 doped BaTiO2 ceramic sensors</field><field name="creator">Puli, Venkata Sreenivas</field><field name="description">The positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (PTCR) sensors is resistor materials that undergo a sharp change in resistivity at a designed Curie temperature due to its unique structure and chemical composition.

Two batches of samples were fabricated at low and high sintering temperatures of 1100&#176;C, 1350&#176;C respectively. The effect of different concentrations of donor dopant on BaTiO3 on the electrical properties of Ba(1-x)LaxTiO3 with x= 0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.0025, 0.003 mol%, is investigated at low sintering temperature. The influence of lantanum doping with Al2O3+SiO2+TiO2 (AST) as sintering aids on the electrical properties of Ba(1-x)LaxTiO3 with x= 0.0005, 0.001, 0.003 mol%, is also investigated. The results of the electrical characterization for the first batch of samples showed an increase in room temperature resistance with increaisng donor concentration. Also the results of the electrical characterization for the second batch of samples also showed the same increase in room temperature resistance with increasing donor concentration. For first batch of sensors the high room temperature resistance keeps the jump small and these materials showed V-shaped NTCR-PTCR multifunctional cryogenic sensor behavior with a strong negative coefficient of resistance effect at room temperature.Where as the second batch of sensors showed few orders of magnitude rise in resistivity values. The La-doped BaTiO3 ceramics co-doped with Mn gives an enhanced PTCR effect which can be exploited for various sensor applications.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ceramic materials - Thermal conductivity</field><field name="subject">Ceramic materials - Electric properties</field><field name="subject">Ceramic materials - Thermal properties</field><field name="subject">Electric conductivity</field><field name="subject">Electric resistance</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PR, journalism and democracy: how individuals might guard themselves against the manipulation of public opinion</field><field name="creator">Macmillan, Robert</field><field name="description">This thesis is a series of four articles examining the interface of public relations and journalism and how this affects the information the public receives as news. The central research question it aims to answer is: 'How can the public guard against manipulation of opinion?' The articles are accompanied by an exegesis which explains the research process and the role of important sources in the project. The research draws on relevant literature as well as interviews with people involved in public relations, journalism and academia.The first article Public Relations &amp; Democratic Society looks at the various definitions of public relations and examines the debate over whether PR operates in the public interest. Article two, The Production of News, discusses the interface of public relations and journalism and also deals with the economic considerations affecting mass media outlets. PR Under the Spotlight in New Zealand, the third article, is a case study of a public relations campaign mounted by state-owned logging company Timberlands West Coast Ltd. The final article Navigating the Information Environment examines the current state of the interface between PR and journalism in New Zealand and sets out suggestions for how members of the public can avoid being manipulated.The research found that in order to prevent manipulation it is up to members of the public to actively seek truth and not uncritically accept information received through the media. Due to the work of the public relations industry and the media there are many ways in which information can be filtered and massaged and it is knowledge of these processes that puts the public in the best position to see reality.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Propaganda</field><field name="subject">Press and propaganda</field><field name="subject">Mass media - Political aspects</field><field name="subject">Journalism - Objectivity</field><field name="subject">Public opinion</field><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of variable fluid-properties plate heat exchanger for educational purposes.</field><field name="creator">Protheroe, Michael</field><field name="description">In this thesis a novel computer based model is developed which accurately simulates the operation of a plate heat exchanger (PHE).

This qualitative study has been conducted to answer the question: "What are midwives' experiences of keeping birth normal within a secondary care setting?" van Manen's (1990) hermeneutic thematic analysis was the method used to analyse the data generated from this study. Eight "core" or hospital-based midwives were interviewed. The interviews were tape recorded and transcribed into text and were analysed to come to a deeper understanding of the research question. There are three data chapters that reveal the themes that emerged from the data: "Being a midwife 'is' keeping birth normal", "Stepping back and stepping in" and "Interacting with the doctor". The findings of the study revealed that seeing, knowing, and believing in normal birth leads to an embodied sense of "being" that infuses the way midwives practise. This knowledge needs to be passed on to junior midwives. Midwives judge when to use technology and intervention and the appropriate timing of intervention. The Relationships between medical practitioners and midwives is a key to keeping birth normal. Ultimately, it is through teamwork that normal birth is safeguarded. The midwives in this study demonstrate a quiet yet determined courage to constantly question the decisions that might take away from the "normal" experience. They do not say that intervention is not necessary, but question the appropriate use of intervention. This questioning keeps normal birth a possibility.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwives</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">G&#257;patia i Fa'anoanoaga'</field><field name="creator">Young, Loretta</field><field name="description">G&#257;patia i Fa'anoanoaga is a general Samoan expression which literally means 'burden with sadness', which encompasses all aspects of loss and grief in relation to the burden of obligation to reciprocity. This project has functioned as lightening the load of the burden of grief and loss through the process of making an art installation exploring a migrant Samoan experience.My project is concerned with the exploration of Samoan matters of cultural significance such as heritage, religion, identity and family, in particular those customs pertaining to deaths and funerals. The mores and values implicit in these reflect the fundamental aspects of obligation and reciprocity in Samoan life and society. As a Samoan-born and New Zealand raised woman, my work and explorations tended to engage with the challenges of disrupting boundaries formed around ideas of cultural appropriation and cultural authenticity.Therefore this project investigates my position as a migrant Samoan living in New Zealand exploring notions of mobility and globalisation and the effects on the obligation to reciprocity through practical art means. Importantly my art practice intends to explore and position the installation of contemporary materials to speak metaphorically about my identity and issues significant to the obligation to reciprocity in the fa'aSamoa (the Samoan way or in the manner of the Samoans; according to Samoan customs and traditions) particularly the concept tautua aiga (tautua means functions or any service performed in order to support aiga or family)Conceptually my work addresses and brings forth for consideration the impact of mobility and globalisation on cultural issues and practices.

Peer review is a professional activity where one health practitioner evaluates the practice of another. Accordingly, much professional effort has been expended on developing peer review systems and implementing review processes, yet the benefits of peer review are uncertain. A changing legislative environment where producing evidence of ongoing professional development is required, has provided impetus for this study given the limited research to support the use of peer review in this context. While the literature identifies competing focuses on professional development and accountability, there is lack of clarity about which model of peer review is being implemented in this country and which might serve the profession better. This study is a first step in clarifying the issues by identifying the personal, professional and organisational factors that influence health professionals' participation in peer review. The methodology consisted of a qualitative descriptive approach situated within a post positivist paradigm. Seven physiotherapists working in the New Zealand health system who had participated in a peer review process within the last 3 years participated in this study. Semi structured interviews were conducted, guided by broad questions relating to central themes identified during an extensive literature review. Interviews were then audio taped and transcribed verbatim to form the data. Transcripts were analysed by assigning content labels to units of text that seemed to encapsulate one complete thought or idea. The labelled groups were analysed into sub themes. Finally, the general themes that arose were described. Findings indicate that while peer review systems have been developed and are carried out as prescribed, therapists lack clarity about the intended outcomes. While recognising the benefits of receiving feedback on practice, many manage the review process to maintain positive working relationships and ensure their practice is favourably reviewed. The strategies they employ and the consequences of managing peer review in these ways are described. Current peer review processes in New Zealand do not provide reliable information about competence to practice. Neither do they fully achieve their potential as a professional development tool. Therefore, the professional emphasis and effort on peer review needs to be revisited. The findings highlight the need for consultation amongst individual physiotherapists, physiotherapy managers, physiotherapy professional organisations, and the registration board, to negotiate whether regulatory or professional development needs will drive peer review processes in New Zealand in the future.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative descriptive</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Peer review</field><field name="subject">Quality assurance</field><field name="subject">HPCA</field><field name="subject">Professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the academic writing problems of New Zealand-born Samoan students in tertiary institutions</field><field name="creator">Fanene, Naila</field><field name="description">Academic success is clearly linked to one's ability to write well. Given this close link between the two and the poor academic record of Pacific Island students within mainstream education in New Zealand, it is surprising that very little research has been undertaken to examine the academic writing problems of Pacific Island students. This emancipatory, critical study focused on tertiary students who identified as New Zealand-born Samoan. Since Samoans constitute half the Pacific Island population in New Zealand, New Zealand-born Samoan participants were chosen as being representative of this larger group. They were also chosen because they represented a group of New Zealanders identified as disadvantaged in terms of their largely low socio-economic status and poor academic achievement levels.The theoretical framework for this study is grounded in Bernstein's critical theories on communicative and teaching practices in mainstream education which disadvantage minority students from working class communities. These theories are discussed in conjunction with a general review of relevant literature in Chapter 2. The Samoan researcher in this study has added an inter-generational commentary to some of the views and experiences of school and Samoan homelife in New Zealand of participants, firstly from the perspective of her own first-hand experiences of school and Samoan homelife in the 50s and 60s and secondly from the perspective of an experienced English language teacher in New Zealand tertiary institutions.This study used a triangulation approach to enhance reliability and validity of quantitative and qualitative data collected. Three data collecting instruments were used: a written questionnaire, face-to-face interviews, and students' actual essay assignments. A written questionnaire was completed by 14 students who identified as NewZealand-born Samoan. A case study approach was then used with a sub-group of five students, representative of the original 14, who were interviewed more closely in the following areas of interest which emerged through the questionnaire: students' perceived and actual academic writing skills, communicative and teaching practices of high school and tertiary teachers, students' learning strategies, the role and effectiveness of Pacific Island support staff and programmes and the impact of the cultural and communicative practices of Samoan parents in traditional, bilingual Samoan homes on students' academic performance and success in the formal learning environment. The impact of factors such as poor self-motivation and time-management skills, inadequate reading skills and a lack of understanding of and exposure to the academic discourses of the formal learning environment, on the academic writing problems of the participants in this study, were also examined.Teaching methods which perpetuated rote learning practices amongst students were reported by participants in this study from both low and middle-decile high schools. The communicative and teaching practices of Pacific Island teaching staff were also examined in this study. Relevant data from the one-to-one teaching sessions with participants were also included as part of this study. The face-to-face interviews and one-to-one teaching sessions were tape-recorded.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academic writing</field><field name="subject">Tertiary students</field><field name="subject">New Zealand-born Samoans</field><field name="subject">Quantitative</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Pacific Island teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power output of America's Cup grinders can be improved with a biomechanical technique intervention</field><field name="creator">Pearson, Simon</field><field name="description">Grinding set-up in America's Cup sailing provides the power behind tacking and gybing, where the yacht crosses the wind to change direction. Grinding is also used for trimming the sails, which changes the angle on which the yacht is headed. This study provided a descriptive biomechanical overview of grinding on an America's Cup class yacht, and experimentally evaluated the influence of technique instruction on backward grinding performance. Inter-subject differences in body position (technique) throughout the grinding cycle, the ability to alter grinding technique within an eight-day technique intervention period, and the effect of technique on grinding performance as determined by power output were assessed. The quasi-experimental design, in which each of eleven Team New Zealand America's Cup grinders served as their own control, assessed four trials of backward grinding at baseline and post-biomechanical technique intervention testing sessions. Each trial was a maximal effort performed against a high load (250 W) and sustained over a period of eight seconds. Sagittal plane video was used to analyse joint kinematics (elbow, shoulder, trunk, hip, knee, ankle angles and joint centre positions) and to calculate the centre of body mass relative to the grinder pedestal. Height, weight, and limb lengths were obtained from each grinder using the ISAK protocol. Current backward grinding technique employed by the majority of grinders did not optimally use biomechanical principles. Recommendations for improvement were specific to each individual but focused on lowering trunk position and distancing the trunk from the grinding pedestal. Real-time visual feedback was provided to the grinder operators with the main focus being the position of their hip joint (viewed in the sagittal plane), and lowering the shoulder to be vertically level with the apex of the grinding handle cycle. During the intervention the grinders were given added correctional instruction relating to their body position according to perceived technique requirements. Recommendations were based on biomechanical principles regarding body position, and how body position could be altered to optimise the contribution of body weight and force production by the muscles of the upper limb in order to improve the torque applied to the handles. Altering grinding technique according to biomechanical principles produced 4.7% (p = 0.012) greater power during five seconds of grinding performance. Muscular strength, when measured using a 1RM bench pull (116.4 &#177; 9.8 to 117.3 &#177; 10.3), was unaffected by the intervention program, thus not contributing to the increased power output observed during grinding. Moderate changes to body position were observed after the eight-day intervention. Forward lean of the trunk decreased from 25&#176; to 17&#176; (p = 0.028) due to a lower hipy position (-0.09 m to -0.16 m below hub, p = 0.019). The more vertical trunk alignment resulted in the shoulderx position being further from the hub (0.33 m to 0.41 m, p = 0.013), producing a greater line of pull due to a more efficient shoulder vector angle (47&#176; to 36&#176;, p = 0.009). Variability (standard deviation and confidence intervals) decreased in all but four kinematic measures (which exhibited no change) indicating improved consistency in grinding technique. Regression analysis indicated the best predictors for high-load backward grinding performance were COMx position relative to the grinding pedestal and maximal strength. Changes in COMx position explained 40% (p = 0.166) of the variation in grinding performance, while maximal strength showed a relationship of 0.23% (p = 0.144) increase in performance per kilogram of bench pull 1RM. A one standard deviation difference in maximal strength altered the effect of COMx position by 0.26% per centimetre (p = 0.008). Weaker predictive factors were body weight, standing height, and pull angle, while brachial index did not appear to have any substantial influence on backward grinding performance. For future research greater subject numbers should enable more conclusive findings, especially in terms of the technique mechanisms and their relative levels of influence on performance.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">America's Cup</field><field name="subject">Sailing</field><field name="subject">Yacht racing</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Sport Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hyphenated living: between longing and belonging, an exposition of displacement as liminality in the transnational condition</field><field name="creator">van Dyk, Yoka A J</field><field name="description">This thesis explores a complex concept of home with respect to issues of belonging and displacement from both a personal and transnational1 perspective, which deals with the here in New Zealand and there in the Netherlands. Through the visual and the poetic, in printmaking, book art, digital photography and installation--drawing on auto-biographical experiences of migration, as well as contextual research--I have been investigating the concept of "home" as a hyphen. This hyphen motif aptly performs the migrant condition of between here and there, a liminal space of betweenness and transition, where internal and external worlds, here and there, past and present, intersect. This intersection point, marked by hyphenation, always performs across multiple borders and thereby emphasises a spatial-temporal liminal register experienced by many transnational. In textual practice a hyphen is a punctuation sign that connects and separates two different entities. As such, here the hyphen begins to evoke an interesting spatial-temporal paradigm for transnational, who are placed between two or more divided geographies, sociographies and cultural identities. As well as being a link between multiple series of dual entities and conditions, the hyphen can simultaneously signify an ambiguous area of liminality--a psychological space of neither here nor there, an undecidability of identity and belonging, which, on various levels, is symptomatic for many transnational. This project explores how this hyphenated position influences a sense of identity and belonging and its relation to our postmodern world.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Modern art</field><field name="subject">Netherlands</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Emigration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of diet and physical activity on the markers of oxidative stress</field><field name="creator">Migriauli, Lela</field><field name="description">Lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, cancer, type 2 diabetes are the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The prevalence of these diseases is high in New Zealand as well. It is believed that promoting a healthy diet and increased physical activity can make beneficial changes and extend the healthy life expectancy. This twelve week study with follow-up at 52 weeks was designed to demonstrate if a diet and physical activity group intervention in the workplace would result in changes in risk factors for antioxidant damage and therefore reduce the risk for lifestyle diseases. The effect of the addition of kiwifruit to the diet on markers of oxidative stress was also measured in a crossover sub study within this study. Fifty two healthy subjects (male 24, female 28, mean age 46), completed the 12 week study with measurements points being at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Thirty eight subjects presented for another set of measurements at 52 weeks. The intervention started at week 3 and the kiwifruit crossover treatment was launched between weeks 6 and 12.Ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay was utilized to measure the changes in plasma antioxidant activity(AOA) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay to measure the changes in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), as a marker of lipid peroxidation (LP) at each measurement point. Since almost all participants had a normal range of baseline measurements of plasma AOA and LP (plasma MDA), they were categorized as relatively low and high AOA (1200micromol/L cut off point) and LP groups (1.70mmol/L cut off point), as well as divided into male and female groups. The effect of changed diet and increased physical activity during the 12 week study period resulted in a significant increase (P&lt;0.05) in plasma AOA. The changes were much higher in low AOA group (P=0.005) and in male subjects (P&lt;0.005), while no changes were observed in subjects with already high AOA at baseline. The increased plasma AOA level was maintained and increased even more over the year. No changes were observed in LP (plasma MDA). The effect of kiwifruit on the markers of oxidative stress was modest, the 3-week daily kiwifruit consumption (2-3 kiwifruit per day) resulted in significant increase (P=0.01) in plasma AOA only in female subjects within the low AOA group. However, the precision and validity of the measurements were limited by a possible loss of vitamin C due to storage of the plasma samples rather than analysis when fresh. Given that kiwifruit is particularly high in vitamin C the effect of the addition of kiwifruit to the diet might not have been detected. In this study it was shown that a group diet and physical activity intervention within the workplace can increase the level of plasma antioxidant activity and thereby reduce the risk for oxidative stress and related lifestyle diseases.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lifestyles</field><field name="subject">Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Physical fitness</field><field name="subject">Oxidative stress and disease</field><field name="subject">Oxidative Stress</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The kinematic, kinetic and blood lactate profiles of continuous and intra-set rest loading schemes</field><field name="creator">Denton, Jamie</field><field name="description">The optimisation of strength and power through resistance training has been the source of debate amongst health professionals and researchers for many years. As resistance training involves the repeated activation and contraction of skeletal muscles, continuous training will ultimately result in a failure to sustain the training intensity especially when performing multiple sets and / or repetitions. Therefore the prescription of rest periods within the training session becomes an important consideration. Relatively short rest periods (60-90 seconds) have been traditionally used for the maximal strength adaptation involving increases in the cross-sectional area of the muscle, whereas longer rest periods (180-300 seconds) have traditionally been used for the maximal strength adaptation involving enhancement of neural function and maximal power adaptation. However, there is very little scientific evidence to support these current practices. In fact, the effect of different rest periods on maximal strength and power development has received very little research attention. Additionally, research that has been conducted in this area has been typified by a number of methodological inconsistencies, within and between studies, which confound scientific understanding. Although traditionally resistance training has employed continuous training schemes with inter-set rest periods, intra-set rest training methods which distribute rest intervals between groups of repetitions have also been investigated. It has been theorised that the short rest periods within the training set allow partial resynthesis of the intramuscular phosphocreatine stores, potentially allowing an athlete to increase their training volume by training at high intensities for longer durations, or performing additional repetitions (Berg, 2003). This is thought to lead to an increased exposure of the muscle to the kinematic and kinetic stimuli thought important for strength and power adaptation whilst minimising performance-inhibiting metabolic accumulation and substrate depletion. However, research into intra-set rest training schemes is still in its infancy, and many of the theories surrounding intra-set rest training are currently unsubstantiated. It is thought that examinations of the acute kinematic, kinetic and blood lactate profiles of continuous and intra-set rest training schemes may enhance scientific understanding regarding the efficacy of intra-set rest training. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the acute kinematic, kinetic and blood lactate responses to continuous and intra-set rest loading schemes. Nine male subjects performed an isoinertial Smith machine bench press task (6RM load) with a continuous loading scheme (CONT), an intra-set rest loading scheme equated by total rest time, volume and load (ISRV) and an intra-set rest loading scheme equated by total rest time and load (ISRR). The order of the loading schemes was assigned in a block randomised order with a minimum of 48 hours recovery between each testing session. Attached to the bar of the Smith machine was a linear position transducer that measured vertical displacement with an accuracy of 0.01cm. Displacement data was sampled at 1000Hz and collected by a laptop computer running custom built data acquisition software. Finger prick blood lactate samples were taken from the non-dominant hand using sterile techniques at the following time points: pre-exercise (Pre), immediately post-exercise (P0), five (P5), fifteen (P15) and thirty minutes (P30) post exercise. Blood glucose samples were taken pre-exercise only. It was observed that manipulating the rest period, by increasing the frequency but decreasing the length of each rest period, did not significantly influence the kinematics and kinetics associated with resistance training, but did have an effect on the post-exercise blood lactate response when the load, rest duration and training volume was equated (ISRV). This finding may be of practical significance if fatigue is important in strength development or conversely if power training needs to be performed with minimal fatigue. It was also observed that increasing the frequency of the rest period enabled the subjects to perform a greater number of repetitions (ISRR), resulting in significantly greater kinematics, kinetics and blood lactate accumulation. It may be speculated, therefore, that ISRR training may offer a superior training stimulus for the development of maximal strength and hypertrophy than CONT training methods, as ISRR loading increased the exposure of the muscle to the kinematic, kinetic and metabolic stimuli thought important for the development of these qualities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood lactate</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Kinetics</field><field name="subject">Exercise Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing employee customer service interpersonal exchanges in the hospitality industry: a New Zealand hotel case study</field><field name="creator">Goodsir, Warren</field><field name="description">The continued growth of service industries and the development of the experience economy has highlighted the need for employees to have extensive social and interpersonal skills. The need for employee interpersonal skills is further emphasised by the extensive interaction between employees and customers, during the provision of customer service, in full service hotels. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the customer service environment, management expect that a consistent level of service will be maintained, while customers desire a unique experience that meets or exceeds their individual expectations. To ensure that both the needs of the organisation and customers are consistently met, management control of employee actions and behaviours is required.The aim of this study was to identify how hotel organisations and managers control employee interpersonal interactions with customers. The research also sought to identify the interpersonal and emotional capabilities employers require from employees to meet the needs of customers and present the desired corporate image. A qualitative, case study, research methodology was applied to understand the expectations of managers, the issues concerning managing employee interactions with customers, perceptions of employee capabilities, and beliefs about current management control strategies in a hotel environment. The research was conducted at four hotel properties belonging to one international hotel group. The data gathering methods included semi-structured interviews, documentation review and field notes.The research concluded that effective alignment of employee and management goal congruence first requires the alignment of managers' goals to the organisation. To ensure management's expectations, customers' expectations and employee actions and behaviours are aligned, management must also have a sound understanding of the organisation's brand and desired image. Cultural and social control mechanisms were found to be important, as they provided a consistent method of aligning employees' behaviour with the goals and expectations of management. The development of social cohesion and norms, through serial and investiture socialisation mechanisms, also helped to create self-managing teams that reinforced the goals of management. The study suggests that, due to the increasing diversity of the stakeholders' views and goals, some of the traditional management perspectives of hospitality may need to change to meet the needs of contemporary employees.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer service</field><field name="subject">Management control</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal</field><field name="subject">Customer orientated behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of physiotherapy and RICE self treatment advice for early management of ankle sprains</field><field name="creator">Lopes, Justin</field><field name="description">Ankle sprains are one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries.  Physiotherapy treatment and advice to rest, use ice, use compression, and elevate the ankle (RICE advice) is believed to speed up the functional recovery and enhance healing associated with acute ankle sprains.  However, there is limited evidence to support the efficacy of RICE treatment.  This study investigated whether physiotherapy (including RICE advice) was as effective as RICE advice alone in improving the time to recovery in a clinical situation.The evidence for RICE advice was reviewed along with the different treatment modalities currently used by physiotherapists in New Zealand for acute ankle sprain.  This review highlighted the low number and poor quality of studies investigating RICE and early intervention physiotherapy management for ankle sprains.  RICE principals appear to be relatively inexpensive and somewhat effective for pain relief and may reduce further tissue damage in the acute stage of Grade I and II ankle sprains.  Evidence extrapolated from studies investigating the use of post surgical ice appears to support the use of ice in the acute stage of an ankle sprain to minimise bleeding and oedema.  The intermittent application of ice is more effective for pain relief in the acute phase than sustained icing.  Physiotherapy interventions such as TENS for pain relief and bracing for the support of Grade II - III ankle sprains have been shown to be beneficial for pain relief in the acute phase.  A need for further high quality, randomised controlled trials (RCT's) was identified.Subsequently a RCT was conducted with 28 participants to investigate the difference between (a) early intervention physiotherapy management combined with RICE advice, and (b) self management RICE advice without physiotherapy.Twenty eight individuals (males n = 22, females n = 6), between the ages of 16 and 40 with acute ankle sprains, who met the inclusion criteria, were approached by physiotherapists working on this project and invited to participate.  Dependant variables were pain, function, swelling, compliance and medication use up to Day 11 post injury.  Swelling, pain and function were measured over three assessments on Days 1, 3 and 11, using volumetric analysis, a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a functional question derived from a validated functional questionnaire respectively.  Medication use and compliance were elicited from information gathered in a participant home diary. Both groups were similar on Day 1 in respect to their initial pain, swelling, the number of participants who were referred for X-rays, and the time taken to present to the physiotherapist.  However the RICE group had significantly higher function scores (p = 0.042).  The RICE group also had a significantly higher use of medication on Day 1 (p = 0.035) and Day 11 (p = 0.048).  For both groups there was a statistically significant decrease in swelling (p = 0.003), pain scores (p = 0.000), and an increase in function scores (p = 0.000) in relation to time over the eleven days of assessment.  The physiotherapy group had significantly improved function scores (p = 0.042) from Day 1 to Day 11 compared to the RICE group.  There were no significant differences between groups for swelling, pain scores, and their first day of documented non-compliance.  The within day range of error in the volumetric measurements was within 189.9 ml and 1.2 ml.  Three trials were conducted per person within a Day session.  The first volumetric analysis was significantly less than the subsequent two measurements (p = 0.040).It was concluded that, in the early stage of an ankle injury both physiotherapy and RICE, and RICE advice alone, resulted in significant improvements in swelling, pain and function.  Early intervention physiotherapy was significantly better at improving the functional ability of participants by Day 11.  Early intervention physiotherapy may also identify complications associated with ankle sprains.Despite its limitations this research could potentially lead to changes in the standard treatment protocols for soft tissue ankle injuries.  Implementation of self management RICE by patients in the acute stage would initially reduce the cost of physiotherapy treatments, and may lead to equal improvements in pain and swelling outcomes.  However, it appears that physiotherapy may lead to better functional outcomes which would reduce the costs associated with time off work, and rehabilitation.  It is important to note that these findings are based on a small sample size and on Grade I or II ankle ligament sprains, and that treatment for more severe ankle injuries may be better with physiotherapy, or surgery, rather than self management RICE by patients.  Findings contribute to the growing body of 'best practice' evidence for health practitioners.

It investigated the perceptions of the two parties associated with an event bid: the event bidders and the event owners. The research has also compared and contrasted the international findings with the New Zealand findings and a model of the event bidding process (Targeted Model), from the perspective of the local government event bidder, has been developed.Of the international research that had been done on event bidding the majority had been focused towards identifying the success factors when bidding for high-profile mega-events such as the Olympic Games. At the local level, the literature review identified that no such research had been conducted on event bidding within New Zealand. This lack of research presented the opportunity to gain an insight into the event bidding process within New Zealand. Due to the competitive nature of event bidding, New Zealand event bidders tend to work in isolation and there is no collective understanding of those factors that secure a bid. This research has overcome this isolation and presented a collective understanding of the success factors.Using the grounded theory methodology, common success factors and a model of the event bidding process emerged from the data. Common success factors that were frequently mentioned by event owners and event bidders included the need for government support, providing adequate event infrastructure, previous event management experience and providing quality information. The event owners tended to focus on those factors that ensured the successful delivery of the event. In addition, the event bidders mentioned common success factors that enhanced the bid: previous bidding experience; partnerships and relationships; bid leadership; research; providing quality information; using figureheads; making an emotional connection with the decision makers.The Targeted Model identifies the critical stages in the bidding process from the perspective of the New Zealand local government event bidder. An important step in event bidding is the "Bid Development Stage" where the event bidders are attempting to fulfil, and in most cases, exceed the criteria presented by the event owners. Event bidders who achieve the state of "Best Fit" - the desired outcome of the bid process where the event owners' conscious needs and unconscious desires are best met by an event bid - will succeed in winning the bid.The significance of this research is that it is the first of its kind in New Zealand, from which further research on event bidding will be able to compare and evolve from. One of the outcomes of the grounded theory methodology is that the findings are useful for the participants. It is envisaged that the results from this research will have practical applications for the events industry as it provides useful insights to the factors that win a bid and clearly models the bidding process.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sporting events</field><field name="subject">Bidding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uncovering strategic entrepreneurship: an examination of theory and practice</field><field name="creator">Luke, Belinda</field><field name="description">The combination of entrepreneurship and strategy is gaining increasing recognition as a pathway for growth within both individual organisations and national economies. Hence the benefits emerge from both a micro and macro economic perspective. Essentially, however, research on strategic entrepreneurship, being the intersection of entrepreneurship and strategy remains in the early stages. While the benefits of combining entrepreneurship and strategy are well established, specific details and underlying elements of strategic entrepreneurship as a concept remain under-developed and unsubstantiated. Prevailing models of strategic entrepreneurship are limited in number, conceptual in nature, and do not yet have practical or empirical support. Thus the question arises as to what constitutes strategic entrepreneurship?In order to address this issue a preliminary framework of strategic entrepreneurship is derived from the literature on both entrepreneurship and strategy, in order to identify the intersection of the two. This framework is then examined in the context of activity which is recognised as both entrepreneurial and strategic within three state-owned enterprises. Thus the research question addressed is:What constitutes strategic entrepreneurship in both theory and practice in the context of SOEs?Based on this examination, six elements are identified as central to strategic entrepreneurship, being opportunity identification, innovation, acceptance of risk, flexibility, vision, and growth. Additional findings uncovered inductively from the data reveal a number of supporting elements which foster strategic entrepreneurship, including strategy, culture (encompassing both people and confidence), branding, operational excellence, cost efficiency, and transfer and application of knowledge.Thus, an enhanced understanding of strategic entrepreneurship as a concept is obtained, being activity which is both entrepreneurial and strategic in nature, and characterised by the integration of the six core elements. Findings indicate strategic entrepreneurship is a concept not bound by context, and thus, may be applied to various forms of business. Such businesses which do create strategic entrepreneurship activity and are able to maintain a balance of the core elements over time have the potential for both competitive advantage and wealth creation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Http://www.100types.com: developing a computer-mediated model for the teaching of type design history</field><field name="creator">Archer, Ben</field><field name="description">This project's purpose is to relocate traditional paper-based library content about typographic history to a website, curated as a digital museum. The project process is defined as three distinct parts: 1. Scholarship and research. 2. Model-building and website creation. 3. Deployment, testing and evaluation. To support this, the project included the following sub stages: An informal needs analysis generated by reflection on practice. A survey of contemporary typeface classification systems, type education literature and online resources for typographic study. The building of animated and three-dimensional prototype models. The creation of a database of 100 historically significant typeface designs. The sourcing of samples, references, images and the gathering of reproduction permissions from designers, institutions and foundries whose work features in the database. The writing, editing, design and launch of the website at http://www.100types.com Peer feedback and review. An evaluation study of the website with students at AUT University in Auckland, New Zealand. A series of revisions to the website structure and presentation. The writing up of the research process and findings. I chose this topic as the direct result of my experiences teaching typography at AUT University and other tertiary institutions. The need for graphic design students to demonstrate competencies in typography (as a sub-discipline of graphic design) has always been present, but has been fore grounded over the last two decades; however, a recent PhD thesis on the subject has argued that traditional delivery of print-based typographic knowledge no longer serves undergraduate requirements for today's divergent screen-based media (Yee, 2006, p.11). This has been accompanied by a significant rise in the number of available typefaces (Cahalan, 2004, p.62). Unfortunately the means with which to study them has not kept pace with these developments (Dixon, 2002, p.4).Changes occurring within the type manufacturing industry and the wider field of creative industries during the last two decades have made the historical, background context of typography harder to comprehend from an undergraduate point of view. Students complain that they are under-resourced for information (in their preferred research medium) about the typefaces they must demonstrate care and deliberation in choosing. From experience gained in observing an online-learning pilot scheme in 2005, I elected to develop an online reference resource designed for self-directed research of typographic history as a complement to the existing tuition of typographic applications face-to-face in the classroom. While the project offers a useful example of how practice-led research can augment a teaching situation, and is concerned with the promotion of student-centred and self-directed learning at AUT University, this is not its only objective as a public-access location on the internet. In keeping with the rising philosophy of open content for web-based education resources, a conscious decision was made at the project's inception to host and present the website independently of AUT University and its online learning environment.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Typeface design history</field><field name="subject">History of printing</field><field name="subject">Typographic history research project</field><field name="subject">Curriculum action research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being together and separate: a grounded theory study of the experience of first-time fathers during childbirth</field><field name="creator">Carbines, Maria</field><field name="description">This grounded theory study explored the experience of first-time fathers during the time of birth with the aim of developing a conceptual framework to explain how they managed the process. In sharp contrast to the recognised maternity care practices of a generation ago, most fathers in New Zealand are currently expected to be present when their babies are born. There has been little New Zealand-based research to determine what the birth experience is like for fathers. Because contemporary fathers are expected to fulfil a major role in the care and support of mother and baby from pregnancy through to new parenthood and beyond, exploring the experience of fathers during birth is a way to understand part of the childbirth process from the perspective of husbands or partners in the developing new family. Eleven first-time fathers from the North Island of New Zealand participated in antenatal and postnatal interviews that were conducted over a 20-month period. Transcripts were analysed using grounded theory processes of coding, constant comparative analysis and theoretical sampling, and a conceptual diagram was developed to explain the core process which was discovered, namely, 'being together and separate'. It emerged that fathers could feel separate from the birth process, together with the birth process and at times they could experience both positions concurrently. Influences on participants' experience of 'being together and separate' included social expectations, the level of control that participants wished to have during the birth and the ways in which fathers were drawn in or excluded by wives/partners and maternity caregivers. The ways in which maternity caregivers responded to the involvement of fathers in the birth process was found to have a significant impact on the participants' experience of the process. Implications for the practice of maternity caregivers and childbirth educators are the importance of assessing each father's needs antenatally and of assisting them to develop strategies for participating comfortably in the birth experience. The relevance of supporting fathers to participate in the childbirth process at a level that promotes positive birth outcomes for the entire expectant family is demonstrated, and some practical strategies are provided that can assist health professionals and others to support fathers.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fathers</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voices in water</field><field name="creator">Meiklejohn, Hayley</field><field name="description">This project involves heuristic research as creative practice in the design of a set of divination cards.

While attention is given to vibrational imagery and micro photography, the research is not limited to these techniques. The chosen creative research process provokes tacit knowledge2. The images are used in the creation of a divinatory text.1 Tarot is a divination system consisting of seventy-eight cards, twenty-two of these are the trump cards known as the Major Arcana.

Semi-structured interviews and participant observations were employed to gather data from five families including children of pre-school and school age and their parents. Constant comparative analysis of the data revealed a central caregiving category, Structuring For Security, which encompassed two simultaneous and interdependent caregiving processes. A model is presented illustrating the processes.Structuring For Security describes the way the parents' caregiving is directed towards building a framework that provides for the present and future safety and success of their children. Holding Things Together explains endeavours to contain the distressing events resulting from the accident, with a focus on protecting the children from physical and emotional dangers. Joining My Child With Others explains what is happening when parents set things up for their children to spend time in activity with other people. The two processes are mediated by support from others, and involve learning and use of practical knowledge about the child. Successful implementation of the processes results in parents' increasing awareness of their ability to cope, progress in the children, and children's successful participation with other people. Participation in the processes is ongoing, responding to change in the child and in the environment.The study findings suggest a basis for the development of a framework that families and clinicians might use to guide caregiving for children after a traumatic brain injury. The findings also indicate the importance of supporting parents in developing effective caregiving structures that fit with their concerns for their children's safety and success with others. Consideration needs to be given to policies that take into account the safety issues involved for children and the support needs of parents following the accident.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brain</field><field name="subject">Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Brain-damaged children</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Brain damage</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Home care</field><field name="subject">Brain Injuries</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facing up to cancer: the lived experience of being diagnosed with a life threatening form of cancer</field><field name="creator">Lothian, Neil</field><field name="description">This Heideggerian phenomenological hermeneutic study explores the lived experience of those coming to terms with the diagnosis of a life-threatening form of cancer. It offers an interpretation of the narratives of eight adult New Zealanders, three men and five women, aged between 25 and 60 years of age who had been recently diagnosed. The study, based upon van Manen's (1990) six-step method, uncovers the experience of the person facing up to being told they have a life-threatening form of cancer within New Zealand society. It is informed by the writing of Heidegger. The study explores the meaning of cancer to the person involved and how this meaning affects them and their world. The study explores the changes within the person and how this change in the person subsequently changes the understanding they have of themselves and the world. The narratives of participants reveal a journey that is undertaken, a journey they thought they would never undertake and were not prepared to take. The cancer journey begins suddenly, is frightening in its intensity, towards a perceived destination of probable death. The real journey for many takes an unforeseen detour along the way, a detour of hope and eventual enlightenment. The final journey for all human beings will always end in death. The realisation that all human journeys must and do end in death and learning to live with the reality of this one fact in life is the major lesson learnt by those who experience the cancer journey. The journey is made more difficult and lonely by a society that wishes to fool itself that this journey does not happen or wishes to believe that one day this journey may be totally avoided. Society, and the people that make up society, need to face the reality of the cancer journey for many of its members in order to better prepare the person for the journey and to support the person while on this journey.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer - Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Cancer - Patients - New Zealand.</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the implementation of enterprise systems within government organisations in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vevaina, Paeterasp Darayas</field><field name="description">The 1990's saw a rapid growth in the use of Enterprise Systems by organisations to undertake quick and strategic decisions.

This research encompasses the factors which affect the implementation process of an Enterprise Document Management System and thereby render it a success or a failure. The study used an ethnographic approach in order to introduce rigour in the research. The data was collected by conducting eight semi-structured interviews at the client organisation. The interviews were transcribed and later coded using an open - coding methodology. A thematic analysis based schema was developed to later analyse the coded data.The research found that, factors such as change management, behaviour management / emotions, communication, implementation process approach and system functionality had profound effects on the implementation success of the Electronic Document Management System in the research organisation.

Each woman demonstrated the complexity of the transitions. The pregnant body and becoming visible were factors that impacted on all five women who participated in this study. The case studies describe how pregnancy intervened in the experience of being a student.Various coping mechanisms were employed by these pregnant university students. The research suggests that they find balance through compartmentalizing aspects of their lives. They attribute educational and personal outcomes to luck.

Brand refers to the name and reputation of the knowledge provider, Auckland University of Technology, and the level and type of qualification achieved, the MBA degree.The marketing function promotes the brand. The day-to-day management of the process of learning is performed through operations. Thus, in providing tertiary education, how is the brand and the desired objectives of customer satisfaction promoted with the brand, balanced with organisational competencies when applied to the AUT MBA learning process.A triangulation approach has been applied in conducting both qualitative and quantitative research involving MBA students, lecturers and management staff at AUT in order to ascertain whether marketing promises were met. Key findings were that the perception of the quality of the MBA programme showed a statistically significant difference between satisfaction levels of graduate MBA students and undergraduate MBA students in the areas of flexibility, student orientation and support provided with applications and enrolment. Furthermore, the collective responses for both groups of students for all questions showed that although both groups of students appeared to demonstrate a general level of satisfaction with the MBA course, there was a general movement away from strong agreement for graduate students towards strong disagreement for undergraduate students.

It deals with the issues surrounding experimentation with genetic engineering and human alienation and disability.The script references the tradition of New Zealand film and its development as a "cinema of unease" through the character of Nat, who lives as a "man alone" on a moored yacht, and through its setting in a desolate mangrove estuary adjacent to a suburban industrial estate. It features characters who are recent immigrants from varying cultures and offers insights to world views that contrast with the pessimistic colonial outlook on life that pits man against the environment in a struggle for domination.The title, Mangrove, is a metaphor for the rich human environment that can be found in outposts of society that are often maligned and overlooked for their perceived lack of value.Mangrove's main character, Talia, is a disabled woman whose desire is to be accepted for her difference, her insights and her humanity. She is confronted with her past and her origins that may be part of a late 20th century genetic experiment.She meets Nat, a former journalist hiding out from society who is searching for a way to express his idealism. Likewise, Shiva, an indo-Fijian living in a nearby car wreckers yard has a love of music and the environment and shares Nat's idealism and desire to work for a better world. The three uncover a potentially world-altering genetic experiment with sugar. The antagonist multinational has Russian mafia allies that have to be dealt with, while the protagonists have the assistance of some Thai monks and Pacific Island street kids as they strive to expose the experimentation, and work out their relationships with one another.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fringe</field><field name="subject">Mangrove</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Cross culture</field><field name="subject">Edge</field><field name="subject">Kiwi</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shifting focus: how registered nurses in residential aged care organise their work: a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">McKenzie-Green, Barbara A</field><field name="description">Registered nurses in residential aged care work with older people who have complex care needs. Besides providing direct care, these nurses have a wide range of responsibilities which include supervising staff and attending to the smooth running of the care facility. This grounded theory study using dimensional analysis was aimed at answering the question: How do registered nurses organise their work? Indepth interviews were conducted with 10 registered nurses who worked in a range of positions in aged care facilities. Theoretical sampling and constant comparative analysis was used to guide both ongoing data collectiona and data analysis. Categories were examined for their relationships and dimensions to arrive at a substantive grounded theory which I have named 'shifting focus'. Individual and institutional philosophies of care were core elements in the registered nurses' focus of work. There was a relationship between staffing adequacy, individual and institutional philosophies of care, and the focus of registered nurse work. These relationships created conditions where the registered nurse would focus on ensuring the delivery of individualised resident care or focus on getting through the routine of care. The relationship between staffing adequacy, philosophies of care and the registered nurses' focus of work remained consistent when staffing adequacy changed. In instances of decreased staffing adequacy, the participants' focus shifted to either maintaining individualised care or focusing on safety. When the registered nurse aimed to change the philosophy of care, an increase in staffing adequacy enabled some aspects of cultural change to commence. The relationships between residents, family and staff were significant contrasting elements within an individualised philosophy of care, and an institutional philosophy of care. In the former, relationships were valued and developed. In the latter, they were benevolent, functional or conflicted. The significance of this study is that it reveals how registered nurses and management personnel in aged care facilities, can create conditions where the relationships between residents, their families and staff, are valued and developed to result in positive care outcomes. It is recommended that future research be conducted to examine the resources required to maintain an individualised approach to the nursing care of residents in aged care facilities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="subject">Care</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Practice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of caffeine on simulated intermittent high-intensity sport performance</field><field name="creator">Stuart, Gene R</field><field name="description">Caffeine is now an unrestricted ergogenic aid for competitive athletes.  Previous reviews of caffeine's effects on exercise performance have been limited to qualitative analysis.  The purpose of this paper was therefore to quantitatively meta-analyze the effects of caffeine on exercise performance.  We identified 90 estimates of performance effects of caffeine in 32 peer-reviewed studies.  All estimates were converted to mean power in an equivalent time trial then subjected to a mixed-model meta-analysis.  The fixed effects were gender, training status (elite athlete, non-elite athlete, non-athlete), dietary caffeine status (habitual consumer, non-consumer), caffeine abstention period, caffeine dose (mg/kg body mass), type of caffeine (pure or in coffee), delay between ingestion and performance test, duration of test, and presence or absence of fatiguing exercise before the test.  The random effects accounted for within- and between-study variance.  We found that caffeine enhanced mean power by 2.8% (90% confidence limits &#177; 1.1%) in male non-elite athletes who are habitual caffeine consumers abstaining from caffeine for 2 d before consuming 6 mg/kg of caffeine capsules 1 h before performing a 30-min time trial without intervening fatiguing exercise.  The effects for other athletes and conditions were:  females, 3.1% (&#177; 2.7%); elite athletes, 2.9% (&#177; 1.4%); non-athletes, 1.3% (&#177; 1.2%); habitual non-consumers, 4.0% (&#177; 1.4%); 7 d of abstention, 3.4% (&#177; 2.6%); 0.3 mg/kg of caffeine, 1.6% (&#177; 5.3%); caffeinated coffee, 1.0% (&#177; 1.6%); 2-h delay before exercise, 2.9% (&#177; 1.2%); 6-s exercise test, 1.6% (&#177; 1.7%); prior fatiguing exercise, 3.0% (&#177; 1.6%).  Each of these effects of caffeine varied typically between studies by &#177; 1.4% (the between-study random effect; 90% confidence limits &#177; 0.9 to &#177; 3.5%).  We conclude that caffeine has a greater effect on performance with athletes, with habitual non-consumers of dietary caffeine, when administered as pure caffeine, and in endurance exercise, but there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects on individuals.  More research is needed to reduce this uncertainty and to determine the performance effects of caffeine with females, following longer periods of dietary abstention, in low doses, and for brief exercise.

Data was collected from the in-depth interviews of nine participants who have been living with Type 2 diabetes. Text from the interview transcripts was analysed using the version of grounded theory advocated by Strauss and Corbin (1998). This process facilitated the discovery of 'Carrying On With Life And Living' as the main concern shared by Part-Europeans managing Type 2 diabetes. It also identified the substantive theory of 'Walking The Line' as the core category and the basic social and psychological process by which Part-Europeans resolve their main concern of 'Carrying On With Life And Living'. This was a three-stage process involving firstly 'Carrying on Regardless', secondly 'Attempting Balance in Time and Motion and Control', and thirdly 'Balancing, Unbalancing, and Recovering Balance'. The results of this study reveal that the social and historical contexts of Part-European culture, such as heavy drinking, carrying on with life and living in the face of adversity, and taking traditional medicine impact significantly throughout their managing process. Findings of this study may contribute to development of some culturally aware strategies that could assist healthcare services to provide appropriate support, intervention, and education for Part-Europeans with Type 2 diabetes. This study also addresses the lack of studies concerned with the management of Type 2 diabetes in Pacific peoples and serves to inform research initiatives and priorities set by the Health Research Council of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcohol</field><field name="subject">Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Pacific Islands</field><field name="subject">Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">Traditional medicine</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of attributional style in a call centre environment</field><field name="creator">Fulcher, Patricia Ann</field><field name="description">This study explored the relationship between attributional style and the performance of front line service staff in a call centre environment. Attributional style was evaluated using a well recognised method (Seligman's Attributional Style Questionnaire). This was the first time that the Seligman's Attributional Style Questionnaire (SASQ) has been used in a New Zealand context. Performance was calculated using five independent measures. These measures have been used for several years by the company at the centre of our study as an objective measure of Call Centre Representative (CCR) performance. The association between attributional style and performance was then examined using a combination of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and co relational analysis. People have different ways of reacting to adversity such as failure, rejection or a high-pressure situation. The ability to succeed is closely tied to the ability to handle adversity (DeCarlo et al., 1997; Seligman &amp; Schulman, 1986; Boone, 2000). Research has supported the common sense view that optimistic beliefs can be self-fulfilling prophecies (Sujan, 1999a; Porter, 2000; Furnham et al., 1994). Hundreds of studies have revealed the benefits of optimism such as increased motivation, superior achievement (in various areas e.g. work, school and sports), elevated mood and well-being, and better physical health (Seligman et al., 1990; Seligman et al., 1986). Furthermore, individuals can learn to reduce negative ways of thinking and become more optimistic when it is appropriate (Satterfield et al., 1997; Eronen et al., 1999; Bohart, 2002).Call centres are not new phenomena, however they have become a growth industry in the private and public sector over the last decade (Creagh, 1998). The following definition of call centres was used by Gilmore and Moreland; "A physical or virtual operation within an organisation in which a managed group of people spend most of their time doing business by telephone, usually working in a computer-automated environment." (2000, pg 4)Due to the size and the complexity of tasks undertaken within call centres, there is a growing need for empirical findings to broaden understanding of how to best manage call centres and how to optimise the utilisation of human capital (Feinberg et al, 2000).This cross-sectional study assesses the performance of Call Centre Representatives (CCRs) in a New Zealand based call centre and explores whether there is an association with the Seligman's Attributional Style Questionnaire (SASQ).It was found that the performance measure for soft skills varied significantly when ranked by a measure of optimism. The performance measures considered in this study focus mainly on technical competency and task efficiency, and were therefore not well explained by attributional style. Future research should investigate pre-testing for soft skills at recruitment, interventionist training on attitude and whether that translates into improved soft skill performance, and the reassessment of current call centre performance measurements.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Call centers</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The meaning and importance of service for health professionals</field><field name="creator">Raleigh, Susan</field><field name="description">The primary purpose of this study was to explore and identify the meaning and importance of service for health professionals. Those who participated in this study are all registered nurses who each have between 10 and 40 years of clinical nursing and nurse lecturing experience. The participants each wrote two stories, one about the meaning of service and the other about the importance of service. Definitions of service generally suggest organised labour involving an act of help or assistance. Our intent was to understand what constituted service for each of us in the healthcare - and specifically the nursing practice/education - context.A secondary purpose of this qualitative research was guided by participatory and critical theory paradigms. Seven participants and I (as the initiating researcher) formed a co-operative inquiry group to undertake the research using a collaborative process. Within this method the leader and the group became co-participants and co-researchers. Nurses and women are identified as marginalised people and by honouring the principles of co-operative inquiry we were empowered through this process. While the initial data was analysed thematically by the lead researcher, the original 19 sub-themes were refined by participants into five themes.The findings of the participants are consistent with overseas studies on emotional labour and sentimental work. The five themes that emerged as the meaning of service are helping, giving, elements of service, acts of doing, and pride in work. Helping was defined as an attitude and an action, which often results in a spiritual connection. Giving involves stretching yourself, and altruistic behaviour that also incorporated a spiritual component. Five sub-themes merged to form the third theme elements of service; working with people, being a public servant, being a servant, need and duty. The complexity and hidden aspect of service work was expressed in acts of doing where being professional was paramount. The final theme, pride in work, acknowledged childhood conditioning and a sense of contributing to the greater good through our unique work as nurses. This study affirmed that service has much importance to those involved and deepened our understanding of the blend of meanings service expresses.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Service as vocation</field><field name="subject">Helping</field><field name="subject">Elements of service</field><field name="subject">Act of doing</field><field name="subject">Pride in work</field><field name="subject">Spiritual care</field><field name="subject">Emotional labour</field><field name="subject">Caring</field><field name="subject">Compassion</field><field name="subject">Sentimental labour</field><field name="subject">Giving</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abstract reality: the alienating gaze</field><field name="creator">Matheson, Clare</field><field name="description">This is a visual arts project consisting of 20% exegesis and 80% practical work.

The nature of surveillance is investigated with reference to Michel Foucault's metaphorical use of Jeremy Bentham's panopticon in describing the organization of society in the modern nation state. My critical interest lies in the intrusive aspect of surveillance in regard to the privacy of the individual and the concomitant sense of alienation and disempowerment.

Whilst position and movement awareness in the osteoarthritic knee have been studied extensively, little work to date has been produced on muscle force awareness in this subject group. Poor force acuity may contribute to muscle and joint pain and dysfunction, and additionally hinder rehabilitation efforts in an osteoarthritic population. Overestimation of the muscles forces required for a given task, resulting in greater joint compression forces, may aggravate and inflame osteoarthritic symptoms. Underestimation of required muscle forces may amplify existing joint instability, increasing the risk of injury in an osteoarthritic population. Additionally, both under and overloading of muscles during the rehabilitation process can delay the return to full function after injury.When regarding the neurological process of force coding, current debate centres on the relative importance of centrally generated motor command mediated 'sense of effort' versus the peripheral mechanoreceptor signalled 'sense of tension' as the dominant coding process, with central mechanisms favoured in the majority of studies published to date. The purpose of this study was to investigate muscle force awareness in the knee extensors and flexors and hands of subjects with and without knee joint osteoarthritis. Twenty one subjects with knee joint osteoarthritis and 23 age and gender matched subjects with no known knee pathology were evaluated. All subjects performed ipsilateral isometric force estimation and force matching tasks, at levels scaled to individual maximum voluntary capacity (MVC). Errors in estimation and matching acuity were normalised to reference targets (comparison force/reference force) giving a relative score (RS) to allow comparison across submaximal force levels with RS less than 1.0 indicating that subjects produced insufficient force and vice versa.Maximal voluntary capacity tests revealed significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) peak knee extension torque (111.2 Nm versus 145.3 Nm), but similar peak knee flexion torque (46.1 Nm versus 45.4 Nm for osteoarthritis and control subjects respectively). A pattern of overestimation at low reference levels and underestimation at high reference levels was demonstrated by all subjects. In the lower limb, force appreciation differed significantly between muscle groups regardless of knee condition, with knee extensors demonstrating greater overall accuracy than knee flexors. There was a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in force estimation ability and a trend to significance (p=0.066) for force matching acuity across groups at the 10% MVC test level. A significant (p&lt;0.05) group difference in grip force estimation ability between the lowest and highest target levels was demonstrated.It can be concluded that there are small differences in force acuity in osteoarthritis subjects at lower submaximal force targets when compared to healthy age matched peers. The notion of information redundancy, whereby no new proprioceptive inputs, regardless of origin, are able to effect an improvement in force acuity in a given situation has been demonstrated in previous studies that reported relatively stable force matching acuity at forces between 30% and 60% of maximal capacity. The poor comparative force perception demonstrated in this study by the osteoarthritis group at the lower submaximal test levels supports the notion that centrally generated copies of motor commands do not provide sufficient data to adequately encode force magnitude at low levels of force generation, evoking a greater reliance data received from peripheral mechanoreceptors. This has significant implications for this subject group given that the majority of daily tasks require only low levels of force generation. Given that perceptive acuity in a variety of sensory modalities has been shown to improve with training there may be a role for force perception training in older adults with osteoarthritis.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Force</field><field name="subject">Knee</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis</field><field name="subject">Matching</field><field name="subject">Estimation</field><field name="subject">Proprioception</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction of risk for lifestyle diseases: group diet and physical activity intervention in the workplace</field><field name="creator">Cumin, Michelle Brenda</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in most Westernised countries. The prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancers is rapidly increasing. Older people with elevated blood lipids, obesity and DNA damage are at high risk of developing these diseases. There is a plethora of research to support the claim that a healthy diet and increased physical activity can reduce the risk of increased body fatness, diabetes and generally improve health. However, most interventions require intensive one to one advice. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of a group approach to advising on changes in lifestyle with particular attention to foods high in fibre. The study spanned a period of 12 weeks with a follow up session at 52 weeks to ascertain sustainability. The study: This study was a 12 week longitudinal intervention study with a follow up after 52 weeks. Measurements of anthropometry (skin folds, girths, weight and height), blood pressure, body fat by bio impedance and fasting blood (lipids, glucose and insulin) were made at weeks 0, 3, 6, 9,1 2 and 52. The participants were asked to complete a food frequency questionnaire and a physical activity questionnaire at each of the 6 measuring sessions and to provide an indication of what the goals that they had set and if they had accomplished them after 9,12 and 52 weeks. Between measurements at weeks 0 and 3 the volunteers were left to follow their usual food and activity pattern. Then as a group they were given a diet and exercise talk and provided with written material and pedometers to increase motivation. After measurement at week 6 they were randomly divided into two groups. The first group (A) were prescribed and provided with kiwifruit at a dose of 100g/30 kg body weight for three weeks while the second group (B) continued with the changes in diet and physical activity. Following measurement at week 9 group A abstained from kiwifruit while Group B added the kiwifruit to their diet and the measurements repeated. After 52 weeks, with only emails as ongoing communication, they were remeasured. Results For this multicultural, relatively middle aged group of 53 staff (28 women, 25 men) of mean age 46 years, measurable and statistically significant metabolic gains were made in the lipid profile over 12 weeks. Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL all decreased and HDL increased significantly. Total cholesterol decreased from 5.6(&#177;1.1) mean (&#177;SD) mmol/L at baseline to 5.3(&#177;1.1) mmol/L at week 12 (p&lt;0.001); LDL cholesterol decreased from 3.5(&#177;0.97) mmol/L at baseline to 3.3(&#177;0.94) mmol/L at week 12 (p&lt;0.001); and total cholesterol to HDL ratio decreased from 4.0(&#177;1.1) to 3.7(&#177;0.9) (p&lt;0.001). In the 36 who were measured at 52- week follow- up these changes persisted. With the other outcome measures glucose showed a statistically but not biologically significant decrease over the 12 week period and body composition, blood pressure and insulin showed no significant change. The kiwifruit crossover had no apparent affect on the measures of any of the measurements reported. The participants reported that they increased fruit and vegetable and oily fish consumption and increased physical activity. These increases took place over the initial 12 week period and were maintained over 52 weeks. Conclusion: This study has shown that changes in diet and physical activity can favourably influence blood biochemistry even without accompanying changes in percentage body fat and weight. Furthermore, small, manageable lifestyle changes can result in biochemical changes persisting over 52 weeks.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lifestyles</field><field name="subject">Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Employee health promotion</field><field name="subject">Physical fitness</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining enjoyment of life in the process of living with high cholesterol : a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">Reade-Raethel, Valerie R</field><field name="description">Hypercholesterolaemia (high cholesterol) is a risk factor for atherosclerosis, a major contributor to cardiovascular disease. Much has been written on managing high cholesterol levels including the use of drug therapy and recommendations about beneficial lifestyle changes relating to nutrition and exercise in particular. Despite this, and the need for patients to engage in self management of a condition which may impact invisibly on their health, little is known about how people living with this risk factor actually manage.The purpose of this grounded theory study is to investigate people's process of living with high cholesterol. Eight participants with self reported high cholesterol levels were interviewed and their data analysed using the process of constant comparative analysis, open coding, selective coding and theoretical coding. A substantive theory in the area of patient self-management of high cholesterol levels was generated through the use of this approach. The theory developed was the basic social process of Maintaining Enjoyment of Life, with two supporting categories, Accepting and Getting On With It.Maintaining Enjoyment of Life was central to the participants' process of living with high cholesterol and the recommended health directives. The identification of this basic social process adds to our understanding of the influences on individuals' motivation for behaviour change and adherence to lifestyle changes. The findings of this study provide understanding that issues relating to behaviour change and adherence are not so much about denying that anything is wrong or not taking personal responsibility, but more about trying to hold on to something important, around which the participants' lives revolve. This is Maintaining Enjoyment of Life. By focussing on this basic social process, which is grounded in the participants' data, health professionals could work more effectively towards empowering patients to identify their own individualised strategies for self-management of high cholesterol. In addition, health directives could focus more on process rather than on do(s) and don't(s).</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hypercholesteremia</field><field name="subject">Blood cholesterol</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hollywood, Wellywood or the backwoods?</field><field name="creator">Conor, Bridget</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the New Zealand film industry and its historical and ongoing relationship with the Hollywood film industry. It will critically evaluate the notion that New Zealand now has more autonomy and independence in the international film industry and the analysis will examine the realities for both the New Zealand and Hollywood film industries by unravelling the hype and rhetoric at both core and periphery.There has been a huge amount of activity, discussion and 'hype' surrounding feature film production in New Zealand in the last few years, particularly in the wake of The Lord of the Rings production and its international success. There is also optimism that changes in the dominant US mode of production and the rise of a global entertainment industry is diminishing the centralised power of Hollywood and creating new opportunities for international filmmaking outside the US.The New Zealand industry (like many other 'national' cinemas) has always struggled between commercial and cultural imperatives for filmmaking. Using a political economy approach, this thesis examines these two imperatives as threads through the development of a national film culture in New Zealand and the constant struggle against the dominant power of Hollywood film. It works to uncover the false and often contradictory dichotomy between the two polarities, cultural and commercial.Recent policy initiatives and the activities of the New Zealand Government in terms of feature filmmaking are also examined. The initiatives of the New Zealand Government are embodied in the 'Brand NZ' slogan that has been employed in order to promote New Zealand as a location for global production capital. The central argument is that a third, hybrid model has become increasingly visible as a complex 'partnership' has developed between a Hollywood studio, New Line Cinema and a national government, New Zealand's.A slogan such as 'Brand NZ' indicates that this third model is primarily a commercial construct. What is not made clear in the New Zealand context and is in fact, obscured by the hype and rhetoric, is that this third model is also a core-periphery model. Therefore, the much vaunted independent and more autonomous national film industry in New Zealand is largely illusory.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion picture industry</field><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nga kapua whakapipi a tamamutu - strength in unity nurturing future Turangitukua leaders</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Evelyn  H</field><field name="description">Education is development. It helps to create choices and opportunities for people, reduce the twin burdens of poverty and diseases, and give a stronger voice in society. For nations it creates a dynamic workforce and well-informed citizens able to compete and cooperate globally - opening doors to economic and social prosperity.This study examines how a small group of students coped under conditions of adversity. It follows in the tradition of a wide body of qualitative work that has investigated ethnic minorities and their educational experiences. Much of the existing work, however, focuses on merely describing thematically and/or conceptually, what goes on. This study aims to construct an integrated conceptual understanding of how a minority group engaged in the coping process. More specifically, this study seeks to develop a substantive theory that can help explain and predict human behaviour. Grounded theory methodology was used in aid of the theory development process (Glasser and Strauss, 1967). Put simply, grounded theory is an inductive methodology that attempts to understand action from the perspective of social actors (Brooks, 1998).To uncover the coping process, the Turangitukua students and their Hapu (sub tribe) in New Zealand are used as the main data source. Two other student groups were used for comparative purposes. Data was obtained by a number of means; including interviewing, focus groups, hui (meetings), and documentary analysis. The collected data was summarised and analysed over a two- year period.This study contributes to three areas of research. First, it adds to the small but growing body of work relating to Turangitukua hapu (sub-tribe) in New Zealand. Second, it contributes to research in the area of Maori and non-Maori relationships, especially work that focuses on interaction. And finally, it adds to the formal theoretical literature on indigenous educational settings and its management.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Ethnic minorities</field><field name="subject">Indigenous people</field><field name="subject">Maori students</field><field name="subject">Educational opportunity</field><field name="subject">Coping with adversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomics</field><field name="creator">Carthew, Richard</field><field name="description">Abstract This project is concerned with visual representation of human gross anatomy*. The subject is complex because it derives from an intersection of artistic and scientific disciplines and is an active field of research. The overall aim of the project is to open up new ways of interpretation when engaging with complex visual representations of anatomy. The project involves a consideration of the methods and models in which the communication of visually complex information is achieved by using a combination of artistic and scientific representation. It explores methods and techniques used in the creation of visualisations that are intended to convey scientific knowledge. Literature and visual reviews were undertaken and these examined research material which informed the project's exploration. These reviews included texts that studied the historical development of anatomic representation and also contemporary visual material. Elements of cognition and perception and their relationship to visual communication were reviewed and considered in relation to the project's practical work. Wider socio-cultural contexts that affect pictorial style in anatomic representation were also reviewed and some relevant contexts are discussed within the exegesis. Practical exploration included developing models of anatomy that combined elements from artistic and scientific approaches. For example, in some explorative work, the fine detail of traditional anatomic representation formed one section of a model and this was allied with another section that used a more scientific approach to isolate key structures by illumination. The exegesis concludes with a summary of the project, conclusions arising from the research and an indication of potential areas for further study. * For conciseness, all further references within the exegesis to anatomy and anatomic representation refer to human gross anatomy unless otherwise stated.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anatomy and representation</field><field name="subject">Art and science</field><field name="subject">Technology</field><field name="subject">Medical illustration</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Computer mediated communication</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transition on Waiheke: changing ways we view and inhabit the landscape</field><field name="creator">Wakefield, Juliet</field><field name="description">This thesis project explores, through art practice that is informed by sociological and theoretical considerations, a transition taking place on Waiheke Island, in Aotearoa, New Zealand.

The methodological tool provides insights into the quality of the art galleries' marketing activities, categorising promotional material according to their level of visibility/public accessibility and required individual involvement. The promotional material was considered according to three different dimensions of meaning: (1.) The textual dimension of meaning (Fairclough, 1992); (2.) The visual dimension of meaning (Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996; 2006); (3.) The local dimension of meaning (Scollon and Scollon, 2003). The innovation of the newly developed model lies in the combination of these three dimensions coming from the three different theoretical and methodological areas of thought: Critical Discourse Analysis, Systemic Functional Analysis, and Mediated Discourse Analysis. The model takes the above mentioned three dimensions together in order to categorise and assess a gallery's current marketing approach, and to then recommend a gallery's enhancement of marketing strategies to either deepen or broaden their audience. The visibility/involvement model also provides understanding of a gallery's underlying ideology and can explain why a certain gallery emphasises a particular marketing approach more than another cultural organisation and what implications that might have for future developments. This thesis challenges the view that traditional marketing strategies apply to arts marketing. Following Venkatesh and Meamber's (2006), who account for the cultural production process, drawing on McCracken (1986; 1988), this thesis attempts to engage in a holistic arts marketing approach. In order to attempt a holistic analysis, the thesis is based on analysis of galleries' visual signs, mission statements, and sent-out invitations. A central argument in the thesis is that each class of promotional material implies different properties, and hence requires an altered promotion strategy based on the target audience and the main communicative intention. The concept entails that the audience becomes narrower and more homogeneous from the category of visual signs to the class of sent-out invitations. Likewise, the communication needs to become more personal and specific. The audience layer model, an application of the visibility/involvement model introduced in the final chapter of this thesis, illustrates the relationship between the audience and promotional material.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Organisational contexts</field><field name="subject">Organisational culture</field><field name="subject">Organisational reality</field><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Otago exercise programme: do strength and balance improve?</field><field name="creator">Binns, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of participation in the Otago Exercise Programme (OEP) on strength and balance. The change in a number of balance and strength measures were compared between a group of community dwelling women over the age of 80 years participating in the OEP and a control group matched by gender and age.Study design: A cohort study of two independent groups.Participants: Nineteen women over the age of 80 years who were community dwelling and participating in the OEP and 18 age matched community dwelling women who continued with their normal activities of daily living.Main outcome measures: Participants' strength and balance was measured using the timed up and go test, the step test, the 30 second chair stand test and gait velocity. Participants' fear of falling was measured with the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale and falls were monitored using a falls diary.Results: There were no statistically significant improvements in strength and balance in the OEP group and no statistically significant differences between the OEP and control group, after participating in the OEP for 6 months. The only statistically significant change in the OEP group was a slowing of gait velocity, all other outcome measures remained unchanged for both the OEP group and the control group.Conclusions: There were no statistically significant improvements in strength and balance after participating in the OEP. These results are consistent with those of the original Otago trial and the subsequent meta-analysis of all the Otago trials. The results from this study need to be interpreted with caution, as due to the small sample size the study was underpowered.

Lack of empirical study that authenticates the 'practice' of organisational learning In examining these two gaps this thesis provides a synthesis of the fragmented literature, resulting in the development of five core tenets that together constitute organisational learning. Until now, this type of synthesis has never been undertaken. The core tenets are then tested to address the question of whether organisational learning is practiced. This involved a Content Analysis of reports made by Senior Management in leading New Zealand organisations. A pragmatic approach was used in analysing this data, allowing for both quantitative and qualitative methods. The chief finding of this study is that four of the five tenets of organisational learning are prevalent, to varying degrees, among the New Zealand organisations studied.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational learning</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tool support for social risk mitigation in agile projects</field><field name="creator">Licorish, Sherlock Anthony</field><field name="description">Software engineering techniques have been employed for many years to guide software product creation. In the last decade the appropriateness of many techniques has been questioned, given unacceptably high rates of software project failure.  In light of this, there have emerged a new set of agile software development methodologies aimed at reducing software projects risks, on the basis that this will improve the likelihood of achieving software project success. Recent studies show that agile methods have been gaining increasing industry attention. However, while the practices recommended by agile methodologies are said to reduce risks, there exists little evidence to verify this position. In addition, it is posited that the very processes recommended by agile methodologies may themselves introduce other risks. Consequently, this study addresses the risks inherent in the human collaboration practices that are central to agile methods. An analysis of the risk management literature reveals that personality conflicts and customer-developer disagreements are social risks that occur through human collaboration. These risks negatively affect team cohesion and software project success. Personality conflicts are said to be mostly influenced through poor team formation, whereas customer-developer disagreements are induced through excessive customer direct interaction.  However, these risks are not adequately addressed by standard risk management theories.  Furthermore, an evaluation reveals that these risks are also not considered by existing software tools.This study therefore designs and implements a web-based solution to lessen the social risks that may arise in agile projects. The Agile Social-Risk Mitigation Tool (ASRMT) offers support for personnel capability assessment and management and for remote customer feature management, extending the customer's access through an interface. Using software engineering experts to evaluate ASRMT, the tool is shown to effectively address social risk management theories, and is considered likely to assist agile developers in their handling of social risks. In addition, above and beyond its intended purpose, ASRMT is also likely to assist agile teams with general project management. The findings of the ASRMT user evaluations demonstrate sufficient proof of concept to suggest that such a tool could have value in live software projects.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software engineering</field><field name="subject">Agile methodologies</field><field name="subject">Project management</field><field name="subject">Risk management</field><field name="subject">Software tools</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical investigation of category-level effects of consumer factors on private label purchase</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shaoshan</field><field name="description">Private label brands have been examined in the literature for more than forty years (Narasimhan and Wilcox, 1998). Due to the rapid growth of private-label market share, researchers have looked into different influential factors in attempting to find out the reasons behind the success of these store products. As consumers reflect the demand side of fast-moving goods, their perceptions critically affect decisions on brand selection, and therefore the performance of the brands.Although the topic of private labels has long been studied, the volume of private-label research is less than that of national-brand studies. Findings from the extant studies of private labels have provided valuable consumer insights for marketing scholars and practitioners to better develop branding theory and strategies. However, issues still exist in the literature, in particular, concerning category-level influences of consumer factors such as perceived risk and attitude. Risk perception and attitude are important explanatory constructs for consumer proneness towards buying private labels. Moreover, category-level differences are stated as the most critical source that can explain the variations in the performance of private labels (Batra and Sinha, 2000; Dhar and Hoch, 1997).This research replicates Batra and Sinha's (2000) study which examined the categorylevel effects of different determinants of perceived risk on consumer preferences for buying private labels. The purpose of this research is to re-examine their hypotheses and to investigate other attitude determinants which Batra and Sinha did not study. In addition, this study also investigates the impact of demographics on the purchase of private labels.A mall-intercept survey was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that perceived risk and attitude determinants such as quality variability, price consciousness, price-quality association and brand loyalty influence significantly consumers' propensities to buy private labels. Furthermore, these private-label propensities vary across product categories due to category-level variations in perceptions and attitudes. Consumers are more likely to buy private labels in categories where they perceive lower quality variability across brands, where they have higher price consciousness, where they believe weaker price-quality association, and where they have less brand loyalty. Moreover, education and income are also identified as significant indicators of private label buyers.Findings from this study suggest that category-level analysis of consumer factors could more effectively answer the question why private label success varies across different categories. A better way for national-brand manufacturers and retailers to compete against each other is the product quality improvement. Manufacturers should try to keep the quality level of national brands as far above that of private labels as possible, whereas retailers should attempt to reduce the quality gap for their private label brands.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">House brands</field><field name="subject">Brand name products</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Consumers</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of steel foundry by-product in the treatment of stormwater</field><field name="creator">Ren, Jiyang</field><field name="description">The capacity and efficiency of melter slag (provided by New Zealand Steel) to remove heavy metals and suspended solids from stormwater samples are studied in this thesis. A series of batch tests were carried out to investigate the adsorption-desorption mechanism of the slag to remove heavy metals (Cd2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+) from working solutions. The results showed that all the tested metallic ions could be removed by mixing the melter slag with the working solutions. Adsorption and ion exchange are the dominant mechanisms in this process. The adsorption capacity follows the descending order of Cu2+ &gt; Zn2+ = Cd2+. Varied binding energy of different metallic ions to the slag resulted in competitive adsorption between ions.A variety of substances: inorganic salts (KCl, NaCl, KNO3 and sea water), organic acids (citric and tartaric) and inorganic acids (nitric and carbonic), were tested as desorbing agents to recover the used slag. Citric acid in sea water was found to be the best in terms of desorption efficiency and cost-effectiveness.The column tests were carried out to simulate the filtration bed in laboratory conditions. Stormwater samples were collected from residential and commercial areas in Auckland. The synthetic stormwater samples were prepared from clay and metallic ion solution. Both samples were used as feeding solutions in the tests. The removal efficiencies of suspended solids and metallic ions (Zn2+, Cd2+ and Cu2+) vary depending on different operation conditions. They are in inverse proportion to the grain size of the melter slag and the influent flow rate. The higher removal efficiency of Zn2+ than that of suspended solids infers that metallic ions are removed by both precipitation and adsorption.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water - Pollution</field><field name="subject">Water - Purification - Adsorption</field><field name="subject">Water - Purification - Filtration</field><field name="subject">Runoff</field><field name="subject">Enviornmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wavelet analysis and classification surface electromyography signals</field><field name="creator">Kilby, Jeff</field><field name="description">A range of signal processing techniques have been adopted and developed as a methodology which can be used in developing an intelligent surface electromyography (SEMG) signal classifier. An intelligent SEMG signal classifier would be used for recognising and treatment of musculoskeletal pain and some neurological disorders by physiotherapists and occupational therapists. SEMG signals displays the electrical activity from a skeletal muscle which is detected by placing surface electrodes placed on the skin over the muscle. The key factors of this research were the investigation into digital signal processing using various analysis schemes and the use of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for signal classification of normal muscle activity. The analysis schemes explored for the feature extraction of the signals were the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT).Traditional analysis methods such as FFT could not be used alone, because muscle diagnosis requires time-based information. CWT, which was selected as the most suitable for this research, includes time-based information as well as scales, and can be converted into frequencies, making muscle diagnosis easier. CWT produces a scalogram plot along with its corresponding frequency-time based spectrum plot. Using both of these plots, overviewed extracted features of the dominant frequencies and the related scales can be selected for inputs to train and validate an ANN. The purpose of this research is to classify (SEMG) signals for normal muscle activity using different extracted features in an ANN. The extracted features of the SEMG signals used in this research using CWT were the mean and median frequencies of the average power spectrum and the RMS values at scales 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128. SEMG signals were obtained for a 10 second period, sampled at 2048 Hz and digitally filtered using a Butterworth band pass filter (5 to 500 Hz, 4th order). They were collected from normal vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscles of both legs from 45 male subjects at 25%, 50%, and 75% of their Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contraction (MVIC) force of the quadriceps. The ANN is a computer program which acts like brain neurons, recognises, learns data and produces a model of that data. The model of that data becomes the target output of an ANN. Using the first 35 male subjects' data sets of extracted features, the ANN was trained and then validated with the last 10 male subjects' data sets of the untrained extracted features. The results showed how accurate the untrained data were classified as normal muscle activity. This methodology of using CWT for extracting features for analysing and classifying by an ANN for SEMG signals has shown to be sound and successful for the basis implementation in developing an intelligent SEMG signal classifier.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Signal processing - Digital techniques - Data processing</field><field name="subject">Signal processing - Digital techniques - Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Electromyography - Data processing</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How do teachers with different ESOL teaching backgrounds approach form-focused instruction?</field><field name="creator">Gerzic, Ana</field><field name="description">Form-focused instruction makes up an important part of the literature on second language acquisition research. Current approaches to second language instruction have called for an integration of message-focused and form-focused instruction in the L2 classroom. At the same time, a growing interest is the pedagogical applications of form-focused research, which proposes a means of addressing form in the classroom using various instructional options, some of which involve incidental and pre-planned focus on form.This study examined the nature and occurrence of pre-planned and incidental focus on form in two secondary school ESOL classrooms, and what thinking underlay the two teachers' practices in choosing a particular option. The study reports on the methods and approaches that two teachers employed in the context of their own ESOL classrooms, in which form-focused instruction occurred, and explored the extent to which different levels of experience influenced the instructional decisions of two ESOL teachers.The results showed that there was a considerable amount of attention to form in lessons that purported to be 'communicative' and certainly were so. It also became clear that in these classes, a focus-on-form was not just a reactive phenomenon, it was also proactive since the students played an important part in both initiating and responding focus on form episodes. Much of the focus on form that arose was triggered by a problem in using English accurately, not by a problem in communication. That means that, although the lessons were 'communicative', the students regularly paid attention to language for its own sake.It is suggested that both pedagogy and teacher education/development may benefit from a perspective in which both good and not-so-good practice is seen as cognitive and reflective activity.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language - Study and teaching - Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">English Language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of systematic strategies for representing three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface</field><field name="creator">Jowett, David</field><field name="description">This project explores systematic strategies for establishing a definitive mode of representation in drawing.

The number of woody seedlings that established over a 17-month period was recorded. Gaps within the same Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy were created to investigate the influence of the canopy on seedling recruitment. Soil samples were taken to investigate the existing seed bank beneath the same Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopies.At Wenderholm, net change in seedling density differed among treatments (P=0.014). Seedling density increased within the plots that excluded Trichosurus vulpecula and Oryctolagus cuniculus and within plots that additionally excluded Rattus rattus, but declined in the control plots. In contrast at Shakespear, although seedling density increased more within both the exclosure plots than in the control plots, this result was not statistically significant (P=0.728). At Wenderholm, the average seedling height increased within both types of exclosure plots, but declined in the control plots. However, these differences among treatments were not statistically significant (P=0.204). At Shakespear, seedlings increased in height within the Trichosurus vulpecula, Oryctolagus cuniculus and Rattus rattus exclosures and declined marginally in the other two treatments. Again, differences in height change among treatments were not statistically significant (P=0.202).At both regional parks, the greatest cause of mortality within the exclosures excluding Trichosurus vulpecula and Oryctolagus cuniculus was desiccation. All of the mortalities within the Trichosurus vulpecula, Oryctolagus cuniculus and Rattus rattus exclosures was unidentifiable. However, within the control plots, at Wenderholm, the greatest identified cause of mortality was browsing and at Shakespear, the only cause of mortality within the control plots was browsing.Seedbanks at Wenderholm and Shakespear under the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides plantings were dominated by forb species. A total of 1308 seedlings germinated from soil taken from Wenderholm, with exotic species making up 99.4% of germinations, with exotic species making up 97.9% of germinations. Similarly a total of 801 seedlings germinated from soil samples taken from Shakespear.At Wenderholm, the number of native seedling germinations within the gaps created in the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy, was more than twice the number that germinated under the closed canopy. However, this difference was marginally non-significant (P=0.065). At Shakespear, the number of native seedling germinations within gaps created in the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy was similar to the number that germinated under the closed canopy (P=0.2603).The results suggest that at Wenderholm, despite ongoing predator control, Trichosurus vulpecula and/or Oryctolagus cuniculus have had an adverse effect on the survival and growth of seedlings. The results also suggest that at Shakespear, Rattus rattus have had an adverse effect on the survival and growth of seedlings under the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy. The distance from mature forest may also have had an impact on the dispersal of native seeds within the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy. The implication of these results for the future management of restoration plantings in regional parks is discussed.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seedling regeneration</field><field name="subject">Seed bank</field><field name="subject">Revegetation</field><field name="subject">Auckland Regional Council</field><field name="subject">Regional parks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between likeness and unlikeness: a fusion of Chinese ink painting aesthetics into the medium of photography</field><field name="creator">Ping (Heidi), Xu</field><field name="description">This is a practice-based research project that explores a new aesthetic perspective and approach in the Western medium of photography, through the application and interpretation of contemporary Chinese master artist Qi Baishi&#8217;s philosophical notion of between likeness and unlikeness.

The aspiration of drawing upon Qi&#8217;s aesthetics at a philosophical level, which is unfamiliar in the context of Western photography, has posed a challenge to the creative exploration.

The va consists of relationships between people and things, unspoken expectations and obligations: the inherent and changeable patterns, of obligations and expectations between people and their environment. The va space can be viewed as the stage upon which all patterns and motifs carry meaning. How the patterns and motifs change meanings are subject to other elements in the va. Meaning in my work will evoke the interweaving connections of past and present through oral history, genealogy, and fagogo&#185; (story telling) memory and artist sentiment. As participant, the artist reflects through the remembrance of sifting through images, person, family, events, time, and space. An emphasis will be placed on the exploration of pattern and motif as a signifier of events and sign of respect, with a focus on notions of the va. The project explores notions of visual patterns and motifs to be utilized as a vehicle to signify in that all patterns and motifs carry meaning in that they signify an event, person, time, and space.

The topic of the thesis was sparked by prolonged study at the Master&#8217;s level of the writings of Robert K. Greenleaf, modern servant leadership theorist. Greenleaf was concerned with the ways and the conditions in which the human spirit flowers. He wrote a number of essays on the topic (Greenleaf, 1996b). He often questioned what organisations as they currently stood were doing to help people grow as whole people. As workers spend increasing amounts of time in the workplace, organisations continue to seek ways in which to increase employee satisfaction and decrease the compartmentalising of human experience. The geographical context of study is that of Aotearoa/New Zealand with participants selected from the Church Educational System of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the T&#257;maki-makau-rau/Auckland region. The Church Educational System, or CES, is a worldwide religious education provider headquartered in the Western United States. The context for study was chosen based on my perceived personal growth as a student for nine years in the CES programmes and my desire to understand how the programme was administered in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The project employs a qualitative methodology using as primary data gathering methods in-depth interviews with three CES directors, three focus groups made up of sixteen volunteer teachers, classroom observations, and document analysis. Using Greenleaf&#8217;s descriptions of the servant leader as a central focus, I attempt through this qualitative study to address the central research question: How does the Church Educational System (CES) nurture servant leaders? The central metaphor of the garden was used in processing and analysing data. The garden metaphor was intended to assist in the conceptualisation of relationships of service as they are at work in the lives of participants. Identified relationships of service from the findings were between participants co-workers (plants), love (life-force), Jesus Christ (sun), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (plot), purpose (strength), Aotearoa/New Zealand (soil), exemplars (canopy), experience (seasons), Church Educational System (gardener), positions, training, programmes (gardener tools), growth (colour/aroma/fruit), knowledge (water), and organisational care (pruning/transplanting). Findings indicated that nurturing in the Church Educational System is influenced by the ability of the organisation to bring people together in meaningful ways. Findings also show that understanding relationships of service that make up whole people may be an important step for organisations in the nurturing of servant leaders. Nurturing in the CES appears to be taking place in three primary areas: balancing, renewal, and regeneration. The findings of this study have significance for those inside and outside of the CES. A chapter is dedicated to exploring possible application of findings in variant organisational contexts. Providing consistent formal and informal opportunities for sharing in spirit and intellect at the organisational level appears to be a key in the nurturing of servant leaders in organisations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Servant leadership</field><field name="subject">Religious education</field><field name="subject">Nurturing</field><field name="subject">Latter-Day Saints</field><field name="subject">Church Educational System</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining differences between novice and expert physiotherapists in the emergency on-call environment: a vignette-based study</field><field name="creator">Dunford, Fiona</field><field name="description">Emergency on-call duties have been highlighted as a key stress factor in newly qualified physiotherapists whose job performance may be affected. The concept of stress relating to on-call work, the general lack of interest or confidence in the respiratory on-call field, and subsequent difficulties with recruitment and retention, pose a difficult problem for managers of services responsible for the maintenance of a competent workforce and a high standard of service provision. Differences in novice and expert physiotherapists&#8217; patient management and clinical reasoning strategies have been previously examined in orthopaedic, neurology, domiciliary and cardiorespiratory fields.  However, no such investigations have been undertaken in the field of emergency on-call. The purpose of this study was to determine if differences existed between novice and expert physiotherapists who had by definition differing levels of context-related experience within the emergency on-call environment. This study also aimed to consider what factors may influence their physiotherapy intervention for an acute cardiorespiratory patient.  A purpose-designed vignette-based postal questionnaire was administered to 26 emergency on-call providers in New Zealand. The questionnaire sought demographic data, investigated participants&#8217; attitudes towards emergency on-call service provision and presented a vignette-based clinical scenario which asked questions throughout an evolving clinical case scenario.  Analysis was performed using the computer software package for social sciences, SPSS for Windows (version 14), results were analysed using descriptive statistics, and significance testing was performed using non-parametric methods.  A good response rate was achieved (78.8%; n = 56). Statistically significant differences between novices and experts were determined in scores for confidence, stress, and support required, also in the factors affecting stress levels.  Novices are less confident (p = &lt; .0001), more stressed (p = &lt; .001) and require more support than experts (p = &lt; .001). Factors which influenced both novice, and to a lesser extent, expert stress levels when working as emergency on-call physiotherapists, were established.  A relationship was determined between confidence and level of support required (r = -.65; p = &lt; .001); confidence and amount of stress felt (r = -.58; p = &lt; .001); and support required and stress felt (r = .47; p = &lt; .001). Some differences were demonstrated between novice and expert physiotherapists in their answers to a clinical case scenario.  Although these were not statistically significant, a trend was noted which may reflect the different clinical reasoning strategies of these physiotherapists. There is a need for novices to gain the type of experience which includes independent problem solving and guided reflection; the use of vignette-based case studies may be one method which could be further exploited. The profession is responsible for the provision of better ways to meet the needs of our future emergency on-call workforce.  If this is not achieved, other professional groups will be required to fill the gaps and physiotherapy; particularly cardiorespiratory physiotherapy will lose out.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Determining differences</field><field name="subject">Novices and experts</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Emergency on-call</field><field name="subject">Vignette</field><field name="subject">Survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rebuilding lives after intimate partner violence in Aotearoa: women&#8217;s experiences ten or more years after leaving</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Rosalind</field><field name="description">My research focused on five women in Aotearoa naming and defining their experiences ten or more years after leaving an intimate partner violence relationship. An increasing amount of literature has been published reporting the prevalence of intimate partner violence among women in our society, including surveys documenting devastating short and long-term health effects. However, little has been published about the long-term experiences of women who have survived such abuse. I was interested in making more visible the experiences of long-term survivors of intimate partner violence. I wondered what the challenges and legacies from experiences of intimate partner violence are and what contributes to women rebuilding their lives after intimate partner violence. In this research utilised a participatory action research approach informed by a critical feminist theoretical perspective. I selected two data collection methods, individual interviews followed by a focus group interview bringing the participants together. The findings identified nineteen themes emerging from the individual and focus group interviews. Some expressed the long-term challenges and legacies of intimate partner violence, such as feelings of powerlessness, guilt and shame and feeling silenced. Others reflected ways women rebuilt their lives, such as empowerment, resilience, courage and the importance of education and meaningful work. Interpreting the findings, empowerment was often juxtaposed with powerlessness, living side by side within the inner world of the long-term survivor of intimate partner violence in equal tension. This study affirms that challenges and legacies from intimate partner violence continue to affect women many years after leaving violence. Despite these challenges and legacies, women work very hard to rebuild their lives, care for their children and attain autonomy, independence and control of their lives. Women spent time and energy to recover &#8216;well enough&#8217; from such violence, in order to lead a productive and functioning life.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Domestic violence</field><field name="subject">Family violence</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Post traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Substance abuse</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakawhiti whakaaro, whakakotahi i a tatou: convergence through consultation</field><field name="creator">Tipuna, Kitea</field><field name="description">None available</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interpretive research paradigm</field><field name="subject">Non-directive interview</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">Tangata whenua</field><field name="subject">maori world view</field><field name="subject">Government process and Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feels like at home - a study of local Chinese media in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Xiao, Yu Michael</field><field name="description">The role of local Chinese media has become more important as the size of the Chinese community in New Zealand has increased rapidly in recent years. The function of local Chinese media could be like a bridge connecting the Chinese community and the mainstream society. This was an exploratory study which examined the current situation of local Chinese media to determine such issues as to whether they are the main source of information for the Chinese community, what if any difficulties they are facing and how they may develop in the future. A general research was conducted for the local Chinese media in Auckland, which covers brief introductions for some local Chinese newspapers, radio, websites, and the sole Chinese television company-World TV. Meanwhile, the researcher collected 102 questionnaires and conducted 10 in-depth interviews from the local Chinese residents and the staff working in local Chinese media companies. The findings of research suggest that most local Chinese residents utilize Chinese language media as a tool to collect daily information either from local society or their original countries. The local Chinese media not only provides information for the local community, but also has social value as a means for self-representation of the Chinese community in New Zealand and better adaptation to the mainstream society. On the other hand, the funding shortage as well as the tough competition became the obstacles for the future development for the local Chinese media. The results of this research may point to what the government&#8217;s role should be.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Questionnaires</field><field name="subject">Face to face interviews</field><field name="subject">Diasporic media</field><field name="subject">Mainstream media</field><field name="subject">Minority media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The swerve: the Elliot Collins handbook</field><field name="creator">Collins, Elliot</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Place holders</field><field name="subject">Punctuation</field><field name="subject">Visual brainstorms</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resurgence</field><field name="creator">Walker, Susan</field><field name="description">The purpose and underlying motivation for this project was to examine the procedure of garment construction methods, by specifically choosing to abandon traditional rules and standards that are associated with mass production.  I chose to explore domestic hand-craft made by women in New Zealand in their domestic situation, focusing on hand-stitched techniques from the past reflecting a nostalgic value which potentially contributed to the garment&#8217;s construction process.  The project sought to utilize the re-using of materials by incorporating previously made hand-craft; and looked at the remaking of second-hand garments by means of deconstruction  and reconstruction. Traditional hand-craft, in this context, refers to the use of craft forms not governed by principles of efficiency, mass production or technology, allowing the garments to contain unique &#8216;one of a kind&#8217; hand-made qualities.  My studio practice specifically focused on exploring the relationship between hand-craft and garment construction, by researching their application and integration into the garment&#8217;s structure, along with disrupting the orderly traditional production process. I was not focusing on the finished garment&#8217;s design. The project provided an opportunity to refocus my attention on the hand-made, as I perceived that the skills required to produce these were being extinguished by modern lifestyles.  Exploration promoted new discoveries by exposing the construction process and revealing unpredicted combinations.  The project explored these ideas, resulting in a range of women&#8217;s garments that revealed, as part of their construction, hand-work which offered a modern variation of nostalgia.  This project comprised of 80% practical work and will be accompanied by an exegesis with a value of 20%.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Garment construction</field><field name="subject">Hand-craft</field><field name="subject">Woman's fashion</field><field name="subject">Traditional clothing construction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">House and contents insurance: an exploration of tactility and narrative</field><field name="creator">Stachl, Erna</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationships between fictional narratives and material objects through writing and sculptural practice. Its purpose is to explore how fiction assists in an understanding of the world we inhabit and, conversely, how our experiences of the world and its real and physically accessible contents (or objects) prevent fiction from transgressing into nonsense. It is anticipated that the combination of material practice and textual fiction will not be an easy marriage: it may be the objects which ultimately give presence to our voices, voices which historically have often attempted to claim and own of things through utterance. The sculptural component of the project addresses the tactility of objects and examines the space where so many tales are told &#8211; the home. In so doing, the project explores issues of isolation and connection through objects and materials which harbour a narrative of ostensible comfort. Objects may simultaneously project conflicting accounts of comfort and unease, connection and isolation, contributing to an articulated consciousness of the home.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Home</field><field name="subject">Mimesis</field><field name="subject">Melancholia</field><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="subject">Fiction</field><field name="subject">Freedom</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is Auckland ready for Chinese travellers?</field><field name="creator">Tian, Feng Sabrina</field><field name="description">The Chinese tourists market has become the 4th largest inbound market for New Zealand in 2007; it also ranks 6th in terms of expenditure. Chinese visitors spent a total of NZ $352 million to the year December 2006, an average of NZ $3,340 per person (Ministry of Tourism, 2006). The latest statistics released from New Zealand Tourism Research Council show that 122,045 Chinese visited New Zealand by the year ended January 2008. These crucial statistics &#8211; market size, length of stay and average spend &#8211; indicate the necessity for the New Zealand tourism industry to understand and provide for Chinese expectations and requirements. Auckland is New Zealand's key gateway, and it is vital that Auckland provides a first good impression for the rest of country. Chinese travellers visit New Zealand with great desire and expectations of experiencing an exotic land. They expect Auckland, as the biggest city in New Zealand, to provide them with a memorable city experience in a developed country. The purpose of this research is to study Chinese tourists' expectations and travel experiences, with a particular focus on investigating whether Auckland can provide suitable services and experiences which match their requirements and expectations. The research will build on the study by Bull (1991) and Ryan (1995), which looked at supply demand relationships and at the tourism industry attempts to balance the supply with the actual demands. It will also build on work by Zhao (2006) and Qu (2006) which explored the dimensions of Chinese demand and distribution channel factors at both origin and destination. The goal is to establish which factors are adequate or inadequate. A synthesis of the demand supply situation will enable the development of recommendations. It is envisage that these recommendations could be adopted by local government and the tourism industry, either as actions or as improvements to policy. With regards to the purpose of this research, a qualitative method was decided as the most relevant approach. Qualitative methods are useful for revealing and understanding what lies are behind any phenomenon about which little is known. Grounded theory is a qualitative research method that was developed for the purpose of studying a social phenomenon, and to generate a theory relating to a particular situation (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1994). The historical bases of the grounded theory approach matches the aim of this research, namely to reveal the relationships between tourists and the tourism industry and to gain a better understanding of Chinese tourists' expectation and satisfaction, and the level of the service which the Auckland tourism industry provides to Chinese travellers needs to match the Chinese market and requirements of travellers. The interviews were conducted with both Chinese travellers and the Auckland tourism industry, including hotel managers, restaurant managers, gift/souvenirs shop assistants, tour guides, and so on. The research shows Auckland is not ready for Chinese market yet. This result comes from three aspects: firstly, most Chinese tourists do not have clear requirements or expectations of Auckland before they come to New Zealand. This is mainly because of the limited promotional materials available in China about Auckland. Secondly, Chinese tourists do not have many opportunities to get to know Auckland's attractions and activities after they arrive in Auckland. Auckland city is New Zealand's most popular urban tourism destination in terms of population and gateway function provides tourism facilities and services to Chinese tourists. However, the findings highlighted most Chinese tourists found Auckland's tourism attractions to be unattractive to them due to the language barrier and itinerary issues. Thirdly, the research also found Chinese tourists have been driven away due to lack of hotel accommodations in Auckland, especially in the shoulder or high seasons. Auckland's accommodation facilities are facing a challenge. The increasing domestic and international visitors' numbers and insufficient hotel accommodations will be the major problem for Auckland for the next decade. Most of the Chinese tourists who were interviewed expressed their hope of knowing more about Auckland, however, these hopes will go unrealised until the city provides better attractions and more services for them.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Chinese tourists</field><field name="subject">Demand and supply</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mind shift: creating change through narrative learning cycles</field><field name="creator">Grainger, Jenny Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the process of an annual appraisal strategy, &#8216;clinical conversation&#8217;, from the perspective of seven nurses who were assessed using this technique.  The findings demonstrate that clinical conversation is a strategy which facilitates reflection, both as a solitary exercise and with others, to ensure that learning from experience is optimized. The research used a qualitative interpretive approach informed by the model of Grounded Theory espoused by Strauss and Corbin.  All eight nurses who were assessed using the clinical conversation strategy were advanced practitioners working within the scope of sexual and reproductive health.  Two of the actual appraisals were observed and seven of the nurses were interviewed within eight weeks of being assessed. The outcome of the clinical conversation was primarily one of learning; the acquisition of new insights into self as practitioner.  The learning was facilitated through the process of narration; telling the story of clinical practice.  Three distinct narrative cycles were identified, each an experiential learning episode.  The experience of undertaking a variety of assessment activities created a narrative with self and triggered an internal reflective thinking process; the experience of working with a peer created an additional narrative, a mutual dialogue reflecting back on practice; the experience of sharing practice with an assessor created a further and final narrative, a learning conversation.   Each narrative can be seen as a catalyst for change.  Primarily, the nurses felt differently about themselves in practice, the way they saw themselves had shifted.  Such a change can be described as an alteration in perspective.  These alterations in perspective led all nurses to identify ways in which they would change their actual clinical practice.  In this way the nurses attempted to align their espoused beliefs about practice with their actual practice. My study shows that each nurse responded differently to each narrative learning cycle: for some the conversation with the assessor was more of a catalyst for change than for others.  In this way clinical conversation may be flexible enough to respond to a variety of differing learning styles.  Learning was person specific which is an imperative for the continued professional development of already highly skilled clinicians. The implication of the research is that whilst clinical conversation was designed as a tool for appraising clinical competence, its intrinsic value lies in supporting the professional development of nurses.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative interpretive</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Clinical appraisal</field><field name="subject">Learning conversation</field><field name="subject">Reflection</field><field name="subject">Professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Project risk management in smaller software teams</field><field name="creator">Crosby, Dave</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates project risk management issues in smaller software teams. Certain gaps in the literature are identified. There is limited literature on what risk management techniques software practitioners use. The studies that are published tend to focus on large software teams. This thesis investigates what risks these smaller teams consider to be important. It also investigates what techniques are perceived to address these risks and how effective those techniques are considered to be. One of those risks is found to be of primary importance, yet this risk is not suggested by the project management literature. This thesis goes on to conduct a more in-depth exploration of that specific risk in the context of these smaller teams Interviews were selected as the most appropriate method to achieve the objectives of the thesis. Nineteen interviews in eight software organisations are conducted to collect data for this thesis. Three different perspectives on project risk were investigated. Those were the perspectives of the; service managers, project managers and developers. Hence a large store of rich information is collated. The results are analysed and a rich set of information is presented in this thesis.  As a result of this research it is suggested that smaller software teams may find it useful to consider the 16 risks discussed in this research and how applicable those risks are to their individual organisation. Service managers may need to do more to raise the awareness of the importance of risks associated with &#8216;customer relationship issues&#8217; within their own organisations. Three risks stood out as areas where future research might be most fruitful. They were; customer relationship issues, introduction of new technology and unrealistic schedules and budgets. Risks related to customer relationship issues were of particular significance and have tended to be over looked in the project management literature. It is submitted that research into standard project risk management approaches may need to be combined with business risk management approaches to gain a full understanding of the risks faced and addressed by these smaller teams.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Project management</field><field name="subject">Software project</field><field name="subject">Small projects</field><field name="subject">Software development</field><field name="subject">Risk management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quadriceps strength prediction equations in individuals with ligamentous injuries, meniscal injuries and/or osteoarthritis of the knee joint</field><field name="creator">Colvin, Matthew</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of eleven prediction equations and one prediction table when estimating isoinertial knee extension and leg press one repetition maximum (1-RM) performance in subjects with knee injuries and knee osteoarthritis. Study Design: A descriptive quantitative research study was undertaken utilizing a cross-sectional design. Background: Traumatic injuries and osteoarthritis are common musculoskeletal pathologies that can disrupt normal function of the knee joint. A frequent sequela of these pathologies is quadriceps femoris muscle weakness. Such weakness can contribute to disability and diminished levels of functional and recreational activity. Therefore, safe and accurate methods of measuring maximal strength are required to identify and quantify quadriceps strength deficits. One option proposed in the literature is the use of 1-RM prediction equations which estimate 1-RM performance from the number of repetitions completed with sub-maximal loads. These equations have been investigated previously using healthy populations and subjects with calf muscle injuries. However, to date, no known study has investigated their accuracy in individuals with joint pathologies. Method: Machine-weight seated knee extension and seated leg press exercises were investigated in this study. Twenty subjects with knee injuries and 12 subjects with knee OA completed the testing procedures for the knee extension exercise. Nineteen subjects with knee injuries and 18 subjects with knee OA completed the testing procedures for the leg press exercise. All subjects attended the testing venue on three occasions. At the first visit a familiarization session was carried out. At the second and third visits each subject was randomly assigned to perform either actual or predicted 1-RM testing for both of the exercises. Twelve different prediction methods were used to estimate 1-RM performance from the results. The estimates of 1-RM strength were then compared to actual 1-RM performance to assess the level of conformity between these measures. Statistical procedures including Bland and Altman analyses, intraclass correlation coefficients, typical error and total error of measurement were used in the analyses of the results. In addition, paired t-tests were performed to determine whether actual 1-RM values were significantly different across the control and affected limbs and whether there were any significant differences in predictive accuracy for each equation across the control and affected limbs. Finally, the number of subjects with predicted 1-RM values within 5% or less of their actual 1-RM values was determined for each equation. Results: When the knee injury group performed the knee extension exercise, the Brown, Brzycki, Epley, Lander, Mayhew et al., Poliquin and Wathen prediction methods demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. When two atypical subjects were identified and excluded from the analyses, the accuracy of these equations improved further. Following the removal of these two subjects, no significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p &gt; 0.05). Typical errors and total errors were low for the more accurate prediction methods ranging from 2.4-2.8% and from 2.4-3.5%, respectively. Overall, the Poliquin table appeared to be the most accurate prediction method for this sample (affected limbs: bias 0.3 kg, 95% limits of agreement (LOA) -5.8 to 6.4 kg, typical error as a coefficient of variation (COV) 2.4%, total error of measurement (total error) 2.4%; control limbs: bias -1.3 kg, 95% LOA -9.0 to 6.3 kg, typical error as a COV 2.7%, total error 2.8%). When the knee OA group performed the knee extension exercise, the Brown, Brzycki, Epley, Lander, Mayhew et al., Poliquin and Wathen prediction methods demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. No significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p &gt; 0.05). When an atypical subject was identified and excluded from the analyses, the accuracy of the equations improved further. Typical errors as COVs and total errors for the more accurate prediction methods ranged from 2.5-2.7% and from 2.4-2.9%, respectively. Overall, the Poliquin table appeared to be the most accurate prediction method for this sample (affected limbs: bias 0.9 kg, 95% LOA -4.5 to 6.3 kg, typical error as a COV 2.5%, total error 2.5%; control limbs: bias -0.1 kg, 95% LOA -6.0 to 5.9 kg, typical error as a COV 2.5%, total error 2.4%). When the knee injury group performed the leg press, the Adams, Berger, Lombardi and O&#8217;Connor equations demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. No significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p &gt; 0.05). Typical errors as COVs and total errors for the more accurate equations ranged from 2.8-3.2% and from 2.9-3.3%, respectively. Overall, the Berger (affected limbs: bias -0.4 kg, 95% LOA -7.2 to 6.3 kg, typical error as a COV 3.2%, total error 3.2%; control limbs: bias 0.1 kg, 95% LOA -6.6 to 6.7 kg, typical error as a COV 3.1%, total error 3.0%) and O&#8217;Connor equations (affected limbs: bias -0.6 kg, 95% LOA-6.8 to 5.7 kg, typical error as a COV 2.9%, total error 3.0%; control limbs: bias -0.2 kg, 95% LOA -6.9 to 6.4 kg, typical error as a COV 2.9%, total error 2.9%) appeared to be the most accurate prediction methods for this sample. When the knee OA group performed the leg press, the Adams, Berger, KLW, Lombardi and O&#8217;Connor equations demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. No significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p &gt; 0.05). The typical errors as COVs and the total error values for the more accurate prediction methods were the highest observed in this study, ranging from 5.8-6.0% and from 5.7-6.2%, respectively. Overall, the Adams, Berger, KLW and O&#8217;Connor equations appeared to be the most accurate prediction methods for this sample. However, it is possible that the predicted leg press 1-RM values produced by the knee OA group might not have matched actual 1-RM values closely enough to be clinically acceptable for some purposes. Conclusion: The findings of the current study suggested that the Poliquin table produced the most accurate estimates of knee extension 1-RM performance for both the knee injury and knee OA groups. In contrast, the Berger and O&#8217;Connor equations produced the most accurate estimates of leg press 1-RM performance for the knee injury group, while the Adams, Berger, KLW and O&#8217;Connor equations produced the most accurate results for the knee OA group. However, the higher error values observed for the knee OA group suggested that predicted leg press 1-RM performance might not be accurate enough for some clinical purposes. Finally, it can be concluded that no single prediction equation was able to accurately estimate both knee extension and leg press 1-RM performance in subjects with knee injuries and knee OA.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quadriceps</field><field name="subject">Strength prediction equations</field><field name="subject">Knee OA</field><field name="subject">Knee injuries</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnic minority migrant Chinese in New Zealand: a study into their acculturation and workplace interpersonal conflict experiences</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, Nancy</field><field name="description">This study makes an important academic contribution by adding a new dimension to the existing scholarly literature on the acculturative processes of immigrants through its findings from an investigation into ethnic minority migrant Chinese Chinese&#8217;s acculturation experiences in relation to workplace interpersonal conflict in New Zealand. The literature reviewed illustrates the complexities of the acculturation process for immigrants and is of prime importance and relevance to this study. The literature provides an informed academic foundation that aligns with the subject matter under study. The focus of this study is on the acculturation process experienced by ethnic minority migrant Chinese in New Zealand as they strive to adapt to various aspects of their new surroundings. The study inquires into whether the length of acculturation has an influence on ethnic minority migrant Chinese&#8217;s handling of workplace interpersonal conflict in the New Zealand. The researcher&#8217;s interest in conducting this study arises from her own personal acculturation and workplace interpersonal conflict experiences as an ethnic minority migrant Chinese. A phenomenological interpretive research methodology was adopted for this study. One-on-one indepth interviews of 25 ethnic minority migrant Chinese from China (Mainland), Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,  and Vietnam provided primary data on the individual migrant&#8217;s experience and perspective on acculturation and workplace interpersonal conflict in New Zealand. The findings from the 25 ethnic minority migrant Chinese interviewed reveal the complexities and difficulties in the acculturation process, as they attempt to adapt to various aspects of their new environment. The adaptive strategies used almost certainly mean that the immigrants will have to make changes in their thinking, attitude, speech, and social conduct. There is a particular emphasis on the study of intercultural dynamics at play in the face of workplace interpersonal conflict between immigrants and members of the host society.  The acculturation process is made more difficult for migrants who have negative workplace encounters in their intercultural interactions resulting in misunderstandings and conflict. The findings also reveal the migrants&#8217; response mechanisms, particularly in learning to be more assertive. This study found that the cultural orientations of the ethnic migrant Chinese are such that for many, this concept (assertiveness) has to be learned since it runs counter to their educational, cultural tradition, and familial upbringing. The principles of Confucianism are deeply rooted, such as respect for authority and an emphasis on &#8216;giving-face&#8217; to others and preserving social harmony. From this study&#8217;s findings, there is empirical evidence that Confucian principles are deeply entrenched in the ethnic minority migrant Chinese&#8217; psyche irrespective of which country of origin they come from. In addition, the findings show that the acculturation experiences are unique to the individual migrant, depending on the person&#8217;s previous exposure to a foreign environment, language proficiency and personality. This study shows that the acculturation process experienced by these migrants was a period of personal growth and development, acquiring self-confidence, self-rationalisation, changes, and adjustments. Also, the findings reveal that while the length of residence in the host country is a significant factor for these migrants, other factors are significant as well, such as acquiring a certain level of language proficiency and increasing self-confidence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Migrant</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">Acculturation</field><field name="subject">Workplace</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal relationships</field><field name="subject">Conflict</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research approach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflections on Lal Batti</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Chander</field><field name="description">This project draws on aspects of research into the plight of women prostitutes working in Lal Batti areas of India.

The ethnic comparison of body composition may help to explain and understand the difference of health outcomes and health status in different ethnic groups. NZ Chinese is the largest Asian group in New Zealand, however, knowledge about health risks and body composition for NZ Chinese is very limited. Therefore, the aims of this thesis were: 1) To compare the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and percentage body fat (%BF) of European (M29, F37), Maori (M23, F23), Pacific people (M15, F23), and Asian Indian (M29, F25) (existing data) with NZ Chinese aged 30-39 years; 2) To compare fat distribution, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ApSM), bone mineral density (BMD) and limb bone lengths across these five ethnic groups.  A convenience sample of healthy NZ Chinese (M20, F23) was selected by BMI to cover a wide range of body fatness. Total and regional body fat, fat free mass (FFM) and bone mineral content were measured by whole-body Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The main study findings were: &#8226;	For a fixed BMI, NZ Chinese had a higher %BF than European and less %BF than Asian Indian. At a %BF equivalent to a BMI of 30 kg.m-2 in Europeans (WHO threshold for obesity), BMI values for Asian Indian and NZ Chinese women were 5.8 and 2.2 BMI units lower than European, respectively, and for Asian Indian and NZ Chinese men, 8.2 and 3.0 BMI units lower. &#8226;	Abdominal-to-thigh fat ratio of NZ Chinese was significantly higher than that of European (P&lt;0.001) and similar to that of Asian Indian. NZ Chinese had a significantly higher central-to-appendicular fat ratio than both Asian Indian and European (P&lt;0.001). NZ Chinese was centrally fatter than European and Asian Indian. &#8226;	For the same height and weight, NZ Chinese had significantly less FFM (-2.1 kg, P=0.039) and ApSM (-1.4kg, P=0.007) than European. NZ Chinese had significantly more FFM (+3.2 kg, P=0.001) than Asian Indian and similar ApSM to Asian Indian. &#8226;	For the same weight, NZ Chinese had a similar BMD as European for female and male. NZ Chinese male had a higher BMD (+0.07 g.cm-2, P= 0.001) than Asian Indian male. &#8226;	Among the five ethnic groups, NZ Chinese had the shortest leg (-1.5cm, P=0.016) and arm bone lengths (-2.3cm, P=0.001) (measured by DEXA) for the same DEXA height.  Therefore, the relationship between percent body fat and BMI for Asian Indian and NZ Chinese differs from Europeans and from each other, which indicates that different BMI thresholds for obesity may be required for these Asian ethnic groups. Given the relatively high percentage body fat, low appendicular skeletal muscle mass and high central fat to appendicular fat ratio of NZ Chinese aged 30-39 years demonstrated in this study, promotion of healthy eating and physical activity is needed to be tailored for NZ Chinese. The NZ Chinese community should be advised to keep fit, prevent limited movements in older age, and to prevent obesity and obesity-related diseases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">Body composition</field><field name="subject">DEXA</field><field name="subject">BMI</field><field name="subject">Body fat</field><field name="subject">Ethnic comparison</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding user's perceived playfulness toward mobile information and entertainment services in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chou, Jacky Po Ching</field><field name="description">The convergence of mobile commerce and internet technologies has promised users unprecedented convenience and greater enjoyment. Over the past few years, the development of mobile information and entertainment services (MIES) has been phenomenal. Recently, research has been conducted into ways toward better acceptance of these services by users. However, many of these studies are technical driven, without discussing important end user needs. To understand users' perception associated with mobile information and entertainment services the author extended and empirically tested a new antecedent model of Perceived Playfulness an intrinsic motivator toward technology acceptance by users, based on previous research. It has been shown that user's Perceived Playfulness toward information technologies has a direct impact on his/her subsequent use. Using the new antecedent model of Perceived Playfulness, the author argues users' Autotelic Personality, Perceived Service Quality, Perceived Technology Compatibility, their Motivation for Using and tolerance of Social Influence affect their Perceived Playfulness when interacting with MIES. A questionnaire was administered to students in business and computing schools at Auckland University of Technology. The closed-ended questions within the questionnaire were used to validate the proposed research model. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares. Most of the proposed hypotheses were supported, rendering several significant findings in this thesis. In this study, it has been found that individuals who are more innovative and confident about using MIES are more likely to develop a positive image toward these services. They also value services that are useful and easy to use and demonstrate high enthusiasm for more personalized mobile services. More importantly, their perceptions toward MIES can be further reinforced if their mobile phone functionalities are highly compatible with these services. Therefore, service providers should strive to create a seamless MIES experience for users. Furthermore, given that mobile phones have their own strengths and limitations, the motivation behind user's choices of various applications becomes an important issue for service providers to consider. It has been shown that the importance of service attributes vary with user's motivations of using MIES. This study therefore focuses on several important end user issues which are not well explored in the research of mobile internet services. Overall, this study contributed to existing research into user s perception toward MIES as an information technology based on his/her intrinsic motivator. Several important antecedents have been identified to influence user's Perceived Playfulness in this context. Limitations and suggestions for future studies are considered at the end of this thesis. Implications are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile services</field><field name="subject">Mobile commerce</field><field name="subject">MIES</field><field name="subject">Perceived Playfulness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A thematic analysis of recent PHARMAC new medicines' subsidy decisions</field><field name="creator">Villers, Trevor</field><field name="description">PHARMAC, the Pharmaceutical Management Agency, manages the Pharmaceutical Schedule on behalf of the Government.

In determining which pharmaceuticals to fund, PHARMAC&#8217;s Operating Policies and Procedures (OPPs) state that nine criteria guide its decision- making. The OPPs further state that PHARMAC can apply whatever weight it sees fit to the application of these criteria. I undertook a thematic analysis of 20 cases referred by PHARMAC&#8217;s principal medical advisory body, the Pharmacology and Therapeutic Advisory Committee (PTAC), to PHARMAC during the period February 2004 to November 2006 to determine whether these criteria were acknowledged in the official minutes of the respective bodies. PTAC is similarly required to take account of the abiding decision criteria. I also sought to determine whether other factors were apparent in guiding the decisions. There was evidence that PHARMAC consistently applied the decision criteria. PTAC was less assiduous in recording its application. In addition, I found that PHARMAC takes account of factors outside the stated criteria. I noted that PHARMAC takes particular account of the degree to which a decision might be publicly, politically or medically contentious in its decision-making.  I also found evidence that consistency with prior decisions is another factor which PHARMAC takes into account, though does not apply routinely. This research indicates that PHARMAC does take account of its abiding decision criteria, applying health needs as well as fiscal criteria, though the weighting given each criterion is nowhere apparent in its official minutes. There remains an opportunity for evaluative research to determine whether fiscal considerations &#8216;outweigh&#8217; needs considerations in PHARMACs decision-making.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thematic analysis</field><field name="subject">PHARMAC</field><field name="subject">Subsidy</field><field name="subject">Medical funding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fine balance</field><field name="creator">Sye, Jill</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to analyse the discourses drawn upon by community paediatric nurses in relation to children&#8217;s rights to health. The philosophy of Michel Foucault has been used to underpin the analysis of the interviews and exemplars of five experienced community nurses, revealing conflicting power relationships and discourses. Rights are formalised morality and so from a children&#8217;s rights perspective, discourses reflect both the moral and ethical positions of the nurses. Children are constructed as developing human beings whose moral status gradually changes and who, through a lack of developmental autonomy, entrust their decision-making to their representatives (parents and caregivers) as their trustees. Rights are correlative with the obligations and duties toward children by both families and society. Society constructs legislative and politically organised structures to govern raising children because children are an intrinsic social concern. Whilst representing society&#8217;s interest in children&#8217;s rights to health, nurses in the home act as a conduit for multiple governing structures. The nurses in this study construct their &#8220;truths&#8221; and knowledge about children&#8217;s health rights from nursing, medicine, law, education, and social policy. However, the values of individual parents can conflict with universal values for children&#8217;s health and wellbeing. Therefore representing society positions nurses as &#8220;agents of the state&#8221;, a role that potentially holds power over parents and children and leads to the epithet of &#8220;the health police&#8221;. Within the institution of the family, and in the privacy of the home, there are also mechanisms of power that can resist the mechanisms of the state and its representatives. Therefore the discourse &#8220;it takes a village to raise a child&#8221; competes with the &#8220;my home is my castle&#8221; discourse. Nurses negotiate a fine balance between these power relations. Nurses are challenged with using power productively to promote children&#8217;s rights whilst respecting the role of parents and families. I argue that children&#8217;s rights are central to the moral and ethical work of nurses but that such work is often obscured and invisible. I propose that children&#8217;s community nurses are excellent at negotiating networking and connecting at a micro level, but need to create a more sophisticated and cohesive entity at a macro level to become fully political children&#8217;s rights advocates.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Community children's nurses perceptions and practices</field><field name="subject">Childrens rights to health</field><field name="subject">Family centred care discourse</field><field name="subject">Child centred discourse</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing the nature of relationships between organisations and their stakeholders: a stakeholder and organisational enablers relationships (SOER) framework</field><field name="creator">Karabadogomba, Jean Pierre</field><field name="description">Little is known about how employees in New Zealand companies view their organisation&#8217;s involvement in community-based initiatives that attempt to address areas of social needs. Understanding what people and organisations think from their frame of reference (Taylor &amp; Bodgan, 1998) on ways of contributing to enhance community wellbeing is of high importance within a nation growing in diversity, and where everyone needs to fully participate in building a harmonious society (Ministry of Social Development, 2005; Swanson, 2002). Despite abundant extant research and many models already developed, frameworks in this area are fragmented. A case study approach has been adopted using one New Zealand Company to test a preliminary framework, Stakeholders and Organisational Enablers Relationship (SOER) Model, that analyses &#8220;the nature of relationships in terms of processes and outcomes for the business and its stakeholders&#8221; (Jones &amp; Wicks, 1999, p. 207). From investigating the company&#8217;s community involvement from the employees&#8217; perspective, results indicate that this particular company is engaging with the community, supporting and empowering employees to participate in the company&#8217;s community programme and thereby making a difference in the community by giving to the community. However, in general terms, solving recurring social, economic, political and psychological issues that influence social wellbeing requires cooperation between public, private, and voluntary sectors of the community (New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development, New Zealand Ministry of Social Development, New Zealand Dept of Labour, &amp; New Zealand Dept of Statistics, 2003; Roberts &amp; King, 1989; Steane, 1999). While the results from the case company reported in this study demonstrate that community engagement is being taken seriously by exemplary private sector companies, generalisation of these findings would require further cross-sectional research across industries and organisations from all sectors: private, public and voluntary.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder theory</field><field name="subject">Community wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Corporate community involvement</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder and Organisational Relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Border crossing: work-life balance issues with Chinese entrepreneurs in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chan, Camellia</field><field name="description">Work-life balance is a dominant discourse in contemporary Western society. It has been built on a language of large organizations, hence has not been widely considered in relation to the small-medium enterprise sector. As a consequence, scant research has been conducted on the experiences of immigrant entrepreneurs and work-life balance within the small-medium enterprise sector in New Zealand, a country largely populated with migrants and small businesses which account for 96 per cent of the total enterprises. This study aims to fill this gap by firstly exploring the interpretations of the concept of work-life balance by Chinese immigrant entrepreneurs and, secondly, the main challenges they face in achieving work-life balance. This is done by drawing on literatures including those on work-life balance, small-medium enterprises, and immigrant entrepreneurship theories. Primary research was conducted using a critical interpretive approach where the researcher is an insider to the study. This philosophical and methodological approach makes it possible to give a minority group a voice to effect social change and gain further research attention. Fifteen Chinese business owners, chosen from a variety of industries within the Auckland region, participated in this study. A qualitative methodological technique and semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data for the case study on these entrepreneurs. The results indicate that the majority do not enjoy a sense of work-life balance because they take on filial obligations important for their own culture. They need to work hard to generate financial profit for the benefit of family. About half of them work more than 60 hours per week and three works longer than 70 hours weekly. The motivation for them to work in this way is to provide their family with desirable housing and to enable their children to meet higher education goals.  This study challenges the applicability of the work-life balance discourse among the immigrant entrepreneurs who perceive the concept differently based on their cultural values. The results emphasise the need for business case studies from Chinese immigrant entrepreneurs and research attention on contemporary human resource topics to be given to minority groups.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigrant entrepreneurship theories</field><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">Organizational citizenship behavior</field><field name="subject">Small and Medium Enterprises</field><field name="subject">Organisational citizenship behaviour</field><field name="subject">Familial obligations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of sagittal plane postures on trunk rotation range of motion</field><field name="creator">Montgomery, Trevor</field><field name="description">Axial rotation is regarded as an essential movement of the trunk that allows many individuals to participate in vocations, sports and activities of daily living. Unfortunately when the destabilising nature of rotation is combined with that of spinal flexion, the risk of injuring the spine can increase significantly. Few studies have investigated the potential benefits that maximizing trunk rotation has in certain vocation and sport-related arenas and none have looked at whether adopting certain spinal postures in the sagittal plane can maximise trunk rotation more than others.  The aim of the study was to determine the effects of alterations of trunk inclination, spinal posture, pelvic fixation and turning direction on the active range of motion (ROM) of trunk rotation. Twenty healthy individuals participated in the main study. Retro-reflective markers were placed on key anatomical locations and used to track the movement of the thorax and pelvis during a series of repeated maximal trunk rotations in ten different spinal positions within the sagittal plane. Trunk kinematics and kinetics were recorded simultaneously using an optoelectronic motion analysis and force platform measuring system. A repeated-measures multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test for the main effects of trunk inclination, spinal posture, fixation of pelvis and direction of turn on maximum active ROM of trunk rotation, maximum pelvic rotation and the anterior-posterior and lateral displacement of the centre of pressure (COP). To investigate test-retest reliability, ten participants were tested on two separate days. Repeatability for each outcome measure was investigated using interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland Altman graphs. The majority of subjects showed reasonable test-retest reliability for trunk rotation measures in each of the test positions, with ICC&#8217;s ranging between 0.562 &#8211; 0.731. Overall, trunk inclination (0&#176;, 22.5&#176;, 45&#176;) forward in the sagittal plane had a significant effect on trunk and pelvic rotation (p&lt;0.001) and lateral displacement of the COP (p&lt;0.005) during trunk rotation. As trunk inclination increased from 0&#176; to 45&#176; there was an average increase in trunk rotation ROM of approximately 10 % (approximately 3.4&#176;). Furthermore, increasing trunk inclination led to an increase in lateral displacement of the COP and a decrease in pelvic rotation. Spinal posture (neutral, flexed, extended) at a forward inclination of 45&#176; had a significant effect on trunk rotation (p&lt;0.01) and pelvic rotation (p&lt;0.05), with a neutral spine averaging approximately 3 % (approximately 1.1&#176;) more trunk rotation than a flexed or extended posture.  The position and posture of the spine in the sagittal plane appears to have a significant influence on ranges of trunk rotation. The study suggests that rotating the trunk when adopting a neutral spine inclined to 45&#176; will maximise range of trunk rotation and encourage a natural stabilisation of the lower body. This posture meets the unique set of biomechanical requirements for the sport of golf and may help to reduce the risk of injury in manual material handling tasks. Conversely, rotating the trunk whilst the thoracolumbar spine is flexed leads to a reduction in trunk rotation ROM, encourages greater pelvic and lower body rotation, reduces torque production of the trunk and may increase the risk of lower back injury. These findings have important implications in relation to the teaching of spinal position during vocations, sports and activities of daily living that seek to maximise trunk rotation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trunk rotation</field><field name="subject">Trunk inclination</field><field name="subject">Spine posture</field><field name="subject">Randomised repeated measures</field><field name="subject">Pelvic fixation</field><field name="subject">Range of motion ROM</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The classroom as a learning community?

This thesis explores what eight postgraduate students judged to be their &#8216;best&#8217; classroom experiences within one New Zealand university. The researcher started from the assumption that the students&#8217; &#8216;best&#8217; classroom experiences  would correspond with what the literature characterises as &#8216;communities of learners&#8217; in which the students felt that their past experiences were valued and personal relationships were respectful and relatively equal.  This assumption was, for the most part, accurate.  Problematic areas, such as assessment, were also identified. International students&#8217; experiences were a key part of the research. Six of the students were studying in their second language yet that alone was not the main indicator of classroom participation as personality (such as shyness)also affected how students engaged with the course content, the lecturers, and with each other. The case study approach raises possibilities and questions as well as recognising trends that suggest that postgraduate students value interactive learning within meaningful classroom contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community of learning</field><field name="subject">Tertiary classroom experiences</field><field name="subject">Constructivist approach</field><field name="subject">Learning communities</field><field name="subject">Interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perceptions of a group of first year undergraduate Malawian students of the essay writing process</field><field name="creator">Kalikokha, Chimwemwe</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of the essay writing process of first year undergraduates at Chancellor College (University of Malawi) and to a lesser extent those of the lecturers responsible for teaching academic skills. A mixed methods design, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques, was employed in order to obtain richer data for deeper understanding of the students&#8217; writing process. Two hundred students from the humanities and social science faculties responded to a self-completion questionnaire towards the end of semester one. Based on the students&#8217; responses, an open-ended questionnaire was administered to four full time English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instructors. Findings from this study indicate that most students find it very challenging to obtain sufficient and relevant source text information, paraphrase or summarise information, and use an appropriate academic writing style. As solutions to these challenges, the students suggested the need for timely essay writing instruction, availability of resources for essay writing, increased amount of time spent on essay writing instruction, and discipline specific instruction in essay writing. EAP instructors identified lack of teaching and learning materials, large EAP classes, and students&#8217; negative attitude towards the EAP course, as some of the challenges they encounter when teaching the course. The EAP instructors proposed an increase in the number of staff members, making students aware of the significance of the EAP course at an early stage, and the availability of up to date resources, as some of the ways in which the teaching of the course can be improved. Overall, the findings seem to suggest that difficulties that students encounter during the writing process and teaching challenges that EAP instructors face, have great impact on students&#8217; perception of academic writing as well as their approach to writing tasks. The findings also suggest a lack of dialogue between the students and their lecturers. This is evident in students&#8217; unawareness of the nature of the writing demands of their lecturers and disciplines; students&#8217; desire to have timely essay writing instruction; and the lecturers&#8217; concerns about students&#8217; negative attitude towards the EAP course.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication between lecturers and students</field><field name="subject">Tertiary writing skills</field><field name="subject">Essay writing strategies</field><field name="subject">Academic writing challenges</field><field name="subject">English for Academic Purposes EAP</field><field name="subject">Tertiary instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing positive physical activity experiences, perceptions and habits: a soccer based intervention in children</field><field name="creator">Tegg, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Levels of participation in physical activity and sport by the New Zealand population are in decline, whilst the levels of sedentary behaviours are rising. Developing positive physical activity experiences, perceptions and habits in childhood may provide an effective approach to decrease the burden of inactivity. The purpose of this thesis was to improve knowledge of the efficacy of a sport-based intervention to increase physical activity levels of New Zealand children from a low socio-economic background. This was achieved by implementing an after-school soccer intervention at two low decile schools in Auckland, New Zealand. To determine current levels of physical activity, fifty-eight children wore a NL-2000 pedometer for four consecutive days (three weekdays and one weekend). Mean step counts (&#177; SD) for boys were 17018 (&#177; 4640) and for girls 12415 (&#177; 4329) on weekdays, and for boys 12507 (&#177; 4338) and girls 9537 (&#177; 4421) on weekends. Nearly 50% of girls and 37% of boys were not reaching previously published daily step count recommendations of 15,000 for boys and 12,000 for girls during weekdays. The feasibility and efficacy of a six-week after-school soccer programme (2/hr.wk-1) on physical activity levels of 70 children (43 boys, 27 girls) compared to a control group of 25 children (23 boys, 2 girls) was determined in a randomised controlled trial. Measures of physical activity (4 day sealed pedometry), mass and height were completed at baseline, Week 6 (end of the intervention), and at three-month post-intervention. Compared to control, participants in the soccer programme attained higher weekday step counts after 6 weeks (treatment 16980 &#177; 4515; control 15021 &#177; 3783) and these were sustained three months post-intervention (treatment 16218 &#177; 4591; control 14591 &#177; 3488). However, these step count differences were not statistically significant. When children were grouped into activity tertiles (low, moderate and highly active) the intervention effect was more evident in the low to moderately active children. Further analysis revealed that the treatment groups&#8217; moderate activity tertile was significantly more active than the control at follow up (p = 0.0399). This programme may offer a viable alternative to traditional physical activity interventions which concentrate on other forms of physical activity accumulation such as active transport and physical education. However, additional research needs to be carried out to determine whether the absence of statistical differences is simply a lack of statistical power.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Sport</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Intervention</field><field name="subject">After-school</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating suitable pitch sizes for young football players in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gerdsen, Willy</field><field name="description">Whilst smaller pitches have become the norm in junior football, they may still be too large for certain ages and levels of skill. To date there has been no research into the relationships between size of the pitch and the technical kicking ability (distance and accuracy) of young players (8 - 14 years of age). The purpose of this investigation was to examine variables that influence actual kicking distance and accuracy and also to measure what differences in play behaviour (passing and dribbling) emerge from self-selected changes in pitch size for different age groups (9 and 10 years of age). Data were collected on 120 (N=120) junior football players: Playing experience (M=2.85 years, SD=2.56), Height (M=1.44 m, SD=1.08), Weight (M=37.8 kg, SD=7.69), Lengths of lower limbs (knee/ankle: M=35.54 cm, SD=4.27; hip/knee: M=35.54 cm, SD=5.25), Step lengths (M=37.66 cm, SD=8.693), Estimated kicking distance (M=31.13 m, SD=16.63). Participants performed a series of three kicks along the ground, using the inside of the foot, and aiming for a target (25 m away). The distance (M=18.04 m; SD=6.56) and accuracy (M=8.32 m; SD=4.38) of each kick were measured. The children (9 and 10 years of age) were then assigned to teams and asked to construct a small-sided game on two different pitch sizes. The first pitch size used was the recommended regulation size. The second pitch size was self-selected by the players. Any changes to the playing dimensions (e.g., width of the pitch) and playing behaviours (e.g., total number of passes, dribbling) were measured and analysed. Kicking distance is best predicted by the player&#8217;s height (20.0%, P &lt; 0.000), or a combination of the player&#8217;s height and estimated kicking distance (30.0%, P = 0.002). Kicking accuracy can be attributed to the influence of the player&#8217;s step lengths (8.1%, P = 0.016) and both their step lengths and estimated kicking distance (15.1%, P = 0.020). Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the increase in pitch size (18.5% and 25%) resulted in a greater amount of dribbling (63% and 33%) and passing (12%). In general, our results support the idea that young children in New Zealand should be playing on a pitch and at a skill level which matches their football abilities. Grouping young players on a pitch according to their physical (e.g., height) and technical kicking ability (e.g., distance, accuracy) instead of their chronological age, seems to be the key factor to any other set of proposals. The findings of this thesis have important messages that could enhance the effectiveness of coaching, competitive game-play (pitch sizes) and consequently performance at all junior levels of football in New Zealand. Further research should manipulate the number of players per team to see if this factor affects competitive game-play in junior football. Additionally, the mean distances maintained between players in the same team (team-mates) during game play needs to be considered (with regard to the &#8216;beehive effect&#8217;). Further studies should examine different age groups of equivalent skill level and assess their performance in relation to their technical kicking ability on different pitches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soccer field size</field><field name="subject">Pitch dimensions</field><field name="subject">Children's sports</field><field name="subject">Sports skills acquisition</field><field name="subject">Quasi-experiemental method</field><field name="subject">Methods of association and difference</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design of dialogue</field><field name="creator">Crowe, Peter</field><field name="description">With the first commitment of the Kyoto Protocol commencing in 2008, many signatory governments have identified bio fuels as a favoured response to the problem of fulfilling their countries' pledges to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels. Despite the tendency for pressure over climate change to expedite the commercialisation process, detailed evaluation of the claimed benefits, likely efficacy or environmental impact of bio fuels in New Zealand in the form of the Bio fuels Sales Obligation policy (BSO): a mandate place on the Oil Companies to supply a percentage of bio fuel.  Systems thinking propound the notion of complex interrelatedness: a pivotal concept in our current understanding of the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and their relationship to climate change. It also recognizes that the multiple ways in which different stakeholders perceive a contentious question are an integral feature of any problematical situation. By applying systems concepts to qualitative research, Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) is therefore particularly suitable for the analysis of multiple stakeholder discourse in this situation. The present study employs SSM to examine stakeholder opinion through the construction of conceptual models in the form of rich pictures and root definitions. The researcher invited diverse stakeholders to &#8216;see what they were thinking&#8217; and reflect upon the beliefs and assumptions that informed their views with respect to New Zealand bio fuels development. With reference to official documentation arising from the policy development process and through a series of interviews and a focus group, the research examines perceptions of the consultation process on bio fuels development and its contribution to informed decision-making. The study data indicates that the scope of enquiry tended to be restricted by early presuppositions regarding the consultation process and its desired outcomes, which consequently shifted the focus of consultation the enquiry from an assessment of the desirability of bio fuels to an appraisal of the feasibility of government policy. However inadvertently, communication was distorted. The research examines the basic assumptions that shaped the discourse and enabled already established opinions to prevail. Furthermore, the thesis explores how using SSM to surface tacit assumptions and challenge proposed models of intervention can help improve the reflexivity of discourse and decision-making. By ensuring open communication remains at the centre of discourse, SSM could provide a means of establishing productive conditions for learning and co-creative dialogue. Consequently the study has important implications for how the &#8216;health&#8217; of public discourse in New Zealand might be sustained when addressing other similarly complex issues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soft Systems Methodology</field><field name="subject">Biofuels</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder discourse</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Rich pictures</field><field name="subject">Focus group</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Observing mothers lifting their children in their own home to identify factors which might give rise to musculoskeletal disorders</field><field name="creator">McKay, Renee</field><field name="description">The lifting associated with childcare has been linked to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in mothers (Griffin &amp; Price, 2000; Sanders &amp; Morse, 2005). The purpose of the current study was to investigate, for the first time through observation, the lifting of young children by mothers in the home environment to identify risk factors which might give rise to MSDs. Twenty five mothers with one or two children weighing between 9 and 15kg (n = 30) completed a self-report survey modified for the New Zealand context (The Ergonomics of Caring for Children (Sanders &amp; Morse, 2005)). They also took part in a structured observation of lifting in the home using a checklist based on the New Zealand Manual Handling Hazard Control Record NZMHHCR (OSH &amp; ACC, 2001). Modifications were derived from careful consultation of current literature to enable contributory factors related to the load, the mother, the environment and the task to be assessed and a rating of low, medium, or high risk to be assigned to each factor. A protocol to guide risk assessment was developed to accompany the tool. The modified observational checklist was named the OMLITH (Observing Mothers Lifting In The Home). Survey data identified the mothers as aged between 28 and 40 years, predominantly NZ European, and of average height (&#967; = 1.69cm) and weight (Body Mass Index = 24). The children in the sample weighed between 9 and 14.5kg and had an average age of 17months. All the mothers were either married (n=20) or living with a significant other (n=5) and their partners frequently (n=13) or always (n=12) helped with childcare. The mean time mothers spent per week on the following activities were: sleep, 6.8hrs (n=25), housework, 14.9hrs (n=25), exercise, 2.9hrs (n=22), watching television or using the home computer, 4.3hrs (n=22), hobbies, 2.2hrs (n=19), gardening or home maintenance, 2.9hrs (n=18). Thirteen of the mothers worked (3 full-time, 10 part-time) and 20 mothers used childcare services. Ratings of the physical stress associated with 50 childcare tasks showed that mothers differentiated between tasks in terms of physical stress to a significant degree (p.000), typically rating &#8216;Bending while carrying a child&#8217; as almost twice as stressful as the average rating. Other categories rated significantly above the average stress rating were:  &#8216;Use of a backpack to carry infant/child&#8217;, &#8216;Use of baby jogger&#8217;, &#8216;Carrying child on your shoulders&#8217;, &#8216;Standing bent over to wash child in bath or sink&#8217;, &#8216;Lifting child into or out of cot&#8217;, &#8216;Prolonged squatting or stooping while playing with child&#8217;, and &#8216;Placing child in car seat or removing child from car seat&#8217;. Mothers reported experiencing MSDs most commonly in the low back (n=16), and the neck, shoulder and upper back (n=8 each).  Data from the 87 observations using the OMLITH showed that children were a challenging load due to their moving centre of gravity, and were often unpredictable or awkward to handle. The grip required to lift a child more often than not fell outside the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommendation. In 72.9% of tasks the child&#8217;s weight created a high risk level. The lifting tasks involved horizontal and vertical lift distances that presented a moderate to high risk level in 82.8% of situations. Lifting while twisting and side-bending was assigned a moderate to high risk level in 72.4% of tasks. Risk associated with working at an externally controlled pace; and handling children while seated or kneeling/crouching was also observed. The home environment presented risk associated with obstacles, a variety of floor surfaces and stairs or slopes. Mothers were also observed lifting in confined spaces. Individual factors identified as important considerations were: a mismatch between mothers&#8217; strength and fitness and the lifting requirements, pain or injury, pregnancy, and fatigue. The structured checklist proved to be an appropriate tool to identify the contributory risk factors present when mothers lift in the home and to make an assessment of the level of risk. Results suggest a notable number of risk factors which might give rise to MSDs are present when mothers lift their children at home. The author concludes that further research is warranted to quantify risks, to identify prevention strategies for MSDs in this population, and to guide health providers with regard to treatment and rehabilitation of mothers with MSDs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lifting</field><field name="subject">Mothers</field><field name="subject">Ergonomics</field><field name="subject">Quantitative descriptive design</field><field name="subject">Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Observation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile data services adoption in New Zealand: future predictions</field><field name="creator">Cosgrove, Steve</field><field name="description">The fast pace of development in the Mobile Data Services area means innovators have to remain vigilant to stay in the market.  There is not time to undertake the usual market development cycles.  As a consequence, researchers are looking at various ways to predict the adoption rate of a new product and ways to better forecast adoption in different niche contexts.  Rogers&#8217; (2003) provides a review of historical trends in innovation and diffusion studies, and the foundational (1962) model he developed.  In the context of the most recent literature, it is found that Rogers&#8217; generic model still works well, but variations built on his model need to be considered.  In particular, the &#8216;Chasm&#8217; model, developed by Moore (1999), adapts Rogers&#8217;s model to cope well with the 21st century business environment. Gilbert (2005) has taken the work of both Rogers and Moore and applied the learning to research into adoption rates and characteristics in cross-cultural situations. In New Zealand the past consumer behaviour when new mobile services have been introduced has shown a number of characteristics and specific problems. Vodafone New Zealand provides mobile services only and they now claim 54% market share (Vodafone 2005`).  An early success was to significantly lower the cost of sending text messages (SMS), followed by promotion of that service to the teenage market sector.  In contrast to the popularity of SMS, introduction of the WAP mobile Internet protocol was not successful in New Zealand, as was the case elsewhere. The failure is commonly attributed to a lack of services being offered to use the technology. Near the end of 2004 Telecom New Zealand launched a new product, branded &#8216;T3G&#8217;.  Vodafone New Zealand released &#8216;Vodafone 3G&#8217; during the middle of 2005.  The technologies behind these products is generally called &#8216;3G Mobile&#8217;, or Third Generation Mobile technology.  Operators in Singapore also have 3G networks, commissioned during 2004.   Authors such as Salz et el (2004) find evidence to suggest that US network operators need to speed up the adoption of this technology to meet predicted demand. There are unique factors likely to affect in the New Zealand market.  The OECD has repeatedly found evidence that broadband Internet adoption in New Zealand is lower than other countries.  Introduction of 3G technology provides another way to access broadband Internet.  The OECD indicates that pricing is one of the barriers to broadband adoption.  Telephone companies will have to consider pricing 3G to appeal as an option to having a fixed Internet option. The key question to be addressed in this research is: Do the adoption intensions of New Zealanders match those of Malaysia and Singapore for expected data services use? A related question is: What other factors effect New Zealand's current relatively slow rate of adoption? Product positioning of mobile data products is going to become more critical, given that some telephone operators are &#8216;expecting to get 25% of revenues from mobile data within five years&#8217; (Molony, 2001).  This Thesis will provide information to assist Mobile Service Providers to predict adoption rates of new services.  It will also provide a comparative reference for researchers in other countries to replicate the study, and contribute to an exciting body of international literature.  The New Zealand market is characterised by high cost of broadband Internet in general (OECD, TUANZ, and others), proprietary knowledge capture, and regulation, but these issues do not stop research into the intensions of potential adopters. This thesis will fill part of that research void, by comparing emergent demand for mobile data with existing models, which have previously been used, to predict future demand. New Zealand has a reputation as an earlier adopter of new technologies (Min Economic Dev &amp; others).  This thesis will contribute evidence to indicate how New Zealanders plan to adopt mobile data services, and how intensions of adoption compare with parallel studies in Singapore, and other countries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless</field><field name="subject">Survey</field><field name="subject">Mobile</field><field name="subject">Data</field><field name="subject">Structured equation modelling</field><field name="subject">Technological adoption rates</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immigrant medical practitioners&#8217; experience of seeking New Zealand registration: a participatory study</field><field name="creator">Mpofu, Charles</field><field name="description">This qualitative modified participatory study underpinned by social critical theory explored the experiences of immigrant medical practitioners seeking registration in New Zealand. The occupational science notions of occupation, occupational deprivation and occupational apartheid were used to understand the experiences of the participants. The objective of the study was to understand the experiences of the participants and facilitate their self-empowerment through facilitated dialogue, affording them opportunities for collective action. Data was obtained through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with eighteen immigrant medical practitioners who were doctors and dentists as well as two physiotherapists. The two physiotherapists were sampled out of necessity to explore diversity in findings. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. This method included the processes of coding data into themes and then collapsing themes into major themes which were organised under categories. Four categories were created in the findings describing the experiences of immigrant practitioners and suggesting solutions. Firstly; findings revealed that immigrant medical practitioners had a potential worth being utilised in New Zealand. Secondly; it was found that these participants faced negative and disabling experiences in the process of being registered. Thirdly; the emotional consequences of the negative experiences were described in the study. Fourthly; there were collectively suggested solutions where the participants felt that their problems could be alleviated by support systems modelled in other Western English speaking countries that have hosted high numbers of immigrant medical practitioners from non-English speaking countries. This collective action was consistent with the emancipatory intent of participatory research informed by social critical theory. This study resulted in drawing conclusions about the implications of the participants&#8217; experiences to well-being, occupational satisfaction as well as diverse workforce development initiatives. This study is also significant in policy making as it spelt out the specific problems faced by participants and made recommendations on what can be done to effectively utilise and benefit from the skills of immigrant medical practitioners. A multi-agency approach involving key stakeholders from the government departments, regulatory authorities, medical schools and immigrant practitioners themselves is suggested as a possible approach to solving the problems faced by these practitioners.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Overseas-trained  doctors</field><field name="subject">Diverse health workforce</field><field name="subject">Occupational  deprivation</field><field name="subject">Prejudice</field><field name="subject">Medical accreditation and licensing</field><field name="subject">Professional regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preserve, renew, invent [Light Bytes]: an art exploration into disseminating aphorisms</field><field name="creator">Kaiser, Lesley</field><field name="description">The expanding potential for the dissemination and archiving of aphorisms is explored in this practice-based research thesis.

In 2001, the Ministry of Health reported that New Zealand was facing a Chlamydia epidemic. This epidemic has not abated as rates of Chlamydia have increased significantly in the past five years, with disproportionately high rates in young M&#257;ori women compared to non-M&#257;ori women. Despite significant sexual health disparities, young M&#257;ori have had limited opportunities to participate in research focussed on sexual health and voice their opinions and concerns on sexual health issues. This qualitative descriptive study has used a M&#257;ori inquiry paradigm and approached the research from a Kaupapa M&#257;ori perspective. The primary research question asked what the knowledge, attitudes and reported behaviours of young urban M&#257;ori women were in regards to sexual health and in particular, the sexually transmitted infection Chlamydia. Secondary aims were to ascertain the sources of information used and accessibility of sexual health services, as well as identifying resilience factors associated with protection against Chlamydia infection. The data was collected from semi-structured interviews with 16 young M&#257;ori women living in the Auckland region. Data analysis involved the inductive approach of categorical content analysis to identify major categorical themes to answer the specific questions posed. The main conclusion was that there are a number of barriers to accessing quality sexual health information and services for young M&#257;ori women. Participants&#8217; level of knowledge varied reflecting their personal experiences and many were unaware that Chlamydia is asymptomatic and that delayed diagnosis can lead to fertility problems. The main sources of sexual health information accessed were wh&#257;nau, peers, school, and contact with health professionals. Racism was identified as one of the barriers to sexual healthcare services. The young women expressed a clear preference for sexual health services to be delivered by M&#257;ori. Most importantly, for sexual health interventions to be successful it is essential that M&#257;ori communities, including young people and their wh&#257;nau, are an integral part of creating positive solutions. Resilience factors that may help protect young women from contracting chlamydia characteristic of this group were having a strong connection with a caring adult or friend and parents who viewed sexuality as a normal part of adolescent development. In addition, having a positive M&#257;ori cultural identity with an ability to understand bicultural differences was strongly associated with participants accessing sexual healthcare services despite identified barriers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sexual health</field><field name="subject">Sexually transmitted infections</field><field name="subject">Chlamydia</field><field name="subject">Adolescent</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori research</field><field name="subject">Qualitative descriptive research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How do Chinese print media in New Zealand present ideas of Chinese cultural identity?</field><field name="creator">Lin, David</field><field name="description">Two case studies examine and elaborate the idea of how the Chinese print media in New Zealand present Chinese cultural identity. The thesis examines the free Chinese newspapers given away in shops, supermarkets and other location where Chinese people gather. Do Chinese people use the media to maintain their cultural identity or to adapt to a new environment? The Chinese community in New Zealand is varied due to the diversity of its origins and the different stages at which its members have arrived. The Chinese in New Zealand show many differences in countries or regions of birth, languages, dialects, religions, values, behaviour and cultural identities. Little work has been done on Chinese print media in New Zealand. Many New Zealanders regard the Chinese community as homogenous. They do not know how many different kinds of Chinese newspapers there are in New Zealand and why Chinese migrants have so many of them. Chinese migrants in New Zealand group themselves after their arrival according to their origin, values, religions, dialects, and behaviours. Such varied groups of Chinese need their own papers to express their ideas, attitudes, values and argument. This study is intended to show how these varied newspapers reflect ideas about cultural identity in diasporic setting. Another important factor is how the Chinese print media react to an issue or social events and how readers respond. Chinese readers pick up the newspapers to read and discuss various controversial stories. People argue about important questions such as &#8220;who we are&#8221; &#8220;what we are doing here&#8221; and &#8220;what is our identity&#8221;. By studying these newspapers, we can gain insights into how the Chinese cultural identity is transformed by the experience of immigration.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Print</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="subject">NZ</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Importance of ethical public relations in non-profit organisations</field><field name="creator">Coskun, Nurcin</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to understand the importance of public relations activity in non-profit organisations. The study emphasizes the bearing public relations activities can have on non-profit organisations in the contemporary world. This is especially true in an over communicated society where the vast majority of organisations compete to gain access to the scare media resources to put their message across to their potential clients, supporters and customers. Non-profit organisations generally have to depend on the donor agencies and therefore fail to attract a sizeable public relations budget. On the one hand, these organisations lack the resources to launch a successful public relations campaign and on the other the lack of knowledge and interest among general staff members makes it even harder for a public relations campaign to be developed or successfully launched. In this study, I used both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies to collect and analyse data. The data were collected from two non-profit organisations based in New Zealand working in the area of child welfare. The primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews and survey questionnaires. A single semi-structured interview was conducted with each team leader of the two selected organisations. However, this was like skimming the surface and in-depth interviews would have helped me to collect richer data. On the other hand the data collected was sufficient for this research and it helped me to create a holistic understanding of the topic. The findings of the research highlight that most non-profit organisations working in the area of child welfare find it hard to market themselves due to a lack of funds and employee involvement. Although the findings from the study are significant; caution is necessary in applying the results to other scenarios and in making generalizations. One of the key findings from this research is that both organisations did not use public relations as a strategy. Most decision related to public relations was made on random basis and no long term strategic plan was made to adopt public relations as a core strategy to build creditability among their stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="subject">Non-profit organisations</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="subject">Reputation management</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Media content analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narratwist: alteration in meaning in a short film text</field><field name="creator">El-Noor, Mardo</field><field name="description">This project is a creative production that combines image, sound, and narrative.

An estimated 400 premature deaths occur each year in New Zealand due to motor vehicle emissions.  In addition to premature deaths, acute and chronic health effects including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and bronchitis, as well as increased hospitalisations and restricted activity days (sick days) are also associated with vehicle emissions.  Epidemiological studies have shown that respiratory diseases such as asthma can be exacerbated by increases in the concentration of particulates of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) from motor vehicle emissions. Significant positive associations have been found between proximity to heavily travelled roads and increased childhood respiratory disease symptoms including hospitalisations for childhood asthma. In spite of this evidence, many early childhood centres in Auckland are located adjacent to busy roads. Children at these early childhood centres spend much of their time playing in the outdoor areas of these centres with the potential for particulates from motor vehicle emissions to exacerbate symptoms in those children already suffering from respiratory disease and asthma.  Very little research has been carried out either in New Zealand or internationally on the air quality of outdoor play areas of early childhood centres in relation to motor vehicle emissions and childhood respiratory disease and asthma. The extent of monitoring is also limited and the amount of exposure data available in New Zealand relatively sparse, particularly in comparison with Europe. Levels of traffic-related PM10 in the outdoor play areas of early childhood centres were measured in centres located adjacent to busy roads and in centres away from a quiet road or adjacent to a very quiet road for comparison.  Two of five early childhood centres located alongside busy roads had PM10 levels that exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value. While PM10 levels monitored at the other three centres located alongside busy roads did not exceed the WHO guideline value, results were often only marginally within this guideline value. In contrast, PM10 levels monitored at two centres located away from a quiet road and one centre located adjacent to a very quiet road were well within the WHO guideline value. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that children attending early childhood centres located alongside busy roads have greater exposure to traffic-related PM10 pollution than those attending early childhood centres located away from a quiet road or adjacent to a very quiet road. If the link between PM10 exposure and health effects is causal, as suggested by epidemiological studies, then children attending early childhood centres proximal to busy roads are at a greater risk of respiratory illness than children attending early childhood centres adjacent to quiet roads.  Further work is required to confirm the findings in this small sample of air quality around early childhood centres in a larger sample, and possibly to undertake an epidemiological study to confirm the link to health effects. Drawing on the precautionary principle, prudent territorial local authorities should be encouraged to introduce regulations ensuring that any new early childhood centres are located at a specified distance from major roads, and that information for parents, ongoing PM10 monitoring and processes for issuing PM10 advisories when limits are exceeded are available in existing early childhood centres that are adjacent to busy roads.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Particulates</field><field name="subject">Respiratory disease</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Traffic</field><field name="subject">Early childhood centres</field><field name="subject">Pilot study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ko Marouna te toa: The effects of the Cook Islands public sector reform on the delivery of education</field><field name="creator">Puna, Repeta</field><field name="description">The effects of the public sector reform impacted on all aspects of public services including the performance of the economy.  Central to this argument was the re-organization of the operations of the public service from the traditional administration system to the new public management (NPM). Education, a critical service in any economy was not spared.  Literatures around the application of NPM (a derivative of market principles and practices) to education (which was value based) suggested that NPM was dangerous for education and could deplete the value system of education and replace that with a focus on accounting for money by individuals who were self-interested and who would seek to maximize their benefit with guile. Arguments against NPM suggested that the human factor was neglected and that education had led to chaos among professionals, stakeholders and students.  However, those who argued for the introduction of NPM suggested that it had made the provision of education more efficient, effective and relevant to the needs to the clients.  It held those working in the education sector accountable for the resources used and made the system more responsive to the needs of the clients of education. Education in the Cook Islands experienced many changes since western type education was introduced by the Missionaries in the late 1800s. Cook Islands people have always regarded education as a right and also believed their participation in education would improve their lives as well as positively contribute to economic growth.  As the public sector reform was a global phenomenon, the currents of NPM also converged on the Cook Islands and affected the delivery of education.  Those changes revolutionalized education in ways that was not commonplace in the Cook Islands.  However, professionals and stakeholders within education made the most of the system and diverged some of the practices to suit the need, the environment and the culture of the Cook Islands people.  Change also refocused education from teachers teaching to student learning reinforcing the dedication of many teachers and education administrators to ensure NPM served the best interest of their clients; the students, despite the workload placed on them.  The challenge in this thesis was to understand how the NPM system affected education and how the Cook Islands education professionals worked within the system in their favour. The stories of teachers and Ministry of Education professionals demonstrated that there was no resistance to the application of NPM system in the Cook Islands.  In fact, the system was embraced by the education sector suggesting it was a positive change from their previous system of traditional administration.  Much of their system was inherited from New Zealand where the environment, layers of bureaucracy and economic status of the country was different.  Instead, it appeared the Cook Islands took much of what others deemed as dangerous for education and turned it into a positive opportunity for the Cook Islands education.  This thesis presents the story of the revolution in the Cook Island education system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rarotonga</field><field name="subject">Survey questionnaire</field><field name="subject">Interviews</field><field name="subject">Ministry of Education</field><field name="subject">Educational reform</field><field name="subject">School management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Court of Appeal decision in Accent Management Ltd v CIR [2007] NZCA 230: statutory interpretation in New Zealand tax avoidance law</field><field name="creator">Than, Tut</field><field name="description">In June 2007, the Court of Appeal in New Zealand disallowed the taxpayers appeal and decided that Trinity Scheme is a tax avoidance arrangement.

A permanent placement living arrangement is entered into when a child is no longer able to reside with their family of origin. Three family groups participated in the study and separate interviews were conducted with both the children and placement parents. Overall, three interviews were conducted, with the first interview taking place prior to the child&#8217;s transition into the family. A further two interviews were conducted with the participants after the transition had taken place. The findings of this study indicate that both the parents and children were profoundly affected by the experience of permanent placement. The common themes that emerged from the data were the hopes, anxieties and coping strategies of the participants which became the focal point of analysis. The parents experienced a mixture of fulfilment, tempered with anxieties of whether they would be able to provide adequate care for the child placed with them. Whereas, the children appeared to find it difficult to trust that this experience would be any different from their previous experiences. The study concludes that further attention is needed in the preparation for the transition into permanent placement. It further concludes that &#8216;after transition&#8217; support is important to the stability of the placement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Permanent placement</field><field name="subject">Foster care</field><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Parents</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te whatu o poutini: a visual art exploration of new media storytelling</field><field name="creator">Lee, Michelle</field><field name="description">This visual art project has explored the ancient Maori pukorero (oral tradition) of Te Whatu o Poutini (The Eye of Poutini) that articulates the journey of Poutini Taniwha, Waitaiki and Tamaahua from Tuhua (Mayor Island) in the Bay of Plenty, to the Arahura River.

Unusual phenomena in this thesis refers to felt experiences which are considered to be beyond the everyday in the Cartesian paradigm and are often referred to as spiritual and/or mystical phenomena. Exploring these phenomena brings to light the potentialities in the vastness of consciousness which is considered to be an integral aspect of human existence in the thesis. I chose Heidegger&#8217;s hermeneutic phenomenological methodology for the research because it gives credence to the many and varied possibilities and potentialities both in particular lived experiences and in human existence as a whole. Van Manen&#8217;s lived existential provides the framework in which the participants&#8217; experiences are explored. What emerged from the research is that unusual phenomena are not unusual for the participants. Although such phenomena are less visible and therefore less familiar in the everyday world, they are recognizable through their consistent presentation. This includes the participants having a powerful sense of &#8216;knowing&#8217; which is all-encompassing and is beyond familiar landmarks such as the linear models of time and space. The participants bring their &#8216;knowing&#8217; into the everyday world through embodiment and through their acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of existence. The expression of interconnectedness is experienced by the participants as lovingness, from which the ability for immediate healing in their therapeutic work becomes apparent.

The feminine of consciousness is a term used to describe a fundamental state of &#8216;being&#8217; in contrast to the everyday masculine principle of &#8216;doing&#8217;.

From the past to the present, the biggest impact on iwi identity was colonisation and subsequent urbanisation. Urbanisation changed the foundation of identity largely due to the demographic rural-urban shift, effectively creating a distance physically and spiritually for M&#257;ori between their place of residence and their traditional tribal turangawaewae. Today a larger proportion of tribal members reside in the main urban centres of New Zealand and Australia. This phenomenon provides an ideal opportunity to explore how iwi identity is maintained in an urban setting &#8211; away from the traditional sites of cultural practice. The study, which focuses on Ng&#257;ti Awa members residing in Auckland, provided evidence that the foundation of an iwi identity is still heavily reliant on strong iwi-based wh&#257;nau. The corollary is that, strengthening the tribal knowledge base of wh&#257;nau residing in urban centres may require new or increased active participation in the customs and practices of their iwi. Regrettably, only three of the ten research participants had an in-depth knowledge of their whakapapa, histories and traditions. However, all the participants indicated the need to become more pro-active in creating and expanding on their knowledge base of iwitanga (including te reo). There was also acknowledgement that urban-based iwi marae and wh&#257;nau w&#257;nanga can provide individuals with the opportunities to learn more about their iwi traditions (and thereby reinforce their sense of tribal identity). Encouragingly, each participant confirmed that identifying as Ng&#257;ti Awa was important to them, largely due to the sense of belonging and identity. The study concluded that the sustainability of iwi is reliant on iwi members supporting their iwi regardless of the location of their upbringing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural identity</field><field name="subject">Maori identity</field><field name="subject">Maori research paradigm</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa a iwi approach</field><field name="subject">In-depth interview</field><field name="subject">Iwi, tribal, hapu identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aquatic invertebrate fauna of Matapouri, Northland.</field><field name="creator">Pohe, Stephen Robert</field><field name="description">A study of the aquatic invertebrate communities from two locations (Location 1 and Location 2) within the Matapouri catchment in Northland, New Zealand, was conducted to assess community structure in differing local-scale habitats. Four data collection methods were utilised generating 33,058 adult or larval invertebrates. The sampling methods comprised benthic kick-sampling, sticky trapping, light trapping, and emergence trapping. For the sticky trapping and light trapping, sampling was carried out at three different sites (Sites 1&#8211;3) within each location. The sites were situated within three habitat types; native forest, native forest-fringe, and raupo wetland. Emergence trapping also commenced within the three sites, at both locations, but was discontinued after two months, due to the equipment being destroyed by consecutive flooding events (method described in Appendix 1). Benthic sampling was carried out within the Forest and Forest-fringe habitats. Benthic sampling, sticky trapping, and light trapping were carried out following a monthly schedule between June and November 2005. Conductivity, pH, and water temperature measurements were taken concurrently with benthic sampling on a monthly basis, while water velocity and substrate measurements were taken once to assist in habitat characterisation. Overall, 71 taxa were recorded by benthic sampling over the six month period, with a mean of approximately 30 taxa per site per month. In comparison with similar studies elsewhere in New Zealand, a figure of around 30 taxa per sample was high. The benthic macroinvertebrate fauna at all sites was dominated by Trichoptera (19 taxa), Diptera (16 taxa) and Ephemeroptera (10 taxa). This pattern of diversity is similar to that reported in other New Zealand studies. However, in contrast to previous studies, the leptophlebiid mayfly genus Deleatidium was not numerically dominant over the rest of the community, and other leptophlebiid genera (Acanthophlebia, Atalophlebioides, Mauiulus and Zephlebia) were equally represented, possibly reflecting niche partitioning between the groups. The genus Nesameletus was not recorded at any site, despite being one of the core mayfly species in New Zealand streams. The rare mayfly Isothraulus abditus was recorded at one of the forest locations. There are no published records of this species from Northland. Although acknowledged as another of the core New Zealand benthic taxa, the hydropsychid caddisfly Aoteapsyche was not recorded during the study. However, another hydropsychid, Orthopsyche, was commonly recorded, and these may be filling a similar niche to the Aoteapsyche genus. In contrast to the Trichoptera, Diptera, and Ephemeroptera, the Plecoptera fauna was relatively depauperate, probably reflecting the warmer climate of the region and lack of temperature-buffered spring-fed streams. Surprisingly, Zelandobius, a core New Zealand genus, was absent but is regularly recorded in Northland. A species of conservation interest, Spaniocercoides watti, currently recognised as a Northland endemic, was recorded in low numbers. There were no apparent trends in diversity or abundance of benthic invertebrates over time. Also, there were no significant differences in species diversity between the two locations. However, in many cases, taxa were more abundant at Location 2. This may have been due to steeper gradients at Location 2, and the consequent effects on substrate size and streambed stability, as all other physical factors appeared similar between locations. Although several significant differences of individual benthic taxa were recorded, no broad effect of habitat (sites) on species diversity was observable. However, at Location 2, abundances were significantly higher at Site 3 (Forest) compared to Site 2 (Forest-fringe). The reasons were uncertain, but may be attributed to higher retention of allochthonous organic materials, trapped by in-stream cover and larger substrates. Investigations of adult stages by sticky traps supported benthic results recording community compositions and abundances dominated by Trichoptera and Diptera. Plecoptera were poorly represented. Location 2 recorded higher abundances of taxa, particularly Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera. Investigations of adult stages by light traps however did not produce any statistically significant differences in abundances between sites, between locations, or between sites across locations, and it is believed to be due to limited sampling replication combined with some biases of light trapping. This study indicates that the aquatic invertebrate community at Matapouri is diverse but also reasonably representative. Several rare or uncommon insects inhabit the catchment. It is therefore important that Iwi and the local Landcare Group, who invited and supported this research, together with the Department of Conservation, continue their efforts in protecting these areas. The resident fauna have the capacity to restock areas downstream, which are intended to be improved and restored through sediment control and riparian management.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquatic insects</field><field name="subject">Community composition</field><field name="subject">Habitat use</field><field name="subject">Kick sampling</field><field name="subject">Benthic macroinvertebrates</field><field name="subject">Northland</field><field name="subject">Light trapping</field><field name="subject">Sticky trapping</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of cyclodextrins on the flavour of goat milk and its yoghurt</field><field name="creator">Gupta, Rajni</field><field name="description">A previous study showed that addition of &#946;-cyclodextrin to goat milk made a difference to its flavour, but in an undescribed way. Cyclodextrins (CDs, comprising &#945;- &#946;- and &#947;-CD) may be able to bind the free branched chain fatty acids in goat milk responsible for the largely undesirable &#8216;goaty&#8217; flavour. The primary aim was to test the effect of CDs on this flavour in goat milk and its products with a view to marketing goat milk products with reduced flavour intensity. A secondary aim was to test the effect of &#946;-CD on skatole flavour, a characteristic flavour of milk from pasturefed ruminants. Study design and methods: The present study evaluates addition of mainly &#946;-CD to goat milk, cow milk and their products to reduce undesirable flavours. The methods applied were mainly ranking and hedonic assessment in sensory experiments. The tests done were with CDs added to buffers and milks, some of which were flavour-enhanced with 4-methyloctanoic acid as a representative goaty fatty acid, or with skatole. Goat milk yoghurts were also tested. Free fatty acid concentrations, which may be affected by CD binding, were measured after separating cream and skim milk. The methods applied were standard dairy procedures: titration of free fatty acids in milk fat and the copper-salt method for measuring fatty acids in skim milk. A fungal lipase was added to milks to accelerate fat hydrolysis (lipolysis). This was done to increase the concentration of free fatty acids for several experimental purposes. Some minor experiments studies were also done, for example the comparative effect of lipases on goat milk and cow milk, and the lipolytic activity at different temperatures over different times. Results: The results of skatole experiments were inconclusive. The odour of 4-methyloctanoic acid was reduced in acidic buffers by addition of &#945;- and &#946;-CD, particularly the former. Alpha and &#946;-CD were both effective in goaty flavour reduction in goat milk. &#947;-CD was not effective. In all this work differences were statistically significant to varying levels. Goaty flavour was reduced by addition of &#946;-CD to goat milk yoghurt, but only when added before fermentation (P &lt; 0.001), not after (P = 0.09). The liking scores for goat milk yoghurts for both plain and flavoured yoghurts increased with &#946;-CD treatment (both P &lt; 0.001 for 59 panellists). The chemistry experiments revealed a reduction of free fatty acid concentration in the fat phase when &#946;-CD treatment was added to full cream cow milk. However, analysis of skim milk did not show a corresponding increase in concentration. Further experiments are required to reveal the fate of the &#8216;missing&#8217; fatty acids. Conclusion: Overall it was shown that under certain conditions, CDs were effective in reducing goaty flavour in milk and yoghurts. Whereas CDs are approved for addition to foods in many countries &#8211; including the bellwether U.S.A. &#8211; formal approval by Food Standards Australia New Zealand has not yet been finalized. When it is, the way should be clear to market a range of more consumer-acceptable goat milk products in New Zealand as a primary market. In short, this research has significant commercial relevance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food technology</field><field name="subject">Dairy products</field><field name="subject">Sensory experiments</field><field name="subject">Odour intensity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a grapefruit-flavoured spirit with the opalescence properties of pastis</field><field name="creator">Chaipongrattana, Pornphun</field><field name="description">In the form of a potable spirit, an extract of grapefruit skin has been found to develop an attractive opalescence when diluted to below about 38 % ethanol (v/v).  This phenomenon is analogous to the pastis effect, called louching, common in many drinks popular in some countries bordering the Mediterranean. The main objective of this research was to develop spirit liquor with commercial potential from grapefruit skin, largely a waste commercial product, as the dominant if not exclusive ingredient other than alcohol and water. This would require making extracts by distillation of undried skins, which would develop a dense opalescence significantly below 40 % v/v ethanol, the common alcoholic strength of spirits as sold in New Zealand. The product concept was thus a clear liquid which when poured over ice for example, would yield a cool opalescent drink with a characteristic grapefruit flavour. In the case of citrus, the chemical basis of louching is the greater solubility of citrus skin terpenes, principally limonene, in ethanol than in water.  The louch point is synonymous with the chemical expression critical micelle concentration, detected here by light scattering at the arbitrary wavelength of 450 nm.  Early results with an obvious opalescence showed that the alcohol concentration at which the terpenes ceased to be soluble in the grapefruit distillate was about 38 % (v/v).  This point was similar to that for pastis (Pernod brand), where the principle louchable ingredient is anethole.  However, the light scattering was much greater for pastis. Thus, a grapefruit spirit sold at 40 % ethanol with the louching intensity of pastis should require increasing the solubility of limonene in solutions with a lower ethanol concentration.  This in turn should allow higher concentrations of limonene in true solution in 40 % ethanol, theoretically resulting in a more intense louch in the final drink.  Thus, a broad range of hydrocolloids and surfactants was tested in an attempt to increase the solubility of limonene in lower ethanol concentrations.  None of hydrocolloids or surfactants lowered the louch point of a standard limonene concentration in ethanol/water. The informal flavour assessment showed that the spirit flavour from grapefruit zest alone lacked intensity.  It was then thought that better flavour might be obtained by using the whole grapefruit (zest, pith, and juice) rather than zest alone. The additional of pith or pith plus juice caused no significant change in the louch point or light scattering.  However, the final flavour was informally judged to be more intense than that derived from zest alone. The problem still remained that the light scattering of grapefruit distillate was never as high as that achieved by pastis, even though it was found (by gas chromatography) that the concentration of limonene (w/w) in the grapefruit spirit was at least as high as that of anethole in pastis.  The cause was due to the fact that as a louched compound, anethole was a solid with a flat crystal structure because the melting point (21.4&#61616;C) is well above that of a cool drink (Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 1947).  By contrast, limonene remains a liquid even in an iced drink because its melting point is far below 0&#61616;C.  Flat crystals would obviously scatter light far more than would a micelle containing a liquid, in this case limonene. Although such a grapefruit distillate did not louch as well as pastis, it could still have market potential on the basis that it would be made from the distinctive New Zealand cultivar of grapefruit.  Thus a formal sensory assessment was conducted, using a focus group.  The grapefruit distillates at 40 % ethanol were perceived by most panellists as refreshing, clean, fruity, and citrusy in aroma, but somewhat deficient in grapefruit flavour, and there was a common perception of strong chemical finish. At this stage of development a commercial proposition cannot be sensibly made.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grapefruit</field><field name="subject">Zest</field><field name="subject">Louch</field><field name="subject">Pastis</field><field name="subject">Focus group interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A phenomenological and thematic interpretation of the experience of creativity</field><field name="creator">Bellingham, Robin</field><field name="description">Creativity is a nebulous concept, lacking both clear articulations and common understandings of meaning. Due to a lack of clear alternatives the concept of creativity is increasingly becoming infused with economically driven vocabulary, associations, interests and ideologies. There is an immediate need to provide alternatives to the &#8222;creative economy&#8223; view of creativity, because of its insidious effect on educational institutions and practices and because it promotes a generally impoverished view of the meaning of creativity and of human potential. Reductionist thought; the tendency to understand concepts as separate and distinct from one another prevents us from easily conceptualising an experience such as creativity which involves the simultaneous experience of seemingly paradoxical elements such as individuality and unity, intellect and intuition and freedom and discipline. Democracy is a metaphor which can help to articulate and understand the paradoxical experience of creativity. Democracy stands for the potential to make meaning from the integrated exploration of individuality and of unity, which I argue is a fundamental dynamic of the creative experience. I further suggest that the essence of the creative experience is a democratic attunement to existence, in which subject and object, self and environment, intellect and intuition and freedom and discipline are experienced as in a democratic relationship with one another. This way of understanding creativity provides an alternative to the creative economy view. It implies some significant changes to traditional educational emphases, including a movement away from primarily individualistically oriented curricula and toward curricula and educational values which situate the individual within an integrated eco-system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conceptualisation</field><field name="subject">phenomenological method</field><field name="subject">Heidegger's phenomenology of boredom</field><field name="subject">Creative experience</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Backpackers: the next generation?</field><field name="creator">Markward, Anne</field><field name="description">New Zealand has a well-established network of accommodations, transportation, and visitor activities developed specifically for backpackers. These tourists account for almost ten percent of the country&#8217;s international visitor expenditure. To date, the majority of backpacker research has focussed on the traditional market segment of student and youth travellers, though a few quantitative studies have also researched the needs and preferences of older travellers using hostels and backpackers&#8217; accommodations. Though more than 50 percent of New Zealand&#8217;s international visitors are over age 40, few currently stay at this type of accommodation. Using New Zealand as a case study, this thesis explores, qualitatively, the perspectives of older backpackers: their self-perceptions, their travel motivations, their needs and expectations in accommodation. In addition, it examines the points of view of the owners of small, independent backpackers&#8217; accommodations to gain their perspectives on hosting a multi-generational clientele and on what the implications might be of expanding this market. Key findings show that older travellers who use backpackers&#8217; accommodations technically meet all Pearce&#8217;s (1990) original definitions of &#8220;backpacker&#8221; &#8211; they prefer budget accommodations, they are socially interactive, they travel independently and flexibly, they travel for longer holidays than do most, and they choose informal and participatory activities. However, these travellers reject the self-definition of &#8220;backpacker&#8221;, an impasse that presents a lexical challenge to both scholars and tourism marketers.  The final section addresses the impacts and implications of &#8220;backpacker&#8221; nomenclature on baby boomer travellers, academia, and the backpacker industry at large.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Backpackers</field><field name="subject">Baby boomers</field><field name="subject">Budget travel</field><field name="subject">Travel motivations</field><field name="subject">Self-perception</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study aimed to determine the efficacy of an assessment battery designed to examine oral English language acquisition in refugee and migrant children.</field><field name="creator">Hurburun, Anita L Jibodh</field><field name="description">The process of migration has resulted in population growth and contributed to the transformation of New Zealand. Migrant and refugee children face many adjustment factors and their ease in resettling in New Zealand is largely dependent on their ability to learn English. Migration stress, change, trauma and loss may result in psychological difficulties which in turn may affect their resettling and learning.  The Ministry of Education and other professionals work together to enhance the quality of their service provision to facilitate easier adjustment, resettlement and effective learning for these children. An adequate assessment battery for speech language therapists to assess migrant and refugee children, is presently lacking in New Zealand. Therapists currently use various assessments, with the assistance of interpreters. The New Zealand Speech Therapists&#8217; Association (NZSTA), in accordance with speech therapists in Group Special Education (GSE), strongly supports the need for research with these groups and the development of an appropriate assessment battery. This exploratory study aimed to determine an assessment battery for use in examining English language acquisition in refugee and migrant children and to highlight the benefit of using measurement tools that determine incremental change over time in contrast to the use of monolingual psychometric tests. The study explored a selected assessment battery and gathered data in five main focus areas, namely: cognition, language, trauma, classroom behaviour, developmental and birth information. Eligible children were those who did not have physiologically - impaired cognitive abilities. Eight cases, four refugee and four migrant students, were selected by convenience sampling. All participants were children selected from primary school 1 (three refugees and three migrants) and primary school 2 (one refugee and one migrant) primary schools, aged approximately (5-8 years). Participants included four male and four females, refugee and migrant children, and those with both high and low English ability. Based on the study&#8217;s results, recommendations were made to refine the test battery, which included test modification. For example, the use of the trauma measurement tool only if there is prior evidence of trauma, the inclusion of a larger test population who have a common primary language to allow for cost effective interpreter use and to also allow for generalisations to be made, the inclusion of an assessment of the children&#8217;s primary language in order to determine the relationship, development and acquisition of the child&#8217;s second language with reference to his/her development and skills in his native language. All of the refugee children and 3 migrant children displayed slower processing time during the administration of the tests. Migrant parents were quicker in test completion as compared to refugee parents. They displayed differences in family size, contact with extended family, socioeconomic status and educational level. Migrant children produced sentences that included correct word order and sequence whilst refugee children produced sentences that lacked adequate word order or lacked articles and determiners. The study found the proposed test battery was an effective choice for use in the assessment of both migrant and refugee children, as the battery allows for dynamic assessment of children from diverse groups and this proved to be an unbiased means of assessing their English language and cognitive skills. Recommendations are made for future, more-extensive research. These findings provide information about appropriate and reliable language acquisition tests that measure incremental change with time. This study will contribute to a developing knowledge base for speech-language therapists who work with migrant or refugee children. Effective assessment on which to base tailored language programmes will assist them to optimise their experience in New Zealand schools and enhance their English language skills.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oral language</field><field name="subject">English language acquisition</field><field name="subject">Refugee and migrant children</field><field name="subject">Language acquisition assessment and tests</field><field name="subject">Speech Language therapists</field><field name="subject">English as a second language ESOL</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand businesses in India: opportunities and challenges</field><field name="creator">Nagar, Swati</field><field name="description">As a resource based economy international engagement plays a critical role for the growth and development of New Zealand. One of the most notable trends over the past 15 years has been the rise of some of the largest markets around the world, that have led to a rapid and substantial increase in international trade and investment flows. The liberalisation and consequently the rise of emerging markets has today changed the economic geography for the business world, with companies entering these markets with the hope of getting superior returns arising from rapid economic growth and related market opportunities.  Amongst other emerging markets, the economic resurgence of the Indian market in the recent years has been widely noticed and in many senses has influenced and changed the structure and operations of businesses around the world. The prospects offered by India have allowed firms to substantially expand their activities beyond their domestic borders and access new growth opportunities generating significant productive growth. The benefits that markets like India today generate are likely to be particularly significance for New Zealand, given the small size of the domestic market. Indeed, increasing New Zealand&#8217;s exporting and international investing activity is vital to raising New Zealand&#8217;s growth rate. The rapid rise and deregulation of the Indian market has seen a rise in the number of New Zealand businesses keen to tap into the vast prospects across different sectors over the recent years. Nevertheless, New Zealand businesses have not been participating to nearly the same extent as most businesses from other small developed countries currently operating in the Indian market. Reasons for this limited interaction are unclear and not well documented in the current literature that examines the economic activities amongst the two markets. Given the importance of international engagement New Zealand businesses cannot afford to isolate themselves from the opportunities provided by the Indian market. Considering this, the main aim of this research is to focus on the opportunities that India provides and the benefits that New Zealand businesses stand to gain from those. On identifying, this may help devise actions that might lead to substantially increased levels of international investments by New Zealand firms, given the challenges of entering the Indian base from a small remote country. Drawing on insights gained from existing literature and case studies of companies operating in India, the research will identify appropriate strategies and policies that might help New Zealand businesses to succeed and better direct operations in India.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand businesses</field><field name="subject">Importance for internationalisation for New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Emerging markets</field><field name="subject">New Zealand and India</field><field name="subject">Sector opportunities for New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Challenges in India</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a gluten-free commercial bread</field><field name="creator">Rakkar, Pardeep Singh</field><field name="description">Because of coeliac disease, some individuals cannot tolerate the protein gliadin present in the gluten fraction of wheat flour.  From a commercial perspective, there is a need for the development of gluten-free bread with texture and flavour properties similar to the conventional wheat flour loaf.  In the context of bread, the gluten component of wheat has a crucial role in stabilising the gas-cell structure and maintaining the rheological properties of the bread.  The absence of gluten results in liquid batter rather than pre-baking dough, yielding baked bread with a crumbling texture, poor colour and other post-baking quality defects.  The liquid batter cannot be processed on the existing production line of baking industry. The aim is to develop a gluten-free white loaf with similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread on the existing processing lines at Quality Bakers New Zealand.  Within this constraint, dough has to be produced with handling and moulding properties similar to those of conventional wheat flour loaves.  This research focused on finding and implementing the gluten substitutes for the development of gluten-free high quality commercial bread. In this research, the independent variables were conventional wheat flour (the most basic control), other gluten-free flours from a variety of sources, starches, supplementary proteins,  hydrocolloids such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydrophilic psyllium husk, and enzymes such as microbial transglutaminase, glucose oxidase, lipase and fungal &#945;-amylase.  These ingredients were trialled in different combination and composition to produce a dough having ability to trap the carbon dioxide gas during proofing and baking to get high specific volume bread suitable for the Quality Bakers&#8217; product range. After an essentially &#8216;shotgun&#8217; approach to formulations, the research narrowed to a systematic and progressive variation of ingredients and their composition to develop workable commercial models.  Ingredients and their compositions were manipulated according to the outcomes of the trials and their contribution in the formulations.  The dependent variables included standard bakery rheological properties based on dough stickiness, dough extensibility, oven spring, bread specific volume, bread slice ability, and bread staling. A gelation system of the lower-temperature-stable hydrocolloid psyllium husk, the heat-stable hydrocolloid hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, maize starch, and potato starch was created to form industrial process able dough having ability to entrap carbon dioxide gas produced during proofing and initial phase of baking.  Microbial transglutaminase was used to increase the cross linking of protein present in flours and supplemented for enhancing the dough-like structure and its gas entrapping abilities. A formulation has been discovered by this research for the development of high quality gluten-free commercial bread.  The formulated bread has similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread and can be produced on existing processing lines at Quality Bakers. Industrial process able gluten-free bread with similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread can be formulated by using a specific combination of soy flour, maize starch, potato starch, yoghurt powder, milk protein, HPMC (K4M), psyllium husk, microbial transglutaminase, lipase, and fungal &#945;-amylase.  The significance of this research is mainly commercial and the insights gained may extend to other bakery items that could be used by coeliacs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gluten composition</field><field name="subject">New Zealand bread market</field><field name="subject">Wheat sensitivity</field><field name="subject">Experimental approach</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bridging to new possibilities: a case study of the influence of a bridging education programme</field><field name="creator">Walker, Catherine</field><field name="description">In the rapidly changing &#8216;knowledge economy&#8217; where &#8216;innovation&#8217; and &#8216;responsiveness&#8217; are vital, tertiary education can be at a point transformation. Since the late 1990s the New Zealand government began to shift part of its tertiary education policy with an increasing focus on what is commonly called &#8216;foundation&#8217; education. The shift was aimed at ensuring all New Zealanders are equipped for the knowledge economy and raising the skills of individuals. A variety of research and education programmes were launched, and existing foundation or bridging programmes strengthened through policy, research and educational endeavours. Bridging education programmes (a subset of foundation education) are designed to prepare non-traditional and under-prepared students for ongoing study at a higher level. This current research sought to identify the influence of a university bridging programme (Level 4) on students who progressed into further study at undergraduate level. The bridging programme commenced in 2003 providing a pathway for students into undergraduate health degrees. The key question for this thesis was: how does bridging education influence students? To determine the influence of the bridging programme, this research was based on a case-study of seven students who completed four or eight papers in the bridging programme. Participants were in ongoing study (for at least one year) in a Bachelor of Health Science (any major). The methodology was qualitative in design, drawing extensively on a case-study approach to research the influences of the bridging programme. The method of data collection utilised was individual semi-structured interviews with former bridging students to ascertain their perceptions, views and experiences of the influence of a bridging programme, both historically and currently. In examining this unique context, information on the influences of bridging education was explored and the importance of bridging education, from the participant&#8217;s perspective, understood more clearly. This thesis and the research within revealed that the influence of the bridging programme began at the participant&#8217;s time of enrolment and continued into their undergraduate study and their lives. The bridging programme influenced the way participant&#8217;s interacted with a range of factors including: the institution; their undergraduate programme; with educators and peers; and with family, friends and others in society. Equally, it is acknowledged that these factors influenced the participant&#8217;s, facilitating or impeding their ongoing learning. The participants also identified several challenges (financial and relational) related to the influence of tertiary study which they faced. The research revealed the programme influenced their ongoing success and continuation in undergraduate study. The programme provided an effective bridge into tertiary education (academically, emotionally and socially). Participant&#8217;s acknowledged the influence on their cognitive and meta-cognitive growth and development. The range of tertiary leaning skills and knowledge gained and/or enhanced was considerable. Close links between the academic skills taught in the bridging programme and required in undergraduate study were evident. Positive improvements in confidence, self-efficacy and motivation were also attributed to the influence of the programme. Holistic personal development occurred as the skills and knowledge gained and developed were transferred and extended from academia into other areas of the lives of former bridging students and thus further influenced their family, personal friends and society. The influence of the bridging programme has enabled new opportunities, ways of being and employment to become more than a dream, but a reality which the participants continue to move towards. Overall, it could be claimed that the influence of the bridging programme was holistic. A series of recommendations are provided for theory, policy and practice. The significance for social issues and action are discussed and avenues for further research outlined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bridging</field><field name="subject">Foundation</field><field name="subject">Holistic</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">Transformative education</field><field name="subject">Interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limitlessness and the sublime: illuminating notions</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Grant</field><field name="description">This project explores the basic tenets of abstract expressionism and is considered in relation to the idea of the sublime, limitlessness and the formless.

Light is used to intensify the image with a view to expand the viewer&#8217;s awareness and understanding of the sublime. The research seeks to find ways that allow the viewer to explore the feeling of uncertainty and the sensation of wonderment.

In line with the Auckland University of Technology (AUT) Institute for Radiophysics and Space Research (IRSR) aims to develop the knowledge, skills and experience within New Zealand, extensive use of existing radio astronomical software has been incorporated into the process namely AIPS (Astronomical Imaging Processing System), MIRIAD (a radio interferometry data reduction package) and DIFMAP (a program for synthesis imaging of visibility data from interferometer arrays of radio telescopes). This process has been used to model various antenna array configurations for two proposed New Zealand sites for antenna in a VLBI array configuration with existing Australian facilities and a passable antenna at Scott Base in Antarctica; and the results are presented in an attempt to demonstrate the improvement to be gained by joint trans-Tasman VLBI observation. It is hoped these results and process will assist the planning and placement of proposed New Zealand radio telescopes for cooperation with groups such as the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA), others in the Pacific Rim and possibly globally; also potential future involvement of New Zealand with the SKA. The developed process has also been used to model a phased building schedule for the SKA in Australia and the addition of two antennas in New Zealand. This has been presented to the wider astronomical community via the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand Journal, and is summarized in this thesis with some additional material. A new measure of quality (&#8220;figure of merit&#8221;) for comparing the original model image and final CLEAN images by utilizing normalized 2-D cross correlation is evaluated as an alternative to the existing subjective visual operator image comparison undertaken to date by other groups. This new unit of measure is then used in the presentation of the results to provide a quantative comparison of the different array configurations modelled. Included in the process is the development of a new antenna array visibility program which was based on a Perl code script written by Prof Steven Tingay to plot antenna visibilities for the Australian Square Kilometre Array (SKA) proposal. This has been expanded and improved removing the hard coded fixed assumptions for the SKA configuration, providing a new useful and flexible program for the wider astronomical community. A prototype user interface using html/cgi/perl was developed for the process so that the underlying software packages can be served over the web to a user via an internet browser. This was used to demonstrate how easy it is to provide a friendlier interface compared to the existing cumbersome and difficult command line driven interfaces (although the command line can be retained for more experienced users).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VLBI</field><field name="subject">Array</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Image</field><field name="subject">Synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of different intermittent priming strategies on 3km cycling performance</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, Jordan Patrick Ross</field><field name="description">Priming exercise, or the &#8216;warm-up&#8217;, is an accepted practice prior to exercise participation, physical training or sporting competition.  Traditionally, low intensity exercise has been used prior to both short- and long-duration events in an effort to prepare the athlete, but not fatigue them.  Recently, however, a more scientific approach to priming exercise has been considered important, with some research suggesting that a high intensity intermittent priming strategy may be optimal.  However, given the paucity of performance focussed &#8216;warm-up&#8217; studies, and that existing data regarding high-intensity priming strategies is inconclusive, the aim of this thesis was to determine the effects of three high-intensity intermittent priming strategies on physiological responses and subsequent 3km laboratory time-trial (TT) performance. Ten well-conditioned endurance-trained male cyclists (mean &#177; SD: age, 28.3 &#177; 8.4 yr, body mass, 81.8 &#177; 11.6 kg, stature, 1.8 &#177; 0.1 m,  O2peak, 4.6 &#177; 0.5 L&#8226;min&#8722;1) were recruited for this study.  After an initial incremental exercise test to exhaustion, participants completed four 3km time trials (TT) on four separate occasions, each preceded by a different priming strategy.  These included a &#8216;self-selected&#8217; (control) condition, and three high-intensity intermittent priming strategies of varying intensity (100% and 150% of the power at O2peak, and all-out) and fixed duration (15 minutes), each in predetermined random order.  Five minutes passive rest separated each priming exercise condition from the experimental 3km-TT.  Oxygen uptake ( O2) and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously, while blood lactate concentration ([BLa]) and core temperature (TC) were recorded at rest, post-priming exercise, and immediately prior to and following the 3km-TT.  In an attempt to provide a mechanistic explanation for changes in performance, O2 kinetic variables were determined from the O2 data.  Performance was quantified as a mean power (Wmean) and total time taken to complete the 3km-TT.  Mean power output and time taken for each 500m segment of the 3km-TT were also calculated. Results demonstrated that the athletes self-chosen priming condition (378.6 &#177; 44.0 W) resulted in Wmean that was slightly greater than both the lowest (376.3 &#177; 44.9 W; 0.7%; p = 0.57) and moderate (373.9 &#177; 47.8 W; 1.5%, p = 0.30) intensity intermittent priming condition, but significantly greater than the &#8216;all-out&#8217; intermittent sprint priming condition (357.4 &#177; 44.5 W; 5.8%, p = 0.0033).  Similar differences were observed for time.  While differences existed in the O2 deficit (however, mainly non-significant), these differences did not provide clear explanations for the differences in performance, with the moderate priming condition displaying a significantly reduced O2 deficit (59.4 &#177; 15.6 L, p &lt; 0.05), despite the non-significant change in Wmean, compared to the self-chosen priming condition (73.3 &#177; 18.6 L).  Additionally no significant differences were observed in either the time constant or the mean response time of O2.  Significant findings with regard to HR, [BLa] and TC were observed, but consistent with O2 kinetic variables, they were not related to, nor explain performance changes. In conclusion, regardless of intensity, different high-intensity intermittent priming exercise did not improve 3km-TT performance more than the control condition (self-chosen).  A priming strategy that is overly intense was detrimental to subsequent cycling performance.  The observed finding that a self-chosen priming strategy resulted in a comparable performance suggests that athletes are able to self-select (consciously or sub-consciously) a &#8216;warm-up&#8217; that is of appropriate intensity/duration.  Further work utilising the priming strategies from the current study with events of shorter duration is required to further clarify how priming strategies of this nature may affect track cycling performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Priming</field><field name="subject">Cycling</field><field name="subject">Oxygen uptake kinetics</field><field name="subject">Supramaximal</field><field name="subject">Core temperature</field><field name="subject">Subsequent performance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cross-cultural leader: a comparative study of leadership behaviours in China and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ao, Xiang</field><field name="description">National cultures play a critical role in effective leadership and organisational success in international businesses. Contemporary organisations are therefore challenged by cross-cultural leadership needs to address increasing diversity. In the past decades, there has been a growing interest in studies of non-Western leadership. Recent papers have focused particularly on leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. This paper compares leadership in China and New Zealand, based on the data collected by using the GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organisational Behaviour Effectiveness) project leadership questionnaire. In addition, the paper reviews the main findings of previous research in order to investigate the similarities and differences in preferred leadership behaviours/characteristics in both cultures, while attempting to examine the consistency of current findings against the previous GLOBE studies. Significant differences of leadership behaviours between China and New Zealand have been identified.  This paper generally supports the findings of previous GLOBE studies that charismatic/value-based leadership is the universally contributing factor towards outstanding leadership and self-protective leadership is the universally negative factor against leadership excellence. Findings in this paper may contribute to further understanding of leadership practice in these two countries.  Future research should be undertaken to examine the effects of cultural differences on organisational practice by a more comprehensive research method.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cross-cultural leadership</field><field name="subject">GLOBE</field><field name="subject">Cultural expectation</field><field name="subject">Etic and emic approach</field><field name="subject">Multivariate analysis of variance MANOVA</field><field name="subject">International business</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why do Asian immigrants become entrepreneurs? The case of Korean self-employed immigrants in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lee, Joo-Seok</field><field name="description">With the number of Asian immigrants continually increasing in New Zealand society, Asian immigrant businesses have been appearing more rapidly in New Zealand, particularly in Auckland. The primary purpose of this study is to enquire into why a certain Asian immigrant group become business people after migrating to Auckland, New Zealand. In addition, it investigates the level of their business activity and the level of happiness with their new life in New Zealand. This study examines the growing phenomenon of Asian immigrants, and the entrepreneurship rate of ethnic groups through existing statistics. The study focuses on Korean immigrants. Twenty self-employed Koreans who are running a business in Auckland participated in the study. They were invited to talk about why they became self-employed business people and related matters about their business activity. The study found that Korean immigrants chose self-employment as a means of getting a job. They gave up seeking mainstream employment opportunities due to the language barrier and their inability to cope with a new society and new system. Other fundamental factors in their decision to become entrepreneurs were that firstly, they were willing to invest a considerable amount of their own money and secondly, they preferred to participate in the workforce rather than to depend on the New Zealand welfare system. Based on the information acquired through the research, the study reported that the recently increased numbers of Asian businesses are partly attributable to New Zealand business immigration policy which introduced a new business category &#8211; Long Term Business Visa (LTBV). The findings from this research pointed to commitment that immigrant businesses contribute to the New Zealand economy and New Zealand society as taxpayers and potential employers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asian immigrants</field><field name="subject">Qualitative Methodology</field><field name="subject">Korean self-employed business people</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured and structured in-depth interviews</field><field name="subject">Quality of life</field><field name="subject">English language proficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">User-centred design: the investigation, design and evaluation of an information handbook for coeliac patients</field><field name="creator">Walkinshaw, Rosemary</field><field name="description">Coeliac disease is an intestinal disorder, requiring patients to maintain a life-long gluten-free diet to ensure better health and reduce the risks of osteoporosis, intestinal lymphoma and other associated diseases.

There is very little well designed information currently available for Coeliac patients. Eating out and shopping in supermarkets can become a nightmare. A User-centred design approach was used to generate information and insights on the Coeliac disease and patients' needs to conceptualise, design and evaluate an information handbook that is both functional and pleasurable to use. Questionnaires, interviews and focus groups were used to generate empirical data that guided a participative design process before the evaluation of the handbook.

It focuses on interpreting and visualising New Zealand Chinese immigrants&#8217; thoughts and feelings and their struggle to adapt to the environment as well as their ambivalent negotiation to balance their in-between identity of being a New Zealander (Westerner) and Chinese. It is a practice-based project and is presented by means of photography, with illustration as the supporting medium. The predicament of identity is explored through interviewing members of the New Zealand Chinese community. A semi-constructed interview is designed and introduced to canvass 20 Chinese participants&#8217; opinions of their cultural beliefs and sense of belonging in a Western society. The data is collected and analysed to investigate the informants&#8217; thoughts and feelings in their daily routine in a multicultural community. I, as an art and design practitioner, visually interpret and transcend my opinion of identity dilemma of Chinese immigrants into my practical works. The participants&#8217; thoughts and feelings are transferred into my artwork through creating patterns of visual elements.

At the time of being interviewed, some were completing a Bachelor of Counselling or Alcohol and Drug Studies, while others had completed their counsellor training and had employment in their profession. The students completing the Alcohol and Drug Studies are also trainee counsellors with a particular specialisation. All students completed a ten day, introductory course in Cognitive Therapy. There has been limited research exploring the learning experiences of students on cognitive therapy training. There does not appear to be any research on either the use of self case study in Cognitive Therapy education or the student experience of self case study. The purpose of this study was twofold: firstly, to explore the students&#8217; perspectives on what it was like to learn cognitive therapy and secondly, to explore the students&#8217; experiences of completing a case study on themselves. In this study, narrative interviews were used to invite participants to tell their story. The interviews were audio taped and transcribed. The participants&#8217; in depth stories when analysed, produced clear thematic content as well as unique accounts of personal learning journeys. Analysis involved rewriting each interview as a core narrative, structured to show each participant&#8217;s position when they began learning, the essence of the story line, their unique voice, the plot direction, the story&#8217;s climax, including the impact on their identity and finally, their core message. These narratives are represented by six short pieces of prose and a poem. The narrators and cognitive therapy are central characters in all stories. Thematic content was depicted as steps in a learning process. All core narratives were sent to each participant for checking that it captured their original story and its meaning. The findings were that adult counselling students found brief introductory training courses in Cognitive Therapy to be very effective for enabling them to learn the cognitive therapy model, to refine their cognitive therapy skills and to enhance their own personal development. Self case study has the potential to provide a complex, multi-dimensional learning opportunity facilitating deep learning. Self case study can result in transformative learning and the development of new stories of identity for the writer (and subject) of the case study. Individual student accounts suggest that Cognitive Therapy can be usefully adapted for some Maori and self case study can be a means of strengthening cultural identity. In addition, for some counselling student trainees, the process of doing a self case study may provide a means of working through childhood trauma. The findings provide some preliminary support for including use of self case study within the counselling curriculum. Self case study can provide opportunities for deepening learning about theory and practice, which is all the more potent when related to students&#8217; own selves. Given support, students might be encouraged to complete self case study as a means of gaining significant personal development. Such curriculum changes would require additional expertise on the part of counselling educators. The narratives analysed in this study suggest that particular support may be needed to enable the safe self development of students from ethnic minority groups and also to provide well for those who had experienced childhood trauma. This is recommended as an area for further research. Given that Counselling education has the task of developing and preparing students for the Counselling profession, students&#8217; perspectives on this experience, are an important and relatively underdeveloped area of research. There is a need for further research specifically on students&#8217; learning experiences in Cognitive Therapy. Ongoing research is needed about the use of self case study as a learning opportunity for student learning and personal development.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Student learning experience</field><field name="subject">Narrative research</field><field name="subject">Self case studies</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Student perspective</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moment beyond moment</field><field name="creator">Xie , Jiahua</field><field name="description">This practice-based project explores the photographic phenomenon of &#8216;moment beyond moment&#8217;, which refers to the combined representations of an existing image in an environment, together with the real-life situation at the moment the photograph is taken.

By exploring the performativity of an object (and questioning how an object performs in relation to the body), the documented performances activate an inter-relational act between artist and object (I perform the object, the object performs me simultaneously). The work that unfolds from this investigation considers the placement of the viewer&#8217;s body in relation to the artist&#8217;s. A dialogue is formed between the three bodies: object, artist and viewer, creating a sense of embodiment within the work through this relationship. in|form explores this embodiment through the role of video documentation. The performances are constructed to be viewed solely through the documentation, which creates a discussion between the &#8216;live&#8217; moment and the documented event, and how the viewer then relates to this. The performances take place as solo acts, but are constructed with the viewer in mind. As the viewer watches the documented performance of the action between artist and object in space, the relational nature of the work creates a second performance which embodies the viewer. This sole action, recorded and then viewed, considers the relational value of the body, specifically engaging with the abstraction of bodily formlessness within the object to reveal a bodily nature. Using the object to trace the movement of the body creates a language that communicates to, and about, both viewer and artist: through the awareness of passing time, through the large scale projection of the documentation, through the bodily nature of the object, and through the performativity of the object&#8217;s responsive nature to the artist&#8217;s body as the pair navigate through space. in|form explores how the absence of the body (in a literal sense) considers the body as an object bound by time, at once physical yet transient. By tracing the motion of the body through object, the viewer experiences the body through sensibility. Ultimately, the function of the body negotiating as a time-bound object is imitated through the performativity of the object with artist, and the elusiveness of this action emphasized by its documentation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Body as object</field><field name="subject">Measuring movement</field><field name="subject">Video performative document</field><field name="subject">Sculptural performance</field><field name="subject">Absence of body</field><field name="subject">Duration of time</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What a photograph can and cannot do: a visual investigation into the social phenomena of photographs as a memory device</field><field name="creator">Shirley, Anne</field><field name="description">As members of extended families and genealogical lines we collect and view photographs to remember. By situating the present investigation within the context of archival family photographic collections, this research seeks to understand the assumptions surrounding the interplay between the practice of viewing photographs and notions of remembering. Historically, photography has been connected to concepts of stability and truth with photographic images acting as a metaphor for &#8216;real lived experiences&#8217;. When a photograph is viewed, whatever was present before the camera is verified. In his seminal text Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography (1980), French theorist Roland Barthes describes this as &#8216;a truth to presence&#8217; (Barthes 1980: 84). Barthes links this position to Poststructuralist theory, by determining that photographic signifiers, denotative data, are stable where as the signified, the idea or meaning, is contingent on what a viewer brings to that particular &#8216;text&#8217;. Therefore the viewer relies on denotative data to process meaning. This research explores the ways photographers play with photographic processes to disrupt ideas of stability of meaning surrounding this medium. The visual component of this research explores the expectations that socio-cultural groups, specifically extended families, have when viewing photographs. The subsequent work will endeavour to lay bare the interplay between such expectations and the supposed reliability of the photograph in respect to both meaning and perception. Using an archive of my own extended family&#8217;s collection of photographs, this thesis seeks to disrupt the story-telling qualities of photographs. This interruption strategy points to poststructuralist discourses surrounding the stability of the photographic image and the context in which photography is grounded. The work will challenge viewers to re-assess what the photograph can or cannot do. The final work will be comprised of 80% practice and 20% exegesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photograph</field><field name="subject">Memory device</field><field name="subject">Family photographs</field><field name="subject">Viewing photographs</field><field name="subject">Contemporary art</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benthic-invertebrate diversity of Tucetona laticostata (Mollusca: Bivalvia) biogenic substrata in Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Dewas, Severine Emmanuelle Alexandra</field><field name="description">Marine ecosystems are increasingly being subject to human impact from diverse recreational and commercial activities, not necessarily restricted to those of a marine nature. This has significant implications for biodiversity. The large dog cockle, Tucetona laticostata, once occurred live in Rangitoto Channel, Hauraki Gulf, although this species no longer appears to occur there, most likely as a consequence of repeated dredging and channel excavation and continued siltation. Tucetona laticostata still occurs in a few isolated pockets of sea bed throughout Hauraki Gulf, particularly off Otata Island, part of the Noises complex of islands, where it resides partially buried in shell and rock gravels in shallow water (to 15 metres depth). The shells of T. laticostata collect in large post-mortem deposits in an area ramping from the sea bed off southwestern Otata Island.  These mounds differ significantly in structural complexity from those of adjacent, extensively fragmented shell and rock gravels. Using the mounds of T. laticostata shell as a proxy for structural complexity, in order to appraise the effect of complexity on benthic-invertebrate diversity, the sea bed off southwestern Otata Island was sampled quarterly at two depths and in both T. laticostata shell mounds and adjacent extensively fragmented shell and rock gravels.  These data were complemented with those from additional surveys around Otata Island, and off eastern Motutapu Island to determine the distribution and composition of benthic-invertebrate community assemblages throughout the region, and from concurrent surveys throughout the Waitemata Harbour and inner Hauraki Gulf to determine the current distribution of T. laticostata in this region. The number of benthic invertebrate species and individuals within T. laticostata habitat almost always was higher than that occurring within extensively fragmented shell- and rock gravel habitat, with densities to 142,385 individuals m-2 encountered. Temporal and spatial variations in benthic community structure also are reported for the two habitats, T. laticostata-based shells and extensively fragmented shell- and rock gravels. The numbers of species were higher amongst samples collected off the southwestern and eastern sides of Otata Island than elsewhere around this island, or of eastern Motutapu Island. Of the 351 species reported from all Otata and Motutapu Island samples combined, 73% of them occurred off southwestern Otata Island, 30% of which were found exclusively within T. laticostata shell habitat, and 10.5% within extensively fragmented shell and rock gravel habitat. The sea bed off southwestern Otata Island is regularly, seasonally dredged by recreational scallop fishers, in addition to being a popular small-vessel anchorage site.  Both of these activities, dredging and anchorage, stand to reduce substratum complexity by fragmentation and dispersal of the valves of T. laticostata.  Given the unique benthic invertebrates reported from T. laticostata shell deposits reported from southwestern Otata Island, any activity that damages the shells of this species, regardless of whether they are live or dead, is likely to result in loss of biodiversity. Admittedly, many of species identified as major contributors to differences in benthic invertebrate assemblages between T. laticostata shell-based habitats and those of extensively fragmented shell and rock gravels are not particularly charismatic or large, but each likely plays a role in local food webs and/or sediment and water column chemistry. It was not the intention of this research to determine the effects of anthropogenic disturbances like dredging or vessel anchorage on benthic-invertebrate communities off southwestern Otata Island. However, given the reported differences in species diversity within the structurally complex substratum provided by T. laticostata, conservation of biogenic reef-forming species like it might be a prudent, precautionary measure to take.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tucetona laticostata</field><field name="subject">Ecosystem engineer</field><field name="subject">Benthic invertebrate community</field><field name="subject">Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The invisible view: Betwixt and between</field><field name="creator">Latimer, Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the idea of a liminal space, as being dreamlike, suspended in time and physically unlocatable.  It questions and exploits the boundary between abstraction and figuration in painting.  This investigation has been considered from a subjective viewpoint allowing a distancing of space to illuminate new perceptions and experiences through the language of painting.  The project has sought to explore the relationship between the natural world and seeing, to deepen and emphasize the other worldliness of an in-between space.  This third space has been evoked by a process of abstracting pictorial content, juxtaposition of elements, colour and composition.

Maternal nutrient balance and the subsequent dietary pattern of the family set the path for the growth and development of the individual and therefore also for their offspring. There is strong evidence from studies in India that mothers who have a low vitamin B12 status, but high folate, will have children with higher adiposity and more cardiovascular risk factors than those with adequate B12. The B12 status is closely linked to the dietary pattern particularly the consumption of red meat which has a high B12 content. In New Zealand there are an increasing number of Indian migrants. Vegetarianism is also practiced by an increasing number including young women. In addition, there is a high rate (up to 60%) of unplanned pregnancies in New Zealand. In the 1997 New Zealand National Nutrition Survey (NNS97) report, vitamin B12 intake appeared adequate for the New Zealand population and breakfast cereals were reported as one major dietary source of B12. Cereals in New Zealand however, were not fortified with B12 and there was an error in the FOODfile&#8482; data entries for B12 in some cereals. The raw data of reported B12 intakes in the 24-hour diet recall (24HDR) of NNS97 was reanalysed at the individual level by subtracting the B12 derived from breakfast cereals and applying the 2005 revised estimated average requirement (EAR) value. The possible prevalence of B12 insufficiency was 2.4 times that originally reported by the NNS97, translating into a prevalence of up to 27% of the population sampled. This analysis was limited as it was not adjusted for day-to-day variance or to the New Zealand population. This apparently high prevalence of risk for inadequate B12 intake in the surveyed individuals required confirmation that the B12 intake from 24HDR and also a 7-day diet diary (7DDD) was a valid assessment of B12 status. The group of particular interest is women of childbearing age (18-50y) with a range of eating patterns. Thirty eight women aged 19-48y; 12 non-red-meat-eaters (5 Indians vs. 7 non-Indians) and 26 red-meat-eaters (1 Indian vs. 25 non-Indians) participated in this validation study. Anthropometry and hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance (BIA) were measured on the same day as a 24HDR was recorded. Fasting serum lipids, glucose, haematological parameters, and serum B12, holotranscobalamin II (holo-TC II, a specific B12 biomarker), and folate concentrations were measured. Foods eaten and time spent in physical activity during the following 7 days were extracted from 7DDD and 7-day physical activity diary (7DPAD). There was no significant correlation between dietary intake (24HDR or 7DDD) and biomarkers for B12 status. Indians reported lower mean daily B12 intakes in 7DDD than non-Indians (1.6 vs. 4.5 &#956;g/day, p&lt;0.001) and this was confirmed by Indians&#8217; significantly low serum B12 (203 vs. 383 pmol/L, p=0.04) and holo-TC II (35 vs. 72 pmol/L, p=0.02) concentrations compared to non-Indians. A similar pattern was found between non-red-meat-eaters and red-meat-eaters in daily B12 intake in 7DDD (2.3 vs. 4.8 &#956;g/day, p&lt;0.001) and in B12 biomarkers (serum B12, 263 vs. 397 pmol/L, p=0.01; holo-TC II, 43 vs. 77 pmol/L, p&lt;0.005). Non-red-meat-eaters reported significantly higher daily folate intake in 7DDD (359 vs. 260 &#956;g/day, p=0.01) than red-meat-eaters but no significant difference was found in serum folate concentration between these groups (29 vs. 24 pmol/L, p=0.10). Indians/non-red-meat-eaters also reported lower daily protein intake and higher percentage of total energy from carbohydrate in 7DDD compared to non-Indians/red-meat-eaters but total reported energy intake tended to be under-reported and physical activity over-reported when assessed against estimated basal metabolic rate (BMR). Body composition varied by dietary pattern. Indians/non-red-meat-eaters had higher body fat percentage (BF %) and weaker grip strength than non-Indians/red-meat-eaters. In addition, Indians had a significantly higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) than non-Indians. Overall, the whole group reported that they were inactive. The median time spent in moderate, high and maximal intensity activities was only 19 minutes a day, which did not meet the NZ guideline for adults of 30 minutes a day. In this small study nutrient analysis of diet by 24HDR or 7DDD, was not a reliable or accurate way to assess B12 insufficiency. Questions about dietary patterns such as &#8220;do you eat red meat&#8221;, and taking ethnicity into account could more easily identify the at risk population. Supplementation and/or fortification of B12 should be considered before pregnancy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vitamin B12</field><field name="subject">Childbearing age women</field><field name="subject">Dietary patterns</field><field name="subject">Body composition</field><field name="subject">Holo-TC II</field><field name="subject">BIA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immobilisation of metal in quartz sands by ball milling</field><field name="creator">Zhang, ZhengXi</field><field name="description">Previous work has shown that when inorganic compounds are milled with quartz in a high energy ball mill the elements are sequestered into the quartz matrix and cannot be easily recovered by simple extraction methods.  In this study lead (II) oxide, copper (II) oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide and sodium hydroxide were milled with quartz sand and the recoveries of the metals investigated in detail. The standard EPA3050B method (acid digestion of sediments, sludge and soils) for extractable metals was compared to exhaustive HF digestion method based on ASTM C146-94a (test methods for chemical analysis of glass sand) and UDC 666.123:543.06 (chemical analysis of soda-lime and borosilicate glass).  From these two analyses the total recovery of metals was determined. It was found that the elements extracted by the EPA3050B method decreased in an approximately logarithmic way with milling time. The metals are apparently strongly sequestered into the fractured quartz. Total HF digestion of the insoluble matrix gave good recovery of the &#8220;lost&#8221; elements.  A reliable analytical procedure has been developed and the mechanisms leading to this sequestering are discussed. Particle size analysis and electron microscopy of milled samples support a process of brittle alloy formation as the proposed mechanism whereby the elements are sequestered into the milled quartz.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanochemistry</field><field name="subject">Mechanochemical synthesis</field><field name="subject">Ball milling</field><field name="subject">Reaction milling</field><field name="subject">Reactive milling</field><field name="subject">Heavy metal</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of biodiversity databases in coastal conservation and resource management</field><field name="creator">Palacio, Monalisa</field><field name="description">Marine environmental resource managers and consultants require comprehensive, accurate and current data on the status of marine biodiversity in order to fully evaluate resource consent applications that involve development, impact or encroachment within the marine environment, and for identifying areas of coast appropriate for conservation. The role and efficacy of existing global, national and regional marine biodiversity databases in delivering these types of data are evaluated. Consultation with environmental consultants revealed that none regularly, if ever used any existing marine biodiversity database during their routine consulting activities. Moreover, no existing biodiversity database had appropriate data-mining tools, although each was determined to provide information of value to resource managers and environmental consultants operating at national and regional scales; none was deemed to provide the sort of information required to manage marine resources at a local scale. To achieve the objectives of this research programme, resource managers, data users and data compilers were consulted to determine their ideal data and database requirements. Existing biodiversity data sets that included New Zealand marine biodiversity then were searched or procured, and these data and that of a novel data set of species occurring at 296 intertidal and 25 fringe-saline (effectively freshwater) sites within and proximal to the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park (from Mimiwhangata Bay in the north to Tauranga Harbour in the south) were compared with species inventories from environmental consultants operating in this region. Biodiversity data from the 296 saline, comprising presence/absence data for 713 taxa recorded from the survey region were analysed in detail. Significantly different species assemblages were identified amongst these 296 sites, five intertidal habitats being recognised, each with characteristic species assemblages: marine-hard shores, marine-soft shores, brackish-hard shores, brackish-soft shores, and mangrove shores. Species richness and diversity were consistently higher in marine habitats, and greatest on hard substrata. Most sites host unique assemblages of species. A novel index of species richness is proposed, and although the spatial distribution of richness isn&#8217;t particularly revealing, as obvious patterns in the distribution of richness are not apparent, this index has value in that the richness of any shore can be compared and contrasted with that of others throughout the region. Augmenting this richness index is a novel index of species rarity. Based on the frequency of occurrence of taxa on shores throughout the survey region, very rare through to ubiquitous taxa are recognised to routinely occur on almost all shores, regardless of the total species richness. Moreover, very rare to uncommon taxa often comprise a disproportionately high percentage of the total species occurring on any given intertidal shore, in any habitat. Accordingly, alarm bells should ring for reviewers of resource consent applications wherein environmental consultants state that an area subject to development &#8216;hosts no rare, unique or otherwise remarkable species or ecology.&#8217;  Two applications of these novel biodiversity data are demonstrated: the relationship between species richness and regional council consented activities is described, with a negative correlation reported for the intensity of disturbance (using the number of consented activities as a proxy for disturbance) and species richness on marine hard shores; and an appraisal of four selection criteria for marine reserves (naturalness, representativeness, uniqueness and complementarities), wherein the intertidal fauna and flora of no existing or proposed marine reserve appears to be  natural, unique or representative, and effort seems to have been spent duplicating certain assemblages of species in reserve networks. The former is intuitively obvious, but the latter is alarming, and the ramifications of it far reaching in terms of conservation of the marine environment. Protocols for conducting biodiversity surveys must be established and implemented to elevate the standards of environmental consultants, resulting value judgements on the composition of species, and the likely and actual effects of these developments on the marine environment to ensure that statements made in reports are based on current data rather than perceptions and client expectations. It is possible that resource consents have been issued based on spurious appraisals of the immediate and cumulative effect of discharge on the environment, or of the relative rarity (or appreciation of this) of species that occur within it. Prior to development of the novel Monalisa data set, no existing database or data set existed that provided the information routinely required by managers and consultants to make informed judgements that affect coastal development throughout the survey region. Recommendations for additional research to build on findings detailed herein are made.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Databases</field><field name="subject">Resource management</field><field name="subject">Conservation</field><field name="subject">Intertidal community</field><field name="subject">Marine invertebrates</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The association between auditors' fees and earnings management in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ananthanarayanan, Umapathy</field><field name="description">This study provides evidence between auditors' fees and earnings management in New Zealand. The fee measures used in this study are audit fees, non-audit fees and total fees paid by a client to the audit firm. For each of the three fee measures, I derive client importance fee measures that reflect a client&#8217;s economic importance to the auditor relative to other clients of the auditor at the city office and national levels. This study employs both performance adjusted discretionary accruals and current accruals as proxies for earnings management. Using a sample of 224 firm-years comprising firms listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the results of multivariate tests indicate an adverse association between non-audit fees and earnings management. In other words, non-audit fees paid by a client relative to fees paid by other clients, at the office and national levels, appear to impair the auditor&#8217;s independence because clients generating relatively more non-audit fees report greater discretionary and current accruals. Such evidence is more pronounced for income increasing accrual proxies for earnings management. The results also show that audit fee is not related to earnings management. As the results in this study are consistent across both discretionary and current accruals, the validity of the results is strengthened. This study contributes to the literature by providing insight into how auditors&#8217; fee metrics indicating client importance affect earnings management in a legal and institutional environment of a small economy, and where the audit market is largely saturated with little room for growth. This study raises implications for relevant regulatory bodies in New Zealand pertaining to future developments of auditor independence and financial reporting regulations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audit independence</field><field name="subject">Non-audit fees</field><field name="subject">Client importance</field><field name="subject">Discretionary and current accruals</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A field study of domain knowledge sharing in the software development industry in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ekadharmawan, Christian Harsana</field><field name="description">In contemporary software development, an emergent understanding of the problem domain and envisioned goals forms the basis of designing, testing and development activities. Lack of a common understanding of the domain can result in costly rework or client dissatisfaction. Research shows that the development of shared understanding in this context is a complex and error-prone process and there is room for improvement. Is this because practitioners are not following suggested practice from literature? Or are the actual barriers to shared understanding not being addressed by current tools and techniques? Is the development of shared domain understanding even viewed as problematic (or even important) by practitioners? These are some questions that need to be investigated in order to effectively design process improvements and tool support in this area, yet there is little information related to this. This study takes a multi-case study approach, which incorporate semi-structured interviews with representative from ten small-to-medium organisations. This study focuses on the vendor&#8217;s perspective and includes a mix of application domains. Result of the interviews is analysed to discover themes and patterns related to an analysis framework constructed from the literature review. The findings indicate that vendors perceive the process of developing shared application-domain understanding with their clients as being both problematic and important to a successful implementation. Twelve barriers have been identified from the analysis. The results also confirm that the process of sharing understanding development is generally perceived as being evolutionary and collaborative. This process is described by most interviewees comprises iterative phases of elicitation, confirmation and refinement of the understanding. A definite preference for face-to-face interaction is evident at regular times throughout development, particularly in early stages, although the importance of ad-hoc communications by phone or email, as domain knowledge needs arise, is also emphasised. Access to cooperative domain-expert throughout development is generally seen as a critical success factor. Several companies report using in-house domain-expert as client &#8220;proxies&#8221; in this regard. There is a mix of attitudes apparent regarding the direct communications of developers with client stakeholders. This ranged from insisting that developers are involved from initial elicitation and &#8220;kick-off&#8221; meetings, to &#8220;shielding&#8221; developers almost entirely from client. In terms of representations of understanding, participants relate natural-language, screen-shots, mock-ups, prototypes and product-demonstrations as the most useful artefacts for sharing and confirming understanding of the problem domain. They emphasise the importance of flexibility and client familiarity with the representations. In general, there is no clear separation between problem and solution spaces evident when the interviewees discussed representations of understanding, and the preference seems to be for concrete rather than abstract representations. In conclusion, comparisons between the findings and literature generally confirm contemporary thinking regarding domain knowledge sharing, although a number of barriers were given particular emphasis in this field study. The use of computer-based tool support is not widespread and the need to improve the domain knowledge sharing process and tool support in practice is widely acknowledged by the participants in this investigation. This study has identified some fruitful areas of research in this regard.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">Multiple case study</field><field name="subject">Field study</field><field name="subject">Requirement engineering</field><field name="subject">Domain knowledge</field><field name="subject">Problem domain</field><field name="subject">Shared understanding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic commerce and internationalisation in New Zealand SMEs</field><field name="creator">Jia, Jia</field><field name="description">This research focuses on internationalisation and e-commerce in small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a significant part of the New Zealand economy.

Both phenomena are examined separately to explore relevant issues, followed by consideration of the interrelationship between the two phenomena. Ten case studies of New Zealand SMEs engaged in international business were conducted. Qualitative data was collected in semi-structured interviews with key members of each SME. The interview data were supplemented with secondary data sources, including publicly available information on the firms and their activities. A within-case and cross-case analysis was performed based around the three research foci identified above. The research findings reveal that while there is a high level of confidence among the SMEs studied for internationalisation, e-commerce adoption in these firms was at a medium level of maturity. Facilitators and inhibitors of both internationalisation and e-commerce adoption are presented. A major contribution of the study is the consideration of the mutual effects between the two phenomena, in order to raise awareness of internationalisation and e-commerce in SMEs and their significance for SMEs&#8217; competitiveness.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Small to medium-sized enterprises</field><field name="subject">Internationalisation</field><field name="subject">E-commerce adoption</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrative methods for gene data analysis and knowledge discovery on the case study of KEDRI&#8217;s brain gene ontology</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yuepeng</field><field name="description">In 2003, Pomeroy et al. published a research study that described a gene expression based prediction of central nervous system embryonal tumour (CNS) outcome. Over a half of decade, many models and approaches have been developed based on experimental data consisting of 99 samples with 7,129 genes. The way, how meaningful knowledge from these models can be extracted, and how this knowledge for further research is still a hot topic. This thesis addresses this and has developed an information method that includes modelling of interactive patterns, important genes discovery and visualisation of the obtained knowledge. The major goal of this thesis is to discover important genes responsible for CNS tumour and import these genes into a well structured knowledge framework system, called Brain-Gene-Ontology. In this thesis, we take the first step towards finding the most accurate model for analysing the CNS tumour by offering a comparative study of global, local and personalised modelling. Five traditional modelling approaches and a new personalised method &#8211; WWKNN (weighted distance, weighted variables K-nearest neighbours) &#8211; are investigated. To increase the classification accuracy and one-vs.-all based signal to- noise ratio is also developed for pre-processing experimental data. For the knowledge discovery, CNS-based ontology system is developed. Through ontology analysis, 21 discriminate genes are found to be relevant for different CNS tumour classes, medulloblastoma tumour subclass and medulloblastoma treatment outcome.

A dialogue between the intentional and the contingent is initiated through a systematic approach that involves manipulation of the constituent elements of paint and the implementation of procedure and protocols as a means to activate conditions of possibility. Central to the research concerns are issues surrounding the ability of media to articulate itself, determine its own temporality and of process and content to operate conterminously.

I use hermeneutic phenomenology with the guidance of Heidegger and Gadamer, and draw on Ackermann, Hill, Maluleke, Moltmann, and Thielicke for theological direction. This study analyses how personal formation takes place and how the meaning of that experience can inform future cross-cultural interaction.  The data of this study is drawn from a range of people interviewing &#8216;me&#8217;. This includes a pre and post interview in relation to my three week exploratory visit to Malawi, and recorded daily reflections during the visit.  Upon return I was interviewed about my experience by ten people from the following areas: nursing, counselling, development, theology, business, medicine, clergy, an Expatriate Malawian, and a women working from a Maori paradigm.  These interviews focused on my experience with questions framed from the interviewer&#8217;s specialty area.  The transcripts become further data for my study. The findings of this thesis suggest that people wishing to work cross-culturally need to understand their motivation for their work, and understand who they are before entering a foreign land.  This transformative journey also needs to continue as part of the process of working with people because we can only be effective with change if we are listening and hearing the other&#8217;s perspective.  It is in being open to this difference between persons that we continue to find ourselves.  While perhaps we have a tendency to want to make everybody like us, we can only grow into our full potential in relationship with truly different others.  Tensions I experienced demonstrate that there is a complex need to understand how the context controls how HIV is perceived.  This requires uncovering some of the deeper issues of HIV and culture, and knowing how to conceptualise these in both positive and informative ways.  This thesis asks four key questions for the global-co-worker to work through before embarking on cross-cultural mission: 1. How do you know you should go?; 2. How are you going to make a difference?; 3. Who are you going to be?; and 4. What will sustain your involvement?  My own experience has drawn me into a deeper awareness of the need for a vital connectedness of faith, hope and love underpinning the everydayness of such an experience.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Working cross-culturally with HIV and AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-discovery</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutic Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Theology, health care, and development</field><field name="subject">Reflective thinking</field><field name="subject">Exploratory field visit to Malawi</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spaces between us</field><field name="creator">Eggert, Silke</field><field name="description">This screenplay is a fictional Coming of Age story of a young restless woman who, on an existentialist search for her inner self, investigates into the truth behind her famous grandmother's past, an anthropologist who conducted controversial research in the Samoa of the 1920s.

A qualitative descriptive study</field><field name="creator">Dickson, Caroline</field><field name="description">This qualitative study explores the experiences of female adolescents in relation to physical activity. The study investigates the experience of being adolescent and the meaning of a female adolescent&#8217;s experience of physical activity.  A qualitative description with a phenomenological hue was the methodology used. Their perceptions of their lived experiences in relation to physical activity were revealed through stories. The participants were six adolescent females.  The study data was gathered through open-ended questions and in-depth conversations, to seek meaning of the adolescent&#8217;s experience of physical activity.  The interviews were transcribed and stories extracted from the data. Results from the findings of the study indicate that physical activity needs to be enjoyable for the female adolescent for her to be motivated to participate.  What specifically constitutes enjoyment for the adolescent differs for each individual.  The data also suggested that other persons of influence or the female adolescent&#8217;s environment may also have an impact on their participation.  Peers, parents, their gender, body issues, competition, running, and certain restrictions were revealed as making a difference. For the female adolescent participating in physical activity, it would be advantageous to find an approach that allows a girl to experience physical activity in the way that works for her.  Some participants, already good at sports, are likely to be very competitive, want to train hard, and will build friendships among their like-minded peers. These female adolescents are not so problematic. They already love physical activity and participate in it. The challenge is to target those female adolescents who do not participate on a regular basis, and to design successful interventions which promote and encourage them into physical activity.  This change may prevent a further decline in the levels of physical activity for the adolescent who is at a stage when physical activity may be so advantageous.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Girls and sport</field><field name="subject">Sporting influences</field><field name="subject">Social interaction</field><field name="subject">Body image</field><field name="subject">Adolescent health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shapeshifting: prostitution and the problem of harm: a discourse analysis of media reportage of prostitution law reform in New Zealand in 2003</field><field name="creator">Barrington, Jane</field><field name="description">Interpersonal violence and abuse in New Zealand is so widespread it is considered a normative experience. Mental health nurses witnessing the inscribed effects of abuse on service users are lead to consider whether we are dealing with a breakdown of the mind or a breakdown in social or cultural connection (Stuhlmiller, 2003). The purpose of this research is to examine the cultural context which makes violence and abuse against women and children possible. In 2003, the public debate on prostitution law reform promised to open a space in which discourses on sexuality and violence, practices usually private or hidden, would publicly emerge. Everyday discourses relating to prostitution law reform reported in the New Zealand Herald newspaper in the year 2003 were analysed using Foucauldian and feminist post-structural methodological approaches. Foucauldian discourse analysis emphasises the ways in which power is enmeshed in discourse, enabling power relations and hegemonic practices to be made visible. The research aims were to develop a complex, comprehensive analysis of the media discourses, to examine the construction of harm in the media debate, to examine the ways in which the cultural hegemony of dominant groups was secured and contested and to consider the role of mental health nurses as agents of emancipatory political change. Mental health promotion is mainly a socio-political practice and the findings suggest that mental health nurses could reconsider their professional role, to participate politically as social activists, challenging the social order thereby reducing the human suffering which interpersonal violence and abuse carries in its wake.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foucauldian discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Feminist post-structuralism</field><field name="subject">Prostitution</field><field name="subject">Mental health nursing</field><field name="subject">Violent behaviour</field><field name="subject">Sex workers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How New Zealand universities present themselves to the public: an analysis of communication strategies</field><field name="creator">Roggendorf, Nadine</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how the eight state-funded New Zealand universities present themselves in the prospectuses they publish yearly. The background for this research is the fact that the universities now have to compete for students and funding monies because the government has linked the amount of funding to the number of students and the universities&#8217; success in research (McKenzie, 1996). Additionally, student fees and private sources increasingly contribute to the universities&#8217; budget. The entry of competition into the tertiary education sector is a result of recent policy changes that led the education sector from an egalitarian scholarly system with a tradition of open and free access for all citizens to a market-oriented education industry, which contributes considerably to the national economy. This restructuring of the tertiary education sector is part of the major social, political and economic changes that New Zealand went through &#8211; and is still going through &#8211; beginning with the Fourth Labour Government's second term of office from 1987 to 1990 (Holland &amp; Boston, 1990). The historical background of this thesis focuses on these policy changes that influenced all areas of the public life in New Zealand in the last 25 years. The literature review established that these reforms resulted in processes of commodification of education, competitive marketisation and corporatisation of the universities (Butterworth &amp; Tarling, 1994). The purpose of this thesis is to find evidence of these three tendencies within the language and visual presentation of the university prospectuses. The prospectuses have been chosen as the data corpus because they provide a comprehensive overview of the institutions. Moreover, they represent a hybrid genre of an advertorial text type, being partly informational, partly promotional. The data has been analysed by applying textually-oriented discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1992). Discourse analysis has been proven to be a suitable methodology as it links linguistic analysis to the broader social context. The premise of this approach was that social changes leave traces within the discourse. The data analysis confirmed the intended outcome that the tendencies of commodification, marketisation and corporatisation are visible in the present material. This concludes that the order of discourse of business has colonised the order of discourse of tertiary education.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textually-oriented discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Commodification of education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand universities</field><field name="subject">University prospectuses</field><field name="subject">Corporatisation</field><field name="subject">Marketisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value and validity of software effort estimation models built from a multiple organization data set</field><field name="creator">Deng, Kefu</field><field name="description">The objective of this research is to empirically assess the value and validity of a multi-organization data set in the building of prediction models for several &#8216;local&#8217; software organizations; that is, smaller organizations that might have a few project records but that are interested in improving their ability to accurately predict software project effort.  Evidence to date in the research literature is mixed, due not to problems with the underlying research ideas but with limitations in the analytical processes employed: &#8226;	the majority of previous studies have used only a single organization as the &#8216;local&#8217; sample, introducing the potential for bias &#8226;	the degree to which the conclusions of these studies might apply more generally is unable to be determined because of a lack of transparency in the data analysis processes used.  It is the aim of this research to provide a more robust and visible test of the utility of the largest multi-organization data set currently available &#8211; that from the ISBSG &#8211; in terms of enabling smaller-scale organizations to build relevant and accurate models for project-level effort prediction. Stepwise regression is employed to enable the construction of &#8216;local&#8217;, &#8216;global&#8217; and &#8216;refined global&#8217; models of effort that are then validated against actual project data from eight organizations.  The results indicate that local data, that is, data collected for a single organization, is almost always more effective as a basis for the construction of a predictive model than data sourced from a global repository.  That said, the accuracy of the models produced from the global data set, while worse than that achieved with local data, may be sufficiently accurate in the absence of reliable local data &#8211; an issue that could be investigated in future research. The study concludes with recommendations for both software engineering practice &#8211; in setting out a more dynamic scenario for the management of software development &#8211; and research &#8211; in terms of implications for the collection and analysis of software engineering data.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisation data set</field><field name="subject">Ordinary Least Squares OLS modelling</field><field name="subject">Project estimation</field><field name="subject">International Software Benchmarking Standards Group ISBSG</field><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="subject">Regression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">10 Bowen St.</field><field name="creator">Leitch, Fran</field><field name="description">This project is a site specific based exploration into the boundaries between the domestic home and the navigation of the anxious corporeal body which dwells in the space. These connections open up ways of mapping anxiety brought on through intrusive thoughts surrounding contamination (in relation to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).  The corporal navigation of the domestic is fuelled by the thoughts and their control over the notions of fear and anxiety surrounding the transferring of contaminated material from the external temporal world (dust and organic matter) into the internal sterile environment through movement or fissures in the fabric of the dwelling. The project explores the notions of the domestic space being formed into a container for the intrusive thoughts through physical acts of decontaminating, containment, sealing and expelling the elements of dirt; the body and the home become a hybrid entity alluding to the extreme control which forms and takes over the domestic space.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Containment</field><field name="subject">Decontamination</field><field name="subject">Domestic</field><field name="subject">Spatial</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Leakage</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career expectations and requirements of undergraduate hospitality students and the hospitality industry: an analysis of differences</field><field name="creator">Kim, Jung Hee (Ginny)</field><field name="description">The hospitality industry has seen rapid growth through the last three decades. The hospitality industry in New Zealand is still growing steadily. According to the Ministry of Tourism (2008, para. 3), &#8220;Visitor expenditure is forecast (from 2008 to 2014) to increase from $13.73 billion to $19.05 billion per annum, an increase of 41.4%&#8221; (Ministry of tourism, 2008b). Therefore, in response to the needs of the industry, training providers have established a number of hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism degrees (O'Mahony &amp; Sillitoe, 2001). However, previous studies have identified that hospitality management degrees tend to lack importance in the actual world (Harkison, 2004a, 2004b; Steele; 2003). Hospitality management students seem to rate the value of their degrees higher than do employees in the industry (Collins, 2002; Raybould &amp; Wilkins, 2005). Therefore, there are gaps between the expectations and assumptions of students and those of hospitality professionals, which have led to problems in the hospitality industry.  This study has taken three steps to identify: 1) how career expectations, assumptions and requirements differ between undergraduate hospitality management students and management employees in the hospitality industry; 2) The working histories of managerial employees and their perceptions of the industry&#8217;s needs; 3) Establish the perceived value of hospitality management degrees amongst hospitality management undergraduate students and the hospitality industry. To do so, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken, and questionnaires were collected from 137 undergraduates enrolled in a Bachelor of International Hospitality Management degree at AUT University and 74 managerial employees in the hotel industry. After an analysis of the data, the researcher examined and compared the results of both groups&#8217; data with relation to the findings of the literature review.  The following key points emerged from the research: most students expected that they would work in the hospitality industry after completing their course and supposed that their first work field would be in a Food and Beverage department at a management trainee level. The results of the survey show a match between students&#8217; long-term career expectations and the working history of employees. Students also seem to understand the environment of the hospitality industry well. These results show that students organise well, planning for their future careers, and these results were similar with those of some previous studies (Brien, 2004; Harkison, 2004b; Jenkins, 2001). The results of this study identified similarities and differences of perceptions between undergraduate students and managerial employees in the hotel industry. Similarities of students&#8217; perceptions and managerial employees&#8217; perceptions are; &#8226;	Commitment is rated as the most important factor in determining success, while personality is rated the most important attribute for an employee in the hospitality industry. &#8226;	A degree in hospitality management is not recognised as an important qualification by students or employee respondents. Working experience is more important than a bachelor degree of hospitality management for a prospective employee. &#8226;	Students and managerial employees believe that the hospitality educators know the industry well, although educators and employees have different understandings of career expectations. &#8226;	Both parties believe that internship might help hospitality students&#8217; careers in the industry. Differences of perceptions between undergraduate students and managerial employees are; &#8226;	Students believe that knowledge of the industry and experience are the most significant factors for a new employee in the hospitality industry but employees indicate personality. &#8226;	Employees believe that using initiative skills are the most important factor for an employee&#8217;s career development, whereas students answer communication skills. &#8226;	Students believe that a hospitality management bachelor degree will contribute more to the hotel business but employees believe that having three years&#8217; experience will contribute more. &#8226;	Students consider that an employee with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in hospitality will receive higher starting salaries than someone without, but employees disagree. &#8226;	Students suggest that a bachelor of hospitality management degree will affect opportunities for promotion, but employees do not share that opinion. This study found that even if students and managerial employees share some common opinions, many gaps still exist between them. Therefore, the researcher suggests recommendations relating to students&#8217; expectations and assumptions of their job entry level, the working environment in the hospitality industry, the needs of the hospitality industry, and the value of a bachelors degree of hospitality management. Furthermore, the researcher identifies some limitations of this study and areas for further research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career expectations of hospitality students</field><field name="subject">Career requirements of hospitality managers</field><field name="subject">Hospitality management students</field><field name="subject">Hospitality industry</field><field name="subject">Profile of hospitality managers</field><field name="subject">Questionnaire survey method</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emptiness as a visual strategy: an exploration of visual absence in contemporary art practice</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Yue Qu</field><field name="description">This project explores the idea of visual absence in relation to the notion of Chinese classical aesthetics of emptiness.

It is versatile and has been widely adopted to join various materials. There has been strong research activity on revealing the details of the material flow pattern in the nugget zone induced by the conventional shoulder tool. However, there is insufficient understanding on the aspects of the scroll shoulder tool design and the shoulder flow zone formation utilizing this type of tool. The major objective of this study was to conduct experiments, analyse results and then reveal the shoulder flow zone forming mechanism for the scroll shoulder tool. The method used was to identify the flow pattern in the shoulder flow zone using a &#8216;marker insert&#8217; technique, and then to suggest the forming mechanism of the shoulder flow zone based on the obtained flow pattern; although the &#8216;marker insert&#8217; technique has never been used to study the shoulder flow zone flow pattern induced by the scroll shoulder tool. Experiments were conducted to examine the thick sections 6061 aluminium &#8216;marker insert&#8217; welds, which were welded using a scroll shoulder tool at a range of welding parameters. These were followed by quantifying the mass of the accumulated work piece material within the scroll groove (pick up material-PUM), evaluating the effect of welding parameters on the shoulder flow zone formation, and documenting the shoulder flow zone flow pattern. The major finding was that there is a simple banded structure which forms in a layer to layer manner in the bottom portion of the shoulder flow zone, but it disappears in the top portion of the shoulder flow zone. Accordingly, the forming mechanism of the shoulder flow zone for the scroll shoulder tool was suggested as follows. Firstly, the tool pin is plunged into the work piece; the work piece material is extruded by the pin and pushed up into the scroll groove forming the PUM. Secondly, after the tool shoulder is plunged into the work piece to a certain depth, the scroll groove is fully filled up with the PUM. Finally, during the forward movement of the tool, the central portion of PUM is driven downward by the root portion of the pin and then detaches from the pin (tip portion) in a layer to layer manner. It has also found that the thickness of the shoulder flow zone varies with a thicker on the advancing side than on the retreating side, and there is a positive linear relationship between the mass of PUM and the weld quality. This study has revealed for the first time the forming mechanism of the shoulder flow zone, and has improved the understanding of the shoulder flow zone formation using a scroll shoulder tool. It is recommended that a &#8216;shoulder-breaking&#8217; technique is developed to break the rotating shoulder suddenly and hence embed it into the work piece during FSW, in which a real-time shoulder-work piece couple could be produced for a better three-dimensional examination of the shoulder flow zone.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Friction stir welding</field><field name="subject">Material flow</field><field name="subject">Shoulder flow zone</field><field name="subject">Engineering technique</field><field name="subject">Metallography</field><field name="subject">Quantification of induced PUM</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bursting bubbles: a moving image exploration of contemporary Chinese individuality</field><field name="creator">Gao, Yi</field><field name="description">This thesis is a practical project which involves moving images and paintings together as a medium that explores phenomena of contemporary China relating to personal identity, independence and its relationship with the traditional importance on collective groups, group centredness and interdependence.

While there have been many cases and literature on management of culture integration for merger and acquisition from a Western perspective, few have discussed cultural integration in an Asian context. This study provides a case study of cultural integration strategies Lenovo has undertaken to manage employees from both teams after the M&amp;A. It adopts a semi-structure face-to-face interview research method, which 5 participants were selected from the culture integration committee for interview. During the interview, each participant answered the questions from their perspective of the job position they are currently in. The method would enhance the quality of the research as it looks into the problems and strategy that Lenovo has encountered and undertaken from various points of view. However, as no employees from IBM PC-D on the committee were available to participate in the research, it might place some limitations on the research simply because IBM team&#8217;s opinions were not taken into account. After analysing the results obtained from the participants, the researcher found that there were several motives for Lenovo to acquire IBM PC-D, including: - 1) internationalization, 2) acquiring technology and skills, 3) acquiring a brand, 4) obtaining access to new customers, 5) increase bargaining position to suppliers. Among these five motives, acquiring brand was considered to be the most important motive. As Chinese product has always been marketed at the lower end of the product line with low costs and poor quality, acquiring IBM&#8217;s brand would enable Lenovo to boost its product image and to gain access to customers outside the Chinese market. In managing two teams within the organisation, Lenovo has taken very few steps to integrate two teams into one. Instead, a separate management mode was encouraged by Lenovo to allow IBM PC-D to maintain its own management system and procedures. In addition, a culture integration committee was voluntarily set up by employees from various departments to design initiatives to encourage communication between two teams. When problems arise due to the difference between two teams, Lenovo has adopted an accommodation strategy by making adjustments to the work schedule of its employee in the Lenovo team in order to accommodate employees in IBM team. As a result, it has increased the workload for staff in Lenovo team and this may thus lead to stress and work-life imbalance to its employees. Overall, the strategy that Lenovo has adopted to manage two teams seems to have worked well and the culture integration committee appears to have served well in encouraging the communication between two teams. On the other hand, as the participants in the interview were not directly involved with the designing and crafting the strategy of culture integration, that might have some limitation on the result. Therefore, it is suggested that further research can be done to capture the opinion from members that are directly involved in the design of culture integration strategy as well as teams from IBM PC-D in order to ensure a well provided empirical and consistent view.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural integration</field><field name="subject">Merger and acquistion</field><field name="subject">Globalization</field><field name="subject">Internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Organisational behaviour</field><field name="subject">Organizational behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Manaakitanga i roto i ng&#257; ahumahi T&#257;poi - the interpretation of manaakitanga from a M&#257;ori tourism supplier perspective</field><field name="creator">Martin, Frances Kahui</field><field name="description">Manaakitanga plays an important role in M&#257;ori society. There are several meanings associated to this M&#257;ori cultural concept, one of which refers to the fostering and nurturing of relationships between a host and a visitor.  The well-being of the visitor is paramount to the development of this relationship as the mana (prestige) of the host is at stake. If the host fails to manaaki (support) their visitor this could result in the loss of mana within the M&#257;ori community as the host has shown they are incapable of attending to the needs of others. In recent times, there has been an increased presence of the term manaakitanga in tourism related documents, which has generated several interpretations of this cultural concept. Currently, various government organisations use this concept as a basis for developing both short and long-term strategies. This is particularly noticeable in the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015. However, there are varied interpretations of the term manaakitanga by the tourism industry, which are in conflict with M&#257;ori operators understanding and knowledge of manaakitanga reflected in their businesses. In order to contextualise the experiences and perspectives provided by M&#257;ori tourism operators, a theoretical framework has been developed. This framework called &#8216;Te K&#333;hai&#8217; located in kaupapa M&#257;ori (M&#257;ori ideology) ideology best reflects the world-view of the participants who form the basis of this study. Thus, this study has been prompted by the research question - how is manaakitanga interpreted in a M&#257;ori tourism operation?  Possible misinterpretation of manaakitanga may result in the concept being used incorrectly and the transgression of cultural practices, thus compromising the experiences offered by M&#257;ori tourism operations. It is important then, to investigate, whether manaakitanga is understood as &#8216;hospitality&#8217; in the tourism industry and more specifically, by people who work within a M&#257;ori tourism operation. Additionally, it is important to determine how staff employed in a M&#257;ori tourism operation, understand and portray this concept. Subsequently, interpretations of manaakitanga from the perspective of M&#257;ori tourism operators, forms the basis of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori ideology</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Added value to business</field><field name="subject">Tourism and indigenous people</field><field name="subject">Organisational ideology</field><field name="subject">Organizational ideology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing governance in the voluntary and community sector: a case study of organisations in the Taranaki region</field><field name="creator">Cayley, Simon</field><field name="description">Voluntary and community organisations are fundamental to society because they are major stakeholders in building the social capital that underpins healthy and well-functioning communities.  Yet many of these organisations are small and possess limited resources when measured against the challenges and needs that they address.  This raises the issue of the capacity of organisations within the sector to operate effectively.  Within the range of capacity issues, governance is consistently rated as an area requiring development.  This research seeks to contribute to a better understanding of issues impacting on the governance capacity of voluntary and community sector organisations within the overall context of capacity building.  A focused study in the Taranaki region examines the factors impacting on the governance of community organisations providing social services.  The research identifies the level of governance capacity demonstrated within the organisations studied and also explores the level of awareness around the need to enhance governance capacity.  The research examines a range of frameworks and models used to build governance capacity to see if they could be adapted for the Taranaki region.  The study suggests that, although a number of frameworks and models are useful, every situation is different, and models must be responsive to the social and cultural context and the particular history and mission of each organisation.  As a result, the study concludes that further work should be undertaken to develop a model of governance for the voluntary and community sector.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Appreciative enquiry</field><field name="subject">Unpaid work</field><field name="subject">Community organizations</field><field name="subject">Model building</field><field name="subject">Structured interview</field><field name="subject">Capacity building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raising half the sky: work&#8211;life balance of Chinese female administrative workers</field><field name="creator">Ma, Yan</field><field name="description">In recent years, a growing body of research has examined the issue of work&#8211;life balance (WLB). WLB initiatives have been developed by organisations, not only to aid employees in leading healthier and more satisfying lives, but to attract and retain talent. One area where WLB issues have not been examined in detail is from the perspective of Chinese immigrant women. As one of the largest and growing Asian ethnic groups, the WLB issues faced by Chinese women are especially worthy of being examined and addressed. The primary purpose of this research was to explore the WLB experience of Chinese women in administrative roles at Auckland University of Technology (AUT). It also aims to contribute to the body of knowledge on WLB issues for minority ethnic groups and investigated Chinese women&#8217;s coping strategies for integrating work with their non-work roles. An exploratory qualitative case study approach was adopted for this study in order to compare and contrast organisational initiatives and policies for WLB with women&#8217;s experiences. A triangulated research design was also employed to glean qualitative data by virtue of multiple methods including archival evidence such as publicly available documentation, secondary research on WLB and AUT&#8217;s WLB policies, and semi-structured interviews. This study involved 12 Chinese female administrative staff and three staff members from the Human Resource Department (HRD), the Asian Staff Network (ASN) and the AUT Branch of Tertiary Institutes Allied Staff Association (TIASA). Participants were recruited by utilising sources such as the Asian Staff Network (ASN) and the researcher&#8217;s network of contacts within AUT. The findings of the study indicated that Chinese women&#8217;s WLB experience and ways of handling work&#8211;family conflict (WFC) and family&#8211;work conflict (FWC) were affected by their experiences of immigration and cultural backgrounds. In particular, their family situation had a critical influence on the way they organised their households and arranged for childcare or eldercare. Child/elder care responsibilities, personal/family emergencies, and personal/individual sacrifice engendered tensions around their ability to integrate WLB. In addition, work factors such as heavy workloads, meeting deadlines, and working longer hours, and cultural barriers caused emotional stress and physical consequences.  While informal support from managers and colleagues and the WLB policies offered by the university helped women address their WLB issues, some policies were underutilised. A variety of coping strategies such as family members, win-lose strategies, time management, building clear boundaries, changing mindsets, and demonstrating commitment were actively adopted by Chinese women as mechanisms to cope with tensions between their work and family lives. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the theory and practice of WLB.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Work&#8211;life balance in organizations</field><field name="subject">Chinese women</field><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Cultural experience in the  workplace</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Qualitative case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talanoa: matala 'oe fonua</field><field name="creator">Toluta'u, Talita</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with representation.

Drawing on the work of Marshall McLuhan, the early stages of this thesis present an enquiry into the unique positive qualities of both radio and the Internet. The argument that follows contends that radio presented on the Internet can draw from the perceived technological benefits of each individual medium, combining as a potential site for public spheres. Both Habermas&#8217;s liberal public sphere and contemporary critiques of the concept are examined to define a range of principles that could be tested against relevant examples. The increasing commercialisation of the Internet is presented as a challenge to the normative ideals of a public sphere and counter-balances the optimism of a technologically determinist approach. A series of thematic codes are developed from the relevant theory and combined with qualitative interviews. This forms the framework for a thematic analysis of three individual case studies: Unwelcome Guests, an anti-corporate radio programme, SW Radio Africa, &#8220;the independent voice of Zimbabwe,&#8221; and NH Making Waves, the radio arm of a community peace activist group. The study investigates opportunities for these three individual case studies to act as public spheres, by examining the interplay that occurs between both Internet and radio practices. As the thematic analysis will demonstrate, placing radio content on the Internet presents new opportunities to diversify content and audiences through collaborative production and improved distribution. Recommendations for further research emphasise the need to pursue the Internet&#8217;s role in the public sphere potential of radio.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital radio</field><field name="subject">Political economy of the internet</field><field name="subject">Public sphere</field><field name="subject">New media</field><field name="subject">Thematic analysis</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile phone based remote monitoring system</field><field name="creator">Liu, Danyi</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates embedded databases and graphical interfaces for the MicroBaseJ project.

The project developed a generic solution that can be implemented in a number of commercial sectors, such as horticulture, building management and pollution/water management. The developed concept is tested using data relevant to the horticultural area of application. The system also addresses the main issues related to mobile monitoring, including real-time response, data integrity, solution cost, graphical presentation, and persistent storage capabilities of modern mobile devices. Four embedded databases based on J2ME have been investigated. Two of the four have been evaluated and analysed. The Insert function, Sequence Search, and Random Search of Perst List and RMS (Record Management System) databases have been tested. The size of the processed data was limited to 20,000 records when using the wireless toolkit simulator, and 11,000 records when using a mobile phone. Perst Lite reflects good performance and has out-performed RMS in all tests. User interface software such as J2ME Polish for mobile phones has been investigated. Custom J2ME class for graphical interface is developed. This provides the graphical presentation of the data collected from the sensors; including temperature, wind speed, wind direction, moisture, and leaf wetness. The graphical interface, bar charts, and line charts with trace ball for collected data have been designed and implemented.  The embedded database performance and project performance have been investigated and analysed. The performances of Perst Lite and RMS are evaluated in terms of the insert, sequence search, and random search functions based on simulation and real devices. The record numbers vary from 1,000 to 20,000. The project performance contains data receiving and storage, and data presentation and configuration. The performance of data storage and configuration can be negated due to the running mode and the response time. Thus, data presenting performance is the key focus in this project. This performance was divided into the categories of initial, data search, data selection, and charting. The initial performance includes the initialisation of the project parameters, and the reaching of the welcome interface. Data search performance refers to the retrieval of the specified data from the embedded database, measured on 48 data points, which only can be presented on the mobile screen from the retrieved data. These four performance types are measured in thousands of record numbers, varying from 1,000 to 18,000 record numbers, with the retrieved data range varying from 1 day to 30 days.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile application</field><field name="subject">Remote control</field><field name="subject">Mobile phone technology</field><field name="subject">Cell phone technology</field><field name="subject">Mobile database applications</field><field name="subject">Graphic User Interface design</field><field name="subject">Cellular phones</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mission as Good Neighbour: social policy of the Methodist Mission Northern in the 21st century</field><field name="creator">Devanandan, B. Prince</field><field name="description">The Methodist Mission Northern has provided social services to the community since 1851. The underpinning philosophy of Methodist Mission Northern&#8217;s service provision is that of being a Good Neighbour. The concept of Good Neighbour derives from the Old and the New Testaments of the Holy Bible, the Hebrew Scriptures and also public policy. A defining moment in the emergence of Christian universalism comes when the neighbour is asserted to include everyone, &#8230; while the Levite and the Cohen pass by the injured man&#8230; the Good Samaritan comes to his aid and proves himself the true neighbour of his (injured) neighbour [Zizek, Santner, &amp; Reinhard, 2005, p. 6]. What does Good Neighbour entail in the context of so many people suffering owing to poverty, injustice and social exclusion? This study set out to examine how the concept of Good Neighbour has been put into practice and how that is relevant in contemporary public policy setting. This research was undertaken using phenomenological enquiry approach which explored the experiences of the key stakeholders namely the Board of Governors, the staff and the clients or service recipients of the Methodist Mission Northern to understand the impact of service delivery on clients. This was done through a review of the Minutes of the Board Meetings and Annual Reports over a twenty year period from 1986 to 2006. The study found that for the greater part of the history the operation of the concept of Good Neighbour by Methodist Mission Northern tended to focus on the charity model which provides for the day to day needs of the clients such as providing food, clothing and shelter and other immediate needs. For Methodist Mission Northern&#8217;s concept of Good Neighbour to reflect its underpinning philosophy more effectively the practice needs to move beyond the charity model into a community development model focussed on social change and transformation. This means meeting the needs of clients in ways that empower them to move towards independence and interdependent self sustainability.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Faith based social service</field><field name="subject">Methodist Mission</field><field name="subject">Good Neighbour</field><field name="subject">Social policy</field><field name="subject">Religion and society</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural tourism development in the eastern Hokianga area</field><field name="creator">Eruera, Alice</field><field name="description">Rural Tourism is increasingly being used as a development strategy to improve the social and economic well being of rural areas. Rural Tourism encompasses a huge range of activities, natural or manmade attractions, amenities and facilities, transportation, marketing and information systems (Sharpley &amp; Sharpley, 1997). Rural tourism is very diverse and fragmented in terms of operational structures, activities, markets and operating environments (Roberts &amp; Hall, 2001, citing Pearce, 1989). Benefits of rural tourism have been expressed as employment growth and broadening a region&#8217;s economic base, repopulation, social improvement, and revitalization of local craft (Sharpley, 2000). Governments can play active roles in tourism. In short the literature suggests rural tourism development policy approaches require: regeneration/revitalization, horizontal and vertical integration, interdependence, stewardship/sustainability, mediation, cataclysm, service and welfare provisions, spatiality &#8211; awareness, intra and inter regional complementariness, opportunism, realism and quality (Roberts &amp; Hall, 2001). Murphy (1985) proposed a community approach to tourism development which included formation of businesses networks, and the sharing of resources and information. For rural tourism to be successful, collaboration needs to exist amongst entrepreneurs (Wilson et al., 2001). Useful integrated approaches to rural studies include acknowledging the importance of locally controlled agendas to reach centralization, awareness of the benefits for shared ideas and funding developments, and creating appropriate tourism plans for rural areas (MacDonald &amp; Jolliffe, 2003). There are numerous challenges when attempting rural tourism development: the total product package must be sufficient; significant investment may be required; there is the adaption to a service role; the quality of products and services and the availability of skills and resources for effective marketing (Sharpley, 2000). Tourism development requires attractions, promotion, infrastructure and services and hospitality (Wilson et al., 2001, citing Gunn, 1988). The remote Eastern Hokianga area is situated in the Far North (Northland) region of New Zealand.  The area has a low population and is sparsely populated presenting an ideal place to relax with an unhurried atmosphere, flourishing fauna and flora, rich in New Zealand history and culture. This is an economically depressed area that is situated in the centre of Northland&#8217;s three key tourism icons - The Bay of Islands, the Waipoua Forest, and the top of the North Island. The location of the Eastern Hokianga presents an opportunity to create a tourism destination that will attract travellers frequenting the key tourism icons. To date there has been no research on rural tourism development conducted in the Eastern Hokianga. Although comprehensive research was conducted previously in the Hokianga by the James Henare Maori Research Centre (1999) it was concentrated specifically to the &#8220;Maori culture&#8221;. This research aims to examine and identify the key challenges of rural tourism development for the Eastern Hokianga through an analysis of rural tourism development approaches, and identifying the social and economic impacts of tourism. Key findings show that the Eastern Hokianga is an undeveloped area and does not fit with the majority of the rural tourism definitions as described in the literature. The area is displaying positive impacts of rural tourism development. The negative impacts are minimal as the Eastern Hokianga is still in the initial development stage of rural tourism. There are many integrated approaches to rural tourism development currently. A strategic approach is occurring with a tourism policy and community involvement in decision making. There is an integration approach with one RTO actively involved in the communities&#8217; tourism association with the local businesses. Two key clustering approaches are being utilized &#8211; the Twin Coast Discovery Route and total product packaging. Regeneration is not occurring but was not an issue raised by the community, whereas a financing approach was an identified challenge by Eastern Hokianga businesses. The need to improve accessibility through infrastructure was the second key challenge to rural tourism development. The area was not restricted by the other challenges of government&#8217;s role, education / experience and marketing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rural tourism</field><field name="subject">Tourism development</field><field name="subject">Governmental role in tourism</field><field name="subject">Interpretivist approach</field><field name="subject">In-depth interview</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of cultural context on corporate web sites: a New Zealand and South Korean comparison</field><field name="creator">Choi, Mun Ga</field><field name="description">This study examines the impact of national culture on the content of corporate Web sites, and Web users&#8217; attitudes and intentions toward culturally congruent or incongruent Web sites. In this work, culturally bipolar clusters based on Hofstede&#8217;s (1991) and Hall&#8217;s (1976) cultural dimensions are conceptualised. New Zealand and Korea are chosen as representatives of the respective bipolar clusters. This research utilises both content analysis and experimental research to provide deep insight into an area which has not yet been explored. Two studies are undertaken, Study One, focusing on the content analysis, examines how the use of visual communication and Web features differs between the two countries and between industry types. Study Two assesses Web users&#8217; predispositions to respond favourably or unfavourably to the Web site. Web users&#8217; perceptions, measured by experimental research with four culturally manipulated Web sites, are assumed to be the most suitable concept for studying the effectiveness of Web sites. Three ethnic groups are involved: Korean university students, New Zealand university students, and English-Korean bilingual university students. The findings reveal differences in the content of corporate Web sites from the two countries. However, these results do not support the findings of extant research. The results show that the corporate Web sites studied can be distinguished not only by the two national cultures, but also by other significant factors such as a company&#8217;s characteristics, its online presence strategy, national broadband infrastructure, and unique Internet culture. Additionally, the segment of young adults shows a convergence of cultural value systems which can be attributed to the fact that young adults in both countries have similar perceptions toward corporate Web sites regardless of their nationalities. Language structure and local terminology on the Web sites, however, are still important. This study contributes to knowledge by providing critical insights into the effectiveness and cultural congruence of Web sites. The results will benefit both academics and practitioners.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural adaptation</field><field name="subject">Attitude</field><field name="subject">Future intention</field><field name="subject">Industry effects</field><field name="subject">Web site effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Content analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of independent advocacy groups in RFID technology use: the current status of RFID technology adoption in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jiayu</field><field name="description">Radio frequency identification, also known as RFID technology, has been commercially available since World War II. In recent years, interest has turned toward using RFID in supply chain management, such as monitoring and tracking business processes. There are many businesses that have already invested in an RFID supply chain management solution but little is known about the current state of diffusion of RFID technology and the role of advocacy groups in the diffusion process. This research investigated the current state of RFID diffusion in New Zealand according to diffusion of innovation and Moore&#8217;s theory to provide insight into the role of innovation advocacy groups such as New Zealand RFID Pathfinder Group (referred as the NZ RFID Pathfinder Group). RFID in supply chain management terms is inter-organisational and much of the role of advocacy groups is in networking between players in the supply chain management context. Therefore, this research focused on industry group leaders. The research was conducted in two main parts, an online questionnaire survey and a follow up interview. The online questionnaire survey used a quantitative approach while the interview used a qualitative one. In summary, the result show that: 14% industries (seven out of 51) have already adopted RFID technology, the industries were from importer, research institute, manufacturing, and distribution; 36% have plans (16 out of 44) to adopt RFID technology in the near future, the industries were from importer, research institute, manufacturing, and distribution; and 64% industries (28 out of 44) did not any plan to adopt RFID. The strong recommendation was to standardise each aspect of the technology, making the products available to clients and creating competition between RFID technology service suppliers, thus bringing down the cost through market forces. Increasing the number of members of advocacy group could also encourage RFID adoption. One group of potential RFID adopters in the future will be local branches of international companies with a mandate to adopt RFID technology. The results suggest that the NZ RFID Pathfinder Group should set the direction of NZ RFID adoption; get involved in national pilots; and the activities of lobbying governments and associations and information sharing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology and business</field><field name="subject">Innovation theory</field><field name="subject">Diffusion theory</field><field name="subject">Advocates</field><field name="subject">Advocacy groups</field><field name="subject">New Zealand RFID Pathfinder Group</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceived benefits for customer service of ITIL IT control use</field><field name="creator">Egeler, Markus</field><field name="description">IT service management is becoming more and more important in the current business environment. Especially the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a widely adopted and accepted IT service management framework (Wagner 2006). Organizations that adopt one of the IT service management frameworks expect to achieve a large range of benefits through the use of the frameworks. The major benefits that are expected to be realised include reduced costs, IT services that are tailored to the business needs, a higher quality of IT services, and improved customer satisfaction (OGC 2007a). Despite the growing importance and acceptance of IT service management and ITIL, there is not much literature that is concerned with the benefits that can be realised when one of the relevant IT service management frameworks is in place. Only a few studies were published in conference proceedings (e.g. Hochstein et al. 2005, Potgieter et al. 2005, Cater-Steel et al. 2006). Even though these studies were able to confirm some of the claims made by the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), the publisher of the ITIL series, there are still a lot of claims that are not evaluated to date. This thesis is taking a Monte-Carlo method based simulation approach to identify some of the benefits of the ITIL for customer service. To achieve this, an initial research model was developed that represents the four most likely benefits for customer service of the use of ITIL and their relationship with customer service and the generation of business value. Subsequently the different path ways for the relationships were explored and models for each of the possible paths were designed. These models include a mediated model, an unmediated model and a partially mediated model. After defining the estimates and constraints for the simulation, the simulation was executed using a MS Excel spreadsheet. The simulation results presented a large amount of data for each of the models and their relationships. The models produced normal distributions and showed stability for changed input and throughput parameters. The analysis of the findings showed that the changes in estimates for each of the models and the associated results of the simulation followed a linear pattern. The linearity of the models combined with the normal distribution of the results offers a lot of opportunities for the use of the developed models. A further enhancement through a test with real-life data could provide the basis for a tool to quantitatively predict the impact of an ITIL implementation on customer service and the creation of value for the business. In addition the four most likely contributors to improved customer service based on the use of ITIL have been identified from a literature review. The identified contribution towards improved customer service of these four beneficiary factors is supported by the results of the simulation. Therefore the results of this thesis provide the research community with a model that could provide the basis for further exploration of the beneficiary effects of ITIL on customer service.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology infrastructure library</field><field name="subject">Quantitative approach</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="subject">Capability maturity</field><field name="subject">IT service management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A civil and ecclesiastical union? The development of prison chaplaincy in Aotearoa-New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mansill, Douglas B</field><field name="description">New Zealand prisons were a colonial construct established by early colonial administrations to deal with criminal behaviour occurring at the time of European settlement.  Like the prison system, prison chaplaincy also had its origins in colonial experiences from the United Kingdom where chaplains were employed to meet the spiritual needs of those in institutions such as schools, hospitals, colleges, the military and legations. This thesis addressed the question of how the partnership between Church and State administrators in New Zealand for the provision of chaplaincy services developed between 1840 and 2006.  Four phases were identified in the evolution of prison chaplaincy: phase one 1840-to-1950, characterised by ad hoc arrangements between clergy and local prison management; phase two 1951-to-1989 when Secretary for Justice Samuel Barnett established a formal relationship with the National Council of Churches and the Roman Catholic Church to provide chaplains for penal institutions; phase three identified as &#8216;prisons in change&#8217; 1990-1999, when the Interim Chaplaincy Advisory Board and Prison Chaplaincy Advisory Board worked in tandem with the Departments of Justice and Corrections to administer the Prison Chaplaincy Service, arising from the recommendations of the Roper and Perry Reports; and phase four 2000-to-2006, a period when the Prison Chaplaincy Service of Aotearoa New Zealand was contracted to the Department of Corrections to employ prison chaplains. The research adopted a multi-faceted approach, consisting of phenomenology, ethno-methodology and hermeneutics to understand attitudes and experiences of key players and institutions in the evolution of Prison Chaplaincy. Data was collected through interviews of key informants, critical evaluation of published and unpublished material in public and private collections. The study identified six key factors that influenced the development of Prison Chaplaincy in New Zealand. These were: the nature of the Church-State interface, the impact of biculturalism, the influence of theological and ecclesiastical trends, and the impact of inter-church politics, the influence of socio economic trends and developments, and changes in Government policy.  It also found that while there were tensions, the Church-State partnership had positive benefits for the spiritual outcomes for prisoners.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religion and penal system</field><field name="subject">Government and Christianity</field><field name="subject">Multi-faceted methodology</field><field name="subject">Capital punishment</field><field name="subject">Jail, incarceration, gaol, penitentiary</field><field name="subject">Church and society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discussing the nature of painting through the poetics of transaction and experience</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Sandra</field><field name="description">This research project will explore American philosopher John Dewey&#8217;s theory of transaction, and Shannon Sullivan&#8217;s interpretation of Dewey&#8217;s theory, the &#8216;Transactional Body&#8217;, and their inherent potential for the making and reception of painting.  Dewey stated (Dewey, cited in Sullivan: 1-2) that organisms live as much in processes across and 'through' skins as in processes 'within skins'.  Sullivan&#8217;s &#8216;transactional body&#8217; is always in a state of flux, a morphic body in perpetual motion.  Within an artistic context this raises the possibility of exploring the theory of transaction as it applies to painting, using the concept of automatic intuitive art practice.  Central to this investigation will be direct connection between senses, instincts, intuition, and the painting.  Sullivan suggests that truth and wisdom can be pursued through somatic experience. Therefore the process will be explored by an extension of the corporeal body through the physicality of gesture, movement, rhythm, colour, and mark making.  A recurring subtext throughout this investigation will be that of &#8216;duality&#8217;; specifically that defined as the struggle between the use of the conscious, critical mind, allowing for the transaction between artist, paint and canvas to occur naturally and intuitively.  The conscious mind / intuition duality manifests at various stages during the manufacture and reception of a painting.  Whilst the project relies upon automatic and intuitive praxis, conscious decisions are made regarding the size and shape of the canvas, the medium used, and through reflective analysis of the completed work.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Heuristics</field><field name="subject">Art and experience</field><field name="subject">Acrylic on canvas</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drivers of Australian merger waves: industry shocks, mis-valuation and capital liquidity</field><field name="creator">Porwal, Anmol</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to test the extended industry shock hypothesis, which accounts for a macro-economic capital liquidity element, in determining the drivers of merger waves. Various theories have been extended by the literature and these are broadly classified under the neo-classical theory of merger waves and the behavioural theory of merger waves. Behavioural theories have explained merger waves by taking into account the psychology of stock markets and the occurrence of merger waves during a stock market boom. The industry shock hypothesis (a neo-classical theory) however, argues that merger waves are due to the clustering of industry shocks that affect an industry&#8217;s operating environment. Along with this shock, the mis-valuation caused by a stock market boom increases asset values, thereby lowering transaction costs and hence increasing capital liquidity in the economy. This capital liquidity factor causes merger waves to cluster even if industry shocks do not.  The findings in this study show that industry level merger waves exist in Australia and they occur when there is sufficient capital liquidity in the economy. The industry shock variables are found to be insignificant; however they do improve the explanatory power of the explanatory variables used in predicting the start of a merger wave. The mis-valuation variables used in this study: market-to-book ratio, 3-year return and standard deviation of the 3-year return, are insignificant and do not have any explanatory powers in predicting the start of a merger wave. Merger and acquisition announcements made to acquire Australian firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), are collected and analysed for the period from 1996 to 2007. The methodology used in this study is adopted from Harford (2005), which uses legit models to predict the start of merger waves. The explanatory variables are also adopted from Harford&#8217;s (2005) study and include proxies for mis-valuation, industry shock and capital liquidity. Overall, the results obtained for the Australian merger and acquisition data are inconclusive as to whether industry shocks because industry merger waves as Harford (2005) documented for the US merger and acquisition data. However, industry level merger waves do exist, as there is clustering in time of firm-level mergers within industries. Moreover, sufficient capital liquidity must be present to accommodate the necessary transactions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate environment</field><field name="subject">Industry shock theory</field><field name="subject">Australian merger and acquisition</field><field name="subject">Market to book ratio</field><field name="subject">Economic shock</field><field name="subject">Share market</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A generic platform for the evolution of hardware</field><field name="creator">Bedi, Abhishek</field><field name="description">Evolvable Hardware is a technique derived from evolutionary computation applied to a hardware design. The term evolutionary computation involves similar steps as involved in the human evolution. It has been given names in accordance with the electronic technology like, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Evolutionary Strategy (ES) and Genetic Programming (GP). In evolutionary computing, a configured bit is considered as a human chromosome for a genetic algorithm, which has to be downloaded into hardware. Early evolvable hardware experiments were conducted in simulation and the only elite chromosome was downloaded to the hardware, which was labelled as Extrinsic Hardware. With the invent of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Reconfigurable Processing Units (RPUs), it is now possible for the implementation solutions to be fast enough to evaluate a real hardware circuit within an evolutionary computation framework; this is called an Intrinsic Evolvable Hardware. This research has been taken in continuation with project 'Evolvable Hardware' done at Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT). The project was able to manually evolve two simple electronic circuits of NAND and NOR gates in simulation. In relation to the project done at MIT this research focuses on the following: To automate the simulation by using In Circuit Debugging Emulators (IDEs), and to develop a strategy of configuring hardware like an FPGA without the use of their company supplied in circuit debugging emulators, so that the evolution of an intrinsic evolvable hardware could be controlled, and is hardware independent. As mentioned, the research conducted here was able to develop an evolvable hardware friendly Generic Structure which could be used for the development of evolvable hardware. The structure developed was hardware independent and was able to run on various FPGA hardware&#8217;s for the purpose of intrinsic evolution. The structure developed used few configuration bits as compared to current evolvable hardware designs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolutionary computing</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithm code</field><field name="subject">Genetic programming</field><field name="subject">EHW</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustaining one&#8217;s own health and wellness while supporting a stroke survivor: spouses&#8217; and partners&#8217; perspectives</field><field name="creator">Moloczij, Natasha</field><field name="description">Utilising an interpretive descriptive approach, this qualitative study explores and identifies how spouses and partners of stroke survivors sustain their own health and wellness.  Recent literature has mainly focused on identifying psychological coping strategies thought to assist in adapting to the caring role.  As a consequence, there is limited knowledge regarding the experiences of how spouses and partners attend to their own health and well-being.  This study aimed to explore how spouses and partners sustain their own health and wellness while supporting a stroke survivor.  Purposive and theoretical sampling strategies were used to guide recruitment.  Semi-structured interviews were carried out with seven spouses and partners who were living with, and supporting a stroke survivor.  A central theme with three sub-themes became apparent when examining spouses and partners&#8217; experiences.  The theme of Meeting Needs connects the three sub-themes, in that spouses&#8217; and partners&#8217; health and wellness appeared to be influenced by and intertwined with attending to the stroke survivors&#8217; needs.  The context of Being in a Relationship provided a rationale for prioritising the stroke survivors&#8217; needs and was the first sub-theme.  Secondly, Living Both Lives explains how spouses/partners were busy thinking and attending primarily to the stroke survivor&#8217;s daily requirements whilst also trying to attend their own needs.  The third sub-theme, Uncertain Health encompasses how a spouse&#8217;s and partner&#8217;s well-being is connected to the stroke survivors&#8217; health and their future concerns about being able to provide care if they themselves become sick.  Therefore, these circumstances shaped their ability to attend to their own health and well-being.  Whilst attending to the stroke survivor was at the forefront of their minds there were some strategies which spouses/partners utilised to support their own health and well-being.  These were: creating time and space for themselves; talking with others; and comparing own lives against others who were seen to be worse or better off, in order to support their own emotional well-being. This study found that the participants struggled to prioritise and attend to their own health and well-being, as most of them was busy primarily attending to the stroke survivor&#8217;s needs.  Overall, results suggest that exploring what spouses/partners think and do within the relationship could be valuable for health practitioners.  Given that it is the intimate nature of being in a relationship that is the foundation for spouses/partners supporting the stroke survivor, it could also be important for services and health professionals to consider the well-being and needs of the couple, not just the stroke survivor.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Caring for sick</field><field name="subject">Informal caring</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Coping strategies</field><field name="subject">Support for caregivers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of CPAP tube reverse flow</field><field name="creator">Li, Chutu</field><field name="description">CPAP is the most common treatment for moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults. Despite its efficacy, patients&#8217; safety, comfort and compliance are issues to be considered and improved in CPAP design. The issues include condensation, carbon dioxide in inhaled air, humidity and temperature of inhaled air. When a CPAP user breaths deeply, there will be some air not fully expelled and may be driven back into the heated air delivery tube (HADT). An interest has existed in what impacts this so called reverse flow may bring about to the CPAP use. The main objectives of this research are to quantify the reverse flow and its influence on carbon dioxide re-breathing, delivered humidity to the patient and condensation in the HADT. Within this thesis, two computer models of the CPAP system have been constructed on Simulink&#8482; in the Matlab&#8482; environment. One is about the CPAP fluid dynamic performance and carbon dioxide re-breathing and the other is on thermodynamic performance. The models can predict the dynamic behaviour of the CPAP machine. They are able to mimic the breath induced airflow fluctuation, and flow direction changes over wide real working ranges of ambient conditions, settings and coefficients. These models can be used for future analysis, development, improvement and design of the machine. The fluid dynamic and thermodynamic models were experimentally validated and they have proved to be valuable tool in the work. The main conclusions drawn from this study are: &#8226;	Reverse flow increases when breaths load increases and pressure setting decreases. &#8226;	Reverse flow does not definitely add exhaled air to the next inhalation unless the reverse flow is relatively too much. &#8226;	Mask capacity does not influence the reverse flow. &#8226;	The exhaled air re-breathed is mainly due to that stays in the mask, therefore larger mask capacity increases the exhaled air re-breath and the percentage of exhaled air in next inhalation drops when the breath load increases. &#8226;	Deep breathing does not significantly change the total evaporation in chamber. &#8226;	When deep breathing induced reverse flow occurs, condensation occurs or worsens in the HADT near the mask. This happens only when the humidity of the airflow from the CPAP is much lower than that of the exhaled air and the tube wall temperature is low enough for condensation to occur. &#8226;	The deep breathing and reverse flow do not significantly influence the average inhaled air temperature. &#8226;	The overall specific humidity in inhaled air is lower under deep breathing. &#8226;	Mask capacity does not influence the thermal conditions in the HADT and the inhaled air specific humidity. Also the mask capacity does not significantly influences the inhaled air temperature.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep disorder</field><field name="subject">CPAP design</field><field name="subject">Breathing research</field><field name="subject">Lab experiments</field><field name="subject">Simulink modeling</field><field name="subject">Thermal dynamics</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perceptions and experiences of immigrant teachers with regard to the literacy requirements of the New Zealand secondary school curriculum</field><field name="creator">Crossan, Sue</field><field name="description">New Zealand relies on overseas teachers to fill approximately 30% of annual vacancies (Ministry of Education, 2006).  41% of these cohort were teaching in Auckland when this study was conducted (Ministry of Education, 2001, 2003). As only 7% were new to teaching, it is likely that they bring a wealth of teaching experience to New Zealand classrooms. In 2002 New Zealand introduced a new school-leaving qualification, the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), which includes a literacy strand in all subjects (Taylor, 2001). This thesis aims to investigate the needs, perceptions and insights of overseas teachers in Auckland regarding the literacy requirements of the New Zealand secondary curriculum. In this qualitative study, interviews were carried out with ten teachers who had been teaching in Auckland between one and six years and who had all previously taught overseas.  Interviews were also carried out with two literacy leaders as part of the research. Key challenges that emerged were the incorporation of the NCEA literacy requirements in discipline areas; catering for the needs of students who speak English as a second language; dealing with the challenges of teaching literacy across the curriculum and subject specific language; finding and developing relevant resources and sourcing professional development relating to literacy teaching. Findings revealed there were two categories of teachers &#8211; teachers who were very aware of the literacy needs of their students and those who were less aware. Teachers from England and South Africa were very aware of the varied literacy needs of New Zealand students and had received professional development in this area.  Other teachers seemed less aware of the literacy demands of their students, the curriculum or their own professional development needs. This study also reveals that recognition and provision for the professional needs of newly arrived teachers from overseas seems to vary. There is very little research on the experiences of immigrant teachers in New Zealand; this study helps to clarify the issues which these teachers face, particularly with regard to the dual challenges of teaching students with ESL and the expectations that all teachers will include literacy in their approach to teaching, which is part of the NCEA curriculum.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigrant teachers</field><field name="subject">Overseas teachers</field><field name="subject">Secondary teachers</field><field name="subject">High schools</field><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Qualitative interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of green shelled mussel mariculture on benthic communities in Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Wong, Clara</field><field name="description">Sea-bed benthic-invertebrate assemblages of species within and proximal to an existing mussel farm off Taniwhanui Point, eastern Waiheke Island, are reported. Substratum type, whether predominantly mud, gravels or an admixture of the two, mud/gravels, is shown to influence infaunal species assemblage composition; the bivalve Theora lubrica, ostracods, amphipods and polychaetes characterise muddy substrata; polychaetes, particularly spionids and syllids, ostracods, amphipods, bivalves and ophiuroids characterise mud/gravel substrata; and diverse assemblages of polychaetes, bivalves, pagurid crabs, gastropods, ostracods, ophiuroids and nemertean worms characterise gravel substrata. Significant differences in sea-bed assemblages are reported along one transect inside and outside the farm over the three seasons during which surveys were conducted, summer, autumn, winter of 2008. Along the northern side of the mussel farm those sediments beneath the farm are characterised by greater abundances of polychaetes and crustaceans (Malacostraca), whereas sediments outside the farm are characterised by greater abundances of bivalves and ostracods. Sediments both inside and outside the north-eastern border of the farm during summer are characterised by similar abundances of polychaetes, bivalves and ostracods. Similarly, those sediments within and outside the farm along its southern border during summer are characterised by abundances of polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans (Malacostraca) and gastropods. Measures of relative abundance, rarity and species richness are applied to sea-bed assemblages off eastern Waiheke Island to enable an appraisal of the spatial distribution of each within and outside the farm, and throughout the eastern Waiheke Island region. One of these measures, relative abundance, is then compared with other, albeit limited abundance data from previous soft-sediment surveys conducted throughout Hauraki Gulf. The most species rich and abundant sites off eastern Waiheke Island occur in gravelly substrata between Waiheke Island and Pakatoa Island, and between Rotoroa and Ponui Islands, in addition to beneath the southern portion of the existing mussel farm. Gravel-based substrata are recognised to be the most species rich and densely populated with invertebrates for this sediment type in Hauraki Gulf. Similarly, the muddy substrata off eastern Waiheke Island region appear to host more individuals and species than any other reported muddy substratum in Hauraki Gulf. The existing mussel farm is shown to significantly affect sea-bed communities, but in a manner that has not been previously reported in New Zealand. Species richness and abundance are greater beneath the farm, as are the proportions of very rare and uncommon taxa to more common and ubiquitous taxa. Sediments beneath the farm are not characterised by elevated abundances and richness of opportunistic species; and no obvious difference in sediment grain size is apparent along a transect extending from 20 m inside the farm to at least 110 m outside it. The biological footprint of the farm is limited, appearing to extend no further than 20 metres from the northern physical boundary of the farm; the gross sedimentary characteristics (grain size) do not differ significantly within and outside the farm. Within and immediately outside the farm species richness and abundance tend to increase during colder seasons; beneath the farm, species richness (d), abundance (N), Shannon index (H&#8217;) and Simpson index (1-&#955;&#8217;) were higher during May (autumn) and August (winter) than during February (summer); diversity values outside the farm were similar during summer and autumn, but species richness (d), evenness (J&#8217;), Shannon index (H&#8217;) and Simpson index (1-&#955;&#8217;) were all greater during winter. No opportunistic taxa are considered to be appropriate indicators of organically enriched environments, at least enrichment that can be intuitively linked to any direct effect of the existing mussel farm. One species, the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum, only rarely occurs inside the physical farm boundary, so its relative abundance renders it an appropriate indicator species of mussel-farm impacts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine aquaculture</field><field name="subject">Mussel farming</field><field name="subject">Seabed communities</field><field name="subject">Mariculture impact</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To touch or not to touch. Male primary school teachers' experiences of touch: a hermeneutic phenomenological study.</field><field name="creator">Power, Nicola</field><field name="description">This thesis offers an interpretation of how eight male primary school teachers experience touch between themselves and their pupils/students. Despite the positive benefits of touch and evidence suggesting that appropriate forms of touch should be encouraged, the many meanings, interpretations and reactions to touch potentially complicate the ways in which people react. The potential for touch to enhance human well-being is therefore often diminished. The taboo surrounding touch is particularly evident in the school environment where limited research has been undertaken. This study gives voice to male teachers as they share their experiences in an era when the risks associated with physical contact between teachers and pupils are increasing. Hermeneutic phenomenology was used to explore and gain deeper understanding of the meaning of touch in education through interpreting the day to day experiences of male primary school teachers in New Zealand. Narrative interviews were interpreted and described thematically. The themes: &#8216;being careful, cautious and visible&#8217;, &#8216;worrying about misinterpretation&#8217;, &#8216;feeling sad&#8217; and &#8216;battling with boundaries&#8217;, revealed a complex array of tensions that contributed to the findings. Male primary school teachers are constantly aware of the risk they take when interacting with students. They experience tensions and conflict when deciding where and how they will touch children and whether this will be misinterpreted by others. Consideration of the ways in which people respond to this complex and sensitive subject is necessary so that male teachers feel able to use positive and appropriate forms of touch without fear of suspicion and reprisal.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Men</field><field name="subject">Touching</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtual imaging system</field><field name="creator">Wang, Lulu</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this research project was to implement a combination of computer graphics and processing to generate displays that will aid in the visualization of the colour rendering properties of a range of light sources, including the new generation of high-output LEDs (light emitting diodes) that are becoming widely adopted in general lighting service. The CIE (International Commission on Illumination) has developed a colour appearance model CIECAM02 for use in colour imaging and colour management, and this model is utilized in this work.	This thesis describes the design and construction of a computer-based model that can be used as a research tool for the simulation and demonstration of the colour rendering properties of various artificial light sources. It is a comprehensive study of the colour models and measurement procedures currently in use in the lighting industry, as recommended by the CIE. This research project focused on the display of a set of surface colour patches as if they were illuminated by a specific light source, and the simultaneous display of two such sets to demonstrate the surface colour differences arising from the use of the two different light sources. A VIS (virtual imaging system) has been developed to display the colour properties of a series of test colour samples under different light sources. This thesis describes the computer models developed for the representation and display of surface colours in general, and colour rendering in particular. The designed system computes and displays the colour of each sample from a knowledge of the light-source spectrum and the spectral reflectance of each surface. It can simultaneously display the colours resulting from illumination by two different sources. In addition, the system computes the colour appearance differences for two sets of colours using the CIECAM02 colour appearance model. Subjective and objective tests were taken to validate the computed results. The VIS has been designed and implemented. It also has been tested by 21 observers and we believe that it will be a powerful research tool for the lighting industry, especially in relation to colour rendering.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LED</field><field name="subject">Computer modelling</field><field name="subject">Artificial lighting</field><field name="subject">Colour rendering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the use of mobile banking: the case of SMS-based mobile banking</field><field name="creator">Yu, Shi</field><field name="description">Mobile banking is an application of mobile computing which provides customers with the support needed to be able to bank anywhere, anytime using a mobile handheld device and a mobile service such as text messaging (SMS). Mobile banking removes space and time limitations from banking activities such as checking account balances, or transferring money from one account to another. In recent research and studies it was found that while mobile banking and more specifically SMS-based mobile banking applications have become popular in some countries and regions, they were still not widely used. This study identifies and investigates the factors which influence customers&#8217; decision to use a specific form of mobile banking, and specifically focuses on the evaluation of SMS-based mobile banking in the context of New Zealand. The research model includes the basic concepts of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), as well as some constructs derived through a focus group discussion. The model is tested to determine its predictive power with respect to individual&#8217;s behaviour when considering the use of SMS-based mobile banking. A survey questionnaire was developed and employed to collect data from 250 AUT university students in New Zealand. The results of the data analysis contributes to the body of knowledge in the area by demonstrating that context specific factors such as service quality and service awareness are  influencing user perceptions about the usefulness of SMS mobile banking which in turn affect intention to use and adoption. Secondly, the study demonstrates, on the example of SMS-based mobile banking, how a hybrid approach involving qualitative data collection and a subsequent quantitative survey can help investigate how user perceptions about usefulness and ease of use are formed. Although the study has its limitations, the implications of the results allow providing practical recommendations to the banking industry, and directions for further work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile banking</field><field name="subject">Survey</field><field name="subject">Focus group</field><field name="subject">Text messaging</field><field name="subject">SMS</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beach burial of cetaceans: implications for conservation, and public health and safety</field><field name="creator">Bui, Ann</field><field name="description">Every year hundreds of cetaceans strand on New Zealand beaches. Options for dealing with disposal of their carcasses are few, creating significant problems for the Department of Conservation (DOC). More often than not their carcasses are buried in beaches at or just above high water mark, near where the animals have stranded. The primary objective of this thesis is to determine the effects of cetacean burial on beach sediments, and evaluate potential health and safety risks associated with this practice. A secondary objective of this thesis is to appraise the appropriateness of one location DOC has repeatedly transported cetacean carcasses to and buried within beach sediments, Motutapu Island in Waitemata Harbour. The chemical effects of cetacean burial over a six-month period are reported for two sites at which animals were buried in 2008, Muriwai and Pakiri beaches; the biological effects of this burial are reported for one of these sites, Muriwai Beach, 12 months post burial. Intertidal faunal and floral inventories are provided for six sites around Motutapu Island, and these then compared and contrasted with inventories compiled from an additional 290 intertidal sites between Whangarei Heads and Tauranga Harbour, North Island East Coast, to appraise the relative uniqueness of intertidal species diversity around Motutapu Island. At both Muriwai and Pakiri beaches, nitrogen and phosphate concentrations in surface sands changed considerably following cetacean burial, although over six months the effect was localized and elevated concentrations of these two chemicals that could be attributed to a buried carcass did not extend more than 40 m from the site of whale burial. Deep-core profiles revealed nitrogen and phosphate concentrations at and in the immediate vicinity of cetacean burial approximately six months after burial to be markedly elevated to the level of the water table, but elevated concentrations attributable to the buried carcass were not observed greater than 25 m from the site of burial. Elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphates in beaches persist in surface sediments for at least six months post burial. Twelve months post cetacean burial no significant difference in species richness or abundance were apparent in intertidal communities extending along transects proximal to and some distance from the Muriwai Beach carcass; there is no evidence for any significant short-term (to 12 months) biological effects of cetacean burial in beaches. Of those shores on Motutapu Island accessible by earth-moving equipment and large vessels capable of dealing with and transporting large cetacean carcasses, Station Bay appeared to be the most appropriate site for whale burial. However its small size and relatively high biological value (fairly high species richness for comparable shores between Whangarei Heads and Tauranga) renders it an inappropriate long-term option for whale burial. Other shores on Motutapu Island host some of the highest species richness of all shores surveyed between Whangarei Heads and Tauranga Harbour, rendering them entirely inappropriate locations for burying cetaceans, over and above other variables that may influence disposal location identification (such as archaeological sites, dwellings and accessibility). Motutapu Island is not considered an appropriate location for cetacean burial within beaches. Alternative disposal strategies need to be explored for dealing with cetaceans that strand on Auckland east coast beaches. Although burial is the most convenient and most economical strategy to dispose of cetacean carcass, especially in mass stranding events or when cetaceans are of large size, and the biological effects of this practice are not considered significant (for the one whale that could be studied), persistent enrichment of beach sediments with organic matter could result in prolonged persistence of pathogens in beaches, causing unforeseen risks to human health and safety. Recommendations are made to minimize possible threats to public following burial of cetaceans in beaches, until the potential health risks of burial are more fully understood.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cetaceans</field><field name="subject">Conservation</field><field name="subject">Whales</field><field name="subject">Whale strandings</field><field name="subject">Chemical effects</field><field name="subject">Biological effects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of global intellectual property instruments into trade related intellectual property rights (TRIPS) and its ineffective enforcement in developing world: a case study</field><field name="creator">Nasir, Saeed</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to critically evaluate global intellectual property   instruments with detailed analysis of the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Aspects of Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) provisions in order to investigate the enforcement issues, confronted by the Developing Countries due to fragile legal infrastructure. These intellectual property laws are evolutionary and designed to protect and honour human intellectual creations since BC 400 which recognized them distinct from divine inspirations. Italian Renaissance witnessed the systematic recognition of human skill, craft, innovation and invention. Venetian Government institutionalized it by awarding patents and copyrights to skilled workers and publishers. Its primary purpose was to protect the trade and secondary was to foster intellectual creativity through reward and recognition. These rewards and recognitions, known as Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), developed with each new invention and creation. Industrial Revolution accelerated it and developed nations entered into international conventions to protect their nationals and their interests across the borders. In 1995, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) accommodated all the previous (IPRs) instruments and its enforcement linked with global trade. It was a dilemma for developing nations who were desirous to participate in global trading system for their economic development but could not administer (IPRs) regimes on their land due to fragile and static infrastructure. All assistance from developed countries during the transitional period could not address the problems due to alien prescriptions, applied to counter problems in the developed World. Developing Nations need innovative, flexible and indigenous approach to administer the TRIPS Agreement. A case study of Pakistan judicial environment to address the TRIPS enforcement issue has been conducted. The methodological approach of this thesis is the interpretive paradigm of the qualitative research tradition. This interpretive paradigm or framework is applied through the two methodologies of hermeneutics and case study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Legal hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">IP rights</field><field name="subject">Developing countries</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting youth for work in New Zealand: a case study of the Samoan experience</field><field name="creator">Tasi, Bruce Siumanaia</field><field name="description">Pasifika people are a youthful population group. It is important therefore that Pasifika youth have opportunities to live fulfilling and satisfying lives where they can achieve their dreams, support themselves and their families and make valuable contributions to their local communities, their country and global communities now and in the future. Government and local city councils have become more proactive in developing strategies that will assist young people to be part of an inclusive economy. One of the key areas identified, is the transitioning of low achieving and disengaged school leavers into further education, skills training or employment. Hence the government's and the councils' shared goals of implementing the Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs in 2007, which is to ensure that all youth between 15-19 years of age are in employment, education, training or other activities that lead to their long-term economic independence and wellbeing (Ministry of Youth Development, 2004). Transition courses provide bridging alternatives for youth transitioning from school to employment. They are designed to provide extra help for students who leave school with low or no qualifications. In some cases youth find themselves out of favour with mainstream education and have been forced to end secondary schooling prematurely. Transition learning gives youth a second chance at education by improving their employment marketability.  This research highlights the rich stories of Samoan male youths' transitional journeys. The study discusses the critical factors that have contributed either positively or negatively in their ability to transition successfully into the workplace. Eight Samoan male participants were involved in the study ranging from 18-21 years of age. This research topic has evolved from the researcher's involvement in working with South Auckland Pasifika youth for over four years. Some of these youth have been traumatised by their school experiences and have had to face some enormous barriers when transitioning from school into the work place or further tertiary education. After selecting the topic, research frameworks that would be most appropriate for the research were explored. The researcher shares similar cultural and personal experiences to the participants. The framework for the study is therefore aligned to the values of the researcher. Accordingly, the multi-case study approach has been adopted; as such an approach has the potential to reveal what participants feel is significant. The interpretive paradigm underpins this research. The technique for gathering data was through semiformal in-depth interviewing. During the interviews, the participants had the opportunity to discuss the effects that the transitional courses had on them as learners and as Samoan youth. This method of research is culturally appropriate, as it allowed the depth of voices of these young Samoan people to be heard. The themes that have emerged from the findings reflect the broad categories of literature and research findings in the field of transition. The findings also provide new and insightful information about transitional experiences of Pasifika male youth. The research findings from this study focus on key aspects of programme implementation including; the teacher/student relationship, mentoring, student resiliency and the role of the government in youth transition. The research also evaluates the extent to which the transition course curriculum content supports student knowledge and skills in their current work situation. All participants in the study were generally positive about the courses they attended. They discussed the positives in terms of good tutoring, high degree of team cohesion and relevant meaningful learning experiences. The participants cited the negatives as poor teaching, and the low level of some of the literacy and numeracy activities they were expected to complete. Overall they were far more positive about their transitional learning than they were with learning at secondary school. Most felt prepared for work. The study proposes further research in the area of youth transition. Findings from this study will be disseminated to the appropriate government policy makers, city councils, youth services and tertiary providers through presentations at youth development conferences.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative approach</field><field name="subject">Pasifika youth identity</field><field name="subject">Environmental influences to education</field><field name="subject">School to work transition</field><field name="subject">Cultural recognition</field><field name="subject">Tutoring and mentoring</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of inter-partner learning in an alliance between a national sporting organisation and a professional sport franchise</field><field name="creator">Cleary, Paul</field><field name="description">This research explores the determinants of inter-partner learning in alliances. The potential for organisations to learn from their alliance partner is well recognised in the literature. The Knowledge Based View of the Firm (KBV) posits that an organisation&#8217;s knowledge base, especially its tacit knowledge base, is a source of sustainable competitive advantage. Three key determinants of inter-partner learning are: intent to learn, transparency (i.e. willingness to share knowledge) and receptivity (i.e. capacity to learn). These three concepts are used to guide a single case study of an alliance between a National Sport Organisation (NSO) and a Professional Sport Franchise (PSF). Data was obtained through semi-structured interviews with key informants at both organisations. Each individual transcript was colour coded in relation to each of the four research questions. All relevant quotes were then copied into separate files for each organisation and categorised by research question. The results of the study suggest that 1) despite historical conflict, the relationship between alliance partners is becoming increasingly positive; 2) intent to learn was low in both organisations but higher in the NSO; 3) the NSO was more transparent than the PSF; and 4) receptivity was low for both organisations. Key conclusions of the research are that the NSO and PSF are failing to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by their relationship, but intent, transparency and receptivity remain useful concepts to explore inter-partner learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sport management</field><field name="subject">Alliances</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leaving the ship but staying on board: a multiple case study of the voluntary shift from leader to teacher within the same educational institution</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Ian Alexander</field><field name="description">The New Zealand education system has undergone some two decades of substantial reform. There can be little doubt that this has brought significant change to the nature of what is expected of people occupying positions of leadership in schools and educational institutions (Ball, 2007; Bottery, 2004; Codd, 2005). Against this contextual backdrop, and in the researcher&#8217;s experience as a teacher and former holder of a position of leadership, there is an observable phenomenon of educational leaders stepping aside from position and yet continuing to work as teachers within the same workplace. Despite claims of a leadership &#8216;crisis&#8217;, and international acknowledgement of concern over the retention of educational leaders (Brooking, 2007; Brundrett &amp; Rhodes, 2006; Fullan, 2005), the human experience of this phenomenon appears unrepresented in current research literature. The present study has sought to capture this experience through addressing the central research question &#8220;What is the lived experience of the voluntary relinquishing of the position of leader, yet choosing to remain within the same educational workplace?&#8221; In order to gather rich qualitative data, a descriptive multiple case study design was employed. In-depth unstructured interviews were carried out with eight educational leaders who had relinquished position within the contexts of New Zealand State Secondary Schools and Private Training Establishments, and chosen to continue working in these same contexts. The subsequent analysis drew on the tradition of hermeneutic interpretation (van Manen, 1990) to arrive at interpretations of the uniqueness of individual experiences, and offer understandings of the shared meanings of the experience in the form of essential themes. The key findings which emerged in this study were those of a sense of the &#8216;a-lone-ness&#8217; of leadership, the &#8216;ready-suddenness&#8217; of the decision to step aside, a seeking of &#8216;balance&#8217; in the relinquishing of position, a powerful sense of &#8216;re-turning&#8217; to the call of teaching, and varying degrees of &#8216;ease&#8217; and &#8216;dis-ease&#8217; in the experience of &#8216;letting go and holding on&#8217; following positional relinquishment. These findings serve to extend aspects of those of earlier leadership and role exit studies, and offer previously undocumented understandings. Thus, a major contribution of this study is in the bringing-to-voice of the stories of those who step aside from leadership position yet remain in the workplace, and in the opening of avenues for further research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational leadership</field><field name="subject">Lived experience</field><field name="subject">Role exit</field><field name="subject">Succession</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutic phenomenology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Method and implementation of multi-channel correlation in the hybrid CPU+FPGA system</field><field name="creator">Leonov, Maxim</field><field name="description">Modern high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) applications face constantly increasing performance requirements and are becoming increasingly challenging to develop and work with. In DSP paradigm, many researchers see potential in achieving algorithm speed-up by employing Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) &#8211; reconfigurable hardware with parallelism feature. However, developing applications for FPGAs incur particular challenges on the development flow. This work proposes a scalable hybrid DSP system for performing high-performance signal processing applications. The system employs hybrid CPU + FPGA architecture of commercially available, off-the-shelf (COTS) FPGAs and central processing units (CPU) of personal computers. In this work an example implementation of a multi-channel cross-correlator is investigated and delivered using a new development paradigm. The correlator is implemented on the XD1000 development system using a high-level FPGA programming tool &#8211; Impulse CoDeveloper. Analysis of DSP application development in a hybrid CPU+FPGA system employing the high-level programming tool Impulse C is presented. Potential of the selected tool to deliver algorithm speed-ups is investigated using reference multi-channel correlator software. Particular attention is devoted to input/output (I/O) implementation, which is considered one of the most challenging problems in FPGA design development. This work delivers an I/O framework based on PCI Express interface for the proposed high-performance scalable DSP system. Using Stratix II GX PCI Express Development Board from Altera Corporation, a scalable and flexible communication approach for the multi-channel correlator is delivered. This framework can be adapted to perform other high-performance streaming DSP applications. The outcomes of this work are a multi-channel correlator developed in a reconfigurable environment with new design methodology and I/O framework with software control application. The outcomes are used to demonstrate the potential of implementing DSP applications in hybrid CPU + FPGA architecture and to discuss existing challenges and suggest possible solutions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High performance reconfigurable computing</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">DSP</field><field name="subject">C to HDL</field><field name="subject">Correlation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Five hours with Raja: ethics and the documentary interview</field><field name="creator">McKessar, Anna Meredith</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of a young woman coming to terms with her grief.

This paper is a partnership between a practical documentary project and a more traditional written discussion. The documentary Five Hours with Raja is weighted at eighty per cent of the final thesis and the written exegesis makes up the remaining twenty per cent. Together these two elements investigate the developing relationship between Claudia &#8211; the documentary&#8217;s key protagonist, and the filmmaker, investigating how their relationship has affected the style, method, content and even the fundamental story line of a documentary. It also discusses the consequential ethical considerations and dilemmas behind creative and practical decisions, investigating ways that a filmmaker can draw the participant into the process to allow a greater degree of ownership, a stronger voice and a more immediate sense of intimacy with the final audience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Documentary</field><field name="subject">Interview</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Participant</field><field name="subject">Death</field><field name="subject">Baby loss</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Return to work and the New Zealand small business employer</field><field name="creator">Bloomfield, Christine</field><field name="description">The focus of this inquiry is &#8220;New Zealand small business employers&#8217; perspectives of the important factors in return-to-work (RTW) of an employee following a musculoskeletal injury or an illness&#8221;.  Whilst worldwide there is an increasing amount of attention focused on the RTW process in large organisations, there continues to be little understanding of this phenomenon in small businesses.  I chose to use a social constructivist theoretical framework drawing on grounded theory methodology to construct some understanding of the employers&#8217; perspectives of the RTW process.  Eight small business employers from Auckland and Christchurch participated in this research.  Data were gathered using semi-structured interviews.  Constant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling and thematic analysis were used to construct two themes from the data. The findings showed that small business employers prefer informal organisational approaches, rely on close working relationships with their staff, are generally wary of bureaucracy and often must run their businesses with limited staff and financial resources.  Having an employee off work for a prolonged period of time creates a sizable gap in the staff resources that keep the business running.  The employer has responsibility to fill this gap while maintaining a productive business.  In the absence of formal injury management practices an ad hoc approach was taken to the RTW process.  A number of the employers felt undervalued by key stakeholders, such as doctors, treatment providers, Accident Compensation Corporation and in some cases RTW co-ordinators.  Health and safety was a risk all employers appeared to take seriously whereas injury management information and support seemed less of a focus. This research suggests there may be little focus on injury management in small businesses by employers and, that employers perceive greater government emphasis on injury prevention.  The extent and associated costs of work disability in small businesses is as yet unknown, but it is likely to be significant.  How to support and encourage the uptake of injury management in small businesses in the long term warrants further investigation.  Understanding that employers may well lack injury management expertise, experience and resources requires stakeholders to make specific effort with the employer, at the workplace, to facilitate the RTW process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Return-to-work</field><field name="subject">New Zealand small businesses</field><field name="subject">Employers</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Injury management</field><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal injury</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategies older New Zealanders use to participate in day-to-day occupations</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Juanita</field><field name="description">This exploratory study investigated the strategies that eight older New Zealanders use to enable participation in day-to-day occupations that they need or want to do, in their homes and the community. The types of strategies older people use to overcome barriers to participation and manage limitations are not widely known or reported. Exploring strategies for participation employed by older people is important because the majority of older New Zealanders live in the community and their numbers are growing, and projected to reach 25% of the total population by the year 2051 (Ministry of Health, 2002). New Zealand&#8217;s Positive Ageing Strategy (Minister for Senior Citizens, 2001), advocates for a society where people can age positively, where they are highly valued and their participation encouraged. The literature relating to occupation, participation and health was explored, and provided some evidence that older people are developing strategies and, with some education, are able to manage their own health conditions. The assumption underpinning this study is that they are equally able to manage strategies for participation, particularly those devised by older people themselves. A qualitative descriptive methodology was used. The participants were selected following a presentation to a group of older adults and snowball recruitment. They were aged between 73 and 98 years old and were receiving assistance to live in community, which was taken to indicate they had experienced some limitation in, or barrier to their everyday activities, in response to which they might have discovered or developed coping strategies. Interviews were conducted in the participants&#8217; homes, and analysed using a general inductive approach. Four main categories emerged; strategies for keeping me safe, strategies for recruiting and accepting help, strategies for meeting biological needs, and strategies for conserving resources. Overarching themes of managing and getting on with it, sprinkled with a sense of humour by some participants was present in the attitudes of many participants. The study revealed that this group of older people can and do use strategies to enable occupation in their everyday lives, which differ from those recommended by occupational therapists and other health professionals. This finding suggests that health professionals, policy makers and educators have much to learn from older people. The provision of help to older adults should take into consideration the importance of social interactions, not just the physical needs. There is a need for transport to be more readily available and affordable for older people to attend occupations that meet social needs. Health professionals complement the strategies developed by older people, and finding ways to combine the strategies should be developed.  Listening to older adults&#8217; current ways of managing and working with them to develop alternate, yet acceptable methods will provide a challenge. Health professionals should take a greater role in advocating for the social and transport needs of older adults.  A self-management approach in education for older people, using peers and making use of existing education groups in the community and health system, is suggested. Education of those who engage with older people, such as carers, family, health professionals and community groups should include developing their skills in assisting older people to identify their strategies and developing strategies for the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Older adult</field><field name="subject">Strategies</field><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Occupation</field><field name="subject">Qualitative descriptive</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/684</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The Bobby Calf' - non linear and non classical narrative structures in the cinema of unease</field><field name="creator">Scrivin, Nicholas</field><field name="description">This document outlines the research, development and production of a creative work and accompanying exegesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Master of Communication Studies (MCS) programme.  It includes the first draft of a feature film screenplay and an exegesis that explores the research conducted, the theoretical context of the work, and analyses the screenwriting process undertaken. The Bobby Calf (2008) is the first draft of a feature film screenplay that uses a non-classical and non-linear narrative structure to tell the story of its main characters and advance the plot.    A psychological drama set in rural New Zealand, The Bobby Calf (2008) was originally inspired by the Janet Frame short story The Reservoir (1963), a story based on a group of youngsters who venture forth to discover the forbidden reservoir; a place their parents had forbid them from going.  Set in  the outskirts of a small farming settlement, the story is a dark and gothic depiction of rural life and the harshness of reality faced by those brought up in a lifestyle they did not choose.  The story focuses on the journey of ADAM (21); both as a young boy in 1988 (called JOHNNY) and as a young adult in 1997, and his mother CATH; a woman whose dreams and aspirations for her son and indeed her own life are slowly slipping away.   The story centres on Adam as he grows more uncomfortable with how his life has ended up, and his discovery that the life he has been destined to fulfil is not the one he has chosen.  Accompanying the screenplay is an exegesis that explores the research conducted previously on the history of non-classical/non-linear narrative structures and the rationale behind the success and limitations of this now-popular form of storytelling.  These types of narrative structures are not a new phenomenon, and as many authors have attested, the basis of this form of storytelling is rooted in the history of screenwriting and film making, and borrows many techniques from theatre and literature.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non linear</field><field name="subject">Narrative structure</field><field name="subject">Bobby calf</field><field name="subject">Story-telling</field><field name="subject">New Zealand rural life</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/688</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SKEIN: pick up styx</field><field name="creator">Turner, Raewyn Mary</field><field name="description">The work in progress, Pick Up Styx, investigates re-sensing and extra-sensing of the world.

The ability of learners to set their own &#8216;tasks&#8217; suggests that researchers need to investigate how individual students react to the tasks they have been asked to perform (Ellis, 2003).  To date, there have been very few systematic studies on learner and teacher perceptions in this particular field. Four studies conducted by Kumaravadivelu (1989, 1991), Slimani (1989, 1992), Block (1994, 1996), and Barkhuizhen (1998) have shed light on the learner and teacher perception of classroom events. This study has continued the investigation into how individual students react to the tasks they have been asked to perform. In particular, it has focussed on four potential mismatches between teacher intention and learners&#8217; interpretation of task, previously identified in a study by Kumaravadivelu (2003): instructional, pedagogic, procedural and strategic.  The study aimed to look at teacher and learners&#8217; perceptions and therefore a qualitative approach was used to gather information. The study was triangulated on two levels, using a variety of data (data triangulation) and different methods (questionnaires and interviews) to collect the data (methodological triangulation). Sixteen students studying for a Certificate in English at the School of Languages and Social Sciences at Auckland University of Technology were asked to perform a task and then complete a questionnaire which was designed to elicit information regarding the four potential mismatches, between teacher intention and learner interpretation, referred to above. Four pairs of students participated in each of the two tasks. Four students, one from each pair was then interviewed in order to elicit more in-depth information regarding the four mismatches referred to above. The teacher was also interviewed after the task had been completed. The student answers from the questionnaires were compared with the data gathered from the student and teacher interviews. The findings seem to show that two mismatches between teacher intention and learners&#8217; interpretation were evident, namely instructional and pedagogic. There was no clear evidence of a strategic or procedural mismatch. Despite the small sample size, the study seems to show that mismatches are identifiable. Given the importance of perceptual mismatches and the fact that they are part of the practice of everyday teaching, it is important that we try to identify as many mismatches as possible in future research. It is reasonable to assume that the narrower the gap between teacher intention and learner interpretation, the greater the chances of achieving learning and teaching objectives (Kumaravadivelu, 2003).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Potential mismatches</field><field name="subject">Learner interpretation</field><field name="subject">Teacher intention</field><field name="subject">Task</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physical demands of elite men&#8217;s field hockey and the effects of differing substitution methods on the physical and technical outputs of strikers during match play</field><field name="creator">Lythe, John</field><field name="description">Research has indicated that teams who cover greater distance during matches and complete more basic tasks such as passes, tackles and shots are more successful.  Identifying means of increasing these physical and technical outputs is therefore a significant opportunity for performance enhancement.  There has been limited research performed on hockey, especially at the elite level. An issue that is even more relevant given that in the past 15 years the sport has undergone some significant rule changes including the introduction of unlimited substitutions.  With sixteen players able to be used per match and eleven players on the field at any one time the coach can make substitutions as frequently as desired to try and maximise the overall performance of the team.  The objectives of this thesis were to use methods of performance analysis to measure the physical and technical outputs of players during elite hockey and to specifically measure the impact of differing substitution strategies on the physical and technical outputs of strikers during match play. Three striker conditions were assessed; three strikers with no substitutions, four strikers with a moderate amount of substitutions; and, five strikers with a large amount of substitutions.  Five matches between the New Zealand men&#8217;s hockey team and Tasmania state representative team were played over eight days.  Physical outputs of players were measured using portable GPS units and heart rate monitors and technical aspects of match play were measured using team performance statistics and a set of technical criteria which awarded points to strikers for each contribution they made to the game based upon a scale of effectiveness. Average total distance covered during 70 minutes by a position was 8160 &#177; 428m of which 479 &#177; 108m (6.1%) was performed at speeds greater than 19km.h-1.  Within this high intensity distance were 34 &#177; 12 sprints per player with an average duration of 3.3s.  Average match HR was 85.3 &#177; 2.9% HRmax and average peak HR was 96.3 &#177; 2.7% HRmax.  Distance covered decreased by 6.2% between the 1st and 2nd halves and there was a trend of decreasing distance in both halves when total distance was broken into five-minute time periods. When assessing the impact of substitutions on the performance of strikers it was found that there were no significant differences in physical outputs between conditions with total distance (S5 = 8414 &#177; 125m, S4 = 8422 + 34m; S3 = 8282m) and distance covered at speeds greater than 19km.h-1(S5 = 701 &#177; 46m, S4 = 685 &#177; 28m, S3 = 723m) being similar.  Substantial differences were found in technical outputs between the substitution conditions with more strikers and greater substitutions offering a better total output than less strikers and fewer substitutions (S5 = 241 &#177; 35, S4 = 207 &#177; 38, S3 = 173) but statistical significance between conditions was also not found. In conclusion, the results suggest that although substitutions are not a means to increase the physical work of strikers they do appear to be a way to enhance the contributions that strikers are making to the game.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hockey</field><field name="subject">GPS</field><field name="subject">Heart rate</field><field name="subject">Techincal outputs</field><field name="subject">Match analysis</field><field name="subject">Notational analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bluetooth information exchange network</field><field name="creator">Liu, Xiaoning</field><field name="description">Bluetooth is a low cost and low power wireless technology for connecting portable and / or fixed Bluetooth enabled devices to form short-range wireless ad hoc personal area networks (PANs). As the Bluetooth specification does not specify a protocol to form ad hoc Bluetooth networks, a method for forming an efficient Bluetooth network under a practical networking scenario is still an open research problem. This thesis introduces an approach to implement an indoor ad hoc Bluetooth wireless network, Bluetooth information exchange network (BIEN). This network formation is based on Bluetooth and Java technologies. A set of Bluetooth enabled devices configured with the BIEN software application are able to spontaneously establish a dynamic multi-hop wireless network using Bluetooth technology without the need of formal network infrastructure, centralized administration, fixed routers or access points. In this study, the performance evaluation focuses on the relation between network capacity and topology by testing end-to-end performance in terms of throughput and the latency of communication links with various parameters, including the hop number between nodes and the number of slaves in piconets. The evaluation results show that the throughput reduces with the increased length of a path, and with an increase in the number of slaves in a piconet in the network.  The latency also increases with path length, and with the number of slaves in a piconet in the different experimental BIENs, whether if there is traffic or not in the networks. Experimental results have further confirmed the necessity to minimize the number of bridge nodes in the Bluetooth networks due to their traffic bottleneck effect. This work is an attempt at implementation of a distributed multi-hop scatter net with an integrated routing protocol in the practical environments, while most of the literature focuses on covering the modelling of it. It intends to demonstrate how Bluetooth technology with Java technology can be used to design, develop and deploy ad hoc wireless networks with the commercial Bluetooth devices, and examine how well Bluetooth technology supports ad hoc multi-hop wireless network technology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Implementation</field><field name="subject">Ad Hoc</field><field name="subject">Bluetooth</field><field name="subject">Wireless</field><field name="subject">Network</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Becoming &#8211; Pakeha: questioning the use of native birds in representation as a means of exploring New Zealand post-settler identity in visual art</field><field name="creator">Wilkin-Slaney, Katherine</field><field name="description">The depiction of birds by artists such as Don Binney, Bill Hammond, Michael Parekowhai and Grant Whibley has served as metaphors in the conceptual systems of post-settler New Zealanders&#8217; expression of identity.

Is depicting native - rather than introduced birds, an incongruous and romantic settler iconography in identity, leading to a re-telling of our place in this land at the expense of not only the rightful indigenous place of Maori, but of our own cultural becoming? By exploring the painting of birds as metaphors of New Zealand post-settler identity, the project aimed to contribute to the complex issues surrounding the entwined and entangled post-settler relationships of both the past and present.

However, research highlights a concern among therapists who carry out vocational assessments that there is a lack of consistency with regard to quality and comprehensiveness using current methods of assessment.  One of the reasons for this is that there are no standardized measures of work-ability available that are designed to be used for the purpose of facilitating rehabilitation.  The Participation And Work-ability Support Scale (PAWSS) is a new measure, conceptualized and initially developed by Professors Lynne Turner-Stokes and Kathryn McPherson, that was designed to address this gap. Design and Methods: This research was designed to develop the PAWSS measure to the point where it had face validity, and was complete enough to be formally psychometrically tested.  The design of the research involved three parts.  Firstly, a comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken.  This was done to identify all the aspects of work functioning that are considered to contribute to work-ability, and then consider currently available work-ability measures in relation to their suitability for assessing vocational support needs.  Secondly, in phase one of the research, qualitative focus groups and interviews with stakeholders in the return-to-work process were undertaken.  The purpose of this phase was to check the content of the measure against stakeholder experiences, and determine the most appropriate administration context and procedures.  Interviews and focus groups were analysed using descriptive analysis, and findings were used to inform revisions to the measure.  Finally, phase two of the research involved pilot testing the measure.  This was carried out by contracting experienced occupational therapists to test the new measure with consenting workplace assessment clients.  Feedback from assessors and injured workers, assessor testing notes and scoring were analysed to examine feasibility and acceptability of the PAWSS, and revisions to the measure were made in accordance with findings.Results: The qualitative interviews and focus groups (phase one) provided feedback and comments that informed adaptations to the measure to bring it more in line with stakeholders&#8217; experiences of work-ability.  Furthermore, this phase provided information about the context in which the measure should be administered, and this was adopted for the pilot testing.  Pilot testing of the measure (phase two) showed that the measure was acceptable to both the assessors and the injured workers, and that it was feasible to administer as part of a workplace assessment.  Revisions to the measure and training procedures at this stage were primarily made to enhance clarity of item descriptions and scoring decisions. Conclusions and implications for practice: Findings from the research confirmed the need for a standardized measure of work-ability that can be used to plan vocational supports and interventions.  Furthermore, the PAWSS was shown to be feasible and acceptable as a comprehensive tool for assessment of the work-ability of injured workers.  Further research is needed to test the reliability and validity of the PAWSS before it can be used in practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vocational rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Measure development</field><field name="subject">Work injuries</field><field name="subject">Work disability</field><field name="subject">Work incapacity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a software procedure for Curved Layered Fused Deposition Modelling (CLFDM)</field><field name="creator">Huang, Bin</field><field name="description">Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is one of the most widely used Rapid Prototyping processes that uses the technique of depositing a semi-solid material in layers to build up a part and finds application in a variety of situations, be it making a mould for the rapid production of an industrial tool or the production of models for preoperative planning of complex cranial reconstructive surgery. When it comes to directly producing the end products, the process is still in its infancy, using inferior materials and flat layer deposition, bringing forth shortcomings such as poor surface quality, low strength for curved parts, and undesirably higher number of layers. Some of these shortcomings can be overcome if material deposition is modelled in curved layers as against the traditional flat-layer slicing and deposition. While the stair case effect can be significantly minimized, mechanical properties of the parts will also be enhanced due to continuity in fibres and the elimination of the inherent weakness between laminations. However, this being a fairly new idea, there are no existing facilities for practically implementing and experimentally testing this concept of Curved Layered Fused Deposition Modeling (CLFDM). The current research is to develop both hardware and software systems to build a working FDM system and implement CLFDM. The project involves the construction of an FDM system and then development of mathematical models for curved slicing. The numerical data generated from curved slicing algorithms is integrated with the hardware system for the practical implementation of CLFDM. Efficient curved slicing algorithms are developed and successfully used on the FDM system built for the practical implementation of CLFDM. Several case studies involving geometrical complications of increasing complexities have been successfully modelled and physically produced using CLFDM.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curved Layered Fused Deposition Modelling</field><field name="subject">CLFDM</field><field name="subject">Rapid prototyping</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working as a coordinator midwife in a tertiary hospital delivery suite: a phenomenological study</field><field name="creator">Fergusson, Lindsay</field><field name="description">This phenomenological study has been conducted to reveal midwives&#8217; experiences working as coordinator/charge midwives in tertiary hospital delivery suite settings.

While cold seep ecosystems have been studied in the last three decades worldwide, little is known about New Zealand&#8217;s cold seep habitats and associated fauna. A joint German-New Zealand cruise to the Hikurangi Margin in early 2007 enabled biological and sediment sampling to investigate the biological and sedimentological relationships and variability of seeps and their faunal diversity. Multi-disciplinary approaches were employed that included Xray radiography, stratigraphic descriptions, lebensspuren traces analysis, sediment grain size analysis, determination of total organic content, carbonate content and its stable isotopic composition, and analysis of benthic invertebrate assemblages of seep habitats. The results of this study revealed three distinctive habitats and associated fauna based on the sediment characteristics and faunal type. Habitat 1 includes all sites pertaining to Omakere Ridge, a seep-related habitat comprised of layers of very poorly sorted, sandy silt, shell hash and bands of methane-derived authigenic aragonitic carbonate nodules with low total organic content (TOC). Due to the characteristics of the sediments and death assemblages of molluscs, it is inferred that Habitat 1 methane seepage is actively diffusive, waning or dormant. Habitat 2 describes sites that are either non-seep or relic and applies to those at Bear&#8217;s Paw and Kaka. Habitat 2 constituted of shell hash overlain with very poorly sandy silt, and low carbonates content and low to medium TOC. Habitat 3 describes non-seep related habitats, and includes all sites of the Wairarapa region and one reference site from Kaka also falls into this category. Sediments for Habitat 3 constituted poorly sorted silt with high TOC and low carbonate content which can be explained by their close proximity to land and converging sea currents. The mineral components of the background siliciclastic sediments for all sites studied originated in the Tertiary mudstone of the East Coast Basin. The characteristics of seep habitats of the Hikurangi Margin were comparable to that of the Northern Hemisphere modern seep counterparts, although the abundance and distributions of seep fauna were low. Results from this research have enhanced our understanding on the spatial and variability of methane fluxes and their affects on the duration of cold seep ecosystems, especially for New Zealand. However, more such studies are essential to increase our understanding of seep sediments and explain disturbance-sediment-benthic invertebrate interactions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hikurangi Margin</field><field name="subject">Cold seeps</field><field name="subject">Burrow structures</field><field name="subject">X-radiographs</field><field name="subject">Benthic invertebrates</field><field name="subject">Sediment characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8216;Sandcastles&#8217; &amp; &#8216;The Postmodern Rules For Family Living&#8217;</field><field name="creator">Fee, Roderick Harold</field><field name="description">The exegesis accompanies a thesis, the latter being the portfolio of work consisting of two parts, each being a completed first draft of a novel written during the Masters of Creative Writing course: Part 1:  &#8216;Sandcastles&#8217; - a 'closed' text novel Part 2:  &#8216;The Postmodern Rules For Family Living&#8217; - an 'open' text novel These two works are separately bound with a thesis cover sheet and numbered.

STUDY DESIGN This experimental study used a within-subject design with experimental and control interventions. PARTICIPANTS Fifteen people with chronic stroke participated in the study.  INTERVENTION Participants performed a simple force tracking task with or without EMG-triggered neuromuscular electrical stimulation of the finger flexor muscles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cortical excitability was measured by single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Multi-digit grip control accuracy was measured during ramp and sine wave force tracking tasks. Maximal grip strength was measured before and after each intervention to monitor muscle fatigue. RESULTS No significant increases in cortico-motor excitability were found. Intracortical inhibition significantly increased following the EMG-triggered neuromuscular electrical stimulation intervention immediately post-intervention (t = 2.466, p = .036), and at 10 minutes post-intervention (t = 2.45, p = .04). Accuracy during one component of the force tracking tasks significantly improved (F(1, 14) = 4.701, p = .048), following both EMG-triggered neuromuscular electrical stimulation and voluntary activation interventions. Maximal grip strength reduced significantly following both interventions, after the assessment of cortical excitability (F(1, 8) = 9.197, p = .16), and grip control (F(1, 14) = 9.026, p = .009). CONCLUSIONS EMG-triggered neuromuscular electrical stimulation during short duration force tracking training does not increase cortical excitability in participants with chronic stroke. Short duration force tracking training both with and without EMG-triggered neuromuscular electrical stimulation leads to improvements in training-specific aspects of grip control in people with chronic stroke.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Grip control</field><field name="subject">Cortical excitability</field><field name="subject">Electrical stimulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can a cross training program improve rugby skills in adolescent male rugby players?</field><field name="creator">Marnewick, Michel</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to find whether cross training could improve male adolescent rugby skills.

Currently this is done using a combination of passive security cameras and security officers actively patrolling the premises. However, security officers, being human, are subject to a number of limitations both physical and mental. A security robot would not suffer from these limitations, however currently there are a number of challenges to implementing such a robot. These challenges include navigation in a complex real-world environment, fast and accurate threat detection and threat tracking. Overcoming these challenges is the focus of my research.  To that end a small security robot, the CuWITH or Curious WITH,has been developed and is presented in this thesis. The CuWITH utilises a programmable navigation system, curiosity-based threat detection and curiosity-driven threat tracking curiosity to protect a real office environment. In this thesis we will first discuss the CuWITH's system design in detail, with a particular focus on the components and the architectural strategies employed. We then move to a more detailed examination of the mathematical underpinnings of the CuWITHs curiosity based threat detection and curiosity driven threat tracking. The details of the CuWITH's navigation will also be explained.  We will then present a number of experiments which demonstrate the effectiveness of the CuWITH. We show that the programmable navigation of the CuWITH, although simple, allows for easy modification of the patrol path without risk to the stability of the system. We will then present the results of both offline and online testing of the CuWITH's curiosity based threat detection. The reaction time and accuracy of the CuWITHs curiosity driven threat tracking will also be illustrated. As a final test the CuWITH is instructed to execute a patrol in a real office environment, with threatening and non-threatening persons present. The results of this test demonstrate all major systems of the CuWITH working together very well and successfully executing the patrol even when moved to a different environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robot</field><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="subject">PCA</field><field name="subject">Curiosity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8220;It&#8217;s my think&#8221;: exploring critical literacy with low level EAL students</field><field name="creator">Harison, Rosemary</field><field name="description">This study explores the use of a critical literacy approach in a class of language learners who had low levels of literacy. The particular focus was on the teacher&#8223;s role in the process and how she could implement this approach in such a way that the students would benefit. The study records the exploration of the relevant literature, the planning and implementation of the lesson, and her reflection on the process. The students had all arrived in New Zealand as refugees. They had limited English proficiency and were enrolled on a Training Programme at the Auckland University of Technology. The aim of this programme is to help students enter gainful employment or continue with their studies. To this end great emphasis is placed on students improving their English proficiency and entering the workforce or engaging in further study. Many of the texts employed in the classroom context underline the desirability and praiseworthiness of these goals. In this study 15 students drawn from a variety of sociocultural backgrounds were asked to deconstruct a text of a type often employed in the classroom and explore their reaction to it. Two experienced observers provided feedback on the lesson and the way in which it was implemented. The students worked in groups, where possible in their first language, and answered a series of questions on the text. They were also asked to write individual texts in response to the teaching text. The researcher then conducted interviews with the students which afforded them the opportunity to expand on and clarify these responses. The study concludes that classroom exercises such as these can be meaningful and empowering particularly when students assume the roles of narrators and advisors. However such lessons need to be carefully designed and structured if students are to gain real benefit from such as approach.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical literacy</field><field name="subject">ESL</field><field name="subject">EAL</field><field name="subject">Languages</field><field name="subject">Refugees</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping the aliran of the academic discipline of entrepreneurship: a discursive representation</field><field name="creator">Lock, Rob</field><field name="description">In this study, I consider the status of the academic discipline of entrepreneurship as represented in refereed journal articles and citations in the Web of Science database within a broad philosophical framework, developed for this investigative purpose.  This dissertation firstly explores an understanding of knowledge as offered by French social theorist, Michael Foucault, identifying two forms of knowledge. Using Foucault&#8217;s distinctions, I develop models that position savoir and connaissance knowledge, which I define as practical applications of understanding and academic orientations of explaining, in relation to disciplines and discourses. The strategic apparatus of the episteme is included in my models as a discipline-based method of determining the acceptability of knowledge into the discipline, incorporating the varied roles of gate-keepers, intellectuals and other participants into the models. The roles of epistemology and ontology are discussed and included in the models.  Further, drawing on the works of German philosopher, Martin Heidegger, I introduce the concept of an ontological test as a possible means to consider whether an academic discipline clearly understands its &#8216;meaning of being&#8217; or, alternatively, could be considered to have passed Foucault&#8217;s point of epistemologization and be termed a &#8216;dubious discipline&#8217;. Academic thinking on entrepreneurship has come under an array of criticism from within the discipline, including criticism as to a perceived lack of objectivity. The models developed in this dissertation are applied to the discipline of entrepreneurship in order to better understand the development of the discipline of entrepreneurship and the reasons for this criticism. Using the episteme of the Web of Science database, I apply citation analysis to identify those articles and texts which are considered within the entrepreneurship discipline to have the highest gravitas. These high gravitas articles are used to create an archaeological representation or aliran that illustrates the development of the discipline over time and the ontological development of sub-aliran.  This aliran is a phenomenological representation of the discipline based upon the episteme to depict the episteme &#8216;as it is&#8217;. This representation is hermeneutically interpreted to discern the development of various sub-aliran, and identify the possible influence of gate keepers with high gravitas in such development.  Based upon my survey of high gravitas articles from the aliran, I found there was a general exclusion of practitioner both as an audience for and as a source of savoir knowledge. Admittedly this finding could well be attributed to the nature of the episteme selected for the research. The exception to this general finding was in the Venture Capital sub-aliran.  Further findings indicated an apparent feature of the aliran was a higher than expected level of demarcation between the organization and the firm. This demarcation had several features including an increasing trend towards learning by the organization as applied to entrepreneurship. Firms were not perceived to engage in learning but did engage in new ventures and undertook innovation. These functions were not indicated within the aliran to be part of the functions of the organization. Innovation was also not shown to be an activity conducted by individuals but was a preserve of the firm. These findings are consistent with the political structure of the Academy of Management&#8217;s Entrepreneurship Division and indicate the influence this body likely has on the discipline.  In some instances, as might be expected, there was an overt level of construction of some sub-aliran by those with high gravitas in the discipline. This was most apparent in endeavours to add &#8216;corporate&#8217; nominations to entrepreneurship, innovation and venturing.  In the case of corporate entrepreneurship, such overt construction was perceived to be less than successful. However, the changing orientation offered by such construction is seen to offer a new direction to entrepreneurship which may be realized in the fledgling Strategic Entrepreneurship sub-aliran. Some sub-aliran observed was considered to be more introverted due to restraints imposed by the political structuring of the discipline.  While the discipline of entrepreneurship may not to be able to pass Heidegger&#8217;s ontological test and could be considered a dubious discipline (doubtless like so many others), this finding should not be deemed to be unduly negative. As with Gadamer&#8217;s rehabilitation of prejudice, the term dubious could be rehabilitated to be positive and encourage moves towards greater objectivity, or at least greater rigour, within the discipline of entrepreneurship.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Episteme</field><field name="subject">Aliran</field><field name="subject">Practitioner</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">History of knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Storytelling: circles and straight lines</field><field name="creator">Bronkhorst, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Storytelling: circles and straight lines is a qualitative, retrospective analysis of my thesis (a collection of iconoclastic New Zealand short stories, entitled In Transit), in which I define the scope of my creative work by: positioning my approach within the wider contemporary and literary contexts; explaining its conceptual framework; and describing my intention and process.

In the preparation of a range of products at Hubbard Foods, technical staff has become aware of a bitterness problem that sporadically appears in toasted oats. Toasting involves dry heating to about 150&#176;C resulting in the golden colour and flavour development necessary for range of products. Bitterness development has been described in the literature, but Hubbard staff is necessarily focussed on production issues, rather than on a sporadic problem seemingly outside the scope of production variables. The author of this thesis set out to identify the cause and suggest a remedy. Prior research with oats has shown that bitterness and associated off-flavours are linked to the accumulation of free fatty acids, their volatile oxidation products, and possibly amino acids and certain phenols. Oats are distinguished from related grains by their high relative fat content, about seven percent, and an associated very active lipase. The free fatty acids stem from the lipase activity that should be, but may not be, inactivated at source in Australia. This is achieved in the milling process by physical disruption and moist heating to a temperature at which the enzyme is denatured. However, residual lipase activity may adversely affect oats quality during time in storage and transit. A number of analytical methods for cereals were adapted to match the constraints of time and resources. These methods were for colour, moisture, peroxidase activity, p-anisidine, and fat and free fatty acids content, composition of fatty acids, total phenols, volatiles, and bitterness as perceived by an analytical sensory panel of four people. Determination of lipase activity is very expensive, so peroxidase activity is commercially used as an indicator. If the latter is inactive, the former will necessarily be also inactive. The designed methods were first applied to 17 oats lots passing through the Hubbard environment, where 14 were paired raw and toasted. The values of moisture, fat content, free fatty acids content and total phenols were within the normal limits expected for commercial lots of oats compared with the previous studies. Not much variation was observed among the 17 oats lots, with the exception of lot DWHE25. Lot DWHE25 was a faulty product, which had high moisture content, high free fatty acids content, and tasted very bitter. The results suggested that moisture content, free fatty acids and bitterness were usually correlated. In spite of the differences encountered and the clues provided by extremes, the data generated from Hubbard oats lots did not provide enough variation in quality to lead to a definitive chemical model of bitter flavour development. But perhaps crucially, it was found that most samples as received from Hubbard Foods were peroxidase-active which conflicted with the results reported on specification sheets prepared by the oats supplier. These specifications accompanied each lot delivered to Hubbard Foods. Therefore, the supplier&#8217;s method was examined and was found to be deficient in one critically important respect. Their method omitted the key reactant hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, it is possible that the lipase was active in many of the samples. Therefore, some experiments were conducted where raw oats, from Hubbard Foods and a supermarket, were treated with water additions and stored for a period to examine the effect of moisture content on the quality and flavour deterioration on subsequent storage. Water-treated oats were toasted to simulate a typical Hubbard process, yielding a total of 58 samples with carrying moisture contents. The data set was statistically analysed to identify the cause of bitterness and the means of its control. The free fatty acids content, volatile compounds particularly hexanal, and total phenols increased with moisture content and storage time. The correlations between chemical analysis and sensory test indicated that free fatty acids positively correlated with bitterness (r = 0.71), and hexanal was also positively correlated. Total phenols did not appear to correlate with bitterness. Oats lots with high peroxidase activity tended to have the poorest quality, strongly implicating residual lipase activity as the critical factor. There were no important interactions between water addition and toasting for most of the experiments. Therefore, it seems likely that the toasting procedures at Hubbard Foods are not responsible for bitterness formation. The cause(s) of bitterness is certainly at source, with a faulty peroxidase test strongly implicated.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food processing</field><field name="subject">Bitter flavor</field><field name="subject">Cereal</field><field name="subject">Lipase activity</field><field name="subject">Toasting</field><field name="subject">Analytical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a cheap and rapid method to determine calcium in milk fractions in an industrial environment</field><field name="creator">Kaur, Daljit</field><field name="description">Milk contains high concentrations of calcium. It occurs in two forms, a free ionic form, and calcium associated with milk proteins (caseins). The latter association is called colloidal calcium phosphate. New Zealand Dairy Foods of Takanini is marketing a range of commercial milks in supermarkets. The company uses ultra filtration to concentrate milk proteins and calcium in different milk products. During ultra filtration, the fraction that is retained by the membrane is rich in calcium bound to proteins and the portion that passes through the membrane is richer in the free ionic form. The company wanted to develop a quick and an economical method that can be applied in industrial settings to determine calcium in both these fractions and in other milk products. This research aimed to develop a quick, wet chemistry method to measure calcium in milk fractions and to trial it in an industrial environment. Two methods, the so-called EDTA method and the atomic absorption spectrophotometric method (AA) were trialled as potential reference methods against which to compare results obtained by the method to be developed. The AA method was chosen due to its ease, accuracy and precision. (This could not be selected as the industrial method for a number of reasons.) A colorimetric method was favoured over other contenders. Two colorimetric dyes, Arsenazo I and o-cresolphthalein-complexone (CPC) were chosen to work with. Arsenazo I forms a purple complex with calcium in a suitable buffer at a range of pHs. o-Cresolphthalein-complexone also forms purple-coloured complexes at alkaline pHs. During method development with Arsenazo I, different buffers were trialled and a NaOH/ KCl buffer was selected for further development at pH 12. The method worked well during the development phase but with some inconsistent results at times. o-Cresolphthalein-complexone formed clear purple complexes with Clark and Lubs and 2-amino-2-methylpropanol (AMP) buffers. The key advantage of the CPC dye with AMP buffer was that when 8-hydroxyquinoline was included in the reaction mixture, it successfully masked coloured complex formation due to CPC with magnesium, which is present in milk at about 1/3 the calcium concentration. This effect did not work with Arsenazo I. However, the results obtained with the CPC method were lower than claimed values of most milks trialled during development. Both methods were compared for their precision and it was found that CPC method has better precision and was chosen for further development. To improve the accuracy and precision, various denaturing reagents were used to (hypothetically) release calcium from the caseins. Trichloroacetic acid at 25 % was more effective than the several other denaturing treatments tested. The finalised CPC method, using trichloroacetic acid, AMP and 8-hydroxyquinoline, was then used to monitor calcium concentration over four months in three milk products, skim, Xtra (retentate) and permeate. For all milks, the CPC values were lower than the AA reference values, and the values reported by a commercial analytical laboratory. The reasons for this are discussed, as are other changes in calcium concentration in the three milks throughout the trial. The correlation between the CPC and AA values was poor for Xtra, better for skim, and best for permeate. A chemical model to explain this is discussed. The method developed is cheap and quick, and sample and reagent preparation is simple. The method could be applied in an industrial environment, but a proportionality factor would have to be applied to account for the difference in mean values between the CPC and AA methods.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk composition</field><field name="subject">Calcium concentration</field><field name="subject">Quantitative analysis</field><field name="subject">Analytical chemistry</field><field name="subject">Spectrophotometry</field><field name="subject">Colorimetric dye</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of cleaning procedures for allergen control in a food industry environment</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xin (Annie)</field><field name="description">Tegel Foods Limited produces an extensive range of poultry products which may contain various potential allergens. These include wheat, soy, milk, and egg, sometimes in combination. This research has two purposes. One was to examine three cleaning stages of processing equipments &#8211; Rinse only, Foam and rinse and Sanitise and rinse to validate the efficacy of cleaning required between production runs where the first but not the second product contains the allergen. The allergen chosen to model the cleaning efficacy was gliadin, a protein in wheat. The second aim was to quantify allergenic risk to consumers from inadequately cleaned conveyer surfaces. The commercial motives driving this research were as follows. Cleaning represents a loss in productivity and an increase in consumables costs, and if it can be minimised, this would be advantageous. The requirement to declare the possibility of cross-contamination on retail packaging can potentially adversely affect consumer response, and if these declarations can be avoided then this too would be a commercial advantage. Three approaches were adopted or developed, an ATP bioluminescence test, an ELISA test kit for gliadin, and a Coomassie Blue test to quantify protein given that most allergens are proteins. Fifteen trials were done in the High Care Zone and the Old Further Processing line of the Tegel Henderson Plant production area over a period of nine months. In a typical trial, gliadin values normalised to Uncleaned values fell from 1000 (Uncleaned) arbitrary units, to 60 (Rinse only), to 0.3 (Foam and rinse), to zero (Sanitise and rinse). Parallel ATP tests similarly showed a progressive decrease in values. Compared with Uncleaned, the relative gliadin value was less than the relative ATP value after Foam and rinse in 14 of 14 trials. After Sanitise and rinse the same result was obtained. In the equivalent trials with ATP and Coomassie Blue, after cleaning of Foam and rinse and Sanitise and rinse, the relative ATP values exceeded the relative Coomassie Blue values in four of the five trials. Therefore the considerably cheaper and simpler ATP test is not only an indicator of hygiene but also a good guide to gliadin concentration (gliadin test), and to allergen contamination in general on the basis that allergens are mostly proteins (Coomassie Blue). Modelling of second-product contamination has been done, and was based on knowledge of the absolute gliadin concentration on a typical Uncleaned conveyer surface, as established in the first part of this project. The concept of the worst-case scenario examined the highest possible risk that a sensitive consumer would be exposed to an allergenic dose of gliadin. A pickup efficiency fraction of 0.3 was assumed as an upper limit of contamination from conveyer to the surface of a previously uncontaminated chicken piece. The model showed that the highest concentration of gliadin on the second product would be 6.3 ppm which is below the legislated limit of low-gluten. Information of direct commercial interest to Tegel has been extracted from all these results, and suggestions for future research have been made.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poultry processing</field><field name="subject">Factory sanitation</field><field name="subject">Allergens</field><field name="subject">Analytical chemistry</field><field name="subject">Contaminants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The imagined life of an Otaku collector, or to be a Cosplay star</field><field name="creator">Watts, Mark Leonard</field><field name="description">This project explores my relationship with elements of Japanese culture.

It also evaluates whether attitudinal changes are enduring and therefore continue to influence students&#8217; responses to the disabled after a period of time has elapsed. Respondents were students on the Diploma of Hospitality Management at Auckland University of Technology (AUT), enrolled on an Accommodation Operations paper. A compulsory assessment for this paper was a group assignment that considered facilities offered by accommodation providers for guests with disabilities. Respondents were surveyed before (n = 54) and after (n = 24) the assignment to determine any attitude and knowledge changes. Both surveys were undertaken at the end of lectures. The surveys were distributed in class, so the number of respondents relates to the number of students in class during the particular lecture selected for survey distribution. Respondents were then invited to join a focus group to explore their feelings and opinions about disabled people. Another focus group was undertaken with students who had completed the disability assignment the previous year. The focus group was to assess whether or not the awareness of disability issues was still apparent after a period of time had elapsed. These findings would then prove whether or not exposure to such issues still influenced respondents&#8217; attitudes. The second survey responses and comments made during the subsequent focus groups conclude that awareness of disability issues may be heightened with exposure to barriers, both physical and attitudinal, that are experienced by people with impairments. Understanding of disability issues is the first step in the removal of barriers and will help lead to the creation of a more inclusive environment for staff and guests in the hospitality industry. An inclusive environment is particularly desirable as more hotels are required in response to increases in tourist numbers. With increased visitors&#8217; arrivals, it is reasonable to expect that tourists will have varying abilities, and therefore, modification of facilities to suit their needs will benefit a large number of people. The research also concludes that the knowledge gained in the assignment was still influential after the conclusion of the assignment. Students who have studied issues for people with impairments, as future managers, will have the knowledge and understanding to provide a more inclusive environment for guests that meets both social and legal obligations. Such an environment will be beneficial to both guests and potential employees with physical disabilities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disabilities</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Attitudinal barriers</field><field name="subject">Disability awareness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of local food in Maldives tourism: a focus on promotion and economic development</field><field name="creator">Amira, Fathimath</field><field name="description">In the fiercely competitive globalized tourism industry, where there is growing concern for the development of sustainable tourism, tourism stakeholders are confronted with the challenge of creating innovative product differentiation and effective marketing that will increase yield and promote sustainable tourism development. Food is a fundamental part of the tourist experience. Increasingly, local food is used in tourism as an integral part of the visitor attraction to enrich tourist experiences. Local food acts as a differentiating feature for destinations and can play an important role in increasing visitor yield, stimulating growth in other economic sectors and promoting sustainable occupations. The close relationship between local food and culture enables the promotion of cultural heritage by promoting local food. Thus, linking local food and tourism has the potential to create more sustainable tourism practices and outcomes. This study evaluates the role of local food in tourism promotion. It also focuses on economic development, exploring the potential for creating linkages between local food and tourism in the context of sustainable tourism practices. The research is based on a case study of the Republic of Maldives, a country which has gained success in the international tourism market by promoting the natural beauty of its tropical islands. Like many Small Island Developing States (SIDS), tourism is the key to the Maldives&#8217; economic development. But a heavy reliance on imports and a large expatriate labour force cause a significant leakage of tourism revenue. Tourism has been developed under a one-island-one-resort concept. This has created tourist enclaves that limit distribution of tourism benefits among local communities. Hence, Maldives&#8217; tourism needs ways to broaden economic linkages and increase tourism yield. Broader visitor experiences that enhance product attractiveness in ways that still conserve and protect the fragile ecosystem are also required. This research utilized content and discourse analyses and surveys in a mixed-methods approach. Content analysis of printed and web-based tourism marketing materials reveals that food is not featured prominently as a tourist attraction in the Maldives. Surveys conducted among operators and experts indicate considerable support for and the potential benefits of, linking food to tourism; these stakeholders also state that they believe there is a strong desire on the part of tourists to experience local food. A range of issues and constraints that work against linking local food and tourism are revealed; these include under-developed transportation and logistics, shortages of skilled staff, and a lack of communication between producers and tourism operators. A variety of suggestions on linking local food to tourism are presented with recommendations of potential local foods and food-related events that could be successfully integrated into the tourist experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maldives</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Food</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Sustainable</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated feature, neighbourhood, and model optimization for personalised modelling and knowledge discovery</field><field name="creator">Liang, Wen</field><field name="description">&#8220;Machine learning is the process of discovering and interpreting meaningful information, such as new correlations, patterns and trends by sifting through large amounts of data stored in repositories, using pattern recognition technologies as well as statistical and mathematical techniques&#8221;  (Larose, 2005).  From my understanding, machine learning is a process of using different analysis techniques to observe previously unknown, potentially meaningful information, and discover strong patterns and relationships from a large dataset.  Professor Kasabov (2007b) classified computational models into three categories (e.g. global, local, and personalised) which have been widespread and used in the areas of data analysis and decision support in general, and in the areas of medicine and bioinformatics in particular.  Most recently, the concept of personalised modelling has been widely applied to various disciplines such as personalised medicine, personalised drug design for known diseases (e.g. cancer, diabetes, brain disease, etc.) as well as for other modelling problems in ecology, business, finance, crime prevention, and so on.  The philosophy behind the personalised modelling approach is that every person is different from others, thus he/she will benefit from having a personalised model and treatment.  However, personalised modelling is not without issues, such as defining the correct number of neighbours or defining an appropriate number of features.  As a result, the principal goal of this research is to study and address these issues and to create a novel framework and system for personalised modelling.  The framework would allow users to select and optimise the most important features and nearest neighbours for a new input sample in relation to a certain problem based on a weighted variable distance measure in order to obtain more precise prognostic accuracy and personalised knowledge, when compared with global modelling and local modelling approaches.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personalised modelling</field><field name="subject">Feature selection</field><field name="subject">Nearest neighbour</field><field name="subject">Model optimization</field><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Board Member development: Board Member learning and attributes of experienced Board Members</field><field name="creator">Deacon, Nicola</field><field name="description">This research uses a grounded theory approach to explore the term &#8216;experienced Board Member&#8217; with research into the learning experiences which bridge the gap between an inexperienced Board Member and an experienced Board Member. The purpose of this research is to identify repeatable/reportable patterns which could be utilised and developed to improve Board Member learning. Data is derived from interviews with nine (current and past) New Zealand Board Members. A common set of attributes of an experienced Board Member emerged from the study.  The linking theme of the attributes is that they support the process of reaching a quality agreement or decision. The results of this study suggest that an experienced Board Member is perceived to be a Board Member who contributes to achieving a quality agreement and decision, using attributes associated with: &#8226;	Contribution to Board processes &#8226;	Understanding and Knowledge (governance and business acumen) &#8226;	Internal Drivers &#8226;	Making Hard Decisions.  Formative Board Member learning is associated with developing self confidence, understanding what content is perceived to be (or not to be) relevant, understanding the Boardroom protocols and processes, and understanding the responsibility of the role. The primary mechanism in Board Member learning is observation. Board Member learning was most often the development of tacit understanding through observing events internal to the Board. Learning events for Board Members are likely to arise as part of the dismissal/departure of the CEO or from internal Board dissension. The results also indicate that current NZ Board Members are unlikely to have had any formal preparation for the Board Member role, and learning for the role is likely to be ad-hoc and vicarious. This research suggests that the successful development of experienced Board Members will require a fundamental change in the perception and practice of Board Member development within organisations and at Board level. A Capability and Maturity Model is presented as a framework for assessing an organisation&#8217;s capability and maturity in terms of the development of its Board Members. This study builds on corporate governance theory by identifying attributes considered indicative of an experienced Board Member. This study adds to Learning Organisation and Knowledge theories by providing examples and comment on the place of Communities of Practice, and knowledge development within the development of Board Member experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Director</field><field name="subject">Board</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holey umbrella</field><field name="creator">Hall, Grant</field><field name="description">The creative outcome of my Masters Degree is an extract of my manuscript for a novel.

Strategies used by good language learners have been revealed, strategies used by successful and less successful language learners have been compared, and factors influencing the use of learning strategies have also been investigated. As an attempt to contribute to gaining more insights into language learning strategy, this research aims to investigate the writing strategies used by successful and less successful English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) learners and the relationship between strategy use and the learners&#8217; success. A multi-method approach combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches was used to answer the research questions. This approach was achieved by means of method triangulation which consisted of structured questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and learning diaries. Nine female adult native Vietnamese students, who were in their second year of a four-year Bachelor program at Hanoi University in Vietnam, participated in the study. Questionnaires were administered at the beginning of the data collection phase. Guidelines for diary writing were then provided to the participants. Semi-structured interviews which served as the primary method of data collection were finally conducted with each of the participants. Findings from the study showed that the successful writers not only used strategies more frequently but also used more metacognitive, memory, compensation, and cognitive strategies than the less successful writers. The study also found some strategies which were most and least frequently used by both the successful and less successful writers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning strategies</field><field name="subject">Writing strategies</field><field name="subject">EFL context</field><field name="subject">SLA</field><field name="subject">Small scale study</field><field name="subject">Mixed method</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the literacy and numeracy requirements and demands of entry-level supermarket work</field><field name="creator">Hastwell, Kim</field><field name="description">The nature and role of workplace literacy and numeracy are the subject of considerable debate (Baker, 1998; Castleton, 2002; Gee &amp; Lankshear, 1997; Hull, 1997; Jackson, 2000; Marr &amp; Hagston, 2007). The debate in New Zealand, (as in many other countries), is taking place amid concerns about the adequacy of the skills of its workforce and the latter&#8217;s ability to meet future demands of everyday work and life (Tertiary Education Commission, 2008). These concerns have resulted in major investment at a national level in a Skills Strategy (New Zealand Government, 2008) with particular emphasis on improving adult literacy and numeracy levels. However, Castleton (2002) suggests that conceptualising literacy as a skill ignores the reality of workplaces which, she suggests, consist of communities of workers who engage in purposeful communication and who possess and use different skills and knowledge in complementary ways, while Hull (1997) believes that too great an emphasis is placed on literacy, particularly in low skilled work. I teach on a programme for students with limited English literacy and numeracy proficiency. A common entry point into the workforce for current and past learners from the programme is entry-level supermarket work. However there is limited information available about the literacy and numeracy pre-requisites for this type of work or the literacy and numeracy demands placed on those in employment. In seeking to contribute to the body of knowledge about low skilled work in general and entry-level supermarket work in particular, research was carried out in a large, busy, suburban supermarket. The study was underpinned by the belief that both literacy and numeracy are social practices which cannot be separated from the contexts in which they occur. It adopted an ethnographic approach and was conducted through semi-structured interviews with supermarket managers and entry-level workers/supermarket assistants; observation of assistants during induction and at work; and analysis of some significant supermarket documentation. Findings indicate that, while literacy and numeracy are generally not considered to be important pre-requisites for entry-level supermarket work, supermarket assistants are exposed to highly context-specific literacy texts and &#8216;embedded&#8217; and invisible numeracy demands at induction and during parts of their working day. The findings have significance for the teaching of literacy and numeracy in vocational training programmes. They indicate that off-site programmes have an important role to play in providing a learning foundation but also point to the importance of, and need for, workplace-specific, on-the-job literacy and numeracy training.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Numeracy</field><field name="subject">Entry-level work</field><field name="subject">Supermarket</field><field name="subject">Ethnography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles and impacts of accounting and auditing organization for Islamic financial institutions (AAOIFI) in dealing with the accounting and disclosure of Zakah and Interest (Riba)</field><field name="creator">Ahmad Nadzri, Farah Aida</field><field name="description">The issues of zakah and interest for IFIs have been highlighted for several years and attracted many arguments among Islamic scholars and public. The increasing public interest on the Islamic Banking since 1970s has been driven by the increasing sensitivity among Muslims to the relationship between religion and economic activities. With the emergence of IFIs, Muslims community has demanded for an establishment of an accounting body to develop a set of accounting standards that adhere to the Islamic tenets, hence AAOIFI was established. However, the journey of AAOFI in achieving such objective has not been smooth. This paper intended to study the effectiveness of AAOIFI in dealing with the issues of zakah and riba for IFIs by examining the disclosure practice of 25 IFIs worldwide.  Based on the analysis conducted, it is concluded that the extents of disclosure by the IFIs are much lower than the AAOIFI requirements. The study also found that leverage and origin factors might contribute to the level disclosures of zakah and financial products. In addition, the test performed also revealed that the adopters of AAOIFI do provide more disclosure as compared to the non-adopters. However, the mean result is relatively low to suggest full compliance with the AAOIFI standards.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic accounting standards</field><field name="subject">Riba</field><field name="subject">Zakah</field><field name="subject">Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI)</field><field name="subject">Content analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Killed in the line of duty: who is killing foreign correspondents and why?</field><field name="creator">Barton, Verena</field><field name="description">The world of journalism is becoming increasingly dangerous, as figures published by international media organisations demonstrate. But the Western news media suggests, that particularly Western foreign correspondents are facing incredibly high risks and cases of abducted, tortured and murdered foreign correspondents are reported regularly. The question arises &#8220;Have they become targets?&#8221; Foreign correspondence has been a dangerous occupation since it first emerged during the Crimean War, when the first consistent war reporting was established. Ever since then, foreign correspondents have had to face opposition, criticism and harsh realities. However, they have also always been highly valued journalists and well-respected for their courage to travel overseas, often into conflict-riddled areas, to report important news to their audiences back home. Sometimes they have even lost their lives in the pursuit of truth. Daniel Pearl, Christian Struwe and Karen Fischer or Trent Keegan are just a few examples of the many correspondents and journalists who have died as martyrs for their profession. As the actual data published by international media organisations, such as Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists or Freedom House, suggests, it has rapidly become worse for all journalists in the last 20 years and there is worse to come. It appears as if the factors leading to their deaths are increasing and will be contributing to even higher death tolls in the future. The thesis will consider such questions as: Who is there to protect journalists and foreign correspondents? Independent media organisations are trying their best. The international press is bemoaning the many deaths and governments have promulgated laws to protect their reporters, but does that actually help? Will those attempts make it better in future? And can the Western news media apparatus itself be held partly responsible for some of the deaths?</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foreign correspondent</field><field name="subject">Journalism</field><field name="subject">International press</field><field name="subject">News media</field><field name="subject">Independent media organisation</field><field name="subject">War reporting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Active stiffness and strength in individuals with unilateral anterior shoulder instability:  a bilateral comparison</field><field name="creator">Olds, Margie</field><field name="description">Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate active shoulder stiffness and strength in recurrent shoulder instability. Additionally, this study sought to investigate the relationship between active stiffness, and quality of life, functional outcome, and perceived instability. The relationship between strength and quality of life, functional outcome and perceived instability was also investigated. Study Design: A cross sectional study of a cohort of subjects with unilateral recurrent anterior shoulder instability was undertaken. Background: Recurrent shoulder instability affects up to 94% of young athletes following a dislocation (Rowe &amp; Skallerides, 1961; Rowe &amp; Zairns, 1956). Active stiffness is possibly an important factor in protecting the joint from episodes of instability (Myers, 2001; Riemann &amp; Lephart, 2002).  While studies have examined passive stiffness at the shoulder, there is little that has examined active stiffness. Method: Maximal Voluntary Strength (MVS) of the muscles involved in horizontal flexion and their active stiffness at 30%, 50% and 70% MVS was tested in 16 male subjects, with unilateral traumatic anterior shoulder instability. Additionally, quality of life, function and perceived instability were measured using the Western Ontario Stability Index (WOSI), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Questionnaire (ASES) and the Single Alpha Numeric Evaluation score (SANE) respectively. Results:  There was a significant decrease in horizontal flexion strength in the recurrently unstable shoulder. Stiffness was also decreased significantly at 30% and 50% MVS. No statistical difference was demonstrated in stiffness values between limbs at 70% MVS. No significant correlation was shown between active stiffness controlling for strength, and quality of life, function or perceived instability. Additionally, no significant association was shown between strength and quality of life, function or perceived instability. Conclusion: The observed reduction in stiffness in the unstable shoulder warrants the inclusion of exercises in the rehabilitation program to enhance this parameter in an effort to protect the joint from perturbations that might lead to dislocation.  Deficits in strength in horizontal flexion indicate that strengthening exercises may also be valuable to enhance performance in activities that incorporate horizontal flexion. The lack of an association between active stiffness and quality of life and overall function may indicate that stiffness investigated in one plane of motion does not adequately reflect tissue stiffness during functional activities. Further examination into stiffness in the unstable shoulder is necessary, utilising methodology that examines stiffness in all three dimensions simultaneously.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shoulder</field><field name="subject">Instability</field><field name="subject">Stiffness</field><field name="subject">Strength</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natal dispersal, habitat selection and mortality of North Island Brown Kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) at the Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary, Coromandel</field><field name="creator">Forbes, Yuri</field><field name="description">The Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary is one of five sanctuaries established in 2000 and managed by the Department of Conservation. The objective of the sanctuaries is to protect the most endangered kiwi taxa, and increase kiwi survivorship. Operation Nest Egg (ONE) is a programme utilised by the Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary for artificially incubating abandoned Kiwi eggs and captive rearing chicks until they begin to show a gain in weight. ONE chicks were then released back onto Moehau or adjacent protected areas.  Kiwi populations are declining on the mainland at an average of about 3% per year in areas where predators of kiwi are not controlled. The main cause for this decline is chick mortality due to predation by stoats (Mustela erminea). During natal dispersal kiwi are known to disperse significant distances of between 5&#8211;20 km, and this has influenced the size of management areas needed for the protection of kiwi (10,000 hectares). The type of forest-cover is an important element in determining where management areas are located, as kiwi has preferences for certain forest types over others. This study conducted at Moehau, Coromandel, on the North Island Brown Kiwi advances our knowledge of kiwi by examining differences in rates and distances of dispersal among chicks, sub-adults, non-territorial and territorial adults, as well as between genders. This study investigates kiwi selective use of roost site types, ground-cover types, forest types and physiographical features. Addressed in this study are differences in dispersal, habitat selection and mortality among age-classes and between genders over the months of the year, and across elevations. Comparisons between ONE and wild-reared kiwi dispersal and mortality are included. Data were collected between 2001 and 2008 from observations of kiwi located during daytime hours. The data recorded included the grid reference, elevation, ground-cover type, forest type, physiography, and the type of roost site. The sample size for this study was significantly larger than for any previous studies thus enabling a greater confidence in estimated dispersal rates and dispersal distances, habitat selection and factors relating to mortality. All wild-reared kiwi displayed dispersal and were not philopatric to their natal area. Dispersal distances were found to be further than previously estimated, with the net distance of natal dispersal differing among age-classes, from an average of 834m (SE +/- 131) for kiwi chicks to 7,553m (SE = +/- 1167) for non-territorial adults. Female sub-adult kiwi dispersed further (7,215m) than male sub-adult kiwi (4,226m) (p = 0.04). The time taken to travel one km during natal dispersal ranged from an average of 131days/km (SE = +/- 9) for chicks to 89 days/km (SE = +/- 13) for sub-adults. Habitat selection has been observed in other studies on kiwi but not specifically for Coromandel North Island Brown Kiwi, and selection for ground-cover types by kiwi when roosting on the surface has never been previously studied. Roost site selection of kiwi differed among age-classes (p &lt;0.001), between gender (p &lt;0.001), and across elevations (p &lt;0.001). Female kiwi were found more often in surface roosts (64%) than hole roosts (32%), and male kiwi were found at similar frequencies in holes (46%) and on the surface (47%). Sub-adults used holes to a greater extent as elevation increased, and selected for sub-alpine forest over broadleaf forest (p &lt;0.001). This study is the first to recognise that selection of ground-cover types by kiwi differs among age-classes (p &lt;0.001). Kiwi chicks were more often found on the surface under dead fern fronds and debris (39%) than other ground-cover types. The mortality rate was highest in chicks (33%), with predation responsible for 60% of these deaths; conservation management techniques were responsible for a further 20% of deaths; the remaining 20% of deaths were due to natural or unknown causes. Summer (December-February) was the season in which 81% of kiwi chick deaths occurred. The high proportion of deaths from monitoring techniques and the use of radio-transmitters (22%) indicates improvements need to be made to current management practices. ONE chicks were found to disperse shorter distances and had a greater mortality rate than wild-reared chicks. Therefore, recommendations are made for changes to ONE management practices. Further recommendations are made for the enhancement of kiwi habitat that could reduce kiwi mortality, and for increasing the habitat available to kiwi, thereby potentially increasing population sizes and/or densities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apteryx</field><field name="subject">Dispersal</field><field name="subject">Habitat selection</field><field name="subject">Mortality</field><field name="subject">Kiwi</field><field name="subject">Moehau</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phaze One: part one of a draft novel.

There is an overview of Phaze One and why I have chosen to write part one of a three part series. The landscape of contemporary young adult fantasy, as well as, the categories of science fiction and fantasy literature and how they overlap will be discussed, with reference to academic literature. I will also discuss the relevance of mythic conventions and archetypes common in fantasy, and how these conventions have been adapted to the novel. Thus, positioning the creative work within its wider context. The exegesis includes reference to various writers who were relevant to the creative process; however, significant reference will be to the young adult fantasy writer Garth Nix and his &#8216;Keys to the Kingdom&#8217; series.

These factors in turn affect the viability of many small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the primary employers and the engines for economic growth and employment in rural districts.  The combined effect of these processes is that many rural districts struggle to keep young people, maintain economic and social diversity and attract new settlers and investment. This thesis seeks to answer the question as to how large scale retail businesses, rural farm amalgamations and declining rural populations impact on the viability of SME retail businesses in rural areas.  In order to answer this question, this study identifies   the key factors, which affect the future viability of small-to-medium sized retail businesses in sparsely populated rural districts using the South Taranaki District as a case study.  The role of economic development agencies and district councils is also examined using case studies of small towns in rural districts of Australia and the United States of America (USA).    This study found a number of factors affect the future viability of small-to-medium sized retail businesses in sparsely populated rural districts. For the South Taranaki district, these factors include the arrival of large-scale supermarkets, followed by large scale retail chains such as The Warehouse.  These factors, combined with changing rural population structures and economic &#8216;spikes&#8217; relating to sporadic energy development, have significant implications for the long term viability of many SMEs in the district. Case studies of similar rural districts in the USA and Australia provided examples of strategies that could be used to manage these impacts.  This thesis recommends policies, initiatives and strategies that may be considered by territorial local authorities, regional councils and central governments to help address the economic development challenges facing rural districts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retail convergence</field><field name="subject">Big box retailers</field><field name="subject">Case study South Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Rural depopulation</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acquisition of New Zealand Sign Language as a second language  for students in an interpreting programme: the learners&#8217; perspective</field><field name="creator">Pivac, Lynette</field><field name="description">This research study presents an investigation of interpreter trainees acquiring New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) as a second language (L2) outside their formal classroom learning. This study was motivated firstly by a concern that a considerable reduction in learner and lecturer contact hours within an NZSL interpreting programme would compromise graduate NZSL competency, necessitating a compensatory approach predominantly in the context of the Deaf community. Secondly, the study attempts to address a marked gap in research related to L2 sign language learning from a socio-cultural perspective. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in a bilingual context (NZSL and English) in order to gain the &#8216;inside&#8217; perspectives of six NZSL learners who had just completed a two-year Diploma in Sign Language Interpreting. The interviews sought to uncover the informal NZSL language learning opportunities used by the participants, especially within the social context of the Deaf community, and the individual learner strategies utilised by &#8216;good learners&#8217; of NZSL. Interview data were transcribed and were analysed by employing qualitative methods. Coding of the data revealed a number of categories which were subsequently examined for salient themes relating to the research questions. The main findings of the study revolved around the significance of L2 learner access to social and material resources, especially within the Deaf socio-cultural context. Of particular significance was the enhancement of learner motivation and confidence as was the frequency and depth of interaction with Deaf people and degree of mediated NZSL learning from NZSL mentors. Of key importance were the social relationships and networks developed with L1 users, which facilitated access to an array of NZSL learning opportunities. Material language learning resources, such as NZSL video samples and equipment were also useful, when interaction with Deaf people was not possible due to heavy study demands, especially in the second year of the programme. Learner involvement in the Deaf community, particularly within Deaf social networks, resulted in significantly improved linguistic, pragmatic and socio-cultural competency. The findings of the study raise two main implications.  Firstly, the study highlights the need for NZSL interpreting curriculum enrichment and the resourcing of the programme to foster learner autonomy.  Secondly, to date there has been little research on adult L2 sign language learning outside the classroom context and the study may stimulate further studies of the acquisition of sign language as a second language. The study may also be of benefit to autonomous L2 sign language learners and stakeholders in sign language interpreting education around the world.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sign language learning</field><field name="subject">Sociocultural perspective</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Autonomous learning</field><field name="subject">Learning strategies</field><field name="subject">NZSL learning opportunities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">That&#8217;s no way to say goodbye: exit interviews and employee turnover in New Zealand hotels</field><field name="creator">Williamson, David</field><field name="description">The hospitality and tourism industry is an increasingly important part of the New Zealand economy, contributing almost nine percent of the Gross Domestic Product in 2008.  One of the key concerns regarding this part of the economy is the impact of a tight labour market and intense skill shortages on its ability to maximise returns from tourists.  Labour turnover rates have been extremely high in the hospitality sector over the past few years and this has contributed to the intense labour market pressures affecting this industry.  Hotels have suffered particularly high turnover rates in the past few years and exit interviews have been one of the tools that Human Resource Managers used to try and gain data about employee reasons for leaving.  This study looks at exit interviews as a source of data on the causes of labour turnover in two New Zealand hotel chains. The aim of this study was to analyse hotel exit interview data in order to identify significant patterns that might illuminate the causes and potential moderating factors of labour turnover in New Zealand hotels.  In addition, the study aimed to analyse the processes used to gather exit interview data in order to evaluate the efficacy of exit interviews and see if any practical recommendations could be made regarding the use of exit interviews to address labour turnover.  A qualititative, triangulated research methodology was applied in order to analyse the data generated from over 4500 exit interviews, from 17 hotels, in two New Zealand hotel brands.  The interviews cover six years of exit interview gathering.  In addition, in depth semi-structured interviews with six hotel Human Resource Managers were used to gain insight into the practice and perceptions around exit interviews. The study found that despite considerable application of time and resources, hotels gain very little benefit from the exit interview process.  Several issues are identified as bringing the efficacy of exit interviews into question, including power imbalance between interviewees and interviewers, language and cultural concerns, and the impact of psychological contract breaches on the employment relationship.  In addition, the study found that even when opportunities for organisational improvement did arise from exit interviews, little or no action was taken by the hotels in question.  The study concludes that there is insufficient benefit to the hotels given the costs of exit interviews and suggests that other forms of employee feedback, such as engagement surveys may be more efficacious in addressing labour turnover.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospitality</field><field name="subject">Hotels</field><field name="subject">Exit interviews</field><field name="subject">Turnover</field><field name="subject">Labour</field><field name="subject">Employee</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guangzhou</field><field name="creator">Muir, James</field><field name="description">Seth, a savvy but shy innocent from the American mid-West, discovers the hedonism of Guangzhou when he jumps ship with the Preacher. He becomes entangled with the patriotic Snow Flake and together, they visit her remote ancestral village. But they are followed there by the shadowy figure of Lin Jun who tests Seth&#8217;s commitment to the values of his forefathers and his feelings for Snow Flake.  The novel examines what it is to be a Westerner in contemporary China through the character of Seth who, with no appropriate language skills, embarks on an adventure without morals &#8211; discarding his religious beliefs, recreating himself as his imagination sees fit and running wild with the Preacher and Snow Flake. At the same time, the novel also asks how the West should best engage China on sensitive internal issues such as the suppression of religious, spiritual, democratic and artistic movements when China grows ever stronger and more influential. This question is presented to Seth when he is totally removed from his own culture and faced with an extreme event that, even in his state of mind, is totally contrary to his own moral framework.  The exegesis discusses Seth&#8217;s dilemma from the perspective of cultural relativism - that is when can an individual from one culture declare an event which takes place in another culture to be &#8216;wrong&#8217;?  The exegesis also discusses my own dilemma of writing about a culture that is not my own and concludes that Guangzhou both asks how the West can engage China on sensitive issues and is also my response to this very question.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural relativism</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diagnosis of subacromial impingement syndrome and associated pathology in the primary care setting</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Daniel</field><field name="description">Diagnosing shoulder pain conditions is a challenging area of musculoskeletal practice.  Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a clinical syndrome that indicates pain and pathology involving the subacromial bursa and rotator cuff tendons within the subacromial space. The three stages of SIS are subacromial bursitis, partial thickness and full thickness rotator cuff tears. The cause of SIS is believed to be multi-factorial with both extrinsic and intrinsic factors involved in its pathogenesis. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed SIS using a clinical examination including a subjective history followed by confirmatory clinical tests. A review of the evidence for diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests highlights that individual tests have poor diagnostic accuracy. A combination of clinical tests or a clinical examination per se may be useful at ruling out rotator cuff tears, but is less accurate at detecting rotator cuff tears when it is present. There is consensus in the literature that particular combinations of signs and clinical features may be useful in diagnosing rotator cuff tears but not for diagnosing SIS. The vast majority of research to date examining the clinical diagnosis of SIS has been focused on individual clinical tests carried out by medical practitioners in specialist and tertiary care settings. This review has established that the majority of diagnostic accuracy studies for SIS and rotator cuff tears have had poor methodological design. This exploratory study was conducted with subjects undergoing a standardized clinical examination (index test) by a physiotherapist. The decision as to which specific tests were chosen for this research was based on supporting research within the literature and the test&#8217;s actual use within the New Zealand clinical setting.  This included subjective history questions, active and passive shoulder movement tests and eleven SIS tests. Subjects were referred for a diagnostic ultrasound scan immediately following the clinical examination and results from the scan stood as the criterion reference standard. Thirty eight individuals (males n=23, females n=15) with new onset shoulder pain, who met the inclusion criteria, were assessed by a participating physiotherapist. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios and respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all variables of the examination. Individual variables from the clinical examination were tested for their association with the diagnostic ultrasound scan reference criterion using Pearson Chi-Squared Exact test. Potential predictor variables were retained as potential predictors for use in the logistic regression analysis to determine the most accurate set of clinical examination variables for diagnosing SIS and the individual pathological stages of SIS. The results indicate that no historical, subjective or objective features from the clinical examination are accurate in diagnosing SIS or rotator cuff tears. The presence of night pain demonstrated a significant correlation (P&lt;0.02) with the criterion reference standard for the presence of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching. Night pain and pain with overhead activity has a high sensitivity for subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present. The absence of night pain and the absence of pain with overhead activity are two subjective phenomena from a clinical examination that are useful in ruling out subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present. Night pain was also found to be the best predictor of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present (P&lt;0.012). Male gender (P&lt;0.034) was the best predictor of partial thickness rotator cuff tears while being 60 years of age or older (P&lt;0.01) significantly correlated with full thickness rotator cuff tears. The Drop Arm Sign (P&lt;0.01) and External Rotation Lag Sign (P&lt;0.01) were significantly correlated with SIS and full thickness rotator cuff tears. Clinical tests for all three pathological stages of SIS and subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present, had equivalent or if not greater diagnostic accuracy than previous report studies in the literature. The Hawkins-Kennedy Test and Neer Sign can be used in the primary care setting to rule out the presence of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching or SIS if the tests are negative. For mid to end stage SIS (rotator cuff tears) the Empty Can Test and Drop Arm Sign with their high sensitivity can be used to rule out rotator cuff tears especially to the supraspinatus tendon when the tests are negative. Despite the small sample size and other limitations of this study, the findings are an important addition to the current literature surrounding the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for SIS and rotator cuff tears. This is the first study to use physiotherapists as examiners and to be set in a primary care setting. The study is also the first to examine the diagnostic accuracy of a range of historical and subjective features from the clinical examination. The results found in the current study could be used by future studies as a starting point in the development of a clinical decision or prediction rule to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of SIS and rotator cuff tears.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Subacromial impingement syndrome</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Clinical examination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The champions of corporate community involvement: an exploratory two-stage study of why and how individuals impact corporate community involvement in their organisations</field><field name="creator">Black, Xavier</field><field name="description">This study explores the role of managers and manager-owners in decisions to engage the community and select particular social causes. This exploratory study aims to investigate why and how individuals impact on corporate community involvement (CCI) in their organisations. This is of significance in New Zealand as corporate philanthropic funding to the non-profit sector accounts for only three percent, which is low by international comparisons (Tennant, O&#8217;Brien &amp; Sanders, 2008). The role of managers and their influence on CCI has been vociferously debated, with some arguing that personal impact should be limited and CCI decisions should be made solely according to profit maximisation. This perspective has used a rational and cognitive model of decision making paired with the Expectancy or reward/reinforcement theory in motivation to argue that management rationally considers the firm and then selects the best strategic option. This study turns to contemporary psychology to propose that managers may use &#8216;hot&#8217; mental processing, including making CCI decisions based on values, emotions, ideologies and their own sense of identity. This study utilises a two-stage mixed method approach. The first stage investigated six respondents utilising a phenomenology approach to give a detailed description of each manager&#8217;s frame of reference and how this frame of reference impacted CCI outcomes. The second stage of this study progressed from a description to offering a theoretical explanation of the phenomenon, investigating the variables influencing how managers expressed their personal frame of reference in behaviour and the consequential impact on CCI decision making. This study found that managers and manager-owners held a strong sense of values, well defined ideologies, emotions, preferences and opinions regarding social issues which constructed the frame of reference surrounding their organisations community involvement. However, the existence of the personal frame of reference did not consistently impact the visible behaviour of individuals or their organisation&#8217;s corporate community involvement. Cold or rational thinking was shown to mitigate the impact of hot processing or alternatively post-justify decisions based on hot mental processing to validate the initial decision or alter how it was communicated within the organisation. Whether the personal frame of reference impacted CCI decision-making was influenced by the depth of the frame of reference, the internal mental dialogue regarding the acceptability of effectiveness of hot or cold decision making and task, organisational, and personal variables. This study offers a critique of extant research based on rational cognitive models and offers an alternative explanation for why and how managers champion CCI in their organisations. Further, through providing a deeper understanding of the roles of managers this thesis provides recommendations for non-profit organisations strategising to target the corporate sector for funding and provides some insights into how to mitigate or encourages the use of hot mental processing within CCI decision making.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Corporate community involvement</field><field name="subject">Corporate philanthropy</field><field name="subject">Corporate community investment</field><field name="subject">Community engagement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Walls that speak: creative multivocality within Tangatarua</field><field name="creator">Thyne, Debbi</field><field name="description">This research posits art as an encounter, an encounter between the conceptual worlds of artists and of viewers. It acclaims the respective art skills within the marae (communal meeting place) named Tangatarua at Waiariki Institute of Technology, Rotorua. Tangatarua Marae is a place of bicultural encounter. This writing includes readers in the social relations of this encounter. This is a qualitative study that uses an interpretive epistemology to examine some of the art forms of Tangatarua. My focus is on micronarratives - that is, on intimate, improvised meanings generated by some of the small artworks. These reference and affirm the symbolism of the carvings but are less visible due to their lesser scale and interstitial placement within the interior architecture. They are rendered more visible through the phenomenological detail of participant accounts as well as the positivism of a formalist critique. I posit art as a dialogical activity, inseparable from the phenomenological conditions that precede and inform it, and inseparable from the emergent meaning that is forged at its encounter. I contend that the collaborative mode of art production within Tangatarua embodies this dialogical model. I amplify some of the tangible art forms of Tangatarua by dismantling the intangible discursive forms that have impinged on them. These include aspects of the political context of the establishment of the marae, Waiariki Institute of Technology&#8217;s bicultural framework, and the pedagogy of its Art School. My writing is underpinned by a participatory paradigm acknowledging my situatedness as an artist participant within Tangatarua, a woman of Ngai Tahu descent, and art tutor at Waiariki Institute of Technology. This study similarly acknowledges the multifaceted, experiential transactions between those artists whose small collective gestures have informed and transformed the interior of Tangatarua.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bicultural art</field><field name="subject">Relational aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Art pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Dialogical meaning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching Buddhism in New Zealand universities</field><field name="creator">Huang, Li Ting</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into the university-level teaching of Buddhism in New Zealand, which has developed as part of the international spread of education about Buddhism for both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. The study was based on Interpretivism and accordingly sought to understand and interpret university teachers&#8217; perceptions and experiences about their teaching of Buddhism; as they engage with the students' learning in this field. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were employed as the primary research method. All seven university teachers who teach Buddhism in New Zealand were invited to be the participants. Six university teachers participated in this research-study. Five of them were academic teachers, respectively teaching at Religious Studies of Massey, Victoria and Otago. Another one was a New Zealand-born Zen teacher who had been teaching a Zen meditation workshop at Auckland University of Technology for several years, and taught two Buddhism-related courses at the University of Auckland. These participants were chosen according to the information provided on official websites of New Zealand universities. The findings from the study showed that the university-level teaching of Buddhism in New Zealand, though growing, had been limited by the number of teachers and students. As fewer students were primarily interested in Buddhism, outward funding support appeared to be a very important factor for its future development. In terms of teachers&#8217; role, objective-outsider remained the main position for scholars and scholar-practitioners in teaching Buddhism in university classroom. In addition to the pursuit of knowledge, there were also alternative educational opportunities, such as Zen workshop, for university staffs and students to learn Buddhism, outside university classroom. This thesis is significant in that it provided a bibliography and a set of data for the university-level teaching of Buddhism in the West, particularly New Zealand It established a space for future educational research into for the university-level teaching of Buddhism in the West, as part of the field of&#8217; Buddhism and Education.&#8217; In future studies, the limited approaches to teaching Buddhism in universities could be investigated on the basis of the literatures and findings of this study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buddhist studies</field><field name="subject">University</field><field name="subject">Interpretivist approach</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured interview</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Teaching religion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Story telling as koha: consolidating community memories</field><field name="creator">Tanoai, Tuafale</field><field name="description">This project will explore a fusion of Tangata Whenua and Pacific perspectives within a performance installation framework.

The first, an exegesis, sets my creative work in a literary, stylistic and social context. The second and main part of this submission is the first draft of a novel, Sleep, Sister, which I have written over the course of the last year. [Note: the draft novel is embargoed until 31 May 2011.]  The exegesis explores issues such as the history of the road novel, alienation and loneliness within society, and in particular within families. It also discusses the novel as a coming of age story, with its main characters being members of Generation X, those born between 1960 -1980. This was the first generation of New Zealand children for whom divorced parents and blended families were common experiences. The exegesis also describes how the themes of the story have informed the style, narrative and characterisation of the book. It concludes with the main question of the novel; whether the two main characters &#8211; sisters &#8211; can overcome their damaging past.  The novel is set in New Zealand, predominantly in the year 1987, although there are flashbacks to the girls&#8217; 1970s childhood. It is written mainly in the present tense and with shifting points of view.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">first draft novel</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sam and Susana</field><field name="creator">Heath, Tim</field><field name="description">My novel, &#8216;Sam and Susana&#8217; is set in Auckland in 1968. The story centres on the developing relationship between two students: Sam, a 21 year old from a middle class palagi family, and Susana, a Samoan girl from Otara. When they meet Sam is cynical about university, dedicated to sports and to his drinking companions, but unresolved in almost all other areas of his life. He desperately wants to free himself from the well-to-do St Heliers home where he still lives with his parents, and move out into the world with a more secure set of values and ambitions. He has liberal ideas, bordering at times on Socialist, fuelled by the political events of the day, but not yet translated into any actions. Susana is overflowing with enthusiasm and sees being at University as a privilege. She is very uncertain about academia, but has a strong set of attitudes about everything else, especially the value of family, religion and morality. She is deeply conscious of her extended family&#8217;s pride and expectations. Their romance does not progress smoothly.

The majority of the studies on truancy have been carried out with students in alternative education in the U.S.A and Australia. In New Zealand, research has focused on the truancy of Maori students. This study investigates the causes of truancy for Pasifika students in alternative education in New Zealand. Using a qualitative approach, data were collected using questionnaires and three focus group interviews. The findings from this study suggest that a number of factors affected students&#8217; motivation to study. The behaviour of teachers and the school environment were found to affect the Pasifika students&#8217; approach to learning. Some students had negative views of their own ability and lacked perseverance. Other students believed that a lack of parental or family support impacted negatively on their attendance. Consistent with the findings in other studies on truancy, this study found that a range of influences such as a lack of support from community leaders, students&#8217; perceptions of their performance, the nature of the classroom environment, family structure, lifestyle factors and cultural and church activities contributed to Pasifika students&#8217; truanting behaviour. This study suggests that schools that employ teachers who understand and empathize with the cultural aspects of Pasifika students and who can empathize with their situation will be most effective in preventing truancy among these students. Similarly, schools have dedicated programmes that accommodate the academic requirements of Pasifika students foster a more positive learning environment. Finally, schools should look to put in place initiatives to enable Pasifika parents to become effective partners in their children&#8217;s education.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mainstream education</field><field name="subject">Causes of truancy</field><field name="subject">Pacific Islanders</field><field name="subject">Truants</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the radio noise environment in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Banks, Paul Russell</field><field name="description">A methodology for the measurement of the radio frequency environment close to the radio noise floor is presented for urban, suburban and rural areas within New Zealand for the purposes of characterisation and trend monitoring by radio spectrum managers.

It specifically examined the impacts of both individual and collective remittances to the household and community level and on the broader society as a whole.  This study also identified the opportunities brought about by Filipino remittances from New Zealand to communities of origin in the Philippines and possible avenues for the enhancement of the impact of these remittances at the local community level and on society. Case study as a research methodology was used in the study in order to have an in depth, more exhaustive and more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.  It helped captured the emerging themes of remittance practices and development work of Filipinos and their Associations and Organizations in New Zealand to communities of origin in the Philippines.  It also helped understand the phenomenon in the real life context in which a one shot survey or observation failed to capture. The study found that while it was common for overseas Filipinos to send individual remittances to household members in the Philippines for household use and human investments for family members, this was not always the case for Filipinos in New Zealand.  Most Filipino migrants in New Zealand had their immediate family living with them in the host country and they sent individual remittances to the Philippines either as gifts for parents to maintain their livelihood, for investment, and support for the education of nephews and nieces.  With collective remittances, individual Filipinos and their Associations and Organizations in New Zealand were actively contributing in the pooling of resources for development works in communities of origins in the Philippines.  At the same time, they engaged with their recipient communities in the Philippines in order to establish and maintain their transnational ties for effective implementation of development projects in the home country. The study also found that individual remittances coming from New Zealand for family members in the Philippines had a greater impact on the family as a whole.  Remittances helped establish income generating activities in the family that have multiplier effects to the family such as a steady source of income, strong purchasing power and extra money for the health and education of children.  Individual remittances coming from New Zealand to support the family activities in the community also helped the name of the family in the Philippines in a good stead.  On a community level, collective remittances helped maintain culture and tradition as well as raised funds for the implementation of scholarship programs, medical missions, shelter for orphaned children, and basic infrastructures in the community such as school buildings, community roads and multipurpose halls.  Collective remittances also built communities and gave recipients hope for a brighter future through equitable housing scheme, community empowerment, health, and education programs. Filipino Associations and Organizations in New Zealand were good vehicles in finding opportunities in their communities of origin.  They must engaged with Filipino Associations and Organizations and local business people in their local communities and built partnership with them on community based development projects for the benefit of the wider community.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">Filipino diaspora philanthropy</field><field name="subject">Remittances</field><field name="subject">Filipino migration</field><field name="subject">Community development</field><field name="subject">Gawad Kalinga</field><field name="subject">Public policy</field><field name="subject">Guinsaugon</field><field name="subject">Remittances and development</field><field name="subject">Couples for Christ</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exegesis and screenplay for a film entitled: White Magnolia</field><field name="creator">Hong, Ki Myung</field><field name="description">Most new migrants choose New Zealand as their second home country because New Zealand provides peaceful, safe and relaxed life style and also quality education compared to their homelands. However, for most migrants, settling down in New Zealand is one of the most dynamic and complex processes in their lives. Many migrants are struggling to adjust to New Zealand because the expression of cultural values is different in New Zealand than in their cultures. As migrants adjust to the new culture, their traditional cultural values are increasingly challenged by New Zealand cultural values leading to some degree of personal change. As a result, most immigrants encounter many unfamiliar cultural values in the initial stage of immigration to a New Zealand culture.

Although a wide range of monitoring methods have been investigated and developed, there has been very little migration of these innovations into industrial practice. The principal factor behind this phenomenon is the stochastic nature of the environment in which the system must function. A truly universal application has yet to be developed. The work presented here centres around the application of an unsupervised neural network model to the said problem. These networks learn without the aid of a human teacher or supervisor and learn to organise and re-organise themselves in accordance to the input data. This leads to the network structure reflecting the given input distribution more precisely than a predefined model, which generally follows a decay schedule. The dynamic nature of the process provides an evaluation of the underlying connectivity and topology in the original data space. This makes the network far more capable of capturing details in the target space. These networks have been successfully used in speech recognition applications and various pattern recognition tasks involving very noisy signals. Work is in progress on their application to robotics, process control and telecommunications. The procedure followed here has been to conduct experimental drilling trials using solid carbide drills on a Duplex Stainless Steel workpiece. Duplex Stainless Steel was chosen as a preferred metal for drilling experiments because of this high strength, good resistance to corrosion, low thermal expansion and good fatigue resistance. During the drilling trials, forces on the workpiece along the x, y and z axes were captured in real time and moments of the forces were calculated using these values. These three axial forces, along with their power spectral densities and moments were used as input parameters to the Artificial Neural Network model which followed the Self-Organising Map algorithm to classify this data. After the network was able to adapt itself to classify this real world data, the generated model was tested against a different set of data values captured during the drilling trials. The network was able to correctly identify a worn out drill from a new drill from this previously unseen set of data. This autonomous classification of the drill wear state by the neural network is a step towards creating a &#8220;universal&#8221; application that will eventually be able to predict tool wear in any machining operation without prior training.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SOFM</field><field name="subject">Drill wear</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holding the digital mirror up to nature - a practice-as-research project exploring digital media techniques in live theatre</field><field name="creator">Brannigan, Ross</field><field name="description">Is an actor performing live if that actor is out of sight in the wings and appears on stage as a computer-mediated representation?

It raises issues of the creative possibilities that applications of new technologies afford and of a changing perception of the nature of liveness.  Can digital media techniques usefully enhance the liveness of performance and extend the audience&#8217;s experience of the production?  Specifically, can it augment their perception of themselves, mirrored on stage?  Exploring the usefulness of digital media techniques takes a theatre practitioner into the intermedial, liminal spaces where the two fields converge.

In this painting project I aim to make objects whose objecthood is formed by the collision of the different languages of both painting and sculpture &#8211; objects that negotiate the boundary line between traditional genre divisions. These objects react to one another, where an aspect of one suggests the next, so that they develop like an epidemic. And therefore this project functions in an accumulative way, where each work or body of work acts as a stepping-stone for the next, so that the objects descend from a common ancestor and have a common origin. The project is primarily installational in nature &#8211; in the sense that, although emphasis is put on the individual objects, they are viewed together in installations, not as separate entities. I aim to consider installation in terms of the language of painting, which constitutes the formal underpinning of my practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Painterly language</field><field name="subject">Sculptural language</field><field name="subject">Tinkering</field><field name="subject">Objecthood</field><field name="subject">Installation</field><field name="subject">Object</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power characterisation of a Zigbee wireless network in a real time monitoring application</field><field name="creator">Prince-Pike, Arrian</field><field name="description">Zigbee is a relatively new wireless mesh networking standard with emphasis on low cost and energy conservation.  It is intended to be used in wireless monitoring and control applications such as sensors and remotely operated switches where the end devices are battery powered.  Because it is a recent technology there is not sufficient understanding on how network architecture and configuration affect power consumption of the battery powered devices. This research investigates the power consumption and delivery ratio of Zigbee wireless mesh and star networks for a single sink real time monitoring system at varying traffic rates and the beacon and non beacon mode operation of its underlying standard IEEE 802.15.4 in the star network architecture. To evaluate the performance of Zigbee, the network operation was simulated using the simulation tool NS-2.  NS-2 is capable of simulating the entire network operation including traffic generation and energy consumption of each node in the network.  After first running the simulation it was obvious that there were problems in the configuration of the simulator as well as some unexpected behaviour.  After performing several modifications to the simulator the results improved significantly. To validate the operation of the simulator and to give insight on the operation of Zigbee, a real Zigbee wireless network was constructed and the same experiments that were conducted on the simulator were repeated on the Zigbee network.  The research showed that the modified simulator produced good results that were close to the experimental results. It was found that the non beacon mode of operation had the lowest power consumption and best delivery ratio at all tested traffic rates.  The operation of Zigbee mesh and star networks were compared to the results for IEEE 802.15.4 star networks in non beacon mode which revealed that the extra routing traffic sent by the Zigbee networking layers does contribute significantly to the power consumption, however even with the extra routing traffic, power consumption is still so low that it the battery life of the device would be limited by the shelf life of the battery, not by the energy consumption of the device. This research has successfully achieved its objectives and identified areas for future development.  The simulator model for NS-2 could be improved to further increase the accuracy of the results as well as include the Zigbee routing layers and the experimental results could be improved by a more accurate power consumption data acquisition method.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Power characterisation</field><field name="subject">Zigbee</field><field name="subject">IEEE 802.15.4</field><field name="subject">Mesh network</field><field name="subject">Simulations</field><field name="subject">NS-2</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours on buyers&#8217; commitment</field><field name="creator">Herjanto, Halimin</field><field name="description">Healthy buyer-seller relationships are seen as a source of buyers&#8217; satisfaction, commitment and loyalty. However, creating fruitful relationships with buyers is not always simple and straightforward for salespersons, especially when they seek to establish relationships with buyers from different cultures. Given the challenging nature of intercultural interaction, it becomes imperative for salespersons to identify the behaviours that will best suit such relationships. There is much evidence that salespersons frequently adopt acculturation behaviours in order to build relationships with buyers from different cultures, however the study of acculturation behaviours, though not unknown to marketing scholars, has not been well explored in relationship marketing domains. Studies on the impact of acculturation behaviours from the viewpoint of salespersons are particularly non-existent.  The present study examines the limited available literature on this subject, and attempts to develop a better understanding of the concept of salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours by proposing a model that explains the relationship between salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours and buyers&#8217; satisfaction as well as commitment in the banking context.  The hypotheses are empirically tested in the present study by using appropriate statistical techniques. Results of the study indicate that the hypothesised model of salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours fits the data well. The hypotheses focus on four dimensions of salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours: assimilation, separation, integration and marginalisation. All of these dimensions, excluding separation, show an inter-relationship among the variables of the model and are confirmed with the right significance. Separation is not examined closely within the study as by its nature it is itself exclusionary of any form of interaction with buyers.  Findings from the study indicate however that integration and assimilation positively affect buyers&#8217; satisfaction, whereas marginalisation is negatively associated with buyers&#8217; satisfaction. The results also reveal that buyers&#8217; satisfaction has a mediation effect on the relationships between assimilation, integration, marginalisation and buyers&#8217; commitment.  The model also includes the constructs of interaction intensity, which is positively related to buyers&#8217; satisfaction and buyers&#8217; commitment. This study can be considered as an important step in establishing the linkage between salespersons&#8217; acculturation behaviours and buyers&#8217; satisfaction and commitment. It establishes that salespersons&#8217; acculturation is needed to perform better and create sustainable intercultural interaction.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acculturation</field><field name="subject">Banking</field><field name="subject">Salesperson</field><field name="subject">Behaviour</field><field name="subject">Buyers</field><field name="subject">Commitment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing and characterisation of nano-enhanced composites</field><field name="creator">Frederick, Armstrong</field><field name="description">Since the discovery of nanomaterials in early ninety&#8217;s, a remarkable progress in the synthesis of nanocomposites has been reported looking for a new better material with improved physical and chemical properties for a variety of applications in almost all fields. The science and technology of nanocomposites has created great excitement and expectations in the last decade too. In addition to that, researches in this area have been focusing on the nanoscale second phase embedded in the polymeric matrix that gives physical and chemical properties that cannot be achieved by ordinary material synthesis methods. Researchers have also discovered that incorporating the right amount of nanoparticles into a polymer matrix pose a remarkable strength and flexibility and that industries should be able to integrate the outcome of their researches widely in high performance applications in the field of biomedical engineering, aerospace, marine, high speed parts in engines, packaging and sports gadgets. With the new methods of synthesis and tools for characterisation, nanocomposite science and technology is now experiencing explosive growth. Taking advantage of the need and the properties of the nanomaterials, through this research a new nano-enhanced composite is developed through addition of nanofiller into epoxy matrix to cater for varied applications.  The physical and mechanical properties of the identified nanomaterial reinforced polymer composite were characterised by experimentation in order to ascertain the improvement in tensile, compressive and flexural properties as well as the adhesion of the matrix to the substrate. Also, while addressing potential enhancements like improved mechanical strength, better dimensional stability, higher thermal stability, better abrasion resistance, hard and wear resistance, better chemical properties like better flame retardance, anticorrosive and antioxidation, adequate importance was given to easy and bulk processability and most importantly the commercial viability as well. This nano-enhanced nanocomposite was then optimised. Based on these results, it has been established that epoxy reinforced with 1% percent of nanoclay can significantly improve the mechanical properties without compromising the weight or processability of the composite. Thus, a futuristic and much promising nano-enhanced epoxy composite has been successfully made ready for commercialisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nano-composites</field><field name="subject">Nano-materials</field><field name="subject">Enhancement</field><field name="subject">Properties</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of model fermented fish sausage from New Zealand marine species</field><field name="creator">Khem, Sarim</field><field name="description">Three New Zealand marine species, hoki (Macruronus novaezealandiae), kahawai (Arripis trutta) and trevally (Pseudocaranx dentex) were used to develop model fermented fish sausage.  The formulation comprised fish mince, carbohydrate, minced garlic and salt in a mass ratio of 1 (fish): 0.15: 0.05: 0.03, respectively.  The carbohydrate source was cooked rice or glucose.  (Endogenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) failed to ferment rice).  Folate was also added to the mixture as a factor.  The mixtures were extruded into 50 mL plastic syringes, where the needle end of the barrel had been excised by lathe.  The lubricated barrel was overfilled to 60 mL, capped with a layer of ParafilmTM and aluminium foil, sealed tightly by rubber band and incubated at 30&#176;C.  Over time the piston was progressively advanced to yield samples for microbiological, physical, and chemical analysis. Over 96 hours an increase in the LAB count was observed with a concomitant decrease in pH.  After fermentation was complete, the samples contained around 8.77 log  cfu LAB g-1 with the pH range from 4.38 to 5.08.  The microbiological and pH behaviour of each species varied between preparations.  Hardness, adhesiveness, springiness and cohesiveness of the treatments increased with fermentation, except for hoki.  The treatments showed different colour characteristics with fermentation.  The light reflectance (L* values) of the trevally and kahawai treatments increased, while the a* (redness) and b* (yellowness) values decreased.  Hoki exhibited smaller colour changes except for yellowness, which increased markedly.  Proteolysis, measured colorimetrically by soluble peptide bonds, was greatest for trevally.  Lipid oxidation, measured by the thiobarbituric acid method, was least for hoki, notably the species with the lowest fat content.   Biogenic amines, which are a general quality indicator of fermented products, increased during fermentation.  The trevally treatment generated the highest concentration of amines, but these values were lower than those reported for fermented fish sausage in Southeast Asia.  Notably there were no important difference between folate treatments and those without folate.  The results point to commercial opportunities and further research with New Zealand marine species, especially trevally.  To improve the product quality and to show geographical exclusivity, further research could be done by using starter culture, and a New Zealand staple carbohydrate source such as kumara and potato, and spices and herbs which are commonly used in New Zealand, such as rosemary, thyme and sage or specific to New Zealand, such as horopito.  In addition, sensory studies should also be performed before the products could be tested in the market.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fermented fish mince</field><field name="subject">Biogenic amine</field><field name="subject">Lactic acid fermentation</field><field name="subject">Trevalley</field><field name="subject">Kahawai</field><field name="subject">Hoki</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Botanica: the earthly divine</field><field name="creator">Gannon, Eleanor</field><field name="description">Drawing inspiration from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, this project seeks to incorporate the oxymetaphor, digital photography and photo manipulation into considerations of Heaven, Hell and Purgatory. By considering the potential of an earthly site of transition (the cemetery) in relation to Dante's divine spaces, these images consider certain contradictions existing between the cemetery as a manifestation of waiting, permanence, and decay, and its associations with temporality and transition. The cemetery is therefore an oxymoron. It suggests both a beginning and an end; growth and decay; a place of closure and a pace of transition. Although Heaven, Hell and Purgatory have distinct characteristics in these images, there are commonalities between their layered treatments and iconography that unify them as a whole.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Graphics</field><field name="subject">Photography</field><field name="subject">Divine</field><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="subject">Metaphor</field><field name="subject">Schon</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-fabricate: evolving design through user interaction</field><field name="creator">Laraman, Debra</field><field name="description">This research project focussed on discarded clothing and textiles, as signifiers for the lowest exchange value in the fashion system, and sought methods to add value by up-cycling1 into one of a kind fashion garments. Opportunities to add value were investigated with three main ideas emerging which include up-cycling the visual appearance of the garment or textiles through restyling, user interaction, and creating a narrative for the garment. The practice focussed on developing methods to incorporate these concepts as a way of extending the life of low value textiles into items that could be re-introduced into the fashion cycle2. Walker (2008) suggests that by conveying the story of a product to the consumer, the perception of value increased, and opportunities to explore this concept were investigated during the project. Experimentation with a variety of materials and techniques resulted in developing a method to re-fabricate3 threadbare and stained garments into a new material. User participation4 was investigated as a way to &#8216;add value,&#8217; as it was hoped that by enabling the user to interact with the design they would value the item more. Exploring this concept led to the development of a range of garments and garment kits that enabled the user to learn techniques and make garments using discarded textiles and clothing. The garments and kits were developed using methods and techniques that could be easily mastered and used materials that would be readily available to the user. The development of the garment kits reframed the user as a designer/maker, which is sometimes referred to as participatory design,5 and Followed Fletcher&#8217;s (2008) directive that for practical reasons, the methods need to be low tech and inexpensive. A group of research participants trialled the garment kits, made their own garment and provided feedback, which informed the final phase of the project and the development of revised kits and garments. The project suggests potential opportunities for the fashion designer may exist by focussing on the use of existing resources and heightened user connectivity in the design of garments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Up-cycling</field><field name="subject">Textiles</field><field name="subject">Fashion</field><field name="subject">Sustainable</field><field name="subject">User</field><field name="subject">Kits</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vastra Avatar: a personal manifestation of fashion, culture, and identity</field><field name="creator">Naware, Mihika</field><field name="description">This research project asks; what is the potential for garments to express an Indian/European cultural hybridisation?

The aspect of hybridisation was further enhanced with the use of digitally-printed fabric imagery which features a mythologised and idealised European/Indian history. The research seeks to discover if such a joining-together could develop an aesthetic sensibility, informed by both a &#8216;Western&#8217; enculturation and a traditional Indian heritage.

It is an unpredictable event which causes stress and trauma for all concerned.  Widely accepted and current management of shoulder dystocia involves performing a set of manoeuvres described in the HELPERR mnemonic, which are taught in emergency obstetric training sessions.  This qualitative interpretive study presents a descriptive and hermeneutic analysis of the narratives of five clinicians who have significant experience in the management of shoulder dystocia.  The qualitative descriptive approach is informed by the work of Sandelowski and it incorporates a hermeneutic &#8216;hue&#8217; influenced by the work of Heidegger.  This approach allowed themes to be identified from straight description.  The data was then further analysed using the hermeneutic approach, to bring forth the richness and meaning of the participants&#8217; experiences.  This research approach facilitated a comprehensive analysis of the data.  The findings of this research are that the management of shoulder dystocia has been influenced by HELPERR, so that practitioners most commonly follow the sequence of the mnemonic, despite the fact that some of the manoeuvres are difficult to perform or remember.  Alongside this, the research shows that through their experiences, practitioners have discovered by &#8216;accident&#8217; the manoeuvre of axillary traction.  They find this manoeuvre not only more effective, but easier to perform in any circumstance.  Another important finding of this research is that there are improved neonatal outcomes when axillary traction is the method of choice for resolving shoulder dystocia.  In addition, the research highlights that practitioners who are involved with shoulder dystocia, particularly when the outcome is poor, are at risk of suffering post-traumatic stress and psychological damage, which can result in loss of the practitioner from the profession.  In these ways, this research has contributed to the body of knowledge of shoulder dystocia, and more importantly, provides an alternative and effective strategy for managing shoulder dystocia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Descriptive</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Under the surface: reflections on workers&#8217; narratives from below the minimum wage</field><field name="creator">Sinfield, David Lewis</field><field name="description">This research project is concerned with workers&#8217; narratives, specifically those who have been employed in paid work below the national minimum wage in New Zealand.

In doing this I have sought to creatively synthesize experiences into artworks that provide a deeper insight into the impact of underpaid work. Through this investigation I have attempted to contribute to a broader discussion of underpaid work than what is currently provided, through the analysis of statistical data. In undertaking this project I have also been concerned with investigating new potentials in serigraphy (a graphic medium traditionally associated with working-class politics). I have inquired into how it might be used to create a visual &#8216;voice&#8217; for contemporary workers&#8217; narratives. Accordingly, this project has employed audio recordings of three personal stories. The research has led to the production of a series of serigraphic prints that artistically interpret the journeys and experiences of the participants. These images sit in discourse with looped audio excerpts of their recorded interviews. In this approach, narratives of marginalisation that have often been muted through their presentation as written records, have been re-conceptualised as an artists' images, with which the recordings are in discussion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative inquiry</field><field name="subject">Working below the minimum wage</field><field name="subject">Serigraphic printing</field><field name="subject">Graphic design</field><field name="subject">Workers&#8217; rights</field><field name="subject">Large format screen printed posters</field><field name="subject">Semiotics of the working class</field><field name="subject">Reflexivity as an indicator of the voice of the worker</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ReDress - ReFashion as a solution for clothing (un) sustainability</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Kim</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this practice based project is to promote debate and alter perceptions of second-hand materials and ReFashion concepts.

The WL has been trading in Auckland City&#8217;s central business district for almost fifty years. The WL opens in the early evening and remains open until the early morning hours. At closing, the WL is towed to a storage area where it remains until this process is repeated. This daily pattern has occurred since the WL opened in 1948. Because of its longevity, the WL, and many of its stakeholders have experienced ongoing change as Auckland City has grown, and competition within fast food has increased. Thus, for many stakeholders, the WL is representative of their lives, a mirror of their reality and life experiences. Obviously, these realities and experiences are different for different stakeholders. In this thesis, I examine the contested &#8220;White Lady&#8221; (WL): the perceptions and the social meanings that its stakeholder groups attribute to it. This thesis illuminates differences and similarities within stakeholder viewpoints and in doing so defines that pie carts like the WL are a valid part of New Zealand&#8217;s culinary and social cultures Ultimately, this thesis provides a platform of knowledge from which stakeholders and others can come to understand and know the differing and similar views that other stakeholder groups hold. With this in mind, this research ranges in scope from the examination of city administration to the symbolism associated with the (WL) by some of its stakeholders. Therefore, this research is founded within socio-historic constructs: the history of fast food and, the similarities that this history holds to today&#8217;s WL operation. The contextualisation of hospitality within &#8220;three domains&#8221; (Lashley, 2004, p.13) aids in defining the WL as well as recognising the competitive growth of New Zealand&#8217;s fast food industry. This research suggests that fast food growth and subsequent competition have had negative impacts upon many small fast food outlets including the WL. viii The growth of fast food has facilitated a &#8220;slow food&#8221; (Jones, Shears, Hiller Comfort and Lowell, 2003, p. 298) movement. This movement coupled with the hierarchy of food typologies, adds a Saussurian overlay and sociological discourse to this work. This overlay clarifies for the reader Bourdieu&#8217;s (1984) position that all food is reflective of class status. Within postmodernist constructs and the rise of the individual, (and the consequent opportunity to hear &#8216;voices from the margins&#8217;), movement within class and individuality within New Zealand&#8217;s wider culture has occurred. Social change therefore, has facilitated some of the issues within WL contestation. In highlighting Bourdieu&#8217;s (1984) concept, the &#8220;binary opposition&#8221; (Levi-Strauss, 1981, as cited in Adamenko, 2007, p.27) inherent within food hierarchies and, as often expressed within the media, is examined. This examination reveals that while the media inform, this information often contributes to the polarisation of opinion that facilitates the formation of contested viewpoints by WL stakeholders. It is against a backdrop of compliance need, the absence of an official street trading policy, the differing views of stakeholders, and the intensification of competition in fast food, coupled with a lacuna in the knowledge base of younger Auckland residents regarding the WL that this research finds its voice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fast food</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Contestation</field><field name="subject">Hospitality</field><field name="subject">Pie cart</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can spectators become co-authors in the process of a story narrative</field><field name="creator">Enning, Tang</field><field name="description">This project explores the areas of human perception and story narrative in moving images. Engaged by the research question, &#8220;Can spectators become co-authors in the process of a story narrative?&#8221;, the research focuses on exploring the co-existence and contradiction between the values of spectators and an author in a process of a narrative by developing a new potential narrative approach with multiple perspectives. I hypothesise that spectators could participate with the story narrative process as co-authors. My key method is to engage with spectators&#8217; participation within a narration (story) by displaying story fragments across multiple screens simultaneously. The potential of having a story spread across multiple screens might bring further interest to authors to re-think the notion of a spectator and tell a story with multiple perspectives in a narrative process with spectators. In order to develop this project, I will use different approaches, such as Grounded Theory (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998), Data Visualisation (Tufte, 1983), Action Research (Kemmis &amp; McTaggart, 1988) and Heuristics (Moustakas, 1990), which I will explain in further details in each chapter of my exegesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Story narrative</field><field name="subject">Moving image</field><field name="subject">Cinema</field><field name="subject">Animation</field><field name="subject">Spectator</field><field name="subject">Author</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Co-author</field><field name="subject">Multiple screens</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buyers' enduring involvement with online auctions: a New Zealand perspective</field><field name="creator">Abdul-Ghani, Eathar Mohammad</field><field name="description">Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) online auctions represent an important new marketplace from which consumers can access the goods they require, an alternative marketplace to bricks-and-mortar and online retail stores. Sellers are often ordinary consumers and the items on sale are often second-hand household items, although, modern C2C auction sites also accommodate small businesses selling unused products. Consumer behaviour in online C2C auctions is unlike consumer behaviour in bricks-and-mortar or online retail stores. While considerable research has been conducted into the dynamics of bidding in online C2C auctions little research has addressed the motives for consumers&#8217; ongoing participation in this marketplace. The concept of consumer involvement may explain the amount of time and money consumers are spending in online C2C auctions and the frequency of their visits to auction sites. In the context of this thesis, involvement is defined as the long-term and enduring relevance, connection and relatedness of online auctions to a consumer&#8217;s life. The aim of this research is to explore the ways in which the consumer involvement construct offers an explanation for variation in buyers&#8217; ongoing use of online auctions. The thesis also seeks to discover which consumer motives contribute to buyers&#8217; enduring involvement with online auctions. TradeMe is New Zealand&#8217;s most popular online C2C auction site. In a country of just four million people, the TradeMe auction site has more than 2 million members and accounts for more than 50 per cent of Internet traffic originating from New Zealand websites. This study of buyers who use the TradeMe auction site, offers the opportunity to study online auction consumers in this unique context. Based on an extensive literature review, eighteen propositions were developed regarding buyer motives for enduring involvement with online C2C auctions. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty TradeMe users, to test these propositions and to identify any further motives for enduring involvement with auctions that had not been revealed in the literature review. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed in full. NVivo8 qualitative data analysis software was used to code the interview transcripts. Thematic analysis reveals six themes representing buyer motives for enduring involvement with online auctions. The significant contribution of this thesis is to identify involvement as a useful construct for explaining consumer behaviour in online auctions. In addition to utilitarian and hedonic motives for involvement with online auctions, the interviews reveal that the buyers have a number of social and personal motives for involvement with online auctions. Analysis of the qualitative dataset also reveals a set of marketer activities which encourage ongoing use of the auction site, and a number of factors (anti-motives) which discourage use of the auction site. The research reveals the existence of an off-line community of auction users who value the social contact they experience with one another outside the auction site. Ongoing buyer-seller relationships are also shown to develop outside the auction site, prompted by an initial auction transaction. TradeMe users often express loyalty to the TradeMe website because they are proud of its New Zealand origins, feel secure in using a local auction website, believe they are supporting small New Zealand businesses by buying from TradeMe, and believe they are practicing sustainable consumption behaviour by purchasing second-hand goods. Future research should develop a multi-item, quantitative measure of buyers&#8217; enduring involvement with online auctions and test the validity of this measure with further empirical data.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Online auctions</field><field name="subject">Consumer involvement</field><field name="subject">Consumer motives</field><field name="subject">Business relationships</field><field name="subject">TradeMe</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The shed project</field><field name="creator">Grinter, Keith</field><field name="description">This project attempts to translate my experience of the everyday street for the viewer; to reveal my experience of walking and looking through drawing. The everyday is an elusive and slippery subject that has been used for various and sometimes radical agendas by many writers and artists in the last two centuries. It is seen as having potential for finding the authenticity that is lacking in other spheres of human activity. However, there is an inherent contradiction for the artist engaged with the everyday in that, by definition, the mundane is barely noticed yet it can swiftly become extraordinary when examined closely. This project uses a toolbox of everyday tactics, processes and methods to explore and devise appropriate modes of representing the everyday street, while taking this contradiction into account.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sculpture</field><field name="subject">Drawing</field><field name="subject">Everyday</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Walking</field><field name="subject">Wood</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design for ecosystem function: three ecologically based design interventions to support New Zealand&#8217;s indigenous biodiversity</field><field name="creator">Reay, Stephen</field><field name="description">This research project explores opportunities for sustainable design in New Zealand. Recently a new framework for sustainable design was proposed by environmental chemist Michael Braungart and architect William McDonough who suggest that the current paradigm of cradle to grave product development is unable to provide a solution to the world&#8217;s current ecological crisis, and a &#8220;cradle to cradle&#8221; framework is more appropriate. They suggest that their approach, based on examples from nature, ensures that all human activities have a positive ecological footprint, capable of replenishing and regenerating natural systems, as well as guaranteeing that we are able to develop a world that is culturally and ecologically diverse. A group of New Zealand scientists was asked to evaluate the Cradle to Cradle design framework in an attempt to determine the potential of this, or other sustainable approaches, to design New Zealand products. The key findings from these interviews are described and were utilised to propose a new sustainable design framework &#8211; &#8220;design for ecosystem function&#8221;. In design for ecosystem function, biodiversity is placed central to the design decision-making process, alongside human user needs. This framework was then used to help explore the relationship between science and design, while developing three new, innovative and ecologically beneficial products. The three products, or ecological interventions, represent a design response to a range of ecological problems. They include a toy to help children reconnect with nature in urban ecosystems, a trap to assist lizard monitoring and conservation, and a shelter designed to enhance tree survival, and the colonisation of biodiversity in native forest restoration plantings.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable product design</field><field name="subject">Biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interplay - a visual exploration of the processes of individuation</field><field name="creator">Gorst, Beth Jo-Ann</field><field name="description">This project is an exploration, through art making processes, of a relationship between the interpretation of symbols and the interpretation of everyday life experiences, with a view to evolving a metaphorical visual language that might translate these experiences. Individuation is a process within Jungian psychology that relates the interpretation of symbols to the interpretation of life experiences and places their common meanings within a definitive framework of individual human development. The archetypal pattern that this framework outlines is the development of a healthy relationship between an individual&#8217;s consciousness and the unconscious. The word metaphor originates from Greek metapherein &#8211; &#8220;to carry over, transfer; meta` beyond, over + fe`rein to bring, bear. It is the transference of the relation between one set of objects to another set for the purpose of brief explanation&#8230; the statement &#8220;that man is a fox,&#8221; is a metaphor&#8221; (Webster&#8217;s Revised Unabridged Dictionary, 2008) Due to its particular relationship to time, space, memory and light photography has proven to be an ideal way to engage, record, and present this exploration. Our personal photographs operate as visual metaphors for our personal experience, we transfer the experience into the photograph, we consider the photograph is that moment in time, that place, that experience, rather than being like that experience. The interpretation of personal photographs is entirely individual and emotional. When photographs are placed into the public arena their emotional value changes, their interpretation, purpose, and authenticity can become questionable. In this project the experience and the photographs are placed within the context of individuation, which is a model that guides the interpretation of the photographs and include the individual and emotional values as a necessary part of that interpretation. In this project the symbols and visual metaphors interpreted in the photographs operate as a narrative of the personal experience of the archetypal journey of individuation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human science research</field><field name="subject">Post traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Jungian theory of individuation</field><field name="subject">Intuative image making</field><field name="subject">Archetypes and the unconscious</field><field name="subject">Translating experience via art making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel applications of Association Rule Mining- Data Stream Mining</field><field name="creator">Vithal Kadam, Omkar</field><field name="description">From the advent of association rule mining, it has become one of the most researched areas of data exploration schemes.

There is only limited published research on the topic, either at an academic or industry level. The New Zealand Government has been conducting work in identity fraud in recent times but New Zealand appears to be lagging behind other similar westernised countries in terms of developing specific identity fraud policy or legislative provisions. The research showed that New Zealand does have serious problems in its systems, which in some cases facilitate identity fraud. There is a lack of synchronicity between New Zealand Government systems which undermines a whole of government approach to minimising the risk of identity fraud. Issues in the private sector with identity fraud are just as serious, with financial advantage being one of the main reasons that identity fraud is committed. However, the lack of information sharing between the public and private sectors does not help stem the flow of identity fraud that is currently occurring. Finding policy solutions to combat identity fraud is far from being simplistic. Public policy in this area is fraught with social, political and financial implications. Identity fraud is committed with speed while public policy faces a slow battle with red tape. Nonetheless, the New Zealand Government does not even appear to categorically know what is happening on its own door step with respect to identity fraud. There are no statistics on identity fraud and no concrete figures as to the cost of identity fraud to New Zealand. To compound problems, identity fraud is not even an official offence classification so even when it is occurring, it is not always being recorded. The damage resulting from identity fraud can be catastrophic. Identity fraud is a breeder crime for other offences. It can enable an act of terrorism to occur, women and children to be trafficked, and organisations and individuals to suffer serious financial loss. In New Zealand however, the benefits of identity fraud can be great while the deterrents are weak. New Zealand faces potential harm to its international reputation if its systems are not strengthened to fight identity fraud. In order for this to occur, New Zealand needs to develop a specific identity fraud policy so that it has the basic knowledge in place to allocate the necessary resources to this problem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Identity fraud</field><field name="subject">Identity crime</field><field name="subject">Identity documents</field><field name="subject">Systems analysis</field><field name="subject">Public policy</field><field name="subject">Government</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/828</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International students' expectations of a twelve week IELTS Preparation Course</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Isobel</field><field name="description">The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) English proficiency test has been the focus of increasing research since its inception in 1989. While research has contributed to a better understanding of test construction and has highlighted the limitations of individual test scores for predicting academic success, few studies have focused on students&#8217; perceptions of the academic module of IELTS. The present study attempts to address this gap in the research by investigating student expectations of an IELTS preparation course. The study, adopting a multi-method approach using surveys and interviews, investigated ten international students enrolled in a twelve-week academic IELTS preparation course in a language school affiliated to a university in Auckland, New Zealand. The study found that students have high expectations not only of an IELTS preparation course, but of the IELTS band score they will achieve. The study also found that student expectations of the course were met at least to some extent. Various factors contributed to the fulfilment of students&#8217; expectations including a focus on speaking and listening activities and the use of formative practice tests. Although all four language skills were recognised by the students prior to the course as being important, speaking and listening were identified as those most expected to be improved. By the end of the course, however, reading and writing skills were acknowledged to be most important, suggesting a growing awareness of the importance of literacy skills, both for achieving an appropriate IELTS score and for further academic study. Although limited by the number of participants, the findings have significance for the development and delivery of academic IELTS preparation courses. Firstly, although there is value in focusing on listening and speaking skills, given the change in students&#8217; perceptions, academic literacy skills perhaps need a predominant focus. Related to this focus, challenging reading activities and related vocabulary development should be an integral part of the course. Secondly, the inclusion of practice IELTS tests provides an important formative component of preparation courses. Finally, the study suggests that administration staff and teachers need to better prepare students to have realistic expectations of an achievable IELTS band score.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IELTS</field><field name="subject">Preparation course</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incremental nonparametric discriminant analysis based active learning and its applications</field><field name="creator">Dhoble, Kshitij</field><field name="description">Learning is one such innate general cognitive ability which has empowered the living animate entities and especially humans with intelligence. It is obtained by acquiring new knowledge and skills that enable them to adapt and survive. With the advancement of technology, a large amount of information gets amassed. Due to the sheer volume of increasing information, its analysis is humanly unfeasible and impractical. Therefore, for the analysis of massive data we need machines (such as computers) with the ability to learn and evolve in order to discover new knowledge from the analysed data. The majority of the traditional machine learning algorithms function optimally on a parametric (static) data. However, the datasets acquired in real practices are often vast, inaccurate, inconsistent, non-parametric and highly volatile. Therefore, the learning algorithms&#8217; optimized performance can only be transitory, thus requiring a learning algorithm that can constantly evolve and adapt according to the data it processes. In light of a need for such machine learning algorithm, we look for the inspiration in humans&#8217; innate cognitive learning ability. Active learning is one such biologically inspired model, designed to mimic humans&#8217; dynamic, evolving, adaptive and intelligent cognitive learning ability. Active learning is a class of learning algorithms that aim to create an accurate classifier by iteratively selecting essentially important unlabeled data points by the means of adaptive querying and training the classifier on those data points which are potentially useful for the targeted learning task (Tong &amp; Koller, 2002). The traditional active learning techniques are implemented under supervised or semi-supervised learning settings (Pang et al., 2009). Our proposed model performs the active learning in an unsupervised setting by introducing a discriminative selective sampling criterion, which reduces the computational cost by substantially decreasing the number of irrelevant instances to be learned by the classifier. The methods based on passive learning (which assumes the entire dataset for training is truly informative and is presented in advance) prove to be inadequate in a real world application (Pang et al., 2009). To overcome this limitation, we have developed Active Mode Incremental Nonparametric Discriminant Analysis (aIncNDA) which undertakes adaptive discriminant selection of the instances for an incremental NDA learning. NDA is a discriminant analysis method that has been incorporated in our selective sampling technique in order to reduce the effects of the outliers (which are anomalous observations/data points in a dataset). It works with significant efficiency on the anomalous datasets, thereby minimizing the computational cost (Raducanu &amp; Vitri&#180;a, 2008). NDA is one of the methods used in the proposed active learning model. This thesis presents the research on a discrimination-based active learning where NDA is extended for fast discrimination analysis and data sampling. In addition to NDA, a base classifier (such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)) is applied to discover and merge the knowledge from the newly acquired data. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated against benchmark University of California, Irvine (UCI) datasets, face image, and object image category datasets. The assessment that was carried out on the UCI datasets showed that Active Mode Incremental NDA (aIncNDA) performs at par and in many cases better than the incremental NDA with a lower number of instances. Additionally, aIncNDA also performs efficiently under the different levels of redundancy, but has an improved discrimination performance more often than a passive incremental NDA. In an application that undertakes the face image and object image recognition and retrieval task, it can be seen that the proposed multi-example active learning system dynamically and incrementally learns from the newly obtained images, thereby gradually reducing its retrieval (classification) error rate by the means of iterative refinement. The results of the empirical investigation show that our proposed active learning model can be used for classification with increased efficiency. Furthermore, given the nature of network data which is large, streaming, and constantly changing, we believe that our method can find practical application in the field of Internet security.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Incremental learning</field><field name="subject">Active learning</field><field name="subject">Image recognition</field><field name="subject">Nonparametric analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">User directed search based reverse engineering</field><field name="creator">Schmidt, Frederik</field><field name="description">The current research represents the planning, design, implementation and evaluation of a user directed software clustering approach that utilizes Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE). The aim of this research is to examine if a user directed software clustering approach contributes to the quality of software clustering. Because of the explorative and constructive character this research project utilises the System Development Research Methodology. This research is enabled by the implementation of the Search Based Reverse Engineering (SBRE) component. The SBRE component features multiple similarity measurements and the inclusion of user constraints in the clustering process to create different implementation perspectives of the software system depending on the requirements and preferences of the stakeholders. These similarity measurements are based on software metrics, which measure different software-attributes. The SBRE component utilizes a greedy and tabu search algorithm for the identification of the cluster landscape of the analyzed software systems. The evaluation showed that a user controlled SBSE cluster approach is able to adapt to different user configurations and derive corresponding cluster landscapes from software systems. Different measures are introduced to control the cluster process. It has been shown how these measures contribute to the quality of the clustering. It is demonstrated that tabu search is applicable in the field of software clustering. Finally, it has been examined that a multiple metric approach allows adapting the clustering process to the requirements of the stakeholders and the design of the software system to optimize the clustering result.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Search based software engineering</field><field name="subject">Reverse engineering</field><field name="subject">SBSE</field><field name="subject">Software engineering</field><field name="subject">Java</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of intermittent hypoxic exposure on physical performance in trained basketball players</field><field name="creator">Dobson, Bryan Paul</field><field name="description">Strong evidence exists to support the use of a continuous (&gt;8hr/day) hypoxic stimulus (either geographical altitude or simulated hypoxia) for enhancing the physical performance of endurance athletes. However, evidence supporting the use of acutely intermittent hypoxia (&lt;1hr/day) for enhancing performance is less clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of acutely intermittent hypoxic exposure on physiological and physical performance measures in team sport athletes. Using a single-blind controlled design, 14 trained basketball players (HYP = 7, CON = 7) were subjected to 15 days of intermittent hypoxia or normoxia. Each exposure was 37 minutes in duration (four cycles of 7min on, 3min off) and achieved using a nitrogen dilution device (Airo Ltd, Auckland, NZ). Prescribed peripheral oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) were maintained using an automatic biofeedback system and were progressively decreased from 86-89% on Day 1 to 75-78% on Day 15. A range of physiological measures and performance tests were conducted seven and two days before, and ten days after the intervention. The tests were: an incremental treadmill test to establish peak oxygen consumption ( peak) and running economy (RE), Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test (YYIRT), and the Repeated High-Intensity Endurance Test (RHIET). Whole-blood samples were taken to assess a range of haematological measures. At 10 days post-intervention the HYP group, relative to the CON group, exhibited the following percent changes (&#177;90% confidence limits, CL), and effect sizes (ES; &#177;90% CL); YYIRT running speedpeak (4.8; &#177; 1.6%, ES: 1.0 &#177; 0.4; benefit almost certain), RHIET total sprint time (-3.5; &#177; 1.6%; ES: -0.4 &#177; 0.2; benefit very likely), RHIET slowest sprint time (-5.0; &#177; 2.4%; ES: -0.5 &#177; 0.2; benefit very likely), soluble transferrin receptor (9.2; &#177; 10.1%; ES: 0.3 &#177; 0.3; benefit possible) running economy (11km.hr-1) (-9.0; &#177; 9.7%; ES: -0.7 &#177; 0.7; benefit likely, probable), and running economy (13km.hr-1) (-8.2; &#177; 6.9%; ES: -0.7 &#177; 0.5; benefit likely, probable). Changes to running economy (9km.hr-1), peak, maximum heart rate and lactate and all other blood measures were unclear. In conclusion, acutely intermittent hypoxia resulted in worthwhile changes in physical performance of trained basketball players in tests relevant to competition. However, the lack of clear change in physiological and haematological measures makes it difficult to determine the underlying mechanism for such enhancement.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intermittent Hypoxic exposure</field><field name="subject">Repeated speed</field><field name="subject">Aerobic capacity</field><field name="subject">Basketball</field><field name="subject">Hematology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Sokout,1388" - Body in the space of border</field><field name="creator">Emadi, Azadeh</field><field name="description">The quest of this project is to question and better understand the effects of a widening gap between Middle East and West on Middle Easterners&#8217; experiences and feelings in exile, inbetween.

The thesis explores the proposition that educational marginalisation of minority students will be perpetuated until AUT adopts policies and procedures which enable culturally responsive educational pedagogies and practices which honour indigenous minorities. The thesis asked New Zealand-born Samoan students, what is the nature of their aiga (family) and cultural support frameworks (structures), and, further, to what extent and how and why do these students engage with such networks (processes)? This study used a qualitative approach within which six New Zealand-born Samoan students were interviewed using a semi-structured approach to gathering data. The interview data were transcribed and a thematic analysis was manually completed both within and across the six cases. The turnaround time in gaining ethics approval impacted upon the capacity of the investigator to conduct this research in what she considered to be a culturally appropriate manner and the cautious vigilance of the final ethics committee approval was perceived as a barrier to making culturally appropriate contact. It was discovered that Samoan structures, especially family, are paramount in supporting educational success because of the Fa&#8217;a Samoa processes which they engender. A further discovery was that New Zealand-born Samoans retain cultural affiliations so their lifestyle shows deep regard for Fa&#8217;a Samoa identity. Through these affiliations, meaningful life metaphors become applied. It was concluded that transforming staff so that they understand Pasifika peoples is crucial to growing Pasifika educational success. Staff development must, therefore, be planned so that meaningful understandings of Pasifika concepts and frameworks become nurtured and that is a challenge which AUT must embrace and action.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand-born</field><field name="subject">Tertiary education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/862</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The literary benefits of linguistic and cultural hybridity</field><field name="creator">Radojkovich, Leanne</field><field name="description">The objective of this exegesis is to show how linguistic and cultural hybridity create a unique prose style, and how my stories sit within that style.

Taiwanese Mandarin is significantly influenced by the Tai-yu dialect, and in order to carry out the translation of Taiwanese Mandarin, it is important to deal with the functions of the dialect and related culture-specific items (CSIs). Therefore, the researcher of this thesis has investigated whether the translator of Cape No. 7 successfully applied a variety of translation strategies and prioritized the translation criteria well, to enable the target audience to receive the same message of the film as the source audience, especially when subtitling is constrained by time and space. There are two research areas which have been examined: slang and humour. The data analysis of slang scenes included Tai-yu slang and swearing, while humorous scenes were divided into three areas: puns, irony and metaphor. The research data have been analysed by means of analysis diagrams, which were trialled in a pilot study, described in Chapter Three. The pilot study lead to a new categorization based on previous researchers&#8217; taxonomies (Aixel&#225;, 1996; Davies, 2003; Tveit and Fong 2005, as cited in Yang, 2006), and this was applied to the analysis diagrams. According to the findings from the analysis chapters (Chapter Four &amp; Five), the translator of Cape No. 7 preferred to use mostly the paraphrasing strategy in translating Tai-yu slang and humour, and the synonymy strategy in conveying swearing. In addition, the translator often strengthened swear words rather than toning them down in the English subtitles. However, when subtitling humorous scenes, the translator preferred to incorporate two strategies to deal with the cultural barriers when conveying the humorous effect. The compensation strategy was not used often in slang translation. In regard to the translation criteria, pragmatics and accuracy appeared to have been deemed more important by the translator than other criteria. Surprisingly functional equivalence did not seem to have been the translator&#8217;s first priority, as suggested by earlier research. Overall, this research study appeared to show that the translator of Cape No. 7 considered the paraphrase strategy to be the most efficient strategy for maintaining CSIs, and that pragmatics and accuracy were the translator&#8217;s most important criteria, which differs from the findings of previous research studies.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Translation</field><field name="subject">Slang</field><field name="subject">Subtitling</field><field name="subject">Taiwanese Mandarin</field><field name="subject">English subtitles</field><field name="subject">Humour</field><field name="subject">Tai-yu slang</field><field name="subject">Swearing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toi Maramatanga</field><field name="creator">Te Kanawa, Kahutoi Mere</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is to visually show the significance and relationship between the use of natural materials, and geometric patterns used in M&#257;ori weaving.

These patterns are significant to the M&#257;ori worldview of kaitiakitanga (stewardship of knowledge), which is cognisant in the ontology of M&#257;ori weaving. These patterns are significant forms of M&#257;ori cultural symbols that reflect elements of nature, evolution of time and space. The focus is to show how natural materials can be utilised in an art form that embraces bicultural activity, as a reference to customary and new age methods of thinking and practice. This leads to self-enquiry and our own responsibilities, only to ask ourselves; What are the guiding principles within art and design, that upholds the core values of M&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori? (M&#257;ori epistemological thinking). The concept of this thesis is to define the cultural significance of kaitiakitanga (stewardship), through the preservation of M&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori and practice as weavers and artists. This concept challenges our own understanding of what we know and what we don&#8217;t know about the relationships between people, place, environment and use. The methods and processes used for this work will be based on customary practices and methods, using native materials, endemic to New Zealand. These materials will be harvested at different time periods. The methodologies used in this project, is a product of intrinsic knowledge and testing new boundaries, through researching more specific detail about varieties of harakeke (New Zealand flax) cultivars, testing the flexibility, functionality and durability of materials. This will challenge the test, of making sure that the methods used will be significantly practiced throughout the processes involved in the making of artistic pieces of work, in accordance to tikanga (protocols). The use of native materials enhances cultural values of kaitiakitanga as a metaphor, which asserts sustainability of M&#257;ori epistemological notions of practice and meaning.This also applies to the visual language of M&#257;ori. The concept of visual language embraces metaphoric meanings and understanding, which relates to our co-existence with the earth, animals and the elements. All these elements of nature are contained within symbolic traditional patterns. Some of these patterns have derived from phenomena of thought structure, historical events and our co-existence through our connectedness to the land, waters, oceans, sky and universe. How can M&#257;ori forms of art be embraced and imbued, in modern society, that signifies place, belonging and cultural enhancement?</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual Maori art in weaving</field><field name="subject">Expression of meaning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/883</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hiding in a hollow tree</field><field name="creator">Kenobi, Ben Tuhoe</field><field name="description">Starting with a broad analysis of game story-telling methods, this project seeks to interrogate a player&#8217;s occupation and navigation of the possibility space of a game&#8217;s meta-narrative and isolate &#8216;story-telling&#8217; techniques specific and inherent to the computer-game medium.

Strategies that have been implicated in reducing either the magnitude of vertical ground reaction force (vertical GRF) or the time taken to reach the maximum vertical GRF in the stepping leg were explored. Study Design: The study was an experimental, laboratory based, repeated measures design. Participants: Twenty participants took part in this exploratory study. Ten in the older group of 60-80 years, mean 65.3 (SD 5) years and ten in the younger age group of 20-30 years, mean 22.8 (SD 2.5) years. Main Measures: The vertical GRF and the time taken to reach maximum vertical GRF were measured to ascertain impact during step descent. Electromyography and kinematic variables were measured to determine the effect they may have on the impact. The variables measured were the maximum joint range of motion of the hip and knee during early stance in step descent. Surface electromyography from four lower limb muscles was recorded to ascertain the magnitude of muscle activity at impact. The relationship in an antero-posterior direction of the upper body and stepping leg at initial contact (IC) was also investigated. Results: There was a significant difference in both the amount of knee flexion and the amount of activity of the vastus lateralis muscle during impact between older and younger adults. Older adults had significantly less knee flexion during a step descent activity than younger adults (F(1,18)=5.48; p=.031).Older adults had significantly more vastus lateralis activity during a step descent activity than younger adults (F(1,18)=5.21; p=.035). Conclusions: Older and younger adults use different strategies in both muscle activation and joint range of motion around the knee of the leading leg during the step descent. Older adults used more vastus lateralis activity perhaps to increase stiffness in the knee, leading to a reduction in range of motion at impact. Although no change in vertical GRF was detected in this study, both of these strategies have the potential to increase the impact of a step and therefore cause jarring and possible damage. This study recruited healthy active older adults and differences in impact may be observed in an older or less active population, or in those with joint pathology such as osteoarthritis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Step descent</field><field name="subject">Vertical ground reaction force</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/887</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Manumalo:a study of factors which facilitate success for New Zealand - born Samoan students at university</field><field name="creator">Penn, Rosemarie</field><field name="description">This thesis is about factors which aid and hinder successful completions for New Zealand-born Samoans. The thesis explores the proposition that educational marginalisation of minority students will be perpetuated until AUT adopts policies and procedures which enable culturally responsive educational pedagogies and practices which honour indigenous minorities. The thesis asked New Zealand-born Samoan students, what is the nature of their aiga (family) and cultural support frameworks (structures), and, further, to what extent and how and why do these students engage with such networks (processes)? This study used a qualitative approach within which six New Zealand-born Samoan students were interviewed using a semi-structured approach to gathering data. The interview data were transcribed and a thematic analysis was manually completed both within and across the six cases. The turnaround time in gaining ethics approval impacted upon the capacity of the investigator to conduct this research in what she considered to be a culturally appropriate manner and the cautious vigilance of the final ethics committee approval was perceived as a barrier to making culturally appropriate contact. It was discovered that Samoan structures, especially family, are paramount in supporting educational success because of the Fa&#8217;a Samoa processes which they engender. A further discovery was that New Zealand-born Samoans retain cultural affiliations so their lifestyle shows deep regard for Fa&#8217;a Samoa identity. Through these affiliations, meaningful life metaphors become applied. It was concluded that transforming staff so that they understand Pasifika peoples is crucial to growing Pasifika educational success. Staff development must, therefore, be planned so that meaningful understandings of Pasifika concepts and frameworks become nurtured and that is a challenge which AUT must embrace and action.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand-born Samoan</field><field name="subject">Tertiary education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative of subtitling strategies: culture specific items in the series Friends</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Han</field><field name="description">The dissertation is based on the analysis of thirty episodes of the American television series Friends with the focus on the CSIs (Culture Specific Items) and how these differences have been handled by Chinese translators who produced the subtitles for the English-Chinese translation. The analysis was based on the assumption that Mainland China&#8217;s culture is different from the US culture so people in these two countries may have problems in understanding CSIs if they are translated literally and if the subtitle translation is not adapted to the target audience. Such adaptation is normally known as localisation. The cultural differences that are ingrained in CSIs might have to be handled with caution in the production of subtitles. The main objective of the dissertation has been to analyse different translation choices which are currently used by the translators in questions, dealing with CSIs where cultural differences between mainland China and the US arise. The research discovered that repetition of CSIs is a strategy which underperformed, failing to help the Chinese audience to comprehend the cultural connotations associated with the CSIs. The paper has provided some recommendations as to how the subtitle translation of such CSIs might be handled in such a way that the audience will have a better understanding of the same.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Subtitling strategies</field><field name="subject">Culture specific items</field><field name="subject">TV series</field><field name="subject">Friends</field><field name="subject">Politeness</field><field name="subject">Face</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The automatic eye alignment of an infrared optometer</field><field name="creator">Taylor, David Glenville</field><field name="description">The ability of the human eye to change its overall refractive power so that people can focus on objects both far and near is termed accommodation. Research into how the eye automatically changes its accommodation, demands an instrument capable of tracking the accommodation with fine resolution and adequate corner frequency. An instrument capable of tracking the ocular accommodation is called an optometer. Reports of earlier optometers show that optometers using the older Scheiner principlecan have the required precision and dynamics required to track the micro fluctuations accommodation. However optometers using the Scheiner principle require precise alignment to the patient&#8217;s pupil to be maintained throughout the measurement time. Previous optometers have used the radiation reflected from the patient&#8217;s cornea (calledthe corneal reflection) to initially align the optical axis of the optometer to the centre of the patient&#8217;s pupil. Since the Scheiner principle optometer uses radiant energy reflected from the patient&#8217;s retina to make a refractive measurement, the idea of using this same radiant energy for patient alignment is investigated. Earlier optometers have blocked the corneal reflection from reaching the photodetectors for the retinal reflection using a small fixed light stop. Since it is not possible to use a fixed light stop if the retinal reflection is used for alignment, the feasibility of using crossed linear polarizers is experimentally evaluated. The results showed that about78% of the radiant energy reflected from the front lens of an artificial eye could be eliminated using crossed linear polarizers. Whether the Scheiner principle measurement of refraction of an artificial eye could be done with 78% of the front lens (corneal) reflection removed was investigated. The results were not conclusive. There was not a measureable indication of when the refraction of the experimental optometer matched that of the artificial eye. The experimental optometer system attempts to use a servo controlled mirror system to move the optical axis of the optometer so that it coincides with the optical axis of an artificial eye. The design, development and testing of the mirror system is described. The mirror system enables the optometer to perform a two dimensional scan over the pupil plane of the patient&#8217;s eye or an artificial eye. During the scanning, the total radiant power reflected can be measured. For the optometer to be aligned using radiation reflected from the retina, a scan of the pupil plane of should reveal the pupil boundaries. This was experimentally demonstrated to work. Unfortunately time limitations did not permit further development of an automatic eye alignment and tracking system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optometer</field><field name="subject">Infrared</field><field name="subject">Alignment</field><field name="subject">Eye tracking</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Package design for children: do practitioners get it right?</field><field name="creator">Chareonsakdi, Thidarat</field><field name="description">The literature indicates that children are highly influenced by product packaging and that it is the packaging that will make the product stand out from the crowd and hopefully making a sale. There have been a number of valuable studies offering practitioners principles and guidelines on how to enhance package design for products that target children; however the extent to which practitioners adhere to the principles proposed by academics has had limited attention. This study is therefore aimed at examining the degree to which practitioners implement current knowledge relating to the principles of package design in the context of packages designed to attract children, while simultaneously assessing the relationship between package design and brand performance. An extensive secondary research of the literature has been made to establish a list of criterion for package design for children elements assessment. At the same time, attempts have been made to gather brand performance data. Product samples have been collected from major supermarkets in New Zealand and then analysed against the criterion using the principle of content analysis. The result generated by this study shows that practitioners are mostly adhering to the principles of children&#8217;s package design established by academic research.

Despite the large number of studies which have examined the effects of recasts, mixed views exist as to their usefulness as a corrective feedback technique. The present study has continued the investigation into whether their frequent use is justified and also if learners actually perceive recasts as being corrective in nature. The focus of this study is to explore developmental effects, both immediately following and delayed, of recasts while considering these two key aspects. The primary aim is to explore delayed benefits of recasts while the secondary aim is to investigate whether or not these learners perceived the feedback as a correct version of their incorrect question form. The study involved 34 English as a second language (ESL) learners from various first language (L1) backgrounds who were enrolled in a general English programme, at an Auckland language school. The participants completed demographic questionnaires and took part in task-based interaction sessions, with the members of the experimental group receiving input containing intensive recasts. The proportion and types of questions produced in the immediate and two delayed post-tests were compared and analysed to consider whether exposure to recasts was beneficial. The main findings suggest that for more advanced question types, interaction with intensive recasts may be more effective than interaction alone, for delayed L2 development, despite only weak support in the literature. On the other hand, similar positive effects on immediate question production are not strongly evident. Therefore, the results in this study add support to the claim that recasts may be beneficial for delayed second language acquisition (SLA), when the linguistic target is questions, even when these recasts do not seem effective immediately following exposure. Furthermore, awareness of negative evidence was indicated, which may have contributed, in part, to the positive delayed findings. Finally, these results suggest that recasts can be an effective pedagogical tool in the communicative L2 classroom when providing linguistic feedback in a way that does not unduly disrupt the flow of the interactive task. Practical suggestions for future research were also identified.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recasts</field><field name="subject">L2 question development</field><field name="subject">Implicit negative feedback</field><field name="subject">Delayed posttests</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">City centered cycling</field><field name="creator">Reilly, Lyle</field><field name="description">This project explores design considerations and processes involved in the development of sports performance clothing specifically aimed at city cycling commuters.

The ability of events to attract people to a destination for the purpose of attending the event is well documented. However the ability of an event to add value to attract tourists before or after the event is not so clear. In other words, can an events portfolio positively influence the decision to visit a destination at a time when none of the promoted events are scheduled? As a first step towards answering this important question, this study explores the contribution of an events portfolio to a consumer&#8217;s perceptions of a destination and how this influences their decision to attend a destination under these circumstances. The proposed study conducts a protocol analysis based on consumer&#8217;s decision-making thoughts. Each participant was given a choice between two destinations in India. Participants were asked to &#8216;think out loud&#8217; as they made the decision to visit one of two possible destinations, one with an events portfolio and the other without. However, their visit does not coincide with the events&#8217; dates. The results suggest four lines of reasoning utilised by prospective tourists in the destination choice process: 1) destination image; 2) the timing of the event with respect the time of visit; 3) tourists&#8217; level of interest in the event; and, 4) events not listed in the events portfolio might be scheduled during the time of the proposed visit. In course of finding lines of reasoning for cross-cultural issues it was found that culture, architecture, English language usage, and food are the major aspects that tourists consider while travelling to Indian destinations. In terms of the events portfolio, there is evidence of a preference for a &#8216;fit&#8217; between the event and Indian culture.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Event tourism</field><field name="subject">Protocol analysis</field><field name="subject">Destination image</field><field name="subject">Verbal protocol</field><field name="subject">Destination brand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/897</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of non-indigenous benthic macrofauna in the diet of snapper (Pagrus auratus)</field><field name="creator">Dodd, Suzannah</field><field name="description">Snapper, Pagrus auratus is a valuable coastal fish species in New Zealand and forms an important commercial and recreational fishing industry in the north-east of New Zealand. Previous studies revealed evidence that this carnivorous, primarily benthic feeder consumes a non-indigenous macrobenthic species. Many non-indigenous macrobenthic species have now become established in New Zealand waters. For example, in Rangitoto Channel, Hauraki Gulf, non-indigenous macrobenthic species are prolific, with three bivalve species in particular having thriving populations: Limaria orientalis, Musculista senhousia, and Theora lubrica. The role of these species in the diet of snapper, however, is unknown. To assess the availability of indigenous and non-indigenous prey species to snapper, benthic macrofaunal assemblages throughout Rangitoto Channel were surveyed. To do so, sediment samples were collected at 84 sites. At 24 of these sites sediment was also collected for grain size analysis and at 40 of these sites the seafloor was surveyed with video. To investigate the diet of snapper, fish were collected from four monitoring sites within the channel. Bimonthly monitoring of the diet of snapper as well as the benthic macrofauna was completed at these monitoring sites and trends in the abundance of three prey species, two of which were non-indigenous species, within the sediment and the diet of snapper were compared from June to December 2008. A detailed description of the benthic macrofaunal assemblages throughout Rangitoto Channel confirmed that three non-indigenous species are established throughout this area. The analyses revealed that the diet of snapper has shifted compared to previous studies. Snapper now consume large quantities of two non-indigenous species, M. senhousia and L. orientalis. Consumption of the former species apparently results from its dominance and biomass within the sediment. It is therefore not surprising that snapper consumed large amounts of this species. In contrast, L. orientalis occurred disproportionately in the diet of snapper compared to its abundance within the sediment. I suggest that the establishment of some non-indigenous species benefits snapper.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Snapper</field><field name="subject">Invasive</field><field name="subject">Diet</field><field name="subject">Hauraki</field><field name="subject">Pagrus auratus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/898</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Informative correlation extraction from and for Forex market analysis</field><field name="creator">Lei, Song</field><field name="description">The forex market is a complex, evolving, and a non-linear dynamical system, and its forecast is difficult due to high data intensity, noise/outliers, unstructured data and high degree of uncertainty. However, the exchange rate of a currency is often found surprisingly similar to the history or the variation of an alternative currency, which implies that correlation knowledge is valuable for forex market trend analysis. In this research, we propose a computational correlation analysis for the intelligent correlation extraction from all available economic data. The proposed correlation is a synthesis of channel and weighted Pearson's correlation, where the channel correlation traces the trend similarity of time series, and the weighted Pearson's correlation filters noise in correlation extraction. In the forex market analysis, we consider 3 particular aspects of correlation knowledge: (1) historical correlation, correlation to previous market data; (2) cross-currency correlation, correlation to relevant currencies, and (3) macro correlation, correlation to macroeconomic variables. While evaluating the validity of extracted correlation knowledge, we conduct a comparison of Support Vector Regression (SVR) against the correlation aided SVR (cSVR) for forex time series prediction, where correlation in addition to the observed forex time series data is used for the training of SVR. The experiments are carried out on 5 futures contracts (NZD/AUD, NZD/EUD, NZD/GBP, NZD/JPY and NZD/USD) within the period from January 2007 to December 2008. The comparison results show that the proposed correlation is computationally significant for forex market analysis in that the cSVR is performing consistently better than purely SVR on all 5 contracts exchange rate prediction, in terms of error functions MSE, RMSE, NMSE, MAE and MAPE. However, the cSVR prediction is found occasionally differing significantly from the actual price, which suggests that despite the significance of the proposed correlation, how to use correlation knowledge for market trend analysis remains a very challenging difficulty that prevents in practice further understanding of the forex market. In addition, the selection of macroeconomic factors and the determination of time period for analysis are two computationally essential points worth addressing further for future forex market correlation analysis.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Correlation extraction</field><field name="subject">Forex market analysis</field><field name="subject">SVM regression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a clinical Multiple-Lunge test to predict falls in older adults</field><field name="creator">Wagenaar, Ruth</field><field name="description">Background: The incidence of falls and severity of fall related injuries steadily increase with age. As well as physical injury, falls can lead to adverse psychological and social consequences, which can further reduce older adults&#8217; quality of life. The most commonly reported cause of falls in older persons is tripping over an obstacle, which may reflect the difficulty many older adults have in making an appropriate stepping response. In order to reduce the number of falls experienced by older adults, individuals at high risk of falling need to be identified so that targeted interventions can be implemented. Aims: This series of studies aimed to develop a new Multiple-Lunge test to distinguish between Fallers and Non-fallers in independent older adults, aged 65 years and over. The studies sought to determine the test-retest reliability of the Multiple-Lunge test; as well its validity to predict faller status in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods: One hundred and thirty community-dwelling older adults, aged 65 &#8211; 93 years (mean age 77 &#177; 7 years) with (n = 40) and without (n = 90) a history of falls were administered the Multiple-Lunge test. For the purpose of this study, a Faller was classified as an older adult with a history of one fall, or a Multiple-faller if there was a history of two or more falls in the previous 12 months. The Multiple-Lunge test required the individual to lunge forward to a step length determined as 60% of their leg length, and return to start position, for a total of five repetitions. Two trials were performed after a familiarisation trial. The number of correct steps and the total time for the five steps were recorded for each trial. The highest number of correct steps and the lowest total time of the two trials were used for data analysis. Test-retest reliability of the Multiple-Lunge test was established across two testing occasions from a sub-sample of the validity study (n = 14, mean age 79 &#177; 6 years). A cross-sectional design was used to establish the sensitivity and specificity of the Multiple-Lunge test to predict faller status based on retrospective self-reported fall history. Initial analysis using the number of correct steps and total time, was followed by a linear regression analysis to determine the validity of the test to predict falls. Results: The Multiple-Lunge test was found to be reliable across trials (ICC = 0.79 for number of correct steps; ICC = 0.86 for total time). The change in the mean for steps was small and similar across four trials (-0.43 steps, -0.36 steps, -0.50 steps). The change in the mean for time showed a gradual decrease in time scores across trials (-0.69 seconds, -0.73 seconds, -0.93 seconds). Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated as 73% and 63% for predicting Multiple-fallers using the measure of all five steps done correctly. Linear regression analysis did not indicate that the Multiple-Lunge test could be used to predict faller status for either of the step predictor variables (0/5 steps or 5/5 steps). However, a very high sensitivity value (98%) was observed for the variable of both steps and time in predicting Fallers. Also a very high specificity value (99%) was recorded for the variable of time to predict Multiple-fallers. Conclusions: The Multiple-Lunge test is an easily administered test for independent older adults. Due to the challenging nature of the test it may be well suited to detect subtle differences in abilities of higher functioning older adults. The test mimics the movements needed in response to a trip, the most common cause of falls in older adults. This test is a reliable and reasonably valid measure of falls risk. A practitioner can be confident in 7 out of 10 cases that an older adult who cannot complete all five steps of the Multiple-Lunge test is at high risk of falls. The results of this thesis suggest that there is potential for the Multiple-Lunge test to be used in clinical practice and fall prevention research. However, additional research on how to further increase its validity and/or to determine the most appropriate populations with which to administer this test appears warranted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Older adult</field><field name="subject">Test</field><field name="subject">Fall prediction</field><field name="subject">Physical</field><field name="subject">Gerontology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Le grand voyage</field><field name="creator">Garet, Catherine Annie France</field><field name="description">For most writers who deal with displacement, rewriting themselves, articulating and communicating their sense of estrangment is their lifetime work. For displacement forces one to leave behind the familiar and embrace the unknown. In this process of deconstruction, the concepts of home, belonging and identity are renegotiated and questioned constantly. Le Grand Voyage &#8211; the working title for the draft of a novel that is presented in conjunction with this exegesis &#8211; is a fictional work that is produced out of the implications of displacement, which inscribes itself in a series of explorations I started in 2001, cumulating with two video works Frammento in 2003 and Footnotes in 2004. Le Grand Voyage investigates further the concept of home by questioning the home/mother relationship. The exegesis aims to contextualise the making of Le Grand Voyage by using another woman&#8217;s narrative as the main point of reference: Linda Olsson&#8217;s Let Me Sing You Gentle Songs (2005). Olsson&#8217;s work &#8211; like mine &#8211; is conceived out of the effects of displacement, and the literary form and structure display symptoms that are characteristics to narratives of displacement. By putting the home/mother/daughter in context, the narrative displays home as a patriarchal construct showing how the idealisation of home/place is predicated on a gendering of home, whereby, as McDermott notes, &#8216;home is constructed as a maternal, static and past, to which the (male) subjects longs to return&#8217; (2003: 265). The narrative&#8217;s point of view is that of daughters but also that of mothers as daughters, and enables not only a feminist discussion of the notion of home but also of motherhood. Therefore, the theoretical approach for this work has encompassed feminists&#8217; writings that have particularly focused their research on space, place and gender. In challenging the dominant form of gender constructions and relations, the first and second wave feminism have empowered many women to leave home in order to shape their own version of identity. I believe it is within the perspective of displacement, of being out of place, that many women continue to find the necessary distance to contest a particular reading of woman and home that still prevails in academic literature and fiction. Thus, an important part of this exegesis concentrates on the critic of home. I want to argue in a feminist way that our ideas of home and belonging still reflect gendered assumptions and are therefore contestable. That displacement as a catalyst for loss, emotional grief and mourning becomes an enabling way for women to rethink home in terms of what was at play rather than in place and to do the &#8216;memory work&#8217; that feminists ask women to do: to remember in order not to forget because &#8216;forgetting is a major obstacle to change&#8217; (Greene, 1991: 298). Their attacks on the feminisation of place have opened up for me possibilities to think of home outside the parameters of sameness. They have also enabled me to understand the paradoxical position a displaced person is faced with: if displacement is favored and privileged why then do longings for home still persist for some? &#8211; a fact that is well illustrated in the actual resurgence of the preoccupation to belong. The gain in displacement also involves the fact that distance forces one to look at the longing and nostalgia for what they really conceal. In the case of a woman and, motherless daughters, distance, as this exegesis demonstrates, enables the writer to unveil the longings as subversive and fraudulent, tricking women into thinking there was nothing better than the past: home sweet home, the safe, bounded nest where women could be women: could be the mother. With the &#8216;memory work&#8217; they both learn to think away from the parameters of sameness and the past, outside the nostalgic stances of singularity, safety, boundaries and internalised histories, therefore outside of the maternal, the home/mother relationship. &#8216;What is home?&#8217; is a difficult question to negotiate for a woman. The exegesis and the first draft of the novel show what is at stake when one asks the question and the responsibility of women when writing about home.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Concept of home</field><field name="subject">Narrative of displacement</field><field name="subject">Feminist perspective</field><field name="subject">Mother/daughter relationship</field><field name="subject">First draft novel</field><field name="subject">Linda Olsson&#8217;s "Let me sing you gentle songs" (2005)</field><field name="subject">Feminisation of place</field><field name="subject">Nostalgia</field><field name="subject">Gender construction</field><field name="subject">Home/mother relationship</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Longings</field><field name="subject">Gendering of home</field><field name="subject">Literary structure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bewitched between borders, boundaries and building bridges /</field><field name="creator">Golda, Angieszka</field><field name="description">The conceptual space formed by the experience of being in-between cultures is a fluid one.

Some of the topics of debate include training, social, professional, economic and political issues. Comparatively, there has been little discussion of limited prescription privileges for clinical psychologists in Australia.

It is caused by chemotherapy, radiotherapy and combination therapy and affects a large proportion of patients. Despite its prevalence, an effective anti - mucositis agent has yet to be developed that protects the whole tube, although the use of keratinocyte growth factor ( Amgen ' s Palifermin ) has recently been approved for the prevention of oral mucositis. It is important to understand mechanisms controlling mucositis so that treatment can be targeted appropriately. This thesis has investigated some of the key components identified as being involved in mucositis as well as identifying new genes which contribute to chemotherapy - induced intestinal injury. The research chapters investigated : 1 ) Gene expression of the apoptosis - regulating Bcl - 2 family, p53 and caspase - 3, and the changes which occur in the intestine following chemotherapy treatment for cancer. 2 ) The effect of different chemotherapeutic agents on intestinal cells in vitro and the role p53 plays. 3 ) The mucositis caused by single dose irinotecan in the rat with breast cancer and the role of p53 in induction of intestinal damage. 4 ) The early gene changes that occur in the small intestine of the rat with breast cancer following irinotecan treatment. Firstly, to investigate the difference in susceptibility to damage between the small and large intestine, the protein expression of 8 members of the Bcl - 2 family ( 4 pro - apoptotic ; Bax, Bak, Bid, Bim and 4 anti - apoptotic ; Bcl - 2, Bcl - xL, Bcl - w, Mcl - 1 ) was quantified in jejunal and colonic sections taken from rats inoculated with breast cancer. It was found that there was significantly higher expression of the pro - apoptotic proteins, Bax, Bak, Bim and Bid, in the crypts of the jejunum compared to the colon. Furthermore, expression of the anti - apoptotic proteins, Bcl - 2, Bcl - xL and Bcl - w, was significantly lower in jejunal crypts compared to colonic crypts. Mcl - 1 expression was similar in both regions. Thus, the small intestine is an environment balanced to favour apoptosis through specific Bcl - 2 family protein expression profiles. The Bcl - 2 family regulates apoptosis in response to a variety of chemotherapy agents. However, it is unknown how Bcl - 2 family gene expression changes along with other apoptogenic factors following cytotoxic therapy in the normal intestine. To investigate this, sections of rat jejunum treated with methotrexate and duodenal biopsies from chemotherapy patients treated with various regimens for cancer were subjected to quantitative immunohistochemistry to detect Bcl - 2 family proteins, p53 and caspase - 3. Treatment caused expression of p53 and caspase - 3 to increase within the crypts and follow a similar pattern to apoptosis levels. Pro - apoptotic Bcl - 2 family members, Bax and Bak, were increased, while the anti - apoptotic protein, Mcl - 1, was significantly reduced. A significant increase in mRNA expression for Bax and Bak was noticed at 6 h, without a concurrent decrease in Mcl - 1. Thus, Bcl - 2 family genes were altered in the small intestine in both humans and rats, and this was irrespective of chemotherapy agent or regimen used. The best characterised changes which occur during chemotherapy - induced damage in the intestine are in the epithelial layer, although it is thought that pan #45 mucosal alterations are involved. Two intestinal cell lines were chosen to investigate changes in apoptosis, proliferation and protein expression following cytotoxic treatment with various chemotherapeutic agents. These were the rat IEC - 6 and human FHs 74 cell lines, which represent untransformed epithelial cells. The human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF - 7, was also used as a positive control. Intestinal cells were resistant to the occurrence of methotrexate toxicities within 24 h of treatment, modestly affected by irinotecan and extremely sensitive to doxorubicin. Doxorubicin caused a marked increase in p53 and p21 expression, which for irinotecan was less pronounced. The effect of cytotoxic treatment on Bcl - 2 family expression in intestinal cells varied, however the pro - apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, were generally upregulated following doxorubicin. Temporary inhibition of p53 using pifithrin alpha resulted in a significant improvement in cell survival in cancerous cell only and did not alter Bcl - 2 family expression. It was concluded that cultured epithelial cells exhibit varying sensitivities to different chemotherapeutic agents which is dependent on induction of p53 gene expression. The topoisomerase I inhibitor, irinotecan, is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. It often induces severe mucositis with the most common symptom being diarrhoea. Previous research has shown that irinotecan damages the small and large bowel equally, which is unusual. This is characterised by an increase in apoptosis and a reduction in proliferation within epithelial crypts, an increase in inflammatory cell infiltrate in the lamina propria and excess mucin production. These investigations used two sequential doses of irinotecan. The early effect of a single dose of irinotecan on the intestine have yet to be studied. Thus the primary aim of this experiment was to examine in detail the changes caused by irinotecan at 6 and 48 h in the rat. A secondary aim was to investigate the role of p53 on induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest within intestinal crypts and the effect of temporary inhibition of the protein. Single dose irinotecan caused a decrease in body and small intestinal weight by 48 h after treatment. This was accompanied by crypt and villous degeneration, increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation within crypt epithelium as well as inflammatory infiltrate throughout lamina propria. An increase in Bax expression was seen at 6 h, however p53 protein levels remained relatively low until 48 h. Rats also treated with pifithrin alpha to inhibit p53 and had a significantly lower peak in apoptosis in the colon at 6 h, however did not show improvements in any other parameters tested. It was concluded that irinotecaninduced damage in the rat intestine is primarily p53 - independent, and that pifithrin alpha acts to inhibit apoptosis in the large intestine via a p53 - independent pathway. A study was designed to investigate the early genome - wide changes which occur following irinotecan treatment in the rat small intestine. Microarray analysis found that regulation of many genes was altered at 6 h following dual dose irinotecan. These genes were involved in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, immune function, calcium homeostasis and protein turnover. Multiple genes from the MAP kinase pathway were also activated by irinotecan. The cystine protease, caspase - 1 was upregulated and was chosen for further investigations due to its role in apoptosis and inflammation. Real time PCR analysis confirmed the increase in gene expression at 6 h and also showed a return to baseline levels by 24 h which was followed by another modest increase at 48 h. It was concluded that irinotecan induces a wide range of gene changes within the intestine and that apoptosis and inflammatory damage pathways are activated during treatment. This thesis described key molecules in apoptosis and their role in induction of chemotherapy - induced intestinal mucositis. It has provided evidence of the importance of apoptosis in mucosal injury and also highlighted areas requiring further research. Results presented herein show that the Bcl - 2 family is involved in intestinal damage following many chemotherapy agents, whereas p53 is agent - specific. It has also shown that irinotecan causes intestinal damage via a mainly p53 - independent manner in the rat. It can be concluded that gastrointestinal mucositis is complex and activates multiple pathways to induce damage. Findings from this thesis will aid targeting of new anti - mucotoxic agents.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer chemotherapy complications, gastrointestinal mucosa diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsibility, compensation and accident law reform.</field><field name="creator">Vincent, Nicole A.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers two allegations which conservatives often level at no-fault systems &#8212; namely, that responsibility is abnegated under no-fault systems, and that no-fault systems under- and over-compensate.

In particular, the thesis begins with development of a technique using ultrasonic backscatter analyses to quantitate the early stages of aortic stenosis. Subsequent chapters utilized this methodology to quantitate aortic valve structural changes in a model and intervention study of aortic stenosis in rabbits. The last chapters are human studies designed to identify factors associated with presence of aortic sclerosis/stenosis; with particular interest in potential association of endothelial dysfunction/inflammation/platelet aggregation with abnormal aortic valve structure quantitated by ultrasonic backscatter. In Chapter 1 (Introduction) the relevant literature is reviewed. Development of ultrasonic backscatter to quantitate aortic sclerosis (Chapter 2) Aortic valve sclerosis (ASc) is detected when there is visual assessment of focal increases in echogenicity of the aortic valve most commonly assessed by echocardiography. However, there is no previously described method to quantitate degree of aortic valve structural abnormality as ASc is not associated with marked hemodynamic obstruction quantifiable by Doppler echocardiography. The current study used ultrasonic backscatter to quantitate aortic valve structural abnormality in patients assessed as having ASc based on valve appearances, compared to young healthy volunteers with normal aortic valves. The results of the study indicate: 1) that the mean levels of aortic valve backscatter in ASc patients are approximately 60% greater than in young healthy volunteers (ie aortic valve backscatter scores &#8805; 16dB are not consistent with normal aortic valve structure), 2) ultrasonic backscatter scores in ASc patients are directly correlated with subjective scoring of sclerosis and with a positive trend with transvalvular pressure gradients in patients with mild-moderate aortic stenosis, and most importantly, 3) ultrasonic backscatter is a reproducible technique, with mean differences between estimates based on repeat echocardiograms of 2.3 &#177; 1.7 (9.1%). These results indicate that ultrasonic backscatter could be used as a quantitative measure of aortic valve structural abnormality in epidemiology and for examination of interventions. In vivo studies Development of an animal model of aortic stenosis with vitamin D2 (Chapter 3) The aim of the study was to develop an appropriate animal model for AS. The study used vitamin D2 alone at 25,000IU/4 days weekly (vit-D2) for 8 weeks to induce AS in rabbits. Results showed that: 1) rabbits in the vit-D2 group had significantly increased in transvalvular velocity and pressure gradients compared to rabbits in the control group (normal chow + drinking water); this was consistent for aortic valve ultrasonic backscatter scores; 2) aortic valve immunohistochemistry/histology showed marked calcification, neutral lipids, macrophage, and leukocyte infiltrations for rabbits in the vit- D2 group (ie consistent with histology of human AS); 3) significant elevation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations in the vit-D2 group occurred compared to controls over the 8 weeks treatment period; the change in ADMA concentrations correlated significantly with the change in transvalvular pressure gradients for rabbits in the vit-D2 group; 4) rabbits in the vit-D2 group had significantly impaired endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation, and this effect was completely abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME); 5) the addition of 0.5% cholesterol-supplemented diet to the vitamin D2 regimen did not accentuate the development of AS. Thus, treatment with vitamin D2 at 25,000IU/4 days weekly for 8 weeks significantly induced AS with similar aortic valve pathology to that of human AS; therefore, the model is suitable for use in examining potential therapeutic interventions in AS. Effects of ramipril on development of AS in rabbits (Chapter 4) Using this animal model, this study aimed to examine the effects of the angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) ramipril on development of AS. Rabbits (n=28) treated for 8 weeks were divided into 2 groups: (a) vitamin D2 alone (n=10) (normal chow + 25,000IU vitamin D2 in drinking water); (b) vitamin D2/Ramipril (n=12) (normal chow+25,000IU vitamin D2/Ramipril (0.5mg/kg) in drinking water). Six further rabbits constituted a normal reference group (no treatment was given). The results for comparisons between vitamin D2/ramipril vs vitamin D2 alone were as follows: 1) ramipril-treated rabbits had significantly less severe hemodynamic obstructions (p&lt;0.05, for both) as assessed by transvalvular velocity, and aortic valve area; with borderline reduction in aortic valve backscatter (p=0.08); 2) ramipril significantly reduced plasma ADMA concentrations; 3) there was improvement in acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation (p=0.056), with significant improvement in sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation (p&lt;0.05); 4) there was a strong inverse correlation between acetylcholineinduced aortic relaxation and aortic valve backscatter score (0&lt;0.001), thus providing further evidence of the potential role of nitric oxide in retarding the development of AS in this model. These data provide a strong rationale for the inception of a randomized trial of ACE inhibition as a strategy for limitation of AS progression in humans. Human studies Aortic stenosis is associated with elevated plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations in humans (Chapter 5). Given the findings that aortic stenosis induced by vitamin D2 in rabbits also caused elevation of plasma ADMA concentrations, a physiological inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, a mediator and marker of endothelial dysfunction and an indicator of incremental cardiovascular risk. The study sought to determine whether plasma ADMA concentrations are elevated independently of pre-existing coronary risk factors in subjects with at least moderate aortic stenosis (n=42) compared to age-matched patients with normal aortic valves (n=42): as determined both by visual assessment and with aortic valve backscatter scores &lt; 16dB. Results for this study were as follows: 1) plasma ADMA concentrations were not statistically different between the AS and non-AS group (median 0.59 vs 0.54 &#181;mol/L, p=0.13, Mann-Whitney test) on univariate analysis; 2) backward stepwise multiple linear regression showed the presence of AS was a significant predictor of elevated ADMA concentrations (p=0.04, 95% CI =0.001, 0.072). 3) in addition, elevated plasma ADMA concentrations were also associated with history of atrial fibrillation (p=0.009, 95% CI=0.015, 0.100), and negatively associated with creatinine clearance (p=0.01, 95% CI=-0.002, 0.000), and the use of statin therapy (p=0.01, 95% CI=-0.081, -0.011). Therefore, in conclusion, this study found that AS is independently associated with elevation of ADMA concentrations, beyond that implied by &#8220;conventional&#8221; risk factors for endothelial dysfunction. The clinical status of AS as an incremental marker of cardiovascular risk may reflect ADMA-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Assessment of factors associated with ASc in a random ageing population study (Chapter 6). There have been few clinical studies of factors associated with ASc. Previous population studies have established that ASc is an independent correlate of incremental risk of coronary events. Having established that patients with AS have increased plasma ADMA concentrations (Chapter 5), it was now aimed to determine whether subjects with increased aortic valve backscatter scores (ASc) also have other markers of endothelial dysfunction/NO effects, independent of preexisting coronary risk factors. The study was designed to identify such anomalies, if they existed, on an incremental basis to other putative correlates of ASc, including coronary risk factors, renal dysfunction and vitamin D levels. Random selected subjects (n=253) aged between 51 to 77 years were evaluated. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography examination; aortic valve ultrasonic backscatter score (AVBS), was used to quantitate echogenicity of the aortic valve. Conventional coronary risk factors were identified on history. Integrity of NO generation/response was assessed via (i) plasma ADMA concentrations; (ii) inhibition of platelet aggregation by the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP); (iii) aortic augmentation index (AIx), a measure of arterial stiffness/wave reflection. All putative correlations with AVBS were examined by univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression analyses. On the basis of echocardiographic appearances, ASc was present in 63 subjects (25.4%); mean AVBS scores was 14.9&#177;4.6dB (SD) vs 11.2&#177;3.9dB (SD) in the presence vs absence of ASc (p&lt;0.001). Univariate analyses revealed that platelet responsiveness to NO was inversely correlated with AVBS (&#946;=-0.16, p=0.02); but [ADMA] and AIx were not. On multiple linear regression, significant correlates of increased AVBS were: (i) advanced age (&#946;=0.21, p=0.003), (ii) low body mass index (&#946;=-0.23, p=0.001); and (iii) impaired platelet responsiveness to NO (&#946;=-0.16, p=0.02). In Chapter 7, the implications of the overall findings in this thesis are discussed in relation to future perspective.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aortic valve stenosis; endothelial function; nitric oxide; echocardiography</field><field name="subject">Aortic valve Abnormalities.

The role of obesity on women&#8217;s fecundity has become a focus of attention in recent years. Successful treatment of infertility through Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is also compromised by the presence of obesity, which occurs in 30 % of women seeking treatment. A negative correlation exists between increased body mass index (BMI) and the number of collected oocytes and a lower birth rate after ART. Furthermore, a number of studies have established that weight loss improves natural conception rates in overweight women. Whether weight management can improve success rates in overweight / obese women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) has not been studied. The purpose of this project was to explore the role of short&#8211;term weight loss on potential pregnancy outcomes in overweight / obese women undergoing IVF programme. However, to establish this relationship, we proposed to carry out two studies to assess the following: (I) The feasibility of very low calorie diet (VLCD) during IVF treatment with respect to duration, level of restriction and tolerability of the diet during hormonal down regulation in women (Chapter 2). (II) How energy restriction may affect the quality of an early embryo in diet - induced obese mice with respect to various body weight and caloric intake (Chapter 3). In study (I), women preferred a shorter dietary intervention with greater energy restriction (456 kcal per day) to gradual energy restriction (1200 kcal / day for the first week, and afterward, 456 kcal / day) prior to oocyte transfer. Women were able to comply with the VLCD during IVF treatment and both dietary groups achieved a significant weight loss (mean 6.3 %). In study (II), by using obese mice, the effect of rapid weight loss (mean 12 %) was observed after 5 days of energy restriction. Ovulation rate was greater in the Obese group (HFD) (55.6%) and equal in both Control (CD) and Energy Restricted (HF / ER) (44.4 %) groups. The HF / ER group showed higher fertilisation rate (80 %) than HFD and CD (55% and 45.5%, correspondingly). The blastocyst stage was reached by half of the cultured embryos in both HF / ER and HFD groups and 33 % in the CD group. The quality of embryos that completed blastocyst formation did not differ between groups. However, postfertilisation development in females fed a high fat diet was slower compared to CD and HF / ER groups. In conclusion, this work illustrated a weight management prior conception and use of VLCD during IVF treatment in clinical study needs further investigation with regard to the dietary duration, level of energy restriction and how this combination will influence IVF treatment outcomes. Furthermore, as we were unable to determine the question of how the dietary intervention affects the quality of oocytes and the animal study illustrated a promising result, thus further studies are required.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reproduction; overweight; obese; female; diet; calorie restriction; mice; obstetrics; ART; embryo; zygote; blastocyst; BMI; nutrition; Optifast; VLCD</field><field name="subject">Low-calorie diet.</field><field name="subject">Reproductive technology.</field><field name="subject">Overweight women.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of environmental factors on the development of corticotroph subpopulations in the fetal sheep pituitary.</field><field name="creator">Farrand, Kirsten</field><field name="description">The prepartum surge in fetal plasma cortisol, essential for the maturation of organs in mammals and the normal timing of parturition in some species, including sheep, may result from an increase in the molar ratio of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the fetal circulation. Related to this, the cleavage of POMC to ACTH by the enzyme, prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), may be influenced by corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the capacity of individual corticotrophs to process POMC to ACTH may vary and individual corticotrophs are differentially responsive to CRH. It is not known, however, if there are separate corticotroph subpopulations in the fetal sheep pituitary which can be identified by differential colocalisation of POMC, ACTH and the CRH receptor 1, CRHR&#8321;, nor if changes in the relative proportions of such subpopulations play a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the overall changes in pituitary function described previously during gestation and in response to suboptimal uterine environments. To investigate these hypotheses, it was first necessary to develop novel methods for the simultaneous immunohistochemical labelling of POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; in individual cells on sections of fetal sheep pituitary. In addition, I developed and validated an automated method to categorise and count individual cells to increase the quantitative power of this study. Pituitary tissue was collected from control fetuses at 53-55 (n=6), 63-85 (n=6), 110 (n=4), 139-141 (n=4) and 144-145 (n=6) days gestation. Two animal models, known to alter pituitary function in the fetal sheep, were used to investigate corticotrophic adaptations to suboptimal uterine environments. For the maternal periconceptional undernutrition (PCUN) model, maternal feed was reduced to 70% of maintenance requirements from at least 45 days before to 7 days after mating and fetal tissues were collected at 53-55 days gestation (n=7). For the placental restriction (PR) model, the majority of the placental attachment sites were removed in five ewes before mating and fetal tissues were collected at 140 (n=4) and 144 (n=4) days gestation. Pituitary sections were simultaneously labelled with antisera raised against full length POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; and the proportions of pituitary cells with combinations of antisera were quantified. Four subpopulations of corticotrophs were identified, which expressed either: POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321;, ACTH+CRHR&#8321;, POMC+ CRHR&#8321; or POMConly. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of pituitary cells expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; between 53-55 and 65-85 days gestation, before an increase at 110 days gestation and a further marked decrease between 139-141 and 144-145 days gestation. In fetuses from the PCUN group, the proportion of pituitary cells expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; in early gestation was reduced. PR resulted in a significantly higher proportion of corticotrophs expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; during the prepartum period. This work represents the discovery of the differential expression of POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; in individual corticotrophs of the fetal sheep pituitary and the first insights into the pituitary adaptations to periconceptional nutrient restriction and placental restriction at the level of individual corticotrophs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endocrinology; ontogeny; fetal origins of adult disease; periconceptional undernutrition; placental restriction; immunohistochemistry; image analysis</field><field name="subject">Sheep Fetuses Physiology.</field><field name="subject">Pituitary gland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of phosphorus uptake pathways in a non-responsive arbuscular mycorrhizal host.</field><field name="creator">Grace, Emily Jane</field><field name="description">AM plants acquire Pi via two pathways; the direct uptake pathway via plant roots and the AM pathway via external fungal hyphae and colonised cortical cells. It has been assumed that these two pathways are additive and therefore in non-responsive plants the AM pathway is often considered to be non-functional. However, data from &#179;&#178;P uptake studies indicates that the AM pathway is functional in many non-responsive symbioses and in some instances supplies the majority of plant P. In recent years the high-affinity Pi transporters involved in both direct and AM Pi uptake pathways have been identified. They are expressed at the root epidermis and the symbiotic interface of colonised cortical cells and respond to the P and AM status of the plant. The overall objective of the work described in this thesis was to characterise Pi uptake via the AM pathway in barley, a non-responsive AM host, using an approach which integrated physiological measurements of plant responsiveness and AM contribution with investigations of gene expression and functional characterisation of the plant Pi transporters. A preliminary survey of field-grown barley demonstrated the persistence of AM colonisation under commercial cropping regimes in southern Australia and highlighted the relevance of AM studies to commercial agriculture. Under glasshouse conditions AM colonisation of barley induced depressions in growth and P uptake compared to NM controls. Growth depressions were unrelated to percent colonisation by two AM fungal species and could not readily be explained by fungal C demand; the strong correlation between growth and P content suggested that P was the limiting factor in these experiments. However, a compartmented pot system incorporating &#179;&#178;P-labelling demonstrated that the AM pathway is functional in colonised barley and, in the interaction with G. intraradices, contributed 48% of total P. This suggested that P flux via the direct uptake pathway is decreased in AM barley. The expression of three Pi transporters, HvPT1, HvPT2 and HvPT8 was investigated in colonised roots. HvPT1 and HvPT2 have previously been localised to the root epidermis and root hairs and are involved in Pi uptake via the direct pathway whilst HvPT8 is an AM-inducible Pi transporter which was localised by in-situ hybridisation to colonised cortical cells. Using promoter::GFP gene fusions the localisation of HvPT8 to arbuscule-containing cortical cells was confirmed in living roots from transgenic barley. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the expression of these three Pi transporters indicated that HvPT1 and HvPT2 were expressed constantly, under all conditions regardless of AM colonisation status and indicated that decreased P flux via the direct pathway is not related to expression of these transporters. HvPT8 was induced in AM colonised roots. However, the level of expression was not related to flux via the AM pathway or arbuscular colonisation. The HvPT8 transporter was further characterised by constitutive over-expression in transgenic barley. &#179;&#178;P uptake assays in excised roots demonstrated increased Pi uptake from low P solution compared to wild-type roots and confirmed that HvPT8 is a functional Pi transporter with high-affinity transport properties. This is the first report of characterisation of an AM-inducible Pi transporter in planta. When these transgenic plants were grown in solution culture there was no increase in growth or P uptake relative to wild-type or transgenic controls and growth in soil and AM colonisation were also unaffected in these transgenic lines. The data presented in this thesis highlights the importance of combined physiological and molecular approaches to characterising plant AM interactions. The persistence of AM colonisation in barley in the field indicates the importance of improving our understanding of symbiotic function in non-responsive plants. Future efforts should be directed towards understanding the signals which regulate P flux via both the direct and AM pathways with the ultimate aim of enhancing AM responsiveness of non-responsive species. Making the direct and AM pathways additive in nonresponsive species should be a key aim of future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphorus; phosphate transporter; barley; arbuscular mycorrhiza; symbiosis; plant nutrition; plant gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring animal disease and productivity in Samoa : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Taule'alo, Sina Fuatino</field><field name="description">This thesis presents two studies that form the basis of the Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries&#8217; (MAF) recent efforts to enhance its animal disease surveillance capacity. The first study investigated a method of enhancing the surveillance value of veterinary case data collected by the MAF&#8217;s Animal Health Service, which provides the only veterinary service for livestock in the country, through temporal analysis of cases and syndromes by species. Threshold levels generated from 3-monthly moving averages combined over 3 years of veterinary case data were used to identify unusually high numbers of cases and the cause of these unusual events were investigated. Further, the analysis of data in the system identified gaps in the coverage of the Animal Health Service which helped identify alternative methods for conducting surveillance in these areas using the Crops Division advisory officers. The objective of the second study was to identify if the veterinary case data collected by the Animal Health Service represented pig health problems in the general population. Reproduction and mortality patterns were compared on a group of 10 holdings that were regularly attended by the veterinary staff and 13 holdings that did not utilise the Animal Health Service. The performance of these holdings, measured in liveborn piglets per sow year and pre-weaning and post-weaning mortality were compared given their status as client or non-client of the service and their exposure to various management factors like confinement, protein supplementation, frequency of feeding, management time per sow per day, the use of improved or exotic breeds, the extent of commercial activity and, in the case of piglets their season of birth (rainy or dry season). The mean number of sows per herd was 6, producing a mean litter size of 6.1 piglets with a mean interfarrowing interval of 235 days. The median pre-weaning mortality per litter was 0 and a median of 1 piglet per litter was used for productive purposes (consumed, gifted or sold) at a median age of 153 days. It was found that the greatest influence on productivity in these holdings was nutrition. Sow productivity (in terms of liveborn piglets per sow year and pre-weaning survival) was best in the non-client, free range herds that did not provide protein supplementation (but whose feeding was unrestricted due to their freedom to roam and scavenge) and worst in client and non-client herds that were confined and not given protein supplementation (due to restricted and underfeeding). The mortality of pigs postweaning was significantly higher if they were free roaming, due to their loss to predation, theft and being hit by car. The study showed that the health status of pigs was better on holdings that did not use the Animal Health Service compared with those that did.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pigs</field><field name="subject">Swine</field><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="subject">Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Animal Health Service</field><field name="subject">Diseases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te h&#363; o te puoro : ko te m&#333;teatea te mataaho ki te p&#257; o te hinengaro M&#257;ori, ki te ao M&#257;ori : he tuhingaroa hei whakatutuki i ng&#257; tikanga o Te Tohu Kairangi (Doctor of Philosophy) i te reo M&#257;ori i Te Kunenga ki P&#363;rehuroa (Massey University), Papa-i-&#333;ea, Aotearoa</field><field name="creator">Ngata, Wayne James</field><field name="description">Ko t&#257; Ngata e whakapae nei, m&#257; te tino m&#333;hio ki ng&#257; m&#333;teatea, ki ng&#257; kupu, ki ng&#257; k&#333;rero, ki ng&#257; momo m&#333;teatea a ng&#257; t&#299;puna M&#257;ori, e whai w&#257;hi ai te tangata ki te p&#257; o te hinengaro M&#257;ori, m&#257; reira an&#333; e m&#333;hiotia ai te M&#257;ori.

With the introduction of the emissions trading scheme farmers will soon be liable for their emissions, introducing additional physical constraints and financial costs. Farmers that still operate within the sector will have two options to meet emissions targets; to purchase carbon credits from the open market, or mitigate farm level emissions at added costs to the farmer. This study examines the latter case of assessing farm level options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and quantifying the physical and financial costs associated with mitigation strategies. Results show that, based on the assumptions in the study, there are available options for dairy farmers to profitably meet Kyoto protocol emissions targets. Sheep and beef farmers can increase profit, but cannot meet Kyoto protocol emissions targets, through examined scenarios.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural greenhouse gas emissions</field><field name="subject">Emissions trading scheme</field><field name="subject">Dairy farming environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340201 Agricultural economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Connecting people : investigating a relationship between internet access and social cohesion in local community settings : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Communication, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jocelyn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The assumption that internet access is a means of building stronger communities is commonly found in a number of sectors, particularly in New Zealand government social services policy. In response to this assumed relationship between internet access and social cohesion, the present multiple case study research project examined the experience of free home internet access among families participating in New Zealand&#8217;s Computers in Homes scheme in low socioeconomic school communities between 2003 and 2005. The goal of the study was to assess how internet access and social cohesion are related in a free home internet scheme. Two propositions derived from a literature review underpinned the research goal: first, that internet access leads to ongoing use, and second, that internet access is positively related to social cohesion. The research was designed to test these propositions using a qualitative, constructivist approach with a mixed methodology. The principal method was interviews with adult Computers in Homes family members concerning their internet use and their sense of belonging to, and involvement in, the local community, across two waves of research about one year apart in two community settings. Additional data from observation, interviews and meetings with school principals and key informants such as Computers in Homes staff, provided context. Of thirty volunteer participants from among available Computers in Homes parents at two sites, twenty-six respondents took part in data collection at Time 1. Data from nine Case A and thirteen Case B participants contribute to the results. Nine of the original group participated at Time 2 one year later, seven from Case A and two from Case B. Internet use declined across the group as a whole, a negative outcome mitigated by positive experiences and individual success stories, and the emergence of &#8216;high-connector&#8217; internet users. While evidence of social cohesion was found at both case study sites initially, it was noticeably associated with the activities and interpersonal influence of confident internet users at Case A where significantly greater retention of ongoing internet use also occurred. A key finding of the study is therefore that ongoing internet use was more successfully achieved in a setting where social cohesion was more readily apparent at the time the free internet scheme was implemented. Thus a positive relationship existed in this research between internet access and social cohesion in one case study of two, where conditions included the presence of opinion leaders and social solidarity. Opportunities for face to face social interaction and support such as are present in Computers in Homes practice are potentially significant for ongoing internet use. The Computers in Homes concept extends participants&#8217; social experiences of community through the way it is structured and implemented. In combination with the mobilising behaviours of leader figures, these social experiences may be factors associated with longer term viability of a free home internet scheme as much as the presence of the internet itself. A range of significant barriers affecting individual internet users at home, and larger obstacles such as confused accountability when external agencies are involved in project management, is signalled in this research. Recommendations aimed at increasing the benefits of a free home internet scheme in terms of participant retention and social cohesion are proposed. Opportunities for further research arise from this study, in clarifying the conditions associated with positive social outcomes for internet interventions with a particular focus on the role of existing group cohesion and leadership dynamics.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet access</field><field name="subject">Social cohesion</field><field name="subject">Internet and community</field><field name="subject">Computers social aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conflict and culture : a discourse analysis of public texts on an indigenous New Zealand tertiary institution : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Psychology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Weatherley, Guenevere E.

Then, using Laclau and Mouffe&#8217;s discourse theory, I offer some deconstructive possibilities which provide alternative interpretations of the media discourse that ignited the public&#8217;s vilification of the institute. I describe what transpired over the time of 2005-2006 and critically examine and analyse the language used to express the two-party attack on TWOA and its Tumuaki, Rongo Wetere. I find that the language used by politicians and media commentators positioned TWOA as an inefficient and corrupt Maori institution in need of Pakeha (NZ European) governance and management. Through an investigation of the selection and promulgation of particular tropes, the interests of the political elite are shown as serving to marginalise the institution, limit its growth and channel its students into Pakeha educational institutions. The Wananga brought tertiary education to those New Zealanders who had hitherto been excluded or who had failed in mainstream education. Its astonishing success caused its decline.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Te W&#257;nanga o Aotearoa</field><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">M&#257;ori tertiary education</field><field name="subject">M&#257;ori higher education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art and the greater good : ecology and the leisure economy : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wallis, Samantha</field><field name="description">Art and the Greater Good: Ecology and the Leisure Economy is a research project concerned with exploring how one could alternatively address the environmental issues of our day through site-specific art.

Kokako only exist in small remnant populations separated by large tracts of unsuitable land. Kokako are very poor flyers, only able to fly for approximately 100 metres at a time. In order to prevent inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity in the remaining kokako populations, managers are carrying out translocations to establish new populations, maintain gene flow and prevent inbreeding. However, these translocations have the potential to be unsuccessful because kokako exhibit macrogeographic variation in their dialects, and tend not to breed with individuals who do not share the same dialect as them. If the purpose of the translocation is to enhance genetic diversity by having kokako from different areas breed then song is an important factor that must be dealt with. Song is extremely important to kokako for a number of reasons. Chiefly, it is hypothesised that song is their primary means of territory defence. A kokako gains all its resources from its territory, so it is imperative that they successfully defend it. Their duet song functions in territory defence, but also acts to form and maintain pair bonds. In order to try and address the problem that song causes in translocations I studied if and how song evolves in a multiple dialect area. I conducted research at Pukaha Mount Bruce, where there is a population of kokako originating from two different source populations, and thus two different dialects, Northern Mapara and Mangatutu. I looked at the Northern Mapara dialect, and recorded kokako belonging to three groups; kokako currently living in the source population, kokako that were translocated to Pukaha and kokako that were born at Pukaha. In order to determine how the song may be changing I looked at element repertoires, the levels of sharing between groups, the number of unique elements in repertoires and the syntactical and temporal characteristics of phrases. This study shows that translocation into multiple dialect areas can affect kokako song. Translocation did not affect the size of the kokako repertoire, but it seemed to affect the amount of sharing within and between different groups of kokako. Currently the level of sharing within the groups at Pukaha is lower than the level of sharing within the source Mapara population, indicating that the song may be diverging. There also seem to be more unique elements found at Pukaha, which in part explains the lack of sharing. There appears to be microgeographic variation at Pukaha, with birds clustered around the second (Mangatutu) dialect sharing less with the source population than do those kokako whose territories are lower down in the reserve. The phrases which are used are also evolving, with only one phrase truly shared among all groups. There are other phrases which show additions or deletions of elements, and so are evolving. The main change found in the phrases is the timing between elements, with six out of seven phrases examined showing changes. These results have repercussions for future kokako translocations, and the future of the Pukaha kokako. A low amount of phrase and element type sharing combined with changes of intra-phrase timing could lead to the Pukaha kokako&#8217;s inability to successfully defend their territories. This research shows how kokako song can give conservation managers information on the status of their populations in regards to interbreeding and raises questions which can be answered by further research, both at Pukaha and in other mixeddialect kokako populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kokako</field><field name="subject">Callaeas cinerea wilsoni</field><field name="subject">Bird song</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and the follow-through experience in three year Bachelor of Midwifery programs in Australia. &#8216;Placements with women, not institutions&#8217;</field><field name="creator">Gray, Joanne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Background This research explored the follow-through experience in three year, pre-registration Bachelor of Midwifery programs in Australia. The follow-through experience involves midwifery students following women on their journey through pregnancy, labour and birth and into the early parenting period. The concept was introduced to midwifery education in Australia in 2001 when it was embedded in the foundational Australian College of Midwives. National Education Standards for Bachelor of Midwifery programs. The inclusion of the follow-through experience in Bachelor of Midwifery education programs was a deliberate strategy to ensure midwifery students would experience midwifery continuity of care. Aims The aims of this research were to: explore the follow-through experience in order to better understand its impact on students, midwifery education providers and midwives, and, to identify the learning that is associated with this experience. Setting This research was conducted in Australia. Students from all three-year pre-registration Bachelor of Midwifery programs were invited to participate. Design A qualitative study was undertaken. In-depth interviews were conducted with key stakeholders who had been involved in the development and implementation of the follow-through experience. Data were collected from former and current Bachelor of Midwifery students through an online survey and telephone interviews. A thematic analysis was undertaken and situated learning and constructivist theories were used to identify whether learning occurred in the context of the follow-through experience. Results The findings provided a unique insight into the follow-through experience from the perception of students and stakeholders. This research established that students do learn from their engagement in this experience. This learning was characterised by the primacy of the relationship with the women. Students also identified the challenges they faced in undertaking these experiences, including problems with recruitment and time commitment. Difficulties were identified around requirements of the follow-through experience, the lack of support at times for students, and the lack of congruence with the existing Australian maternity system. These difficulties were identified as having a significant impact on the students. ability to engage in, and to maximise their learning from, this experience. A conceptual model was developed to provide a synthesis of the results of this research and a framework for effective implementation and management of the follow-through experience. Implications This research has implications for midwifery education, particularly in Australia but also internationally. This experience does indeed provide unique learning opportunities for students. It is however essential that the student is given adequate support to aid their learning and to ensure they gain the most from these experiences. Conclusions The follow-through experience is an innovative education strategy and this research identified that learning occurred within this experience. This learning was identified as being situated in the context of students being placed with women. This research clearly identifies the value of the follow-through experience as an important component of student learning.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery students.</field><field name="subject">Midwifery education.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Countertrade and the internationalisation of the Australian firm.</field><field name="creator">Fletcher, Richard</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to broaden our understanding of the nature, causes and consquences of countertrade in the context of the internationalisation of the firm. A comprehensive review and assessment of previous research is presented, including a discussion of how countertrade fits within the context of the various models of the internationalisation process. An analytical framework is presented for studying a number of dimensions of internationalisation (viz forms of international behaviour and international orientation) and possible causes and effects. The forms of internatioalisation invole outward, inward linked forms (such as countertrade).  Based on the literature relating to internationalisation, a number of hypotheses are developed relating various management and firms' characteristics to predisposition to countertrade. These were tested using both bi-variate and multi-variate techniques which involved the use of data generated from a nationwide sample of Australian manufacturing firms. Generally the results of the bi-variate analysis supported the hypothesis showing that the factors which predict outward driven internationalisation also tend to predict countertrade. The analysis involved three measures of internationalisation and four measures of countertrade.   Firms were then grouped according to various measures of predisposition towards countertrade. Using discriminant analysis, these groups of firms were profiled according to factors found to predict countertrade in the bivariate analysis. In order to further explore the relationship between internationalisation and countertrade, firms were also grouped according to their degree of internationalisation and strength of their predisposition towards countertrade. Firms in each group were then profiled using bi-variate and multi-variate analysis. These profiles provide potentially useful classifications of firms as possible bases for targeting and designing government assistance programs.  Finally, three case studies of countertrade transactions by Australian firms were undertaken using the network approach which facilitates a deeper understanding of countertrade in the context of internationalisation. In each case the networks of relationships involved were analysed at both inception and maturity, to further explore how countertrade influenced the internationalisation of the Australian firm. It was found that although the transactions would not have occurred without countertrade, in all cases countertrade led to further international business which in some instances did not require countertrade.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Countertrade.</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="subject">Commerce.</field><field name="subject">Internationalism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hitler comedy / Hitlerhoff</field><field name="creator">Doig, Thomas James</field><field name="description">The critical component of this thesis, &#8220;Hitler Comedy&#8221;, is a dissertation on the intersection between comedy theory in general, and the specific practice of Hitler comedy.

D. L.</field><field name="description">Studies in Europe, Japan, and North America have reported that wild fish exposed to treated sewage effluents can exhibit significant physiological and reproductive abnormalities consistent with exposure to hormonally active chemicals. The main objective of this research project was to examine the estrogenic and androgenic activity in treated sewage to determine the risk associated with treated sewage discharges in Australia and New Zealand.  Several bioassays, including a sheep estrogen receptor and a rainbow trout androgen receptor binding assay, were set up and validated with model compounds. The assays were then used to measure the estrogenic and androgenic activity in sewage samples from 15 municipal sewage treatment plants (STP) utilizing a variety of treatment technologies. Raw sewage samples contained high levels of both estrogenic and androgenic activity, up to 185 ng/L estradiol equivalents (EEq) and up to 9330 ng/L testosterone equivalents (TEq), respectively. Secondary treatment processes such as activated sludge had the greatest impact on removal of biological activity from the wastewater. The estrogenic and androgenic activity in final treated effluents were &lt;1 to 4.2 ng/L EEq and &lt;6.5 to 736 ng/L TEq, respectively. Based on lowest observable effective concentrations reported in the literature, these levels are unlikely to induce biological effects in exposed fish in the short term.  To examine potential long-term effects, resident mosquitofish chronically exposed to undiluted treated sewage were sampled. Several morphological biomarkers indicative of endocrine disruption were measured and compared with mosquitofish captured at a reference site. Mosquitofish captured in a constructed wetland for tertiary treatment of secondary treated sewage exhibited morphological differences such as elongated anal fins consistent with exposure to androgenic chemicals, although this effect was not measurable in fish collected at sites further downstream or at any of the other sites. Based on these results, it is unlikely that mosquitofish populations would be significantly affected by exposure to final treated sewage. A reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to measure the production of a female-specific protein (vitellogenin) mRNA in adult male mosquitofish was developed, and this could be used as a rapid test to detect early changes in individuals exposed to estrogenic activity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">activated sludge</field><field name="subject">androgen receptor (AR)</field><field name="subject">biomarkers</field><field name="subject">estrogen receptor (ER)</field><field name="subject">in vitro bioassay</field><field name="subject">mosquitofish</field><field name="subject">rainbow trout</field><field name="subject">receptor binding assays</field><field name="subject">sewage treatment</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">trickling filter</field><field name="subject">vitellogenin</field><field name="subject">1002 - Environmental Biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of genetic markers associated with wool quality traits in merino sheep</field><field name="creator">Itenge-Mweza, Theopoline Omagano</field><field name="description">A candidate gene approach was used to identify potential genetic markers associated with wool quality traits including mean fibre diameter (MFD), fibre diameter standard deviation (FDSD), coefficient of variation of fibre diameter (CVD), prickle factor, curvature, yellowness, brightness, staple strength, staple length, yield, greasy fleece weight (GFW) and clean fleece weight (CFW). Inheritance of potential genetic markers was studied in two half-sib Merino families and assessed for association with the wool quality traits. The sire for one of the half-sib families is referred to as MV144-58-00, and wool measurements from its progeny were taken at 12 (n = 131), 24 (n =128) and 36 (n = 37) months of age. The sire for the second half-sib family is referred to as Stoneyhurst, and wool measurements from its progeny (n = 35) were taken at 12 months of age.  Genes that code for the keratin intermediate-filament proteins (KRTs) (KRT1.2, KRT2.10) and the keratin intermediate-filament-associated proteins (KAPs) (KAPl.1, KAPl.3, KAP3.2, KAP6.1, KAP 7, KAP8) were targeted for this investigation, along with the beta 3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) gene and microsatellites BfMS and OarFCB193.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify specific DNA fragments from each locus and PCR- single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis was used to detect polymorphism within the half-sib families for all the loci, except for the KAP1.1 gene, where length polymorphism was detected using agarose gel electrophoresis. Only the loci that were heterozygous for the sire (KAP1.1, KAP1.3, KRT1.2, ADRB3, KAP8) and hence were informative, were genotyped in the progeny. The total number of alleles observed at the KAP1.1, KAP1.3, KRT1.2, KAP8 and the ADRB3 loci were four, ten, six, five and six, respectively. Analysis of each of the informative loci revealed allelic associations with various wool traits. In the MV144-58-00 (genotypes KAP1.1 AB; KAP1.3 BD; KRT1.2 AB; ADRB3 CE) half-sib, inheritance of the KAP1.1 A allele was associated with a higher yield at 24 months of age (P = 0.037). This trend also observed at 36 months of age (P = 0.078). At 12 months of age, the KAP1.1 A allele tended to be associated with increased staple length (P = 0.08). At 36 months of age, the inheritance of the KAP1.1 B allele tended towards being associated with whiter wool (P = 0.080). The MV144-58-00 KAP1.3 D allele tended to be associated with increased yield at 24 and 36 months of age (P = 0.091 and 0.059, respectively), and with lower FDSD at 12 months of age (P = 0.055). The sire KAP1.3 B allele was associated with whiter wool colour at 36 months of age (P = 0.045). The inheritance of the MV144-58-00 KR T1.2 B allele was associated with or tended to be associated with a smaller FDSD (P = 0.040), an increase in staple strength (P = 0.025) and an increase in GFW (P = 0.069) at 12 months of age. At 24 months of age, the KR T1.2 B allele tended to be associated with increased yield (P = 0.057). At 36 months of age, the KRTl.2 A allele was associated with whiter wool (P = 0.019) and tended to be associated with increased crimp within the wool fibre (P = 0.089).  In the Stoneyhurst (genotypes KAP1.1 BC; KAP1.3 CJ; KRT1.2 DE; ADRB3 CE) half-sib, inheritance of the KAP1.1 B allele was associated with longer staple length (P = 0.018) and a decrease in wool brightness (P = 0.039). In contrast, KAP1.1 C allele was associated with lowest staple length (P = 0.018) and brighter wool colour (P = 0.039). Associations observed with the inheritance of Stoneyhurst KAP 1.1 alleles were similar to the inheritance ofKAPl.3 alleles. Stoneyhurst KAP1.3 J allele was associated with longer staple length (P = 0.017) and a decrease in wool brightness (P = 0.010). In contrast, KAP1.3 C allele was associated with lowest staple length (P = 0.017) and brighter wool colour (P = 0.010). The Stoneyhurst KRT12 D allele was associated with longer staple length and a decrease in wool brightness (P = 0.033). In contrast, KRT1.2 E allele was associated with lowest staple length (P = 0.033) and brighter wool colour (P = 0.022).  Sire alleles at the ADRB3 gene locus were associated with variation in staple strength (P = 0.025) for MV144-58-00's progeny, and with variation in yield (P = 0.023) for Stoneyhurst's progeny. The results obtained in this thesis are consistent with KAP1.1, KAP1.3 and KRT1.2 being clustered on one chromosome because both sires in this study passed on two major KAP1.1-KAP1.3-KRT1.2 haplotypes to their progeny, and the associations with wool traits were very similar for all the three loci. The major sire derived KAP1.1 &#8211; KAP1.3 - KRT1.2 haplotypes observed within the MV144-58-00 half-sib were: BBA (frequency of 43.4%; n = 43) and ADB (frequency of 44.4%; n = 44). Other minor haplotypes observed were: ADA (frequency of 4.0%; n = 4); BDA (frequency of 2.0%; n = 2); BBB (frequency of 3.0%; n = 3) and BDB (frequency of 3.0%; n = 3). In the Stoneyhurst half-sib, major sire-derived KAP 1.1 - KAP 1.3 - KR Tl.2 haplotypes observed were CCE (frequency of 53.1 %; n = 17) and BJD (frequency of 40.6%; n = 13). The minor haplotype BJE (frequency of 6.3%; n = 2) was also observed.  Statistical analyses within the MVI44-58-00 half-sib showed that KAP1.1 AKAP1.3 D - KRT1.2 B haplotype was associated with increased yield (P = 0.023) and tended towards whiter wool colour (P = 0.059), smaller FDSD (P = 0.081) and stronger staple strength (P = 0.092). In the Stoneyhurst half-sib, the KAP1.1 B - KAP1.3 J - KRT1.2 D haplotype was associated with longer staple length (P = 0.010), while the KAP1.1 C - KAP1.3 C - KRT1.2 E haplotype showed a strong trend with increased wool brightness (P = 0.096).  Result from this study indicated that the keratin genes on chromosome 11 are recombining relatively frequently at recombination "hotspots". A high rate of recombination among loci that impact on wool traits would make breeding for consistent wool quality very difficult.  The results presented in this thesis suggest that genes coding for the KRTs and KAPs have the potential to impact on wool quality. KAP1.1, KAP1.3 and KRT1.2 could potentially be exploited in gene marker-assisted selection programmes within the wool industry to select for animals with increased staple length, 'increased staple strength, higher yield and brighter wool. This study was however limited to two half-sib families, and further investigation is required.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wool</field><field name="subject">traits</field><field name="subject">keratin</field><field name="subject">genetic marker</field><field name="subject">half-sib</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="subject">SSCP</field><field name="subject">polymorphism</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">keratin intermediate-filament protein (KRT)</field><field name="subject">keratin-associated protein (KAP)</field><field name="subject">haplotype</field><field name="subject">recombination</field><field name="subject">hotspot</field><field name="subject">0604 - Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of imperfect mixing in suspended plant and animal cell cultures</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Caleb Kin Lok, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A common problem observed in large-scale cell cultivation is reduced culture performance compared with small-scale processes due to the existence of concentration gradients caused by poor mixing. Small-scale simulations using microbial cell suspensions have shown that circulation of cells through concentration gradients of oxygen, pH and glucose can result in reduction of cell growth and product formation similar to the effects observed in large-scale bioreactors. This study was aimed at using scale-down studies to investigate poor mixing in large-scale bioreactors used for suspended plant and animal cell culture. Two plant cell suspensions and a hybridoma cell line were used in this work. The range of oxygen transfer coefficients achieved in the hybridoma and plant suspensions were about 50???20 h-1 and 12???6 h-1, respectively. One-vessel simulation was developed to induce fluctuations of dissolved oxygen tension in a 2-L bioreactor using intermittent sparging of air and nitrogen. The effect of dissolved oxygen fluctuations on the cells was examined by comparing the performance of the cultures with those operated at constant dissolved oxygen tension. In the hybridoma suspension culture, only slight effects on cell growth were observed at circulation times above 300 s. No effect on the specific glucose uptake rate or antibody production was observed at the circulation times tested. Analysis of gene expression for selected hypoxia-related genes also suggested that the overall effect was limited. In plant cell suspensions, the specific growth rates and biomass yields on total sugar in the cultures under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension were essentially the same as those at constant dissolved oxygen tension for both transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Thalictrum minus. Under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension, no effect on antibody accumulation was observed in transgenic N. tabacum suspensions, but a decrease in berberine accumulation was observed in T. minus. From the results, it can be concluded that only minimal effects due to the development of concentration gradients would be expected in large-scale bioreactors used for the cultivation of the hybridoma and plant cell suspensions tested in this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Plant cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Kylie Anne, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This program of research investigated the nature and processes of autobiographical memory deficits in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Study 1 examined the proposition that difficulties in the retrieval of specific memories present a risk factor for posttraumatic psychopathology. A prospective study of fire-fighters found that a significant predictor of posttraumatic stress was a deficit in retrieving specific memories to positive cues before trauma. Study 2 investigated whether autobiographical retrieval deficits in PTSD can be modified by psychological treatment. Results found that as PTSD symptoms reduced following treatment, individuals with PTSD retrieved more specific memories to positive cues. Together, these results indicated that specific retrieval deficits to positive cues present a vulnerability factor for PTSD. However, this memory style appears to be receptive to modification following therapy. Study 3 investigated the association between autobiographical retrieval deficits and impaired problemsolving in PTSD. Participants with PTSD retrieved more overgeneral categoric memories and took longer to retrieve memories than non-PTSD trauma controls. This deficit was associated with impaired social problem-solving, suggesting that specific retrieval is related to successful problem solving. In an analogue design, Studies 4 and 5 investigated the proposition that resource limitations may underpin autobiographical retrieval deficits. Results generally supported the proposal that reduced cognitive resources may be a mechanism contributing to specific retrieval deficits. Studies 6 and 7 examined rumination as another possible mechanism responsible for these retrieval deficits. Study 6 found high anxious participants retrieved fewer specific memories to positive cues following rumination, compared  to distraction. Study 7 found evidence that negative rumination in the high anxious group increased categoric retrieval, whereas positive rumination had no effect. Study 8 found retrieval of trauma-related self-defining memories was strongly associated with personal goals connected to the trauma. Study 9 found that discrepancies in one???s self construct were related to the retrieval of trauma memories to positive cues. This program of research extends current theories of autobiographical memory by identifying risk, maintenance, and recovery factors in the context of PTSD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autobiographical memory</field><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of surface science to sulfide mineral processing</field><field name="creator">Goh, Siew Wei, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surface spectroscopic techniques have been applied to facets of the flotation beneficiation and hydrometallurgical extraction of sulfide minerals to enhance the fundamental understanding of these industrially important processes. As a precursor to the determination of surface chemical composition, the sub-surface properties of some sulfide minerals that have not previously been fully characterised were also investigated. The electronic properties of ??-NiS and ??-NiS (millerite), Ni3S2 (heazlewoodite), (Ni,Fe)9S8 (pentlandite), CuFe2S3 (cubanite), CuFeS2 (chalcopyrite), Cu5FeS4 (bornite) and CuS (covellite) were investigated by conventional and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy augmented by ab initio density of state calculations and NEXAFS spectral simulations. Particular aspects studied included the relationship between sulfur coordination number and core electron binding energies, the higher than expected core electron binding energies for the sulfur in the metal-excess nickel sulfides, and the formal oxidation states of the Cu and Fe in Cu-Fe sulfides. It was concluded that the binding energy dependence on coordination number was less than previously believed, that Ni-Ni bonding was the most likely explanation for the unusual properties of the Ni sulfides, and that there was no convincing evidence for Cu(II) in sulfides as had been claimed. Most of the NEXAFS spectra simulated by the FEFF8 and WIEN2k ab initio codes agreed well with experimental spectra, and the calculated densities of states were useful in rationalising the observed properties. XPS, static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and NEXAFS spectroscopy were used to investigate thiol flotation collector adsorption on several sulfides in order to determine the way in which the collector chemisorbs to the mineral surface, to differentiate monolayer from multilayer coverage, and to characterise the multilayer species. It was found that static SIMS alone was able to differentiate monolayer from multilayer coverage, and together with angle-resolved NEXAFS spectroscopy, was also able to confirm that 2-mercaptobenzothiazole interacted through both its N and exocyclic S atoms. The altered layers formed on chalcopyrite and heazlewoodite during acid leaching were examined primarily by means of threshold S KLL Auger electron spectroscopy, but no evidence for buried interfacial species was obtained.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface chemistry</field><field name="subject">Sulphide minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of compulsory competitive tendering on the organisational culture of local government in Victoria</field><field name="creator">Aulich, Christopher, School of Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A central feature of public sector reform in Australia in the past decade or so has been the introduction of competition into service markets that were previously monopolised by public agencies. The adoption of more competitive strategies by these agencies has usually been accompanied by changes in their organisational culture - found in their structures, modes of operation and in internal and external relationships, as well as in the underlying values orientation of the organisation. The introduction of compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) in local government in the state of Victoria reflected criticisms of the performance of traditional local government bureaucracies and a determination by the state government to secure a change in local government culture. This study investigates the impact of CCT on local authorities in Victoria, and explores the changes to organisational culture that have occurred. It assesses the extent to which the changes are consistent with a 'post-bureaucratic' conception of public organisations. The study presents evidence that cultural change has occurred in Victorian local authorities, particularly in the establishment of new organisation structures, a more entrepreneurial or outward focused orientation, and the development of more market focused and customer oriented service delivery systems. While cultural changes may not have progressed as far as intended by the Victorian government, they represent a more radical approach to local government reform than in other Australian states - so radical that they present a serious challenge to long-held views of the role of local government in the community. The thesis reveals that the new competitive environment may itself generate new problems such as transactions costs and erosion of trust within local councils and enables senior managers to assert stronger control over the council. It is this control, together with the technocratic or top-down approach to reform taken by the state government, which has constrained the development of model post-bureaucratic local government organisations in Victoria. In particular, it seems that senior managers are more intent on reshaping their organisations than in encouraging the greater market responsiveness anticipated in the post-bureaucratic model.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Local government Victoria</field><field name="subject">Municipal services Contracting out Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques and algorithms for solving the multiobjective path optimisation problem for car navigation</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Ching-Sheng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conventional information used to guide automobile drivers in selecting their driving routes is the shortest-distance path (SDP). As several researchers have pointed out, driver route selection is a multiple criteria decision process. This research proposes a multiobjective path optimisation (MOPO) decision model to make a more precise simulation of the decision-making behaviour of driver route selection. Seven single-objective path optimisation (SOPO) decision models are taken into account to establish the MOPO decision model. They relate to travel time, travel cost, cumulative distance, roadway capacity, roadway grade, passed intersections and number of turns.  To solve the MOPO problem, a two-stage technique which incorporates shortest path (SP) algorithms and techniques for solving the multiobjective programming problem and a path genetic algorithm (PGA) are proposed. In addition, algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and GA are reviewed and algorithms that are applicable for solving the MOPO problems are suggested. Furthermore, new algorithms for solving least-node path (LNP) problem, corresponding to the objective of passed intersections, as well as minimum-turn path (MTP) problem, corresponding to the objective of number of turns, are developed.  To conduct the empirical study, a software tool - the multiobjective path optimisation analysis tool (MOPOAT) - was implemented. It contains tools for constructing a road network and its corresponding network topology, the environment of coding techniques for solving the MOPO problems and tools for the manipulation, statistics, analysis and display of experimental results. The purpose of implementing the MOPOAT software is to provide more efficient, convenient and user-friendly tools for solving MOPO and SOPO problems so that an empirical study of real road networks can be carried out more easily.  To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in supporting more diverse information to drivers to assist in route selection, several experiments were conducted utilising three real road networks with different roadway types and numbers of nodes and links. Techniques and algorithms such as the two-stage approach, Dijkstra and the PGA for solving the MOPO problem, and the Dijkstra, LNP and MTP algorithms for solving the SOPO problems were applied.  Finally, to deal with improvements in computational efficiency for identifying SPs in a large road network and for population initialisation of the PGA, the critical-section (CS) approach and the seed-path expansion (SPE) approach are proposed. To compare the run time between the conventional SP and CS algorithms as well as the PGA and the SPE algorithms, tools were implemented with commercial GIS, and experimental tests were conducted using road networks with a large amount of nodes and links and different roadway types.  Through these theoretical and empirical studies, several useful contributions and conclusions were obtained.  Some of the most significant findings are:  1.	The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of integration with commercial GIS packages in supporting both spatial and attribute data displays. It can be safely said that, assisted by the MOPOAT software, it is easy for automobile drivers to obtain the optimal paths of the SDP, LNP, MTP and MOPO problems in seconds, despite these problems being highly complex and difficult to resolve manually. 2.	According to the experimental results, the proposed LNP, MTP and MOPO decision models give automobile drivers richer information for choosing their driving routes in a more diverse way. 3.	It is shown by the experimental results that the SDP and LNP mostly locate different paths in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks, and that the total passed intersections by the SDP are greater than passed by the LNP. Moreover, it is revealed that ambiguous turns might occur in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks. 4.	It is found that the number of nodes of the SDP is in general greater than the number of nodes of the LNP and MTP irrespective of the type of road network. 5.	A sensitivity analysis for weights shows that as the weighting value of the SDP objective incrementally increases by 0.1 units, the corresponding SDP??s objective value varies either low or high. The same results also occur for the LNP and MTP objectives. This verifies the fact that the weighting coefficients do not reflect proportionally the relative importance of the objectives. Moreover, the MTP objective has the higher sensitivity in comparison with the other two objectives. 6.	Despite utilising Dijkstra or PGA algorithms for solving the MOPO problem, the LNP and MTP algorithms have to be employed to solve the non-commeasurable problem, whereby the standardisation objective value can be obtained. In addition, without any assisting information the PGA might fail to reach the best-compromise solution. 7.	It is found that the total run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the Dijkstra algorithm is much faster than by the PGA. However, if the run time excludes the time needed for population initialisation, the PGA is much faster than the Dijkstra algorithm. 8.	Based on calculated bottlenecks, the proposed CS approach partitions a SP into many critical sections in advance, with the result that a long SP can be obtained by combining all SPs of all CSs. The experimental results show that the run time of the CS algorithm is much faster than Dijkstra??s algorithm. Moreover, the test result for the P-pointer indicates that if the total number of nodes of a SP grows the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm becomes significantly better than the Dijkstra algorithm, and that the CS approach has the best performance. 9.	The experimental result for the E-pointer reveals that the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm will decrease gradually as the number of selected CSs increases. Therefore, the total percentage of selected CSs suggested by the experimental result is no more than 30 percent. 10.	According to the experimental results, the performance order among SDP, LNP and MTP algorithms from fast to slow is SDP, MTP and LNP, and the LNP algorithm requires much more time than the other two algorithms. 11.	As the total nodes of a path increase, most of the run time for SDP and LNP also increases. However, there are still some paths that violate the above rule. This result verifies that the run time needed for solving SDP and LNP is not only affected by the node numbers but also depends on the network topology. 12.	Run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the PGA is faster than applying the Dijkstra algorithm, if the run time of the former algorithm does not take into account the population initialisation time. Nevertheless, if the run time of the former algorithm does take into account the population initialisation time, the latter algorithm is much faster than the former algorithm. 13.	In comparing the run time for population initialisation, the run time of the evolution process by applying the PGA is quite small, and the bottleneck of the run time for solving MOPO problem by applying the PGA is the population initialisation. 14.	The population initialisation time is reduced significantly by applying the SPE algorithm, and increases at a very slow rate as the number of nodes of a path increases. As the total nodes of a path grow ever larger, the computing time is reduced more noticeably.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Multiobjective path optimisation problem</field><field name="subject">Car navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of iron chelators as anti-proliferative agents against cancer : molecular mechanisms behind the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Le, Nghia Trung Van, School of Women???s &amp; Children???s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">Iron (Fe) is a fundamental requirement for life since it is involved in many cellular processes critical for growth and proliferation. Indeed, studies which deplete Fe from neoplastic cells using specific chelating agents result in G1/S arrest and apoptosis. However, the precise role of Fe in the control of the cell cycle remains unclear. Chapter one of this thesis, discusses the potential mechanism(s) by which Fe chelators cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that this process involves multiple molecules and is highly complex. Thus, the studies presented in this thesis assess the effects of specific high affinity Fe chelators on the expression of molecules that may play important roles in cellular arrest and apoptosis. The general methodology used in these studies is summarized in chapter 2. In previous investigations Fe chelators such as 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311) were shown to be far more potent anti-tumor agents than the clinically used ligand, desferrioxamine (DFO). Studies detailed in chapter 3, examined the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the universal cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 following Fe-deprivation. To further characterize the effects of chelators on cell cycle arrest, experiments compared their activity to the DNA-damaging agents, actinomycin D (Act D) and cisplatin (CP). The latter two compounds increase the expression of p53 and its target gene p21CIP1/WAF1. Incubation of normal and neoplastic cells with all agents resulted in increased accumulation of nuclear p53, with the effect being more pronounced for Act D and CP. As expected, both Act D and CP markedly increased nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels, while DFO and 311 caused a significant (p &amp;lt 0.0004) decrease. This result was surprising, since the WAF1 gene which encodes the universal cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 was markedly up-regulated at the mRNA level following Fe chelation. Proteasomal inhibition studies demonstrated the partial involvement of proteasomes in decreasing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 levels following DFO treatment. In contrast, the incubation of 311-treated cells with proteasomal inhibitors did not reverse the down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 when compared to the control. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that only DNA-damaging agents and not Fe chelators increased the nuclear translocation of p21CIP1/WAF1. Collectively, this suggests that the chelators prevented translation of WAF1. Moreover, this decrease in nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein expression did not appear to be due to a general effect in which Fe chelators inhibited mRNA translation since the transferrin receptor 1 was markedly up-regulated (15-21- fold) by DFO or 311. The combination of 311 with Act D or CP prevented the marked p21CIP1/WAF1 nuclear accumulation normally observed in response to these DNAdamaging agents. Significantly, the effect of chelation on reducing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 expression was reversed by the Fe-donor, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), indicating that WAF1 translation was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. This study is the first to demonstrate that Fe chelators markedly up-regulate the mRNA expression of WAF1 but paradoxically inhibit its translation. The down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 protein by chelators may be a novel mechanism by which these ligands cause G1/S arrest through cell cycle dysregulation. In chapter 4, gene arrays were used to assess the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle control and the p53 pathway following the incubation of cells with DFO, 311 or Act D. The N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) was the only molecule identified that was specifically up-regulated by Fe chelation and not DNA-damage. Although the exact function of the Ndrg1 protein is unclear, previous studies have shown that this molecule markedly slows down tumor growth (Kurdistani et al. Cancer Res. 1998:58;4439-44) and acts as a potent metastasis suppressor protein (Bandyopadhyay et al. Cancer Res. 2003:63;1731-6). Subsequent experiments examined the mRNA and protein expression of Ndrg1 using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. Incubation of cells with DFO or 311 resulted in a marked increase in the expression of Ndrg1 mRNA and protein within 3 h and 6 h, respectively. This increase in Ndrg1 after incubation with chelators was not found with their Fe complexes nor when the Fe-binding site had been synthetically inactivated. In addition, the induction of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was correlated with the ligands??? permeability and anti-proliferative activity. Indeed, the up-regulation of Ndrg1 by Fe chelators can be readily reversed by Fe-repletion. Collectively, this indicates that the induction of Ndrg1 was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. Previous studies demonstrated for the first time that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was dependent on HIF-1?? and p53 stabilization. In contrast, investigations using fibroblasts derived from a HIF-1?? knockout (HIF-1??-KO) mouse demonstrated that the transcriptional upregulation of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was mediated by a HIF-1??-dependent and - independent mechanism. In addition, subsequent experiments using the p53-deficient H1299 lung carcinoma cell line revealed that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was not dependent on p53 status after Fe-depletion. Collectively, the presented studies suggest that Ndrg1 may be a novel link between Fe metabolism and the control of proliferation. The up-regulation of Ndrg1 by potent Fe chelators is significant and may be beneficial in the prevention of tumor metastasis. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that the molecular mechanisms behind the G1/S arrest and apoptosis involved multiple molecules following Fe chelation. Indeed, this study shows a potential mechanism by which Fe chelators may cause cell cycle dysregulation through the down-regulation of nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels. In addition, the work presented identifies the up-regulation of the metastasis suppressor protein, Ndrg1, following Fe-deprivation. Collectively, the results indicate that potent Fe chelators can not only be used as anti-proliferative agents, but may also be beneficial at inhibiting tumor cell metastasis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Iron chelates</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Racism, pluralism and democracy in Australia : re-conceptualising racial vilification legislation</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Tamsin, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australian debates about racial vilification legislation have been dominated by mainstream American First Amendment jurisprudence and popular American notions of 'free speech' to the exclusion of alternative Europeans models. This can be seen from notions of Australian racial vilification legislation as inconsistent with 'free speech' rights as well as the influence of some of the basic assumptions of First Amendment jurisprudence on political speech cases in the Australian High Court. Despite the widespread existence of legislation that penalises racial vilification at State and Federal levels, there has been a rise in Australia over the past 10 years of divisive 'race' politics. Against that background, this thesis considers the scope and limits of racial vilification legislation in Australia. It is argued that First Amendment jurisprudence is inadequate in the Australian context, because it is heavily dependent upon economic metaphors, individualistic notions of identity and outdated theories of communication. It assumes that 'free speech' in terms of lack of government intervention is essential to 'democracy'. It ignores the content, context and effect of harmful speech, except in extreme cases, with the result that socially harmful speech is protected in the name of 'free speech'. This has narrowed the parameters within which racial vilification is understood and hindered the development of a broader discourse on the realities of racist harms, and the mechanisms necessary for their redress. The author calls for the development of an Australian jurisprudence of harmful speech. Failing an Australian Bill of Rights, that jurisprudence would be grounded upon the implied constitutional right of free political speech, informed by an awareness that modern structures of public speech favour a very limited range of speech and speakers. The jurisprudence would take advantage of the insights of Critical Race Theory into the connections between racial vilification and racist behaviour, as well as the personal and social harms of racial vilification. Finally, it is argued that the concepts of human dignity and equality, which underpin European discrimination legislation and notions of justice, provide a way forward for Australian jurisprudence in this area.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Race discrimination</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Freedom of speech</field><field name="subject">Racism in language</field><field name="subject">Racism</field><field name="subject">Civil rights</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">External loads and the neural control of posture</field><field name="creator">Chew, John Zong Zheng, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the processes of human postural control. How do we keep still? In any action, the force required changes with limb position. This force-position relationship is elastic stiffness. Holding a desired posture requires muscle activation that accounts for this load property. The studies here examine the physiological processes of postural control as elastic stiffness changes. Psychophysical studies show that thresholds for detecting differences in load stiffness are large relative to those normally encountered. To discriminate stiffness, subjects made consistent movements and judged the force required and detection thresholds followed rules for force perception. For the purposes of postural control, stiffness per se is not a variable of primary interest. The effects of load stiffness on postural stability were investigated using a pendulum that allowed independent control of load force and stiffness. Postural stability varied with load stiffness and this effect was independent of load force. Performance deteriorated as load stiffness became more negative. Load-dependent changes were at low frequencies only, suggesting neural processes operating at long latency, and perhaps ???volitional??? tracking, are the key to postural control. Imposed perturbations evoke patterns of muscle activation reflecting the state of the neural pathways of postural control. Stretch responses obtained while subjects held different loads show that the short-latency spinal reflex and the long-latency functional reflex in the active flexor muscle are unaffected by load stiffness. However, a stereotyped response observed after stretch-reflex latency varied systematically with load stiffness, as did reciprocal activation of the antagonist extensor muscle. The long-latency reflex appears to be a part of a coordinated reciprocal response of antagonist muscle pairs. Adapting to load properties involves modulating these later neural responses. A method was developed, based on ultrasound, to track changes in muscle and tendon length associated with small postural movements. The relationship between wrist angle and muscle and tendon length in the active muscle changed with load stiffness. Particularly with negative-stiffness loads, the wrist moves on the end of a compliant tendon without corresponding changes in muscle length. Thus, compensation of postural performance by neural modulation is limited by the properties of muscle and tendon.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motor control</field><field name="subject">Posture</field><field name="subject">Proprioception</field><field name="subject">Muscle</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The health, wellbeing and work satisfaction of New South Wales?? correctional officers: a pilot study of randomly selected correctional officers in one NSW prison</field><field name="creator">Bond, Lynley Jane Mackay, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract: The role of correctional officers has undergone rapid changes in response to increased prisoner populations and professionalization of the workforce to respond to more diverse prisoner issues and problems, including high levels of prisoners with substance abuse and mental health issues, ageing prisoners, and increased prisoner cultural diversity.  Research into prisoner health has resulted in the implementation of strategies and some improvements in prisoner health.  However there has been no corresponding research into the health of correctional officers. The last comprehensive research into correctional officer health was conducted by Webster et al[1] in 1982.  Recently, in 2002, the New South Wales Auditor General raised correctional officers?? sick leave as an issue of concern.  This pilot study tested a questionnaire which included some comparison questions with Webster??s study, as well as researching some more recent health issues.  The questionnaire appeared overall to be valid and user friendly, and would be suitable for a larger study, albeit with minor alterations.  The results of the research, as expected of a small pilot study (n=30) generated more questions than answers, and raised areas to be tested in a larger research study.  Some results of this study were a reduction in correctional officer smoking levels from 1982 (Webster 44.3%, Australian population 39.1%), and a lower rate of smoking at 13%  than the general male population in Australia in 2004, at 18.6%.  Job satisfaction was almost twice as high as in 1982, yet correctional officers have almost half the level of occupational self esteem.   Correctional officers had higher levels of harmful alcohol consumption (10%,) than 1982 correctional officers (5%) and of the 2004 male population in Australia (7.5%), and the 1982 population (5%).  Occasional harmful alcohol consumption was almost twice as high amongst correctional officers (86%) than amongst other workers (42.8%).  A high percentage of correctional officers had been assaulted in the course of their work (76%), but few sought professional debriefing, with most preferring to discuss this with family members (54%) and co-workers (46%).  Although the mental health of correctional officers appears somewhat poorer than that of the general population, this, and any link between harassment or assault by prisoners and mental health and occupational self esteem and rewards requires further research.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Correctional officer</field><field name="subject">Prison</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formation, fate and transformation of products of iron oxidation in coastal waters</field><field name="creator">Bligh, Mark William, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Flux of ferrous iron (FeII) to the estuarine environment, whether from bottom sediments or via groundwater seepage, has been identified as a potentially important source of iron required for the development and sustenance of nuisance blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay, Queensland. However the rapid oxidation of FeII in seawater imparts importance to the resultant form of ferric iron (FeIII). Oxidation of FeII in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) results in a mixture of FeIII-NOM complex and amorphous ferric oxides (AFO). The fate of these oxidation products has implications for the supply of iron to L. majuscula where transformations over time scales of hours are likely to be important. In this thesis the process of oxidation of FeII in seawater in the presence of NOM and the subsequent transformations of the products of oxidation are investigated. UV and visible spectroscopic techniques were used to monitor the production of organically complexed FeIII for both NOM and a model organic compound. Kinetic modelling of data facilitated the examination of key reactions, especially those involving AFO. Controls on the reactivity and aging of AFO were investigated using two different dissolution reactions to measure reactivity. Light scattering techniques were used to probe the structure of AFO and X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to examine the coordination environment of Fe centres within AFO. Analysis of a kinetic model of iron transformations parameterised using the best available knowledge revealed large uncertainty surrounding the role of ligand classes in complex formation and dissociation and the role of AFO in both formation of oxidation products and the subsequent decay of organically complexed FeIII. Laboratory studies demonstrated that, within a wide range of initial concentrations, unstable mixtures of FeIII-NOM and AFO are produced from the oxidation of FeII in seawater containing NOM and that the organic complexes immediately commence transformation to AFO. Simulation using numerical kinetic modelling of the processes investigated indicated that AFO has a significant role in the processes of formation of oxidation products and dissociation of organically complexed FeIII. The rapid aging that AFO was recognised to undergo was successfully incorporated into the model though whether the aging was due toeither 1) increased coordination of Fe centres or 2) decreased Fe centre accessibility due to aggregation could not be ascertained from the model results. However, together with information regarding the coordination environment of the Fe centres and the particle and fractal structure of the aggregates, aggregation was considered most likely to be the factor responsible for the observed and modelled decreases in AFO reactivity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reacivity</field><field name="subject">Iron oxidation</field><field name="subject">Iron oxide</field><field name="subject">Aging</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The extreme right in Australia with particular reference to protestant Christianity 1945 to 2001</field><field name="creator">Alafaci, Francesco, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to provide a detailed analysis of the postwar movements active on the far right fringes of Australian society between 1945 and 2001. It traces the distinctive features of ultra rightist groups and organizations and discusses the similarities and differences between these forms of non conventional, sectarian behaviour. The study emphasizes the longevity of right wing extremist discourses linked mainly to ideologies that drew upon fundamentalist Christian conceptions of history and politics. My task is to demonstrate that most ultra-rightist types of activities appealed to the historical background of militant conservative mobilization around the issues of Protestantism, white racial ethnicity and Anglo-Saxon national identity. The analysis examines the programs, interrelationships and modus operandi of such groups and organizations and the liberal-democratic reaction to their activities. It concludes with some generalizations about the extreme right as well as offering some insights into the phenomenon's prospects in the early twenty-first century.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporary GPS CORS network for land reconstruction in Aceh, Sumatra</field><field name="creator">Adiyanto, Farid Hendro, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Using CORS networks for land reconstruction after earthquakes and tsunamis is challenging due to the limited infrastructure remaining after the event. Normally, CORS networks are set up in well established cities of regions with developed infrastructure and utilities. The functionality of a CORS approach is suitable to re-establish more than 10,000 land parcels in Aceh affected by the tsunami, but can this method still be useful with limited infrastructure? Also, can a CORS network feasibly re-establish cadastral land parcel boundaries previously based on bearings and distances using coordinates? This is a very crucial problem as often no survey marks exist to re-establish property boundaries. CORS networks can provide an external infrastructure allowing the identification of existing survey marks and the lay out of new and existing parcels for a large number of independent users. Using sophisticated network RTK algorithms, larger inter-receiver distances allow CORS networks 10 cover large areas with a minimal number of reference stations reducing the cost of operations. Also in equatorial regions, such as Aceh, where ionospheric activity is expected to be higher, a slightly denser array of CORS stations ensures reliable initialization.  This thesis tries to investigate the utilization of temporary CORS network approach; that is using some higher order stations as base station monuments, setting up a temporary CORS network over a small region and when operations are completed. packing up the system and moving to an adjacent network of high order monuments which comprise a new temporary CORS networks. Due to logistical consideration during the organization of this project, real-time communications were not used in Aceh and only GPS data was logged in the field. Reference stations logged 24 hours of GPS data and were processed using the free online service from AUSPOS. These coordinates are then used in a post-processed simulation mode using the Leica SpiderNet software.  As a comparison, there is a similar simulation that has been conducted using the well established network RTK GPS infrastructure that belongs to Singapore Land Authority (SLA) in Singapore. The Aceh data simulation showed that the network. RTK suffered from bad network geometry and lack of the common satellite number. On the other hand, the SLA data struggled in network ambiguity resolution due to ionospheric activity in equatorial region. Overall, single based and network RTK GPS is still reliable if it is used in land reconstruction in equatorial region. But it has to give more attention in the extending range and high density of reference stations.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A competency based theory of business partnering : an empirical study of Australian business-to-business partnerships</field><field name="creator">Gray, David Michael, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research, conceptualizes, operationalises and empirically tests a competency-based theory of business-partnering performance within an Australian business-partnering context. Drawing on theory from social psychology and marketing, the research integrates a number of theoretical approaches including resource-based theory, competency based theory, relational factors view, relational interaction theory, and competitive advantage theory to explain why some business partnerships are more successful than others are. The results use a ???process model of business-partnering??? performance to explain the interaction process through which business partners exploit the available partnering related ???operant resources??? and how these resources influence the performance of business partnerships and their ability to achieve a competitive advantage. Specifically, this research investigates a number of important internal resources, which facilitate the building, and maintaining of external businesspartner relations including ???joint alliance competence???, ???joint alliance structure???, ???interpersonal relational competence??? and ???market orientation???. This research shows that an adequate understanding of how these ???operant resources??? are deployed/accessed and co-created by the business partners to achieve a competitive advantage requires integration of ???relational interaction theory??? into ???resource-based theory??? and ???competency-based theory???. The results of this research show that those firms that pursue business partnerships as a competitive strategy can improve performance by engaging in a range of activities, which facilitate the building of ???relational capital??? of the partnership. The results provide support for conclusion that ???communication behaviour??? is a central and important mediating variable in the performance of business partnerships. Overall, the findings are consistent with the literature in finding support for the notion that ???joint alliance competence??? is a direct antecedent of businesspartnering performance. There is support for the notion that the partnership???s ability to govern and manage itself is an important determinant of ???communication behaviour??? and ???co-ordination behaviour???. The results identified ???market orientation???, ???co-ordination behaviour??? and ???relational capital??? as all having a direct influence on business-partnership profitability. Finally, given the relatively high failure rates of business partnerships this research provides greater opportunity for a discussion of the kinds of intervention strategies that could be used to minimise the risk of failure and/or to improve partnership performance.

decline of the Italian-run migrant workers&#65533; organisation FILEF during the 1970s in
Melbourne by reviewing and discussing some significant historical events. It does so in light of the existing literature, archival data and a string of oral accounts gathered from former and current key FILEF members and collaborators. It is hereby offering a better understanding of an otherwise poorly researched area of the Italian-Australian left-wing grassroots organisations in post-war Australia. The thesis has been divided into two parts, including introduction and conclusion. Part One (Chapters 1-5) reviews the historical and political background (in both Italy and Australia) that favoured the establishment of FILEF in Australia, including Melbourne, in the early 1970s; Part Two (Chapters 6-9) presents an
analysis of the historical development and socio-political role of FILEF Melbourne between 1972 and 1980.
Chapter One reviews the theoretical context, the representation of the history of FILEF in
previous publications, primary and secondary sources, the research strategy and methodology. Chapters Two and Three anchor the history of FILEF Melbourne to their respective background in Italy and Australia. That is, Chapter Two examines the post-war Italian emigration and its politicising by the Italian Left; Chapter Three focuses on the postwar emigration of Italians to Australia and outlines a profile of the Italian-Australian community. Chapter Four maps the route of the Italian-Australian Left in the 1950s and 1960s, that is from Italia Libera to the Lega Italo-Australiana. Chapter Five reviews the circumstances that led the establishment of the PCI in Australia respectively.
Chapter Six examines the origins and grassroots activism of FILEF in Melbourne in the 1970s, especially by looking at three areas of activity: migrant press, migrant welfare and
migrant politics. Chapter Seven researches the vulnerability of FILEF to the pressures of
conservative quarters by recounting the &#65533;Italian communist move in&#65533; (1975) and the federal
funding cut (1976) episodes. Chapter Eight, thoroughly revisits the Salemi case (1977), while
Chapter Nine explores the effects of the case and Salemi&#65533;s deportation on FILEF towards the
end of the 1970s.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Italian Federation of Emigrant Workers and their Families (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Italians - Melbourne - Political activity</field><field name="subject">Immigrants - Melbourne - Political activity</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism - Melbourne &#65533; History</field><field name="subject">Ethnic Community Organization - Melbourne &#65533; History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070823.143852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PARENT PARTICIPATION IN CURRICULUM DECISION MAKING: A CASE STUDY</field><field name="creator">Beagley, David Edward</field><field name="description">This study is an historical study of parent participation in school level decision making, particularly in curriculum issues, in relation to the Victorian Government policies of Devolution through the 1980s.  It was conducted as a case study of one rural secondary school, examining how the role of parents in the school&#65533;s curriculum development and associated decision making structures may have changed during the decade from the early 1980s to the early 1990s.

Three conceptual models were established, which served as analytical frameworks for the field data: a Theory model of how school level participation could operate, a Policies model deriving from the expectations of the major Government policies of the time, and an Historical model based on research and analyses of practice in Australia and overseas.

The findings indicate that little effective parent participation developed or took place in the school over the period under study.  Major contributing factors identified are the lack of policy direction and official mechanisms, especially in implementation of change, the definition of appropriate participant roles, the culture of traditional authorities in education (teacher in the classroom, principal in school processes and bureaucracy in administration), and the local factors of community attitudes and demographic profile.

While the local factors are significant, it is concluded that the policies did not provide sufficient direction or mechanism to overcome the entrenched culture of traditional authorities in schooling.  Changes in practice were directed more by the influence of specific personalities in single situations than any development of general attitude or institutional structure.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Parent participation</field><field name="subject">Parent school relationship</field><field name="subject">Policy implementation</field><field name="subject">Rural education</field><field name="subject">School administration</field><field name="subject">School councils</field><field name="subject">School community relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20041216.160407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perfection, Progress and Evolution: A Study in the History of Ideas</field><field name="creator">Berclouw, Marja E.</field><field name="description">The study of perfection, progress and evolution is a central theme in the history of
ideas. This thesis explores this theme seen and understood as part of a discourse in
the new fields of anthropology, sociology and psychology in the nineteenth century.
A particular focus is on the stance taken by philosophers, scientists and writers in
the discussion of theories of human physical and mental evolution, as well as on
their views concerning the nature of social progress and historical change. The
wisdom and feasibility of improving the human species is discussed alongside an
analysis of new methods of investigating and measuring physical and mental
attributes of the human organism. The instruments used to assess the development
of mind, body and society are described, and are viewed as part of an increased
emphasis on the use of technology as an integral part of modern life, and as a means
toward the ordered gathering of information in social-scientific practice. An
international perspective is taken by observing the way in which ideas about the
physical and mental development of humankind was discussed in light and
consequence of English and European scientific exploration in the Southern
Hemisphere. Further, an evaluation is made of the manner of the spread of new
thought in the social sciences from the intellectual and cultural &#65533;centre&#65533; of England
and Europe to the Anglo-European community located at the &#65533;periphery&#65533; in
Australia in the late nineteenth century. In particular the educative role played by the
non-professional enthusiast as a pivotal conduit for the dissemination of these ideas
is highlighted and linked back to a significant tradition of amateur scholarship as a
central phenomenon in the study of the history of ideas.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Idea (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Progress</field><field name="subject">Modern Philosophy</field><field name="subject">history of psychology</field><field name="subject">art and literature</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20061113.110150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Men's involvement in childbirth: implications for paternal identity</field><field name="creator">Chandler, Neale Anthony</field><field name="description">This research analyses the first paternal experience of childbirth and its affects on how men experience themselves as fathers. The study adopts a moral and philosophical standpoint, to ensure that the experiences of other key stakeholders in the childbirth realm are considered. This recognises that childbirth is women&#65533;s business, and how, as a male researcher, I have the potential to impose my views from a position of social dominance. 

Qualitative data were collected from twenty four participants who described their experiences of childbirth, in five focus groups. Participants were men whose first experience of childbirth occurred from as recently as one month to five years ago. Twelve participants were then involved in individual interviews to discuss, in depth, their experiences of fathering. An interview was also conducted with a midwife to illuminate her experiences of men and childbirth. 

Using interpretive interactionism as the chosen method for data analysis, I have identified the first paternal experience of childbirth as an epiphany in its major form. Epiphanies of which there are four types; the major, the cumulative, the minor illuminative and the relived, are those experiences that have the potential to transform and even radically alter peoples lives, and how they define themselves and their relations with others (Denzin,1989b:15). Data were phenomenologically analysed and six primary childbirth and fathering themes have been identified. 

Men&#65533;s first experience of childbirth entails emotions that range from fear and anger to awe and amazement. The reason that this life experience constitutes an epiphany for men, is that it affects how they experience themselves as fathers. The memory of their partner&#65533;s labour and birth pain is significant in how men construct their paternal identity.  Important to men is the ability to biologically sire a child, and in particular a son, the need to create the child in men&#65533;s own likeness and responsibility for financial provision and discipline of the child.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">male birth support</field><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">fatherhood</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">sociology</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050527.145459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narcissism and self-enhancement: Self-presentation, affect, and the moderating role of contingencies of self-worth.</field><field name="creator">Collins, David Russell</field><field name="description">Narcissists typically present themselves in self-enhancing ways to gain validation (through positive social appraisals) of grandiose, yet uncertain self-views. Using e-mail, Studies 1 and 2 investigated several intra- and interpersonal variables that may influence narcissists&#65533; self-presentational behaviour. University students rated themselves on self domains requiring either external validation (e.g., attractiveness) or internal validation (e.g., morality), after being randomly assigned to be either accountable or non-accountable to an evaluative audience for their self-ratings (Study 1), to present their self-ratings to either a single or multiple person evaluative audience (Study 2), and to expect to present their self-ratings to either a high or low status evaluative audience (Studies 1 and 2). Results suggested that when degree of external self-worth contingency (Crocker &amp; Wolfe, 2001) was high, narcissists were insensitive to strategic self-presentational requirements, presenting themselves in a typically self-enhancing manner on external domains when accountable and when presenting to a multiple person audience. Non-narcissists showed more contextual sensitivity when degree of external self-worth contingency was high, and were more modest when these social contextual variables were present. Participants in Study 3 were given bogus positive or negative personality feedback on either their moral virtue or competitive spirit. Narcissists reported greater anger after receiving negative feedback, while also responding to negative feedback with inflated self-presentations. A key finding was that the combination of a high degree of self-worth contingency and negative feedback resulted in increases in self-reported depression and drops in state self-esteem in narcissists. Results suggest that narcissists are chronically vigilant for self-enhancement opportunities, but may be insensitive to social constraints and norms in their efforts to construct their grandiose identities. Narcissists are especially vigilant for self-enhancement opportunities on contingent domains, yet when negative feedback is received in these domains where self-worth is staked, depression and lowered self-esteem may result.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narcissism</field><field name="subject">Personality</field><field name="subject">Emotion</field><field name="subject">Strategic Self-Presentation</field><field name="subject">Identity Formation</field><field name="subject">Identity Goals</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070503.165614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MEASURING ACTIVITY LIMITATION IN LOW BACK PAIN: A COMPARISON OF FIVE QUESTIONNAIRES</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Megan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the methods currently available to measure the functional outcomes of physiotherapy treatment for low back problems. As a preliminary step, all extant questionnaires were located and evaluated against practical criteria to determine their likely utility in clinical practice. This process identified a large number of questionnaires, however, only six back-specific questionnaires fulfilled the practical criteria for clinical application. Four of these questionnaires were selected for further evaluation along with a generic health status assessment instrument, the SF-36 Health Survey. Current recommendations suggest that a low-back specific and a generic questionnaire are required for comprehensive assessment of the impact of low back problems. The four back-specific questionnaires selected were the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and the Waddell Disability Index. An evaluation of the literature on the clinimetric properties of these questionnaires revealed that little information was available for the Quebec and Waddell questionnaires and no information was available for any of the questionnaires for a clinical population of people with low back pain seeking physiotherapy treatment in an Australian setting. The primary aim of the research was identify which, if any, of the questionnaires should be recommended for measuring outcomes of physiotherapy treatment for low back pain. Consecutive ambulatory (non-admitted) patients presenting for physiotherapy treatment at three public hospital physiotherapy outpatient departments, three community health services, and four private practices were invited to enter the study. Patients were included if they were seeking treatment for a low back problem, were aged 18 or over, and could read and write English. Subjects completed the questionnaires on two occasions six-weeks apart. One hundred and forty subjects returned the first set of questionnaires, and 106 the second set. The mean age of the sample at pre-test was 51 (SD 17) and ranged from 18 to 89 years. Sixty-six percent were female, 41% were employed and 12% were receiving compensation for their back problem. Duration of the back complaint was more than six weeks for 56% of subjects, and 60% reported five or more previous episodes or continuous pain. Referred pain in the buttock thigh or leg was reported by 70% of subjects. The first aim was to compare the questionnaires for acceptability and comprehensibility. Data quality was high for all the questionnaires (less than 5% missing data). As expected, subjects found the more complex SF-36 Health Survey more difficult to complete than three of the low-back questionnaires. However, less than 10% of subjects found any of the questionnaires more than a little difficult to complete. The next aim was to explore the internal structure and inter-relationships of the low-back questionnaires and the three physical scales of the SF-36 Health Survey (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical and Bodily Pain). Analysis of item-item correlation, item-total correlation and Cronbach&#65533;s alpha confirmed that all scales were internally consistent. Factor analysis confirmed item homogeneity (unidimensionality) of all questionnaires except the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. The questionnaires were significantly intercorrelated, but correlations exceeded .70 only for the Oswestry, Quebec and Waddell questionnaires. The next aim of the research was to compare test-retest reliability of the questionnaires. The Oswestry, Quebec and SF-36 Physical Functioning scale had sufficient reliability and scale width for clinical application. Despite previous reports of high reliability, the Roland-Morris scale was significantly less reliable than several of the other questionnaires. This indicates the importance of establishing the measurement properties of a test in the population or setting in which it will be used. The Waddell Disability Index, and the SF-36 Role-Physical and Bodily Pain scales had insufficient scale width to be useful in clinical practice. More than 15% of respondents had an initial score on these scales that would not allow change to be detected with 90% confidence. The next aim of the research was to compare the responsiveness of the questionnaires. None of the questionnaires was consistently identified as more or less responsive than the others although two methods (effect size and Liang&#65533;s standardized response mean) suggested the SF-36 Bodily Pain scale was more responsive than some other questionnaires. A secondary aim of this section was to evaluate the validity of the many available responsiveness indices and a novel &#65533;reliable change&#65533; method. A &#65533;known groups&#65533; strategy was used to determine whether the responsiveness index could discriminate between the low-back relevant questionnaires and the SF-36 General Health scale, the scores of which did not change across the retest period. With the exception of the novel &#65533;reliable change&#65533; method the responsiveness indices were all found to be valid indicators of responsiveness. Guyatt&#65533;s Responsiveness Index, effect size and Liang&#65533;s standardized response mean discriminated at 95% confidence between the reference scale and all the low-back questionnaires. The standardized response mean, t-test, correlation and ROC methods discriminated between the reference scale and five or six of the seven other questionnaires. Guyatt&#65533;s index was recommended as the best of the criterion-based methods, and the effect size the best of the distribution-based methods. The three questionnaires identified as having sufficient reliability and scale width, the Oswestry, Quebec and SF-36 Physical Functioning scale, were next analysed for data fit to a Rasch model. All three questionnaires had good data fit and item function was not affected by time, age, gender or whether or not subjects reported avoiding bending. The final aim of this research was to identify by Rasch analysis items to supplement the SF-36 Physical Functioning scale. The new scale, named the Low-Back SF-36 Physical Functioning18, showed comparable reliability and responsiveness to the SF-36 Physical Functioning scale. Further research is required to establish the measurement properties of the Low-Back SF-36 Physical Functioning18 scale in an independent sample. However, it has the potential to improve the clinical measurement of function by providing clinicians with a single measurement tool for comprehensive assessment of patients with low back pain.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low back pain</field><field name="subject">questionnaires</field><field name="subject">health measurement</field><field name="subject">psychometric properties</field><field name="subject">Rasch analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20051220.175347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING NURSES MOVING TOWARDS CONTEXTUAL COMPETENCE IN VICTORIA</field><field name="creator">Deegan, Johanna Christine</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to obtain an in-depth understanding of the perceptions of overseas-qualified nurses from non-English speaking backgrounds (NESB) in relation to their educational and socialisation experience whilst enrolled in a Competency Based Assessment Program (CBAP).

The study was conducted using a modified grounded theory approach. There were a total of seventeen participants; fourteen NESB nurses, and three teachers who were directly involved with their education in the CBAP. The NESB nurses who participated fell into three main groups in terms of their previous professional experience. These were:
&#65533;	Specialist 
&#65533;	Experienced generalist
&#65533;	Inexperienced generalist 
However, the level of skill and experience that the nurses brought to the educational and practice encounter made no difference to their experience of prejudice and lack of support, particularly in the clinical environment. The education and clinical experience they received challenged feelings of competency as much as they expanded feelings of competency. The NESB nurses&#65533; experiences of diversity also challenged their feelings of competence. In addition, the level of previous experience did not reduce the concern expressed by NESB nurses regarding the possibility of finding appropriate employment following registration. The implications of this for the profession and the health care system are that even the most experienced specialist and generalist nurses are not having their level of skill appropriately recognised and utilised in a timely way despite the current shortage of generalist and specialist nurses in Victoria. 
 

The outcome of the study led to the development of a model that has the potential to lead to a culture change in the clinical environment with a view to improving educational opportunities and experiences for NESB nurses who are enrolled in CBAP. In addition, the model has the potential to be useful in terms of providing local nurses with an opportunity to express their own thoughts and ideas in relation to the education of NESB nurses in the clinical environment. The model is based upon the theoretical perspectives of &#65533;productive diversity&#65533; and &#65533;clinical governance and organisational learning&#65533;.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-English speaking nurses</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">professional adjustment</field><field name="subject">contextual competence</field><field name="subject">Nurses -- Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Nurses -- Foreign</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20091123.101606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond Choice : Family and Kinship in the Australian lesbian and gay &#65533;baby boom&#65533;</field><field name="creator">Dempsey, Deborah</field><field name="description">Planned parenthood within the lesbian and gay communities attracts considerable attention internationally among researchers, the media, and law and policy-makers. This Australian study situates the phenomenon&#65533;also known as the &#65533;gayby boom&#65533;&#65533;within the contemporary Australian socio-legal setting and the more international historical and political contexts of Gay and Women&#65533;s Liberation. It investigates how beliefs about nature, kinship, the sexed and reproductive body and political ideologies of family intersect in lesbians and gay men&#65533;s decision-making and stories of living their lives as parents. Two fields of intellectual enquiry are generative: the interest in families of choice and family practices within sociology and the post-modern anthropological critique of Western kinship in the era of assisted reproduction.
This is a qualitative study informed by a critical humanist approach. It is based on in-depth and key informant interviews conducted with 20 lesbians and 15 gay men (parents, &#65533;donor/dads&#65533; and prospective parents) as well as 7 people engaged in legal, health or therapeutic support to prospective and current parents. Also incorporated into the analysis are a range of other primary sources, including a substantial media debate, submissions to an assisted reproduction law reform process and primary documents supplied by participants such as parenting agreements and letters.
The study argues for the need to look beyond unitary concepts such as families of choice when theorising lesbian and gay parenthood. It is important to consider the historical, political and biographical conditions that make some notions of relatedness and decisions about having children seem more feasible, and indeed, natural than others. It explores how various notions of biological relatedness remain important in the formation of parent/child relationships, and the extent to which lesbians and gay men rely on strategic appeals to choice and biology in enacting families. Continuing constraints on who is eligible for clinically assisted reproductive technology in Australia lead to imaginative and harmonious, yet also fraught reproductive relationships.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lesbian mothers</field><field name="subject">Lesbian couples</field><field name="subject">Family relationships</field><field name="subject">Children of gay parents</field><field name="subject">Gay parents</field><field name="subject">Gay fathers</field><field name="subject">kinship</field><field name="subject">donor insemination</field><field name="subject">surrogacy</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080530.164203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practised Ways of Being: Theorising Lesbians, Agency and Health</field><field name="creator">Dyson, Sue</field><field name="description">The contemporary field &#65533;lesbian health&#65533; was shaped by a range of social and political changes in the last third of the twentieth century, as well as by discourses originating in the historical regulation of lesbianism. In discourse, lesbians have been produced as invisible, passive victims of heterosexist and potentially homophobic health-care providers. This project sought to understand how lesbians produce and manage their own health, and their interactions with doctors and other health-care providers. The research questions asked how discourses about lesbianism and the construction of the lesbian health field influence the ways in which lesbians construct and manage their own health, and how lesbians position themselves as they negotiate clinical spaces. Using semi-structured interviews, 19 women, aged between 22 and 64 years, who identified as lesbian, gay, same-sex-attracted and queer were interviewed. Interview data were analysed using discourse and content analysis.
When they engaged with the health-care system, some participants produced their lesbianism as a social matter of no relevance to health; while for others their lesbianism was central to their health. An analysis of power relations revealed the complexity of ways the participants used agency to speak or remain silent about their sexual orientation. This was motivated by complex embodied understandings about the potential for emotional, physical or ontological harm involved in coming out in clinical spaces. Some chose to remain silent all, or some of the time, others to assertively identify themselves as lesbian. This depended on a range of contemporaneous factors including safety concerns, past experience and personal judgement. Whether to come out or not in the medical encounter was not necessarily a conscious decision, but was shaped by the individual&#65533;s embodied &#65533;sense for the game&#65533;. While the health-care system had frequently provided less than optimum care, these women were not passive, but used agency to decide whether or not their sexual orientation was relevant to the medical encounter.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lesbian health</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">coming out</field><field name="subject">sexual orientation</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080630.162510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Blueprint for the Evaluation of an Ombudsman&#65533;s Office: A Case Study of the ICANN Office of the Ombudsman</field><field name="creator">Fowlie, Frank</field><field name="description">The title of this dissertation incorporates two key terms that define the work. First, the reader should view the paper by as a blueprint for evaluation which, like all generic blueprints, can be amended to fit the terrain, augmented based on new information or technology, or reduced to fit a stricter budget. It is also very much a blueprint that is developed from an action-oriented case study of an ombudsman, and is, therefore, relevant and tested.
A long-standing question in the ombudsman community has been how to evaluate ombudsman operations without impugning the determining characteristics of an ombudsman: independence, impartiality, and confidentiality.
There has been a lack of information or guidance, especially at the practitioner level, on how ombudsmen can develop meaningful evaluations without violating confidences or independence. This dissertation provides practitioners with tools that will enable them to conduct evaluations to determine information about ombudsman operations, formulation, and improvements.
The dissertation also provides information on two areas of interest for ombudsmen. First, it focuses on the design, development, reporting on, and assessment of a multipronged evaluation approach for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Office of the Ombudsman. This review also considers the somewhat scarce existing literature in the field.
Second, this dissertation fills the gap in the existing literature by developing a practitioner&#65533;s guide to evaluation techniques. The evaluation research is developed and conducted with the ICANN Ombudsman by designing, implementing, and assessing a number of evaluation techniques: selfevaluation, client surveys, benchmarking activities, and the like.
The ICANN Office of the Ombudsman is a unique entity. It conducts online dispute resolution as an ombudsman. It is likely the first, if not the only online ombudsman operation anywhere. The ICANN Ombudsman has jurisdiction over complaints concerning the actions, decisions, or inactions of the ICANN Board of Directors, staff, or supporting organizations. It conducts its work using a wide variety of alternative dispute resolution techniques: negotiation, mediation, shuttle diplomacy, good offices, fact finding, investigation, and reporting and recommendation.
All this research is important, not simply to fill gaps in the literature, but to provide the growing ombudsman community with cost-effective tools that enable them to determine any gaps in community service, jurisdiction, or activity; to determine whether there are adequate resources; and to justify retention of either the incumbent or the programme generally. This is a set of skills and action plans that are in high demand by the community, and this dissertation provides the first major steps to meet that demand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ombudsman</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090402.093151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participation in Government Disability Advisory Bodies in Australia: An Intellectual Disability perspective.</field><field name="creator">Frawley, Patsie</field><field name="description">This qualitative study examined the participatory experiences of people with an intellectual disability as members of government disability advisory bodies in Australia. These forums are one of the strategies adopted by governments to enable people with an intellectual disability to participate in the formulation of social policy. Such opportunities have arisen from progressive policy that frames people with an intellectual disability as full citizens with equal rights to inclusion and participation in society. 
Little research has considered how people with an intellectual disability experience the participatory opportunities that have grown from this recognition of their rights. This reflects the more traditional focus on their status and participation as consumers and service users. The central question of this study is how people with an intellectual disability experience participation in government advisory bodies, and how such forums can be inclusive and meaningful. 
This study positions people with an intellectual disability as the experts about their own experiences by relying primarily on their first person accounts of their experiences. Ethnographic and case study methods were employed including in-depth interviews with the central participants, document analysis, observation of the work of the advisory bodies and interviews with others involved in advisory bodies. Analysis led to the development of a typology of participation that describes the political and personal orientations people have to participation. 
The study found that structures and the processes used by advisory bodies can mediate people&#65533;s experiences; however more significantly, the experiences of people with intellectual disability are shaped by their perception of how they are regarded by others. Central to this is the efficacy of support based on the development of collegiate relationships, similar to the notion of civic friendship described by Reinders (2002), rather than support that is solely focussed on tangible accommodations 
The study concludes that citizen participation bodies have not fully recognised the personal and political potential of members with an intellectual disability. It presents evidence that people with an intellectual disability are capable of this form of participation, can provide legitimate and informed perspectives on policy and can engage meaningfully, given full recognition of their capacity to participate as well as structures and processes that enable this.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Policy participation</field><field name="subject">Participation support</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090122.114029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Conceptual and Empirical Utility of Social Capital for Public Health</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Deborah Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis evaluates the utility of &#65533;social capital&#65533; for public health in four dimensions (communication, explanation, practice and measurement) and at two levels (macro and micro), using interviews with public health workers and a theoretical analysis of social capital. It concludes that the concept is potentially useful for public health but that there are limitations to its utility, arising from the presence of two competing discourses or world views identified in the social capital literature: the rational choice discourse and the political economy discourse.

This thesis argues that although social capital is widely perceived to have rhetorical leverage in macro-level policy debates, its contested meaning draws into question the value of any consensus built on the glossing over of different world views. The concept has no value for communication at the micro level.

The rational choice theory of social capital appears useful for explaining the social determinants of health although it does not adequately account for the power structures which shape and constrain access to social capital, and it undervalues many aspects of social relationships. The political economy approach is more useful in these respects but is far more complex and difficult to quantify. It is unclear whether either of these theories adds much value to the existing literature which social capital tends to eclipse.

The concept has limited value for public health practice, as the dual world views embedded in it can be used to support widely varying policy directions. It is also limited by its inability to describe the dynamics of change or to identify levers for initiating change.

The meaningfulness of social capital indicators is compromised by the reductionism of the rational choice paradigm. The political economy discourse renders the development of quantitative indicators far more problematic but may be useful for informing qualitative research.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">social determinants of health</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050509.131918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community, Attachment, Structures And The Epidemic. CASE A Study of the Importance of Gay Community in the Lives of Gay Men.</field><field name="creator">Grierson, Jeffrey</field><field name="description">Community, Attachment, Structures and the Epidemic maps some of the changes in gay men&#65533;s experience and conceptualisation of community that have occurred during the AIDS epidemic. Social identity theory has been employed to investigate the social-psychological aspects of gay identity at personal, social and community levels. The study compares three generations of gay men in Melbourne; pre- peri- and post-AIDS. As a starting point, the study employed focus groups to explore basic conceptions of gay community. In the first of two major data collection phases, 32 gay men between the ages of 18 and 40 participated in semistructured interviews of between 45 minutes and one and a half hours. The interviews explored the men&#65533;s social networks, past and present relationship to the commercial gay scene, feelings about gay organisations businesses, neighbourhoods, entertainment, aesthetics, the way they see other gay people, their thoughts about the impact of AIDS on gay communities and their aspirations for gay communities. The second phase of data collection utilised a questionnaire developed from the analysis of the interviews. The 55 item questionnaire covered demographic information, coming out history, initial experiences of the gay world, friendship networks, feelings about the institutions, people and conceptual elements of gay community, items concerning practices of gay community, the community attachment subscale from the SAPA study and items on HIV/AIDS. The questionnaire was completed by 432 gay men, 207 recruited at the Midsumma carnival, an annual gay and lesbian event in Melbourne and 225 through the mailing list of the Victorian AIDS Council. Analysis of the questionnaire data uncovered a complex constellation of difference in the conceptualisation and experience of gay community between the groups, particularly with regard to the content and boundaries of the category &#65533;gay community&#65533;. The research challenges practice based models of gay community attachment and proposes a more dynamic, fluid and multi-dimensional conceptualisation of gay social identity.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="subject">Social Identity</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="subject">Homosexuality</field><field name="subject">MSM</field><field name="subject">Networks</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090129.123239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental health and primary health care: towards a new workforce model</field><field name="creator">Hanna, Elizabeth Gayle (Liz)</field><field name="description">Public health was once synonymous with environmental health. However, as living conditions improved the two fields diverged. Environmental factors are again re-emerging as hazards human health. Increasing global reliance on agricultural and veterinary chemicals (AgVets) over recent decades has is now a serious public health concern.  Evidence of their toxicity has prompted international efforts to minimize, monitor and manage exposure risks. Direct involvement of the primary health care workforce is seen as critical to this process, yet little data exists on the health burden on Australian rural communities imposed by these chemicals. 

The study presented here attempts to explore the impact of these chemicals on two rural communities in Victoria, and ascertain the how the existing primary heath care system responds to AgVet exposure issues. Health determinants are complex, and inter-related, and the client &#65533;provider interface is not an entity acting in isolation from other frameworks. The provider-client service relationship has evolved against a background of legislation and provider training. Many external factors also impinge, such as the structure and focus of the health sector, and Australia&#65533;s systematic approach to environmental and chemical management. Examination of this underlying infrastructure in Australia provided the background against which the issue of exposure to agricultural and veterinary chemicals was explored. A brief summary of international developments in this area served to provide insight as to what interventions may be introduced to address the issue of chemical exposure.

A CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interview) survey of 1050 households sought the perspectives from two Victorian agricultural communities to gather self-reported AgVet exposure patterns and health data, and whether respondents perceived their health problems were linked to exposure. Respondents were also asked to comment on the primary health care service experiences from local providers, and which services they preferred to seek for health advice. Perspectives were then sought from all primary health care providers servicing these communities.  Information was sought on their level of expertise in diagnosing, and managing exposure related illness, via face-to-face interviews, focus groups and paper surveys. 

The study revealed rural communities have a long history of hazardous exposure to toxic AgVets. Awareness of toxicity risks is growing, yet further scope exists to improve safe handling of chemicals. High levels of illnesses known be associated with AgVet exposure exist among rural populations. Many believe their own ill-health is linked to exposure, and express strong dissatisfaction with the apparent lack of environmental health expertise especially among their GPs. Health providers demonstrated limited understanding of the health impacts of AgVet exposure. 

The lack of environmental health expertise among the existing primary health care workforce means that health conditions associated with exposure to AgVets are not being identified, and the absence of health intelligence hampers health planning. In Australia, the health, environment and primary industries sectors function in effect, as distinct silos, with little cross-fertilisation. The United States has combined its agricultural chemical legislative authority to develop a focus on human health, establish direct links, and biomonitoring programs to protect human heath. The U.S. has also developed environmental health expertise at the primary health care level to address community needs as they arise. Strategies are required in Australia to connect the environment, chemical management and health portfolios, with respect to the emerging environmental issues of chemical exposure. There is a need also in Australia to inject environmental health capacity into the primary health care practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">rural health</field><field name="subject">farmwork</field><field name="subject">environmental health</field><field name="subject">agricultural chemicals</field><field name="subject">pesticides</field><field name="subject">toxicity</field><field name="subject">health service management</field><field name="subject">chemical regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20061110.152550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BREAKING THE MIND-FORG&#65533;D MANACLES :
a study of adolescent transformation</field><field name="creator">Heywood, Peta</field><field name="description">This study has adopted the metaphor of &#65533;mind-forged manacles&#65533; to explore adolescent
transformation within an educational context. It does this by examining the experiences of
two groups of people who participated in an intensive, one-off personal development
program for adolescents, known as Discovery. The first study involves secondary school
students for whom the program was part of the school curriculum. The second study
consists of an older group of people who did the program during their adolescence and
outside the formal education system. The third study is a contemplation of transformation
derived from my experience as researcher during the course of completing this thesis.
In an attempt to reflect the perspectival worldview from within which the study is created I have drawn on a range of theorists. To integrate their ideas I created three different &#65533;lenses&#65533;
or ways of viewing the data. The first lens is developed from consciousness theory, the
second from process philosophy and complex self-organising systems theory, and the third
from individual humanistic psychology. The educational pedagogy is holistic and embraces
developmental models of thinking and learning. The study uses participant reflection to
argue that a program of intentionally focussed challenges, combined with the support that
enables these challenges to be successfully met, can be transformational for many young
people. It suggests that the complex postmodern world requires teachers to be aware of
their own and their students&#65533; consciousness, and demands learning experiences that are
deliberately focussed on helping the process of consciousness transformation rather than
only on achieving predetermined outcomes. Transformation is understood as a shift to a
different order of consciousness in which it is how one sees rather than what one sees that
changes. With each shift towards a new order of consciousness the mind-forged manacles are
loosed and individuals accept increasing responsibility for their lives and how they live them.
Educational programs can be developed to assist this process.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Change Psychology</field><field name="subject">Attitude change</field><field name="subject">Adolescent psychology</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Teenagers</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Participant observation</field><field name="subject">Consciousness</field><field name="subject">Youth development</field><field name="subject">Transformation</field><field name="subject">Transformative learning</field><field name="subject">Experiential learning</field><field name="subject">Ways of knowing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20081210.150230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TIED TO THE COSMOS BY THE HEARTSTRINGS : AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY OF ART THERAPY WITH AN INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA</field><field name="creator">Hirschhorn, Yael</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is to investigate the use of art therapy in the treatment of an individual diagnosed with schizophrenia.

At La Trobe University, Australia: Academic And Related Challenges</field><field name="creator">Kole, John Kirwa Tum</field><field name="description">This study involves an exploration of the perceptions of four overseas Kenyan students about their educational experiences at La Trobe University. A related aim of this research is to find out how these four students&#65533; previous learning in Kenya affects their learning and living experiences in Australia, for instance, in terms of demands associated with differences in learning and teaching styles, cultural expectations and proficiencies in English.

A non-positivist, qualitative methodology is adopted for this research which employs an interview-based case study approach. Qualitative research demands that the world be approached with the assumption that nothing is trivial and that everything has the potential of being a clue which might unlock more comprehensive understanding of what is being researched. 

While the findings of this study confirm current understandings of the issues that international students commonly face, they also provide a more complex and individualized picture of the needs and aspirations of overseas Kenyan students. As the case studies demonstrate, the academic and related challenges four Kenyan students have encountered at La Trobe University are best understood in relation to several contexts. The difficulties these international students have experienced in the context of transition or border crossing &#65533; between two countries, cultures and educational systems &#65533; were exacerbated by inadequate pre-departure preparation and orientation on arrival. Incongruities between two educational systems &#65533; in particular between their prior teacher-centred schooling in Kenya and the unfamiliar student-centred university education in Australia &#65533; colour the academic and related challenges such students struggle to address, at least in their initial year at University. The broader, global context of the commodification and marketization of higher education &#65533; along with increasing strains of an under-resourced university sector in Australia &#65533; also impinge upon the lives of these four La Trobe students, in a variety of ways.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Overseas students</field><field name="subject">academic and related challenges</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090130.115451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEYS:
MOTIVATIONS BEHIND FRONTIER TRAVEL EXPERIENCES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR TOURISM MARKETING</field><field name="creator">Laing, Jennifer H.</field><field name="description">Tourists are now visiting some of the most remote and amazing places on Earth, travelling to &#65533;frontiers&#65533; on journeys that are psychological and emotional as well as geographical or physical. These extraordinary journeys to the Poles, the peaks of the highest mountains in the world, harsh deserts and even outer space test both physical and mental endurance and can be characterised as &#65533;unique&#65533; even in the current era. Travelling largely without the aid of a commercial tour operator or guide, the frontier traveller usually invests a great deal of time and resources in their travel experience, often with the assistance of sponsorship, and generally takes part in an extensive and arduous preparation period in their quest for the extraordinary. While the search for new and unique tourism destinations and experiences appears to be relentless in this post-modern era, the frontier traveller appears to be searching for the &#65533;authentic&#65533; beyond the &#65533;tourist bubble,&#65533; both in relation to self and setting. These frontier &#65533;trailblazers&#65533; are already being followed by guided adventure tourists and some of the former are supplementing their incomes and funding their own travel by leading tours or guiding others to the frontier. Studying the extraordinary experiences of the frontier traveller could therefore provide us with a glimpse of the future of travel, although likely to occur in a more structured and less risky guise. Uncovering the motivations for this form of travel will also assist with future marketing of these experiences, including elements of the marketing mix such as product development and promotion.

This thesis examines the motivations behind frontier travel and considers the implications of the findings for tourism marketing. Unstructured, long interviews with 37 individuals were used to uncover the motivations behind these experiences, supplemented by content analysis of narratives produced by frontier travellers, encompassing 50 autobiographies, two online diaries and online interviews with two individuals. The interview participants were largely selected through purposive sampling, in that they were screened as fitting the criteria of a past or potential frontier traveller before being interviewed. They were predominantly born and living in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and 29 of the 37 individuals were male. Ages of participants ranged from 24 to 60 years of age. Interviews continued until saturation of categories of motivation had been reached. Texts were mainly located through searches of bookshops and libraries, including the author&#65533;s personal library. A qualitative methodological approach was chosen in order to provide rich data and allow the researcher to enter the world of the frontier traveller. An interpretive paradigm based on a constructivist paradigm underpinned this study, with an ontological stance based on multiple realities and an epistemological position where participants and myself as the researcher created understandings. The methodology outlined above was consistent with this position and was designed to identify different constructions of the data and seek consensus, where possible. The literature on motivations provides a complex plethora of theories and models, many of which contradict each other, so a principal objective of this study was to work from first principles, grounding a theory of motivations pertaining to frontier travel experiences in the data, rather than seeking to test out a pre-existing model or theory.

Overall, the research findings show that motivations for frontier travel can be analysed under the broad heading of &#65533;adventure,&#65533; which is composed of a variety of sub-motives such as achievement and competence, challenge, thrill-seeking and sensation, ego, dreams or fantasies, self-actualisation, cognizance (exploration/discovery), freedom/escape motives (autonomy), isolation and solitude, spirituality, camaraderie and communitas, authenticity, prestige (external rewards), pro-social motives and a love of nature and wilderness. Risk or danger is an element of these experiences and feeds into many of the motivations identified in this study. A theory of motivations behind frontier travel experiences has been developed, covering intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, as well as achievement-motivated behaviour. Pre-travel influences and inspirations such as literature, cinema, visual stimuli, childhood games, heroes and mentors, family influences and educative influences are also considered with respect to their effect on motivational behaviour. An exploratory typology was then developed for frontier travellers, based on common motivations, which might be used to segment the market. Four basic types have been identified and labelled or categorised as &#65533;Seekers of Truth,&#65533; &#65533;Enlightened Explorers,&#65533; &#65533;Concerned Elitists,&#65533; and &#65533;Freedom Seekers.&#65533; Key motivations behind specific frontier travel experiences have also been identified.

Each frontier traveller will exhibit some, but not all, of the motivations highlighted in this study. Segmenting the market on the basis of motivations may therefore be a difficult, if not impossible task. However, marketers could use the information unearthed during this study in the marketing mix to develop new products aimed at satisfying some of the key motivations and use the findings as themes to be highlighted in promotional literature such as brochures and websites. This thesis also argues that the study of travel motivations in the future would be better served by considering motivations behind market niches such as frontier travel, rather than attempting to develop a comprehensive theory of motivations covering the whole travel industry.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extreme tourism</field><field name="subject">extreme tourists</field><field name="subject">frontier travel</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">travel</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">adventure</field><field name="subject">extreme travel</field><field name="subject">niche travel</field><field name="subject">destination</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070516.142914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relating Women : Lesbian Experience of Friendship</field><field name="creator">Lienert, Tania Marie</field><field name="description">Friends are of crucial importance to lesbians&#65533; lives, their significance heightened due to lack of acceptance from blood family, work colleagues and society. Despite a proliferation of literature on lesbians&#65533; love relationships, lesbians&#65533; friendships remain understudied. In the light of theorising about widespread shifts in intimacy patterns in modern industrial societies, this thesis examines the role of friendship for contemporary lesbians. It takes an interdisciplinary approach, using lesbian feminist, feminist psychological and mainstream sociological theories to interpret lesbians&#65533; negotiations of their friendships and preoccupations with their own continually developing sense of self. The study finds that firstly, the most significant issue in negotiating friendships is deciding on a lesbian identity despite socialisation to &#65533;compulsory heterosexuality&#65533;. Friends are expected to be accepting and supportive or they are lost. Discrimination, the fact that the lover is the &#65533;best friend&#65533;, struggles with difference in lesbian communities, time constraints and a more general shift to individualism mean that community and family contacts are replaced by small, supportive and affirming friendship networks. These meet needs and within them lesbians negotiate a sense of self, but for the most part with no template of political consciousness. Secondly, while friendships are important, they are also difficult. The fluidity of the friendship relationship, blurred boundaries between friends and lovers, and women&#65533;s moral &#65533;imperative to care&#65533; all provide barriers to communication. Thirdly, while lesbians value &#65533;the relational self&#65533;, a confident sense of self is challenged when close-connected relationships sit at odds both with mainstream, heterocentric culture, and with traditional models of psychology which promote independence and separateness. Lesbians who are confident communicators, who have access to alternative feminist discourses which value relatedness, and who, together with their friends, are open to change, are able to negotiate satisfactory friendships and relationships. The study demonstrates lesbians&#65533; complex subjectivities as changing selves are negotiated through friendships, love relationships and communities, particularly through experiences of loss.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">female friendship</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">social networks</field><field name="subject">interpersonal relations</field><field name="subject">lesbians</field><field name="subject">intimacy</field><field name="subject">lesbianism</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20041006.114625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of Chilling-Related Postharvest Rind Breakdown of Navel Oranges (Citrus Sinensis (L.)

In this study, external symptoms of CI were related to patterns of cellular collapse in affected flavedo tissue, and a classification system developed to aid consistent symptom identification and improve communication within the supply chain. 
Potential markers of senescence were evaluated because older fruit were found to be more susceptible to CI.  Electrolyte leakage, moisture content and protein content of flavedo tissue were ineffective indicators of both senescence and chilling stress.  Rind colour and internal maturity were generally good indicators of fruit age, but lacked sensitivity over short time periods to be of use.
Although there was a strong seasonal effect on CI incidence, pre-storage treatments, including hot water and methyl jasmonate, generally reduced the incidence of CI.  Because these treatments elicit defence responses that protect tissue from chilling stress, the response and efficiency of plant defence systems is probably an important factor in chilling tolerance.
The concentration of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) in flavedo tissue was lower in fruit that were stored at a chilling temperature (1&#65533;C) compared to fruit that were stored at a non-chilling temperature (12&#65533;C) and lipid peroxidation did not increase during storage at 1&#65533;C.  There was also a lower concentration of LOOH in the chilling sensitive variety than in the chilling tolerant variety.  Therefore, increased lipid peroxidation is not related to chilling stress and subsequent injury but the results do suggest a role for LOOH in stress signalling.  Antioxidant activity in the lipophilic fraction of flavedo tissue extracts increased as fruit senesced and was strongly correlated with carotenoid content.  LOOH concentrations in flavedo tissue also increased as fruit senesced.  The antioxidant activity of both the lipophilic and hydrophilic fractions of flavedo tissue extracts was higher in fruit stored at 12&#65533;C than in fruit stored at 1&#65533;C.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Citrus</field><field name="subject">cold storage</field><field name="subject">temperature stress</field><field name="subject">cross-tolerance</field><field name="subject">oxidation</field><field name="subject">oxidative stress.</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080526.093527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE RHETORIC OF RECONCILIATION:
EVIDENCE AND JUDICIAL SUBJECTIVITY IN CUBILLO v COMMONWEALTH</field><field name="creator">Luker, Trish</field><field name="description">In August 2000, Justice O&#65533;Loughlin of the Federal Court of Australia handed down the decision in Cubillo v Commonwealth in which Lorna Cubillo and Peter Gunner took action against the Commonwealth Government, arguing that it was vicariously liable for their removal from their families and communities as children and subsequent detentions in the Northern Territory during the 1940s and 1950s. The case is the landmark decision in relation to legal action taken by members of the Stolen Generations.
Using the decision in Cubillo as a key site of contestation, my thesis provides a critique of legal positivism as the dominant jurisprudential discourse operating within the Anglo-Australian legal system. I argue that the function of legal positivism as the principal paradigm and source of authority for the decision serves to ensure that the debate concerning reconciliation in Australia operates rhetorically to maintain whiteness at the centre of political and discursive power. Specifically concerned with the performative function of legal discourse, the thesis is an interrogation of the interface of law and language, of rhetoric, and the semiotics of legal discourse.
The dominant theory of evidence law is a rationalist and empiricist epistemology in which oral testimony and documentary evidence are regarded as mediating the relationship between proof and truth. I argue that by attributing primacy to principles of rationality, objectivity and narrative coherence, and by privileging that which is visually represented, the decision serves an ideological purpose which diminishes the significance of race in the construction of knowledge.
Legal positivism identifies the knowing subject and the object of knowledge as discrete entities. However, I argue that in Cubillo, Justice O&#65533;Loughlin inscribes himself into the text of the judgment and in doing so, reveals the way in which textual and corporeal specificities undermine the pretence of objective judgment and therefore the source of judicial authority.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stolen generations Australia</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians Legal status laws</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australian Children Government policy</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians Removal</field><field name="subject">Legal Judgments Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">Cubillo</field><field name="subject">Lorna</field><field name="subject">Gunner</field><field name="subject">Peter</field><field name="subject">Australia Federal Court Gunner v Commonwealth of Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia Federal Court Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia</field><field name="subject">Reconciliation Australia</field><field name="subject">Evidence legal</field><field name="subject">Testimony legal</field><field name="subject">Critical legal theory</field><field name="subject">Jurisprudence feminist</field><field name="subject">Whiteness</field><field name="subject">Textual analysis law</field><field name="subject">Subjectivity judicial</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080305.105209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A longer working life for Australian women of the baby boom generation? &#65533; Women&#65533;s voices and the social policy implications of an ageing female workforce</field><field name="creator">Merkes, Monika</field><field name="description">With an increasing proportion of older people in the Australian population and increasing health and longevity, paid work after the age of 65 years may become an option or a necessity in the future. The focus of this research is on Australian women of the baby boom generation, their working futures, and the work-retirement decision. This is explored both from the viewpoint of women and from a social policy perspective. The research draws on Considine&#65533;s model of public policy, futures studies, and Beck&#65533;s concept of risk society. The research comprises three studies. Using focus group research, Study 1 explored the views of Australian women of the baby boom generation on work after the age of 65 years. Study 2 aimed to explore current thinking on the research topic in Australia and overseas. Computer-mediated communication involving an Internet website and four scenarios for the year 2020 were used for this study. Study 3 consists of the analysis of quantitative data from the Healthy Retirement Project, focusing on attitudes towards retirement, retirement plans, and the preferred and expected age of retirement. The importance of choice and a work &#65533; life balance emerged throughout the research. Women in high-status occupations were found to be more likely to be open to the option of continuing paid work beyond age 65 than women in low-status jobs. However, the women were equally likely to embrace future volunteering. The research findings suggest that policies for an ageing female workforce should be based on the values of inclusiveness, fairness, self-determination, and social justice, and address issues of workplace flexibility, equality in the workplace, recognition for unpaid community and caring work, opportunities for life-long learning, complexity and inequities of the superannuation system, and planning for retirement. Further, providing a guaranteed minimum income for all Australians should be explored as a viable alternative to the current social security system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">labor supply-Australia</field><field name="subject">life span-productive</field><field name="subject">age and employment-Australia</field><field name="subject">women employees</field><field name="subject">baby boom generation-Australia</field><field name="subject">women's rights</field><field name="subject">retired women-Australia</field><field name="subject">retirees</field><field name="subject">female workforce</field><field name="subject">retirement</field><field name="subject">futures studies</field><field name="subject">scenario planning</field><field name="subject">Internet research</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">online research</field><field name="subject">public health research</field><field name="subject">population</field><field name="subject">retirement planning</field><field name="subject">retirement income</field><field name="subject">retirement savings</field><field name="subject">seniors</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">older women</field><field name="subject">computer mediated communication</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20051103.104704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE HUMAN COSTS AND BENEFITS OF WORK: JOBLOAD, SELF-PERCEIVED PERFORMANCE, AND EMPLOYEE WELLBEING.</field><field name="creator">Miller, Peta</field><field name="description">The primary purpose of this project was to investigate some relationships between workload and employee wellbeing.  The necessary first stage was to formulate a theoretical framework &#65533; the JobLoad Model &#65533; to support a comprehensive and detailed investigation of the main factors that contribute to a job's workload.  Building on the ergonomics concept of &#65533;workload&#65533;, this Model incorporates task- and job-level factors that have been identified within the research literatures of physical and cognitive ergonomics as important; additional constructs were added to take account of additional factors shown to be relevant to employee wellbeing, drawing on evidence from occupational health and organizational psychology literatures. Using this framework, available questionnaire-based measurement instruments for assessing workload and employee wellbeing were reviewed, new items were developed as required, and the JobLoad Index (JLI) was developed.
The JLI was used to collect data from public servants in two different workplaces, with participation rates of 63% and 73% respectively.  Relationships were determined between major task, job and organisational environment factors, self-perceived performance adequacy, and various aspects of employee wellbeing including job satisfaction, physical discomfort and psychological fatigue, stress and arousal. For a sub-sample of participants in one of the two workplaces, levels of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol were also measured from 24-hour urine collections.
The factors measured by the JLI accounted for a very substantial proportion of variance in these various dimensions of work-related wellbeing.  The results provide potentially very useful insights into the relative influences of a wide range of work- and job-related variables on people's perceived abilities to cope with their job demands, and on several aspects of their wellbeing.  Further, the importance of measuring multiple dimensions of wellbeing, and differentiating their separate sets of work-related determinants, was well demonstrated.  Finally, and perhaps most significantly, this study has identified the powerful role that self-perceived performance plays as an intervening variable between job demands and people's work-related wellbeing.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Workload</field><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">body part discomfort</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">self rated performance capacity</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">cortisol</field><field name="subject">adrenaline</field><field name="subject">noradrenaline</field><field name="subject">job content</field><field name="subject">job control</field><field name="subject">support.</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070319.145144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">JUDGEMENTS AS SOCIAL NARRATIVE:
AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF APPEAL JUDGEMENTS IN CLOSELY CONTESTED PARENTING DISPUTES 
IN THE FAMILY COURT OF AUSTRALIA 1988 &#65533; 1999</field><field name="creator">Moloney, Lawrence</field><field name="description">The thesis is divided into two sections. Section 1 explores the psycho-social and legal constructions of family, parenting and children that have influenced judicial decision-making in parenting disputes following separation and divorce. Particular attention is paid, first, to the circumstances surrounding the shift from paternal to maternally-based presumptions about the parenting of children; and second, to the more recent and somewhat puzzling shift to a presumption of gender neutrality. The extent to which fault has continued as a less overt decision-making criterion is also considered.
	In Section 2, judgements in recent closely contested parenting cases in the Family Court of Australia are analysed as contemporary socio-legal narratives. A systematic, in-depth examination of a heterogeneous sample of publicly accessible cases revealed that gender-based assumptions continue to dominate judicial thinking about parenting and family structure. In particular, it was found that outcomes that favoured mothers correlated with perceived evidence of conformity to a maternal stereotype of self-sacrifice on behalf of the child(ren). Outcomes favouring fathers usually resulted from situations in which mothers were judged to fall short of these stereotyped expectations. Fathers&#65533; roles, even in cases in which their applications were successful, generally continued to be equated with breadwinning and support. Their capacities as nurturers to their children were either not mentioned or treated with scepticism.
	In the light of the findings, tensions between continuing gender-based roles in families, public attitudes to parenting and preferred family structure, and recent changes in our scientific knowledge base regarding gender and parenting are reviewed. Implications of the persistence of the breadwinning/nurturing dichotomy both within the Australian culture and family court judgements are discussed. Particular attention is drawn to the impact of the confused circumstances in which gender-neutral parenting principles came about in the 1970s.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Divorce - Social aspects - Australia</field><field name="subject">Family law - Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Custody of children</field><field name="subject">Decision making</field><field name="subject">construction of parenting</field><field name="subject">construction of childhood</field><field name="subject">Family</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070411.144416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of values on development practice: A study of Cambodian development practitioners in non-government organisations in Cambodia</field><field name="creator">O'Leary, Moira Patricia</field><field name="description">Evaluation reports, along with development studies literature suggest that development practice is often failing to enact espoused participatory, empowering and gender equitable approaches or to achieve these espoused goals. Mainstream development theories are underpinned by values and beliefs about what is good and what &#65533;ought to be&#65533;.
In this study I explore the influence of values on the development practice of Cambodian practitioners working in non-government organisations in rural Cambodia. Development practitioners are the major conduit of community based development assistance, but little is known about how their values impact their day-to-day practice, and influence their moral and political choices.
In the study I used ethnographic methodology, guided by feminist principles. The research was conducted with individuals and groups of experienced, mostly Cambodian development practitioners. Data were collected in four phases through in-depth and semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and observations of practice.
I examine the (in)congruity between practitioners&#65533; espoused theories and values and those demonstrated by their practice. The findings reveal that the values are not essentially different but are prioritized differently. The espoused values are consistent with those of the international development discourse, all of which are premised on a belief in human equality. Theories and values inferred from actual practice reflect hierarchical underpinnings. In the Cambodian context this is consistent with socio-cultural values and the hierarchical order of society. However, as expatriate research participants and the literature attest, this incongruence is not particular to Cambodian practitioners.
The study reveals practitioners give higher priority to fulfilling the tasks necessary for the achievement of their NGOs&#65533; planned outputs and organisational imperatives than to the facilitation of participatory and empowering processes. At the same time, the enactment of some development values is in tension with certain socio-cultural norms and practices. Practitioners are challenged to make desirable development values explicit and identify how to operationalise them in the lived social, cultural, political and economic context.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">values</field><field name="subject">development practice</field><field name="subject">NGOs</field><field name="subject">development practitioners</field><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">development values</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20061025.123141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Looking for good practice and optimal services for youth facing homelessness with complex care needs and high risk or challenging behaviour.</field><field name="creator">Owen, Lloyd</field><field name="description">This study employed qualitative research methodology informed by the grounded theory tradition to explore good practice and optimal services for young people presenting with complex care needs associated with challenging or high risk behaviour.  In-depth interviews were conducted in three waves of data collection and analysis with fourteen experienced practitioners whose careers have included sustained periods of work with this group in a number of selected Victorian service systems.
The principal vantage point was the interface between the supported accommodation and assistance programs for homeless young people, statutory child protection and care, placement and support programs for young people at risk and juvenile justice programs for young offenders.  The nature of the problem necessarily included some consideration of mental health and services dealing with substance abuse.
The findings propose a view of good practice giving emphasis to the accessible and assertive presence of a responsible adult to &#65533;be there&#65533; fostering relationships and skilled purposive intervention. Intervention should be planned, holistic, sensitive and responsive to particular needs. It provides active unconditional care. It attends to attachment and trauma concerns and works with short run goals and a long term perspective. Intervention is sustained until constructive disengagement can occur. 
The complexity and challenge in the task of helping hurt youth warrants the support, strength and guidance of a multi-skilled team. Ideally the team will be described using normative terms. Optimal services are timely, congruent, seamless and robust in capacity to nurture, establish boundaries and meet developmental and therapeutic requirements. They should be connected to a community and there for as long as it takes, with ready access to suitable accommodation, purchasing power and flexibility of operation. To the greatest extent possible solutions are generated in the place where help is sought. Voluntary service commitment lasts till personal capacity and natural networks take over.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">social inclusion</field><field name="subject">social exclusion</field><field name="subject">parenting adolescents</field><field name="subject">crisis intervention</field><field name="subject">multiple and complex needs</field><field name="subject">social work</field><field name="subject">youth work</field><field name="subject">welfare work</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20090121.152022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Niche partitioning among fur seals</field><field name="creator">Page, Brad</field><field name="description">At Cape Gantheaume, Kangaroo Island (South Australia), adult male, lactating female
and juvenile New Zealand (NZ) and Australian fur seals regularly return to the same
colony, creating the potential for intra- and inter-specific foraging competition in nearby
waters. I hypothesised that these demographic groups would exhibit distinct foraging
strategies, which reduce competition and facilitate their coexistence. I analysed the diet
of adult male, adult female and juvenile NZ fur seals and adult male Australian fur seals
and studied the diving behaviour of adult male and lactating female NZ fur seals and the
at-sea movements of juvenile, adult male and lactating female NZ fur seals. Female diet
reflected that of a generalist predator, influenced by prey availability and their
dependant pups&#65533; fasting abilities. In contrast, adult male NZ and Australian fur seals
used larger and more energy-rich prey, most likely because they could more efficiently
access and handle such prey. Juvenile fur seals primarily utilised small lantern fish,
which occur south of the shelf break, in pelagic waters. Juveniles undertook the longest
foraging trips and adult males conducted more lengthy trips than lactating females,
which perform relatively brief trips in order to regularly nurse their pups. Unlike lactating
females, some adult males appeared to rest underwater by performing dives that were
characterised by a period of passive drifting through the water column. The large body
sizes of adult males and lactating females facilitated the use of both benthic and pelagic
habitats, but adult males dived deeper and for longer than lactating females, facilitating
vertical separation of their foraging habitats. Spatial overlap in foraging habitats among
the age/sex groups was minimal, because lactating females typically utilised continental
shelf waters and males used deeper water over the shelf break, beyond female foraging
grounds. Furthermore, juveniles used pelagic waters, up to 1000 km south of the
regions used by lactating females and adult males. The age and sex groups in this
study employed dramatically different strategies to maximise their survival and
reproductive success. Their prey and foraging habitats are likely to be shaped by body
size differences, which determine their different physiological constraints and metabolic
requirements. I suggest that these physiological constraints and the lactation
constraints on females are the primary factors that reduce competition, thereby
facilitating niche partitioning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine mammals</field><field name="subject">Southern fur seals Heard Island</field><field name="subject">Arctocephalus forsteri</field><field name="subject">satellite telemetry</field><field name="subject">dive recorders</field><field name="subject">Niche (Ecology)</field><field name="subject">drift dive</field><field name="subject">Heard Island</field><field name="subject">entanglement</field><field name="subject">Neophoca Heard Island</field><field name="subject">Sea lions South Australia</field><field name="subject">Competition (Biology) Heard Island</field><field name="subject">Resource partitioning (Ecology) Heard Island</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20060622.153716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caring for dying parents : an existential phenomenological approach</field><field name="creator">Paul, Lindsay</field><field name="description">The death of one&#65533;s parents, irrespective of the age at which it occurs, is generally regarded as a life experience of considerable significance. The last few years of an elderly person&#65533;s life are often characterized by increasing frailty, declining health and loss of independence. Responsibility for the spiritual and physical care of parents during that period is undertaken by many adult children. Current research in this area is generally informed by the requirements of social policy, which, by identifying and addressing the inherent difficulties in this so-called informal caring, is designed to support carers in the community. The research reported in this thesis represents a departure from this mode of inquiry and seeks, rather, to explore the existential aspects of caring in this particular situation, from the carer&#65533;s perspective. 

To achieve this objective, an existential phenomenological approach informed principally by the philosophies of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, and the adaptation of these philosophies by Schutz, Giorgi and van Manen to social science research, was developed to suit the particular requirements of the topic. In addition to the author&#65533;s autobiographic material, primary sources include conversations with five people who had been principal carers for their parents during their final illnesses. In all cases caring had ended with the parent&#65533;s death at least one year before the conversations took place. The principal secondary sources are Simone de Beauvoir&#65533;s memoir, A Very Easy Death, and Philip Roth&#65533;s account of his father&#65533;s illness and death, Patrimony: A True Story. In addition, the argument is supported throughout by reference to other literary works. From these sources a number of major existential themes, including temporality, hope, suffering, and knowing the body, have been explored in depth, in conjunction with relevant existential theories. Synthesis of these topics suggests that in this particular circumstance, for the people involved in the study, the phenomenon of caring can be understood as an unconditional engagement with the life and concerns of their parent at the end of life, and can be interpreted within an existential framework as representing an authentic way of Being.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Existential phenomenology</field><field name="subject">nursing theory</field><field name="subject">hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">medical imaging technology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080222.152124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Counsellor's Self in Therapy</field><field name="creator">Reupert, Andrea E.</field><field name="description">The person of the counsellor, or what is sometimes referred to as the counsellor&#65533;s self, is the focus of this thesis.  How the counsellor&#65533;s self is described and manifested during therapy constitute the two main research questions.  Various perspectives are presented from psychoanalysis, behaviour therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, person centered therapy and systems therapy.  While issues pertaining to the counsellor&#65533;s self have been explored predominately by systems therapists, this study extends previous research by involving interviews with counsellors from a range of orientations.

The study is conducted within an interpretative research paradigm, and data are collected and interpreted according to a qualitative approach.  Semi-structured interviews with 16 counsellors, from a range of theoretical orientations, constitute the primary method of data collection.  Other data sources include a short questionnaire sent to the same counsellors, the researcher&#65533;s reflective journal as well as recorded meetings between a peer debriefer and the researcher.  

Study participants describe the counsellor&#65533;s self as a multifaceted, positive and integrated entity.  The counsellor&#65533;s self includes participant&#65533;s professional knowledge and skills as well as their beliefs, values, thoughts, feelings, personal style and an unknown aspect of self that some participants referred to as their unconscious.  While somewhat influenced by past relationships and the client, the counsellor&#65533;s self is primarily autonomous and defined by the individual counsellor.  Although the counsellor&#65533;s self has the capacity to change over time, in different environments and with different clients, the self also includes notions of stability and consistency.  The counsellor&#65533;s self is involved in therapy as an inevitable presence, a deliberate tool and a stance.  Participants highlighted the importance of self-awareness and various professional and personal constraints on the involvement of self.  A central function of the self in therapy is in the therapeutic alliance.

The study has implications for the training and supervision of counsellors and future psychotherapeutic research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">counsellor&#65533;s self</field><field name="subject">person of the therapist</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050404.161132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The employment relationship and integrated theory</field><field name="creator">Sansbury, George Ernest</field><field name="description">This research falls within the field of normative business ethics. 
Its aim is to examine the moral nature of the employment relationship in western democracies by examining the liberal, democratic justifications that are normally advanced for its probity. Its concern is to challenge the notion that the employment relationship is in conformity with these liberal democratic values. Thus, the research is an exercise in the examination of the application of the liberal, democratic tradition to the social institution of employment.
Thus research examines areas of dissonance between the political relationship of employee &#65533; employer and the dominant values of the liberal tradition found elsewhere in western democracies.
The research firstly identifies the key moral characteristics of the employment relationship in private, capitalist organisations. This is derived from a consideration of the development historically, of the employment relationship, with acknowledgement of the combined influences of statute, common law, contract law and custom in forming the current employee relationship. 
Secondly, the research identifies the justificatory arguments from the liberal tradition that are normally advanced in support of the employment relationship&#65533;s moral probity. These include notions of rights deriving from private property, the separation of social life into public and private spheres and the application of contract law to employment.
Thirdly, the research examines these arguments for their moral probity. Specifically, this involves an examination of the arguments regarding the private property status of employing organisations, the application of contract law to employment, the moral characteristics of the master and servant relationship as a basis for employment and the relevance of democratic values within employment.
As an additional perspective, the literature on human needs is reviewed as a source, outside of the liberal tradition, for a basis upon which to outline the moral requirements of human relationships to work.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Master and servant - Moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">Business ethics</field><field name="subject">Industrial relations - Moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20060427.125729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preservice teachers&#65533; views of similarities and differences in teaching and learning literacy and numeracy.</field><field name="creator">Scott, Anne</field><field name="description">This is a report of an investigation of aspects of preservice teachers&#65533; perceptions of teaching and learning English and mathematics and factors influencing them. 
The participants of the investigation were primary preservice teachers from two tertiary institutions of Victoria, one located inner city, and the other in a regional centre. Of the 349 participants, 163 were commencing and 186 were graduating from their degrees. 
Preservice teachers completed questionnaires indicating their intentions to use particular practices in their literacy and numeracy lessons. Thirty-one of the 349 surveyed voluntarily discussed key issues arising from the survey during semi-structured audiotaped sessions. Five lecturers responsible for the planning of the compulsory English and mathematics education units at both institutions were interviewed about the survey data and provided written documentation for their units as evidence of their coursework.
Data analyses indicated that preservice teachers often considered practices equally appropriate for literacy and numeracy teaching and intended to use them in similar ways. It seemed that preservice teachers enter their degrees with strong opinions about teaching and learning based not only on their recollections of experiences as learners but also from more recent relevant experiences such as their dealings with children as babysitters, tutors, and classroom helpers. They also gained knowledge about teaching contexts from their informal but regular conversations with friends and family who teach. 
From the examination of the documentation for coursework and discussions with lecturers, it seemed that the content of the literacy and numeracy education units at the two institutions were similar. Overall, the data indicated that many of the preservice teachers&#65533; intentions were consistent with the intent of coursework especially when they described general teaching practices. However, in cases where practices were discipline-specific there were limited changes in preservice teachers&#65533; intentions even after completing their courses. The prospective teachers reported that they considered their recent salient experiences of teaching and their observations of teachers&#65533; practices in schools more influential than coursework.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Survey research</field><field name="subject">Beliefs</field><field name="subject">Teacher education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20070815.163201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clerical Workers, Enterprise Bargaining and Preference Theory: Choice &amp; Constraint</field><field name="creator">Thomson, Lisa</field><field name="description">This thesis is a case study about the choices and constraints faced by women clerical workers in a labour market where they have very little autonomy in negotiating their pay and conditions of employment.  On the one hand, clerical work has developed as a feminised occupation with a history of being low in status and low paid.  On the other hand, it is an ideal occupation for women wanting to combine work and family across their life cycle.  How these two phenomena impact upon women clerical workers ability to negotiate enterprise agreements is the subject of this thesis.  

From a theoretical perspective this thesis builds upon Catherine Hakim&#65533;s preference theory which explores the choices women clerical workers&#65533; make in relation to their work and family lives.  Where Hakim&#65533;s preference theory focuses on the way in which women use their agency to determine their work and life style choices, this thesis gives equal weighting to the impact of agency and the constraints imposed by external structures such as the availability of part-time work and childcare, as well as the impact of organisational culture.  

The research data presented was based on face-to-face interviews with forty female clerical workers.  The clerical workers ranged in age from 21 to 59 years of age.  The respondents were made up of single or partnered women without family responsibilities, women juggling work and family, and women who no longer had dependent children and were approaching retirement.  This thesis contends that these clerical workers are ill placed to optimise their conditions of employment under the new industrial regime of enterprise bargaining and individual contracts.  Very few of the women were union members and generally they were uninformed about their rights and entitlements.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clerical work</field><field name="subject">Women clerical workers</field><field name="subject">Labor market Australia</field><field name="subject">Industrial relations Australia</field><field name="subject">Wages clerical workers</field><field name="subject">Child care</field><field name="subject">Part-time employment Australia</field><field name="subject">Enterprise bargaining Australia</field><field name="subject">Workplace contracts</field><field name="subject">Work and family Australia</field><field name="subject">Famly relationships</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture Australia</field><field name="subject">Preference theory</field><field name="subject">Women clerical workers unions</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050801.172053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The word order of Medieval Cypriot</field><field name="creator">Vassiliou, Erma</field><field name="description">This is the first typological study devoted to Medieval Cypriot (MC). The objective of the study is to provide both syntactic and pragmatic factors which are determining for the word order of the language and to open new ways to recording mechanisms of word order change. 

Cypriot syntax deserves this attention, as it is a language highly interesting for the typologist as for the researcher of other linguistic areas; Modern Cypriot is VOS, and exhibits a series of exceptions to the general rules of V-initial languages. Medieval Cypriot conforms to most of Greenberg&#65533;s Universals (1963) which are pertinent to type VSO in that it has V in initial position in all unmarked clauses, in that it is prepositional, that adjectives mostly follow the noun they qualify, and so on. 
     However, the comparison of MC to Greenberg&#65533;s Universals is not the aim of this work. Apart form the order of the main constituents, this research mainly focuses on revealing mechanisms of syntactic change not generally known, and on unveiling particular traits of the Cypriot VSO order that are not common to other VSO languages.

The analysis can be defined as diachronic for it deals with the language written over a span of many years, as assumed from studying the texts. Some words and structures, used in the beginning of the narrative, seem to decrease in frequency in the end, or vice versa. It is diachronic considering it also allows for comparison with later (colloquial) and earlier (written) constructions of the language. However, it is mostly a synchronic analysis; the patterns observed are from within the same language spoken by the same people living in the same period, more importantly from within the same work. Makhairas is thus the only broad evidence of his period, offered both as a diachronic and a synchronic linguistic testimony of his time. 

As no language exists in vacuo, my description of MC starts with a historical approach to the language under study; it is almost impossible to realise the problems of colloquial, literary and foreign features without being aware of the earlier history of Greek in general and of Cypriot in particular, in some of its earlier documents. I refrained as far as possible from entering the field of comparative criticism with Medieval Greek. In this way I decided to focus on discussions based exclusively on the Cypriot forms and patterns, as presented and justified by the evidence in Makhairas, and as witnessed by history which, for many centuries, has singled out Cypriot from the rest of the dialects and the Greek language itself. So, alternative views, criticism and discussion of same mechanisms of change recorded within the broader Greek language have been more or less avoided. 

The exposition of the MC word order patterns is based on my hypotheses that word order, as I understand it, is founded on purposes of communication and that languages with extreme flexibility of order, such as Medieval Cypriot, may adopt patterns that display rigidity of order in a number of their elements. It is within these areas of rigidity that new mechanisms of change may be detected. I also hypothesised that the same syntactic changes within languages of the same branch may be merely coincidental, and that Greek or forms of Greek may well adopt foreign elements, only (but not exclusively) if these acquire the Greek endings, or if they appear as independent affixes, as is the case with the post-medieval referential Cypriot marker &#65533;mish&#65533; which is from Turkish. Acquiring particular elements from other languages does not mean acquiring their order. However, acquiring patterns that are similar to Greek from a borrowing language which has the same patterns does not exclude syntactic borrowing.  

Since Modern Cypriot is V-initial, I presumed that this might have also been its order in the Middle Ages. I judge that major mechanisms of syntactic change of the same period may have been triggered by factors internal to Cypriot rather than by the more general, universal mechanisms of change. Moreover, I speculated that MC was a far more marginalised language in the Middle Ages than what history and literature have taught us. Its creative dynamism and potentiality to &#65533;juggle&#65533; between words and patterns has been its greater forte. 

Cypriot has not been studied as a dialect, in this work. I avoided having only a partial or a shadowed understanding of its word order patterns. Exhaustive descriptions that show its particularities in the process of completion appear with both rigidity (in some elements) and flexibility of order, and most importantly, they exhibit a long-life endurance. 

I have also been concerned with forms and /or patterns of Greek such as the future and other periphrastic tenses, although they are already known and have been analysed at length in Greek linguistic studies. I concentrate here on some of these from a Cypriot perspective. 

Cypriot has never been classified as Balkan Greek or mainland Greek. Following this study, it will be clarified further that any attempt to fit MC into a framework defined along these categorisations will be successful only in some areas of the general Greek syntax. In fact, Cypriot opens the way for a further understanding of Greek syntax with its (almost) boundless flexibility; it is through MC and the unique data of Makhairas that the study of the Greek syntax is being enriched. Areas of fine-grained classificatory criteria result in connecting some MC syntactic traits to those of Greek and accrediting to the language its own word order singularities in what can be righteously called here the Cypriot syntax. 
Additionally, the study aims to open new areas of investigation on diachronic syntactic issues and to initiate new and revealing answers concerning configurational syntax.
  
To determine the syntactic traits of MC a meticulous work of counting was needed. The counting of the order of the main constituents from both the more general narrative patterns of the Chronicle as well as of those passages thought to be more immediate to the author&#65533;s living experience(s) was done manually. The primarily and more difficult task of considering, following and explaining pragmatic word order patterns in the Chronicle has been the stepping stone of this research. Earlier (and forgotten) stages of Greek, and patterns exclusive to Cypriot, assembled in a unique lexicon and with special Cypriot phrasal verbs, have provided answers to explaining the Cypriot structure. In addition to statistics, areas of language contact have also been explored, both in the morphology and in the syntax.
More importantly, the extreme word order freedom of MC that illustrates word order processes based entirely on internal structural changes, aims to contribute to discussions regarding morphology and syntax versus morphosyntax.

Chapter 1 provides all the background information of the history and language in Cyprus, prior to the Middle Ages. 
Chapter 2 deals with the description of the data and the methodology used to assess them. 
Chapter 3 exhibits the MC verbal forms, both finite and non-finite; it examines non-finites more closely, inasmuch as they play an important role in the change of the order of major constituents and uncover and explain the role of V-initial structures. 
Chapter 4 is the core chapter of this work. It displays Cypriot particularities of word order, reveals data concerned with the word order of the major constituents within the clause and unfolds explanatory accounts of them; lastly, it classifies MC as a V-initial language.
Chapter 5 summarises conclusions, adds a further note on the Cypriot morphosyntactic traits while placing the results into the contemporary scholarship on VSO languages, also suggesting additional research areas into the MC patterns. 

The examples from Makhairas have been written in the monotonic system, where only one accent has been used; other special symbols have been eliminated or modified in the interest of making the text readable in the absence of the right font. However, Ancient Greek words appear with their appropriate accents.  
Abbreviation C indicates structures or words that remained unchanged in Cypriot over a long period of time, and G means a form or word accepted in both their written and spoken forms over a long period of time in Greek. 

A morphemic analysis of each form of the glosses has not always been given. I limited myself to glossing some elements only, for the better understanding of some examples.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cypriot dialect syntax</field><field name="subject">word order</field><field name="subject">typology</field><field name="subject">Greek language</field><field name="subject">Medieval and late Dialects Cyprus</field><field name="subject">Vasiliou</field><field name="subject">diachronic syntax</field><field name="subject">Medieval Greek</field><field name="subject">Medieval Cypriot</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080214.124104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Advent of Methodism and the I Taukei: The Methodist Church in Fijian Nation-making</field><field name="creator">Williams, Beverley Anne Harwood</field><field name="description">This thesis is an historical anthropology of the role of the Methodist Church in Fiji, from the arrival of Methodist missionaries in 1830. At that time Fiji was a fragmented society. Fijians lived in villages on various islands, so there was no cohesion within the society. The insertion of Methodism into traditional Fijian society irreversibly changed the society, and this thesis traces the key changes that occurred. The rise to prominence of Chief Cakobau from Bau Island marks the beginning of unification of a fragmented Fiji. He formed the first Fijian government in 1871.The British Colonial authorities and the Methodists were also centrally involved in unification and the development of a national society as they set up structures to govern and evangelise the Fijians. However, the thesis argues that with the arrival of Indo-Fijians as indentured labourers to Fiji in 1879, the seeds of polarisation were planted and Indo-Fijians were left out of the frame of Fijian society. The thesis traces the involvement of Methodism, always in close relationship with the state in the twin processes of unification and polarisation.
The coups that have changed the political landscape of Fiji served to alter the relationship between the Methodist Church and the state. A schism occurred in the Methodist Church following the 1987 coup, where violence against some ministers occurred, and the Methodist constitution was suspended. Members belonging to i taukei Methodist hierarchy who insisted on Fijian paramountcy to the exclusion of Indo-Fijians have been separated irretrievably from members of the Methodist hierarchy who believe in an inclusive society irrespective of race. Increasing diversity of socio-economic status allied with hierarchical divides and different interpretations of the Church&#65533;s mission have generated conflict in the Church and society at large. Diminution of the power of the Methodist Church in Fiji has occurred since 1987, and there are both internal and external factors at work which continue this trend. The various factors influencing the Church in the present along with its future prospects are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methodist Church</field><field name="subject">Fijian coups 1987</field><field name="subject">Fiji coup 2000</field><field name="subject">future of Methodist church in Fiji</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20091221.121517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">R. H. Bland and the Port Phillip and Colonial Gold Mining Company</field><field name="creator">Woodland, John George</field><field name="description">There are numerous histories of the Victorian goldfields, individual digger&#65533;s experiences, and the digging community as a whole. By contrast, very little has been written about the early gold mining companies. This thesis seeks to address this dearth in part, with a longitudinal study of one of the leading gold mining companies in nineteenth-century Victoria. The Port Phillip and Colonial Gold Mining Company (&#65533;Port Phillip Company&#65533;) was one of many &#65533;gold bubble&#65533; companies formed in England during 1851-3 to undertake gold mining in Australia. Within a few years it was the only survivor of this episode of British corporate gold-fever. The thesis argues that the influence of Rivett Henry Bland, the company&#65533;s managing director, was instrumental in its success, particularly in its early years when faced with anti-company sentiment and unfavourable mining legislation. The company established a large-scale operation at Clunes in 1857, rapidly assuming a pre-eminent position in colonial gold mining with its superior technology and mining practices. Historians generally portray Australian gold mining operations as small, locally funded and inefficient, prior to British capital investment in the late 1880s. While true of the larger picture, this simply emphasises the uniqueness of the British-owned and funded Port Phillip Company, the largest and most efficient gold mining operation in Australia from 1857 until the early 1880s. The company and its investment offshoot, the Victoria (London) Mining Company, invested in over thirty Victorian gold mining companies during the 1860s. Again, this runs counter to the general view that British investment in Australian gold mining began only in the late 1880s. Although the two companies&#65533; investments equalled only a fraction of the later wave of British capital in absolute monetary terms, their contribution to the growth of the Victorian gold mining industry at the time was significant.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Port Phillip and colonial Gold Mining Company</field><field name="subject">Gold mines</field><field name="subject">Mining</field><field name="subject">Victoria - 19th century</field><field name="subject">Gold miners</field><field name="subject">Port Phillip district</field><field name="subject">Clunes</field><field name="subject">Metallurgy</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20041222.162756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Priorities and Strategies for Health Information System Development in China - How Provincial Health Inforamtion Systems Support Regional Health Planning</field><field name="creator">Yang, Hui</field><field name="description">China is moving towards a market economy. The greater use of market forces has made China richer, accelerated modernisation and increased productive efficiency but has created new problems, including, in the health sector, problems of inequity and allocative inefficiency. From 1997, the Chinese government committed to a national policy of regional health planning (RHP), as part of a broader commitment to harmonising social and economic development. However, RHP has been slow to impact on the equity and efficiency problems in health care. 
Planning requires information; better health decision-making requires better health information. Information systems constitute a resource that is vital for the health planning and the management of the health system. Properly developed, managed and used, health information systems are a highly cost-effective resource for the nation and its regions. Bureaucratic resistance, one of critical reasons is that regional health planners gained insufficient support from information system. Health information needs to adopt into the new way of government health management. 
The objective of the study is to contribute to the development of China&#65533;s health information system (HIS) over the next 5-10 years, in particular to suggest how provincial health information systems could be made more useful as a basis for RHP. The existing HIS is examined in relation to its support for and relevance to RHP, including policy framework, institutional structures and resources, networks and relationships, data collection, analysis, quality and accessibility of information as well as the use of information in support of health planning. Data sources include key informant interviews, a questionnaire survey and various policy documents. Qualitative (questionnaire survey on provincial HIS) and quantitative (key informant interviews) approaches are used in this study. Document analysis is also conducted.
The research examines information for planning within the macro and historical context of health planning in China, in particular having regard to the impacts and implications of the transition to a market economy. It is evident that the implementation of RHP has been retarded by poor performance of information system, particularly at the provincial level. However, the implementation of RHP has also been complicated by fragmented administrative hierarchies, weak implementation mechanisms and contradictions between different policies, for example, between improved planning and the encouragement of market forces in health care. 
To support RHP which is needs based, has a focus on improving allocative efficiency and is adapted to the new market development will require new information products and supports including infrastructure reform and capacity development. Provincial HIS needs to move from being data generators and transmitters to becoming information producers and providers. Health planning has moved to greater use of population-based benchmark and demand-side control. Therefore, information products should be widened from supply side data collection (in particular assets and resources) to include demand-side collection and analysis (including utilisation patterns and community surveys of opinion and experience). The interaction between users (the planners) and producers (the HIS) should be strengthened and regional networks of information producers and planners should be established.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health information system</field><field name="subject">regional health planning</field><field name="subject">china</field><field name="subject">provincial</field><field name="subject">reform</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20050818.135812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governing the healthcare market: Regulatory challenges and options in the transitional China.</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Hongwen</field><field name="description">During the transition from a planned economy to a decentralized, market socialist economy, the Chinese healthcare system has evolved from a centralized, egalitarian public system (1949-1979) to one which is largely self-governed and can be characterized as &#65533;public identity, private behavior&#65533; healthcare system (1980-1999). With blurring of the distinction between public and private governing systems, and a shift in norms towards profit orientation, major concern has arisen about the extent of high cost, high volume services being offered through excessive entrepreneurial practices.
  This thesis is concerned with the regulatory strategies and options to reach 2010 health reform objectives of equity and efficiency under a mixed public/private market. While possible lessons can be drawn from established economies and transitional economies, China faces some unique challenges, given the diverse market structures and fragmented healthcare system across the country, and the underdeveloped framework for the rule of law.  The thesis reviews policy documents from 1949 to 2004 and draws from interviews with senior health policy-makers and hospital directors in three different locations, in order to explore the role of the state in market regulation, the effectiveness of technical and social regulations,   and how policy implementation and regulatory compliance occur.
The research has found that the dynamics of the healthcare system are shaped by the financing arrangements for healthcare and the absence of arms-length governance of hospitals by health departments. Without an effective state health financing tool, nor mature market institutions, China is not able to use neither performance-based regulation nor technology-based regulation. China has adopted a management-based regulatory strategy but the absence of effective governance structure hinders effective regulation.
If the reform objectives of improving healthcare quality while costs are to be attained, China will need to develop purchasing tools to alter the current perverse incentives for provider behavior. Government will also need to work with civil society organizations to develop tools for clinical governance, such as clinical audit for risk management and hospital accreditation programs. To do so requires establishing arms-length governance mechanisms between health departments and hospitals, and appropriate corporate governance structures within hospitals. Specifically, MOH needs to establish a technical policy think tank to investigate all the policy issues arising from the announcement of the 1997 health reform, including coordination with other line ministries and provincial authorities, and formulation and implementation of a policy research agenda, in order to attain a market-based governance system for health by 2010.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Market</field><field name="subject">Healthcare system</field><field name="subject">Hospital</field><field name="subject">Regulation</field><field name="subject">Reform</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20080131.100619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive Interactive Expectations: Dynamically Modelling Profit Expectations</field><field name="creator">William Paul Bell</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to develop an alternative expectations model to the Rational Expectations Hypothesis (REH) and adaptive-expectations models, which provides more accurate temporal predictive performance and more closely reflects recent advances in behavioural economics, the &#8216;science of complexity&#8217; and network dynamics. The model the thesis develops is called Adaptive Interactive Expectations (AIE), a subjective dynamic model of the process of expectations formation. To REH, the AIE model provides both an alternative and a complement. AIE and REH complement one another in that they are diametrically opposite in the following five dimensions, agent intelligence, agent interaction, agent homogeneity, equilibrium assumptions and the rationalisation process. REH and AIE stress the importance of hyper-intelligent agents interacting only via a price signal and near zero-intelligent agents interacting via a network structure, respectively. The complementary nature of AIE and REH provide dual perspectives that enhance analysis. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B 2008) profit expectations survey is used in the thesis to calibrate AIE and make predictions. The predictive power of the AIE and REH models is compared. The thesis introduces the &#8216;pressure to change profit expectations index&#8217;, px. This index provides the ability to model unknowns within an adaptive dynamic process and combine the beliefs from interactive-expectations, adaptive-expectations and biases that include pessimism, optimism and ambivalence. AIE uses networks to model the flow of interactive-expectations between firms. To overcome the uncertainty over the structure of the interactive network, the thesis uses model-averaging over 121 network topologies. These networks are defined by three variables regardless of their complexity. Unfortunately, the Bayesian technique&#8217;s use of the number of variables as a measure of complexity makes it unsuitable for model-averaging over the network topologies. To overcome this limitation in the Bayesian technique, the thesis introduces two model-averaging techniques, &#8216;runtime-weighted&#8217; and &#8216;optimal-calibration&#8217;. These model-averaging techniques are benchmarked against &#8216;Bayes-factor model-averaging&#8217; and &#8216;equal-weighted model-averaging&#8217;. In addition to the aggregate called all&#8211;firms, the D&amp;B (2008) survey has four divisions, manufacturing durables, manufacturing non&#8211;durables, wholesale and retail. To make use of the four divisions, the thesis introduces a &#8216;link-intensity matrix&#8217; based upon an &#8216;input-output table&#8217; to improve the calibration of the networks. The transpose of the table is also used in the thesis. The two &#8216;link-intensity matrices&#8217; are benchmarked against the default, a &#8216;matrix of ones&#8217;. The aggregated and disaggregated versions of AIE are benchmarked against adaptive-expectations to establish whether the interactive-expectations component of AIE add value to the model. The thesis finds that AIE has more predictive power than REH. &#8216;Optimal-calibration model-averaging&#8217; improves the predictive performance of the better-fitting versions of AIE, which are those versions that use the &#8216;input-output table&#8217; and &#8216;matrix of ones&#8217; link-intensity matrices. The &#8216;runtime-weighted model-averaging&#8217; improves the predictive performance of only the &#8216;input-output table&#8217; version of AIE. The interactive component of the AIE model improves the predictive performance of all versions of the AIE over adaptive-expectations. There is an ambiguous effect on prediction performance from introducing the &#8216;input-output table&#8217;. However, there is a clear reduction in the predictive performance from introducing its transpose. AIE can inform the debate on government intervention by providing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) perspective on the conflicting mathematical and narrative views proposed by the Greenwald&#8211;Stiglitz Theorem and Austrian school, respectively. Additionally, AIE can provide a complementary role to REH, which is descriptive/predictive and normative, respectively. The AIE network calibration uses an &#8216;input-output table&#8217; to determine the link-intensity; this method could provide Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) with a way to improve their transmission mechanism. Furthermore, the AIE network calibration and prediction methodology may help overcome the validation concerns of practitioners when they implement ABM.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Expectations</field><field name="subject">profits</field><field name="subject">networks</field><field name="subject">adaptive</field><field name="subject">interactive</field><field name="subject">model-averaging</field><field name="subject">agent-based modeling and simulation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical investigation of the Landmark Education phenomenon</field><field name="creator">Vodanovich, Jonathan Ante</field><field name="description">This thesis explores Landmark Education, an American personal development company which claims to transform lives for the better.

This project also researched previous historical representations of Tangaroa with the intention of isolating key elements of the traditional artistic structure and revisits them from a contemporary perspective. Using historic references of original artefacts and traditional Cook Islands&#8217; patterns I engaged contemporary practices and materials to produce a body of work which explored my personal perspective on how Tangaroa could be reconstructed in art form. To support my research and studio practice I researched the myth behind Tangaroa and questioned why he has been displaced from Rarotongan traditional theology and reintroduced today as a marketing brand and souvenir icon.

As a legacy of pervasive pessimism in the face of limited treatment, it is conceptualised and researched from biomedical and psychosocial perspectives that address impairment, problems of performance, quality of life, burden and disruption. Little stroke research is conducted once professional input has ceased, and yet considerable change occurs after this period with evidence that post-stroke wellbeing is independent of impairment and function -- many people do well in the face of poor prognoses, while others remain miserable despite 'good recovery'. Current advances in acute stroke management are generating increasing optimism, but lack of understanding about individuals' post-stroke experiences and long-term outcomes continues. While it is recognised that the impact of stroke on the lives of survivors and families is profound, rehabilitation focuses on recovery as task achievement and measured functional outcomes. For many survivors and their families 'recovery' is contested, ambiguous and extended. For some, it becomes a lifetime marathon because stroke represents an assault, not only to the body, but to the self and the lifeworld -- it is a 'life' event. This narrative inquiry into life after stroke explores recovery as a process taking place over time and conceptualised as a life transition. The work is grounded in narrative theory with the concept of transition providing the lens and focus for the research, its processes and analyses. Individuals' stories remain intact enabling evocation of diverse stroke meanings and the mapping of individual experience. Bringing these whole stories into conversation with each other elucidates post-stroke transition which is interpreted in light of theories of response to traumatic loss and informed by narrative theory. The thesis presents stories of trauma, loss and grief, situated in past lives and selves where assumptions about selves and future lives are shattered. The future makes no sense in terms of participants' past and present lives; life plots are lost and stroke therefore represents 'lost futures'. Stories of moving on to new lives are focused on being and doing in the present and have an expectant view of life. Although mindful of past lives and enduring losses, survivors actively engage in processes to reconfigure their lives with hope for a meaningful future. Transition is interpreted as 'reconfiguring the future'. The life tasks of reconfiguration are embedded in dynamic models of traumatic loss where grief is conceptualised as recursive movement between loss and meaning reconstruction evident in narratives that slowly move towards wellbeing. Despite broad recognition that loss and grief are part of the stroke experience, they are rarely addressed; where attention is paid it is likely embedded in explanatory models of staged response that oversimplify human experience. This thesis offers a new framework. It represents a fresh interpretation that highlights the ongoing traumatic impact of stroke. The post-stroke journeys of survivors and families are affected by individual circumstances and meanings. Although their stories are permeated with loss, many people move forward towards lives worth living. This interpretation suggests ways of reconfiguring lives in the face of devastation and ongoing traumatic loss. The work identifies a complex interaction of individual, emotional and social factors contributing to transitions to wellbeing following stroke and thus adds to a prospective vision of post-stroke life that can inform rehabilitation, discharge and stroke support strategies. Post-stroke transition will be enhanced when we use narrative framing and understanding to guide rehabilitative practice that uses meaning-centred models to prepare survivors and their families for a return to the lifeworld.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease</field><field name="subject">321104 Clinical Nursing: Tertiary (Rehabilitative)</field><field name="subject">321209 Family Care</field><field name="subject">321212 Care for Disabled</field><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy: Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">321025 Rehabilitation and Therapy: Hearing and Speech</field><field name="subject">329999 Medical and Health Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">370201 Clinical Social Work Practice</field><field name="subject">370204 Counselling, Welfare and Community Services</field><field name="subject">380105 Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="subject">380107 Health, Clinical and Counselling Psychology</field><field name="subject">440112 Hermeneutic Theory</field><field name="subject">stroke transition</field><field name="subject">narrative theory</field><field name="subject">traumatic loss</field><field name="subject">long-term stroke recovery</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/92288</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Channel based medium access control for ad hoc wireless networks</field><field name="creator">Ashraf, Manzur</field><field name="description">Opportunistic communication techniques have shown to provide significant performance improvements in centralised random access wireless networks. The key mechanism of opportunistic communication is to send back-to-back data packets whenever the channel quality is deemed "good". Recently there have been attempts to introduce opportunistic communication techniques in distributed wireless networks such as wireless ad hoc networks. In line of this research, we propose a new paradigm of medium access control, called Channel MAC based on the channel randomness and opportunistic communication principles. Scheduling in Channel MAC depends on the instance at which the channel quality improves beyond a threshold, while neighbouring nodes are deemed to be silent. Once a node starts transmitting, it will keep transmitting until the channel becomes "bad". We derive an analytical throughput equation of the proposed MAC in a multiple access environment and validate it by simulations. It is observed that Channel MAC outperforms IEEE 802.11 for all probabilities of good channel condition and all numbers of nodes. For higher number of nodes, Channel MAC achieves higher throughput at lower probabilities of good channel condition increasing the operating range. Furthermore, the total throughput of the network grows with increasing number of nodes considering negligible propagation delay in the network. A scalable channel prediction scheme is required to implement the practical Channel MAC protocol in practice. We propose a mean-value based channel prediction scheme, which provides prediction with enough accuracy to be used in the Channel MAC protocol. NS2 simulation result shows that the Channel MAC protocol outperforms the IEEE 802.11 in throughput due to its channel diversity mechanism in spite of the prediction errors and packet collisions. Next, we extend the Channel MAC protocol to support multi-rate communications. At present, two prominent multi-rate mechanisms, Opportunistic Auto Rate (OAR) and Receiver Based Auto Rate (RBAR) are unable to adapt to short term changes in channel conditions during transmission as well as to use optimum power and throughput during packet transmissions. On the other hand, using channel predictions, each source-destinations pair in Channel MAC can fully utilise the non-fade durations. We combine the scheduling of Channel MAC and the rate adaptive transmission based on the channel state information to design the 'Rate Adaptive Channel MAC' protocol. However, to implement the Rate adaptive Channel MAC, we need to use a channel prediction scheme to identify transmission opportunities as well as auto rate adaptation mechanism to select rates and number of packets to transmit during those times. For channel prediction, we apply the scheme proposed for the practical implementation of Channel MAC. We propose a "safety margin" based technique to provide auto rate adaptation. Simulation results show that a significant performance improvement can be achieved by Rate adaptive Channel MAC as compared to existing rate adaptive protocols such as OAR.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ad hoc networks (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">ad hoc networks</field><field name="subject">230202 Stochastic Analysis and Modelling</field><field name="subject">280204 Signal Processing</field><field name="subject">290901 Electrical Engineering</field><field name="subject">291704 Computer Communications Networks</field><field name="subject">291703 Digital Systems</field><field name="subject">291799 Communications Technologies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">medium access control</field><field name="subject">rate control</field><field name="subject">wireless networks</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/92176</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming the tourist : Aboriginal tourism as investment in cultural transversality</field><field name="creator">Galliford, Mark</field><field name="description">The thesis is an examination of Aboriginal cultural tourism based on interviews with national and international tourists.

Traditional object recognition techniques are usually performed on optical images that are 2D projections of the 3D world. Information about the depth of objects in the scene is not provided explicitly in these images and thus, it makes 2D object recognition techniques sensitive to changes in illumination and shadowing. As surface acquisition methods such as LADAR or range scanners are becoming more popular, there is an increasing interest in the use of three-dimensional geometric data in object recognition to overcome these limitations. However, the matching of 3D free-form surfaces is also a difficult problem due to the shape and topological complexity of 3D surfaces. In addition, the problem is further complicated by other issues such as variations in surface sampling resolution, occlusion, clutter and sensor noise. The huge amount of information required to describe a 3D surface is also another challenge that 3D surface matching techniques have to deal with. This thesis investigates the problems of 3D surface matching that include 3D surface registration and object recognition from range images. It focuses on developing a novel and efficient framework for aligning 3D surfaces in different coordinate systems and from this, recognizing 3D models from scenes with high levels of occlusion and clutter using multi-scale local features. The first part of the thesis presents two different schemes for extracting salient geometric features from 3D surfaces using surface curvature measures known as the curvedness and shape index. By deriving the scale-space representation of the input surface, surface positions with high local curvature or high local shape variations are selected as features at various degrees of scale. One advantage of the proposed approaches is their applicability to both 3D meshes with connectivity information and unstructured point clouds. In the second part of the thesis, an application of the multi-scale feature extraction framework to 3D surface registration and object recognition is proposed. A Delaunay tetrahedrization is performed on the features extracted from each input range image to obtain a set of triangles. Possible correspondences are found by matching all possible pairs of triangles between the scene and model surfaces. From these correspondences, possible transformations between the two surfaces can be hypothesized and tested. In order to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm, various surface geometric and rigidity constraints are applied to prune unlikely correspondences. By finding the match that aligns the largest number of features between the two surfaces, the best transformation can be estimated. In the case of surface registration, this transformation can be used to coarse-align two different views of the same object. In the case of 3D object recognition, it provides information about the possible pose (location and orientation) of the model in the scene surface. Experimental results on a variety of 3D models and real scenes are shown to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the approach.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">3D recognition; 3D matching; 3D registration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Violence in the emergency department: an ethnographic study.</field><field name="creator">Lau, Bee Chuo</field><field name="description">Background Violence in the emergency department (ED) is a significant problem and it is increasing. Several studies have shown that violence in the ED is more likely to occur within the first hour of a patient&#8217;s presentation. Therefore, it is possible that there are some indicators of violence observable during the initial nurse-patient/relative interaction at triage. Nevertheless the problem remains inadequately investigated as many incidents are not reported and most studies that have investigated this issue are descriptive in nature. Although these studies have provided important preliminary information, they fail to reveal the complexities of the problem, in particular the cultural aspects of violence which are crucial for the ED. Aims The main aims of this study were to explore the cultural aspects of violence in the ED and to determine the possible indicators of violence at triage. Methodology Contemporary ethnography based on interpretive and post-positive paradigms was adopted to frame the methodology of this study. Methods This study was carried out at a major metropolitan ED over three months. The data collection techniques included field observations, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The data analysis framework adopted for this study incorporated Spradley's (1980) and LeCompte and Schensul's (1999) approaches. Findings The study indicated that the cultural meanings of violence were complex and highly subjective with variations among nurses which in turn influenced their responses to violence (e.g. reporting or not reporting an incident). The cultural meanings were sometimes contradictory and confusing as violence could be seen as both a challenge and a threat or predictable and unpredictable. The same type of behaviour from one individual could be perceived as violent but not for another. Many nurses perceived that violence was unpredictable and inevitable but the study demonstrated that there were indicators of violence which could be used to predict and prevent the problem. Factors such as environment, conflicting messages regarding waiting time, and patients' expectations and needs played an important part in violence. Besides, there were immediate warning signs of violence such as the overt verbal (e.g. mumbling or shouting) and covert nonverbal signs (e.g. staring or agitation). This study showed that patients' behaviours for instance being unfriendly, not appreciative, inattentive and uncooperative were better predictors of violence in the ED than their traits or problems alone. However, nurse-patient/relative behaviours and the resulting reciprocal relationship were considered central in determining if violence would occur or be avoided. Nurses' efforts to establish rapport with patients was crucial in minimising violence and needed to occur early. There was usually a &#8216;turning point&#8217; that provided an opportunity for the nurse to avoid violence. Nurses&#8217; behaviours at the &#8216;turning point&#8217; strongly influence the outcome. Nurses' awareness of their personal expectations, prejudices and ethnocentrisms were the pivotal points in preventing escalation of violence. Conclusion This study has provided a more comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of the cultural aspects of violence in the ED. While violence is a complex issue with many paradoxes, there are lessons to be learned. The study indicates that effective interpersonal empathetic communication has a significant role in reducing violence in the ED.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violence; aggression; assault; abuse; hospital</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radio propagation in fire environments.</field><field name="creator">Boan, Jonathan Alexander</field><field name="description">Radio propagation in the presence of fire is known to be problematic to communications. In this thesis we use both experimental and theoretical approaches to examine and understand radio propagation in fire environments. Propagation is examined for three small scale fires with broadband equipment operating from 50MHz to 1GHz. Results for line of sight propagation show a strong interaction of fire with electromagnetic propagation. The next section develops electromagnetic modelling of the fire environment. A model of the combustion induced plasma is developed, as well as a refractive index model of the surrounding atmosphere of a fire. Simple propagation calculations are undertaken, using the developed fire models, to provide an intial understanding of propagation in fire environments. The next portion of the thesis considers propagation using a more rigorous electromagnetic simulation technique. A modified Finite Difference Time Domain method is presented and is utilised to examine three dimensional propagation in the small scale fire experiments. The outcome is a more solid understanding of propagation and the contributing factors. The last portion of the thesis is the application of the above electromagnetic modelling and simulation methods to bushfire scenarios. Various scenarios that are problematic to radio communication are examined. Discussion and recommendations are made concerning radio communication frequency selection and considerations for propagation in fire environments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radio propagation; fire; wildfire; bushfire; FDTD</field><field name="subject">Radio in fire prevention.</field><field name="subject">Fire departments Communication systems</field><field name="subject">Forest fires Prevention and control Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58684</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin.

At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring animal disease and productivity in Samoa : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Taule'alo, Sina Fuatino</field><field name="description">This thesis presents two studies that form the basis of the Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries&#8217; (MAF) recent efforts to enhance its animal disease surveillance capacity. The first study investigated a method of enhancing the surveillance value of veterinary case data collected by the MAF&#8217;s Animal Health Service, which provides the only veterinary service for livestock in the country, through temporal analysis of cases and syndromes by species. Threshold levels generated from 3-monthly moving averages combined over 3 years of veterinary case data were used to identify unusually high numbers of cases and the cause of these unusual events were investigated. Further, the analysis of data in the system identified gaps in the coverage of the Animal Health Service which helped identify alternative methods for conducting surveillance in these areas using the Crops Division advisory officers. The objective of the second study was to identify if the veterinary case data collected by the Animal Health Service represented pig health problems in the general population. Reproduction and mortality patterns were compared on a group of 10 holdings that were regularly attended by the veterinary staff and 13 holdings that did not utilise the Animal Health Service. The performance of these holdings, measured in liveborn piglets per sow year and pre-weaning and post-weaning mortality were compared given their status as client or non-client of the service and their exposure to various management factors like confinement, protein supplementation, frequency of feeding, management time per sow per day, the use of improved or exotic breeds, the extent of commercial activity and, in the case of piglets their season of birth (rainy or dry season). The mean number of sows per herd was 6, producing a mean litter size of 6.1 piglets with a mean interfarrowing interval of 235 days. The median pre-weaning mortality per litter was 0 and a median of 1 piglet per litter was used for productive purposes (consumed, gifted or sold) at a median age of 153 days. It was found that the greatest influence on productivity in these holdings was nutrition. Sow productivity (in terms of liveborn piglets per sow year and pre-weaning survival) was best in the non-client, free range herds that did not provide protein supplementation (but whose feeding was unrestricted due to their freedom to roam and scavenge) and worst in client and non-client herds that were confined and not given protein supplementation (due to restricted and underfeeding). The mortality of pigs postweaning was significantly higher if they were free roaming, due to their loss to predation, theft and being hit by car. The study showed that the health status of pigs was better on holdings that did not use the Animal Health Service compared with those that did.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pigs</field><field name="subject">Swine</field><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="subject">Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Animal Health Service</field><field name="subject">Diseases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of physical planning policy on household energy use and greenhouse emissions.</field><field name="creator">Rickwood, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of physical planning policy on combined transport and dwelling-related energy use by households. Separate analyses and reviews are conducted into dwelling-related and transport-related energy use by households, before a model is developed to investigate the city-wide implications of different land-use scenarios in Sydney, Australia. The analysis of household energy use in Chapter 3 suggests that medium density housing (i.e. lose-rise apartments, townhouses, and terraces) is likely to result in the lowest per-capita energy use, while also allowing for sufficient densities to make frequent public transport service viable. The analysis of transport energy in Chapter 4 confirms that increasing urban density is associated with decreased car ownership and use, independent of other factors. However, land use changes alone are likely to result in modest changes to travel behaviour. The results of the scenario modelling in Chapters 7-9 support the view that changes to land use alone can reduce household energy consumption, but the changes, even over a long time period (25 years) are small (~0-10%) for all but the most extreme land-use policies. Instead, a coordinated (land-use/transport and other policy levers) approach is much more effective. The results confirm that it is transport energy that is most sensitive to planning policy, but that a combined consideration of dwelling-related and transport-related energy use is still useful. The micro-simulation model developed to assess the impact of different land-use planning scenarios allows the establishment of a lower-bound estimate of the effect that housing policy has on household energy use, assuming &#8216;business as usual&#8217; transport policy, household behaviour, and technology.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenhouse gas mitigation.</field><field name="subject">Greenhouse emissions.</field><field name="subject">Urban modelling.</field><field name="subject">Urban planning.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interconnections between Crete, the Aegean, and Anatolia, 11th-4th Millennia BCE</field><field name="creator">Krsmanovic, Damjan</field><field name="description">The topic of investigation of this thesis concerns a co-extensive analysis of Crete and Anatolia from the beginning of the Early Holocene (ca. 10,000 BCE) to the start of the Bronze Age (ca. 3000 BCE), with a select analysis of other locales in the Aegean, Levant, and eastern Mediterranean for comparative purposes.

One group of changes preserves cellular integrity through the regulation of cytoskeletal organization. Despite the recognised importance of maintaining microtubule (MT) networks, the specific mechanisms regulating cytoskeleton organisation in response to stress remain relatively poorly explored. Among the numerous proteins that regulate MT organisation, stathmin (STMN) is a key MT destabilising protein that regulates MT disassembly through its ability to bind tubulin dimers. The actions of STMN can be regulated by a number of growth factor-activated and cell cycle regulatory protein kinases. In preliminary work, our studies suggest the potential regulation of STMN by c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) in cells exposed to stress. Specifically, we observed changes in STMN phosphorylation which were coordinated with JNK activation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stathmin, JNK substrate, MAPK pathway, stress, phosphorylation</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speech as a surrogate marker of central nervous system function: practical, experimental and statistical considerations</field><field name="creator">Vogel, Adam P.</field><field name="description">The speech of an individual conveys a great deal of information about how their central nervous system (CNS) is performing. Whether they are tired, distressed or suffering from a degenerative disease affecting the brainstem, speech can change as a function of an individual&#8217;s condition. Yet, when assessing the speech in an individual on the first occasion, it is often difficult to determine whether their performance is different from a pre-morbid level. Therefore, the repeated acquisition and analysis of a set of brief and simple speech measures could provide information on changes in a patient&#8217;s performance over time. This could ultimately lead to the inclusion of objective markers of change in trials of conditions and disorders that currently rely of subjective, clinician derived measures of severity or patient self report, such as pain, depression or fatigue. Furthermore, the information could be used to track patient performance in treatment trials for degenerative disorders, such as Friedreich ataxia or Huntington&#8217;s disease.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">voice, speech, acoustics, central nervous system, monitoring change</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ariadne and the poetics of abandonment: echoes of loss and death in 'Heroides' 10</field><field name="creator">Hirsch, Rachel</field><field name="description">The Ovidian Ariadne of Heroides 10 self-consciously constructs her persona into the archetype of erotic abandonment. The heroine attempts to re-write her destiny and reverse the loss of Theseus and her unfulfilled desire. But Ariadne cannot change her depiction as abandoned by Theseus. The language employed in her epistle only succeeds in emphasising the erotic loss. The more Ariadne tries to change the master narrative, the more she accentuates the literary echoes of her abandonment. This thesis argues that the intertextual echoes of the heroine should not exclusively be read from Catullus 64, but that Ovid&#8223;s Ariadne writes her epistle in the context of many genres - elegy, epic, tragedy, exilic elegy - which all emphasise loss, death, and erotic disillusionment. My reading of Heroides 10 avoids the interpretations of parody previously read of this particular heroine to argue instead the way Ariadne constructs the governing persona in accordance with the genres of both elegy and epistolography. Ariadne&#8223;s self-representation as an elegiac puella ultimately reflects her traditional literary and artistic image.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ovid, elegy, gender, epistolary</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model of visual discomfort and its implications for efficient reading performance</field><field name="creator">Conlon, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Visual discomfort has been described as an extreme sensitivity to bright or intermittent light and some forms of repetitive pattern stimuli. This sensitivity can result in physical symptoms of eye-strain and headache and induction of anomalous perceptual features with exposure to pattern (Wilkins et al., 1984). The pattern percept produced by the lines of print on a page of text has been likened to the pattern of anomalous stripes which can induce unpleasant effects in sensitive individuals (Wilkins &amp; Nimmo-Smith, 1987). This sensitivity is increased in observers who report regular headache or those who report eye-strain and headache when reading.Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome was a term coined by Men (1983) to describe a symptom complex which described anomalous physical, perceptual and performance difficulties reported when reading. This symptom complex is characterised by experience of photophobia, eye-strain difficulties, difficulties with depth perception and experience of anomalous perceptual difficulty with exposure to the print on a page of text (Irlen, 1983). As a result of these difficulties severe reading difficulty has been reported.In this work a model of visual discomfort was developed which combined the reports of physical and perceptual difficulties induced from observation of high contrast square-wave repetitive spatial patterns and a page of text (Wilkins et al., 1984; Wilkins &amp; Nimmo-Smith, 1984; 1987) and the performance difficulties reported by Irlen (1983) to occur when reading. A unidimensional model of visual discomfort was developed using a rating scale version of the Rasch model in which person and item parameters were combined on a simple logistic scale. From this model it was predicted that as the number of positive responses to items on the visual discomfort scale increased the probability of experiencing more severe visual discomfort increased. This increasing difficulty would be revealed by a greater number of reports of unpleasant physical side-effects and anomalous perceptual distortion from repetitive spatial patterns. Performance difficulty if present would be reflected in reduced task efficiency.The similarities between this model and Wilkins (1986a) conceptualisation of visual discomfort was tested with investigation of reports of unpleasant physical side-effects and perceptual distortion from observation of square-wave gratings of intermediate spatial frequency and a page of text. It was found that higher scorers on the visual discomfort scale reported significantly more unpleasant physical side-effects and perceptual distortions from all the pattern types presented than low scorers on the scale. Further analysis demonstrated that high headache susceptibility observers also obtained higher scores on the visual discomfort scale, and reported a significantly greater number of unpleasant physical side-effects from observation of the high contrast square-waves than low headache susceptibility observers. Reports of perceptual distortion among this high headache susceptibility group produced inconsistent results. It was concluded that the visual discomfort scale was a more sensitive measure of visual discomfort than unitary reports of single physical characteristics, although these may contribute.The spatial frequency at which most severe anomalous effects were induced was also investigated. Classifying observers into groups on the basis of scores obtained on the visual discomfort scale three groups, a severe, moderate visual discomfort and control group were formed. The results of these experiments demonstrated that for the severe visual discomfort group when a large pattern size and ten second exposure duration was used greatest physical unpleasantness and perceptual distortion was reported in the intermediate spatial frequency range and for the control and moderate visual discomfort groups greatest difficulty of both types was reported at high spatial frequency. When pattern size was reduced all groups reported greatest difficulty of both types at high spatial frequencies. These findings were explained in terms of a lower threshold of stimulation for the severe visual discomfort group in the intermediate spatial frequency range when a large pattern size and ten second exposure duration was used.Additional findings from these studies demonstrated that a single spatial frequency channel may be sufficient to induce unpleasant effects in both groups. The spatial frequency of greatest sensitivity differed among groups. This finding failed to support the hypothesis that the most sensitive spatial frequency channel would correspond to the most sensitive channel at threshold levels. The level in the visual system at which these effects are generated appears to extend from a retinal to cortical level, with the severe visual discomfort group reporting a number of illusory features induced at a cortical level when an intermediate spatial frequency of large size was presented.In order to examine the effects of this sensitivity a number of performance tests were conducted. Several experiments manipulated the square-wave-like structure of the global pattern. It was found that the severe visual discomfort group performed a letter orientation identification task significantly more slowly than other groups, although the moderate visual discomfort group reported significantly greater subjective difficulty with task performance. The performance of all visual discomfort groups on the Coding-B subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children - Revised differed significantly from one another with the severe visual discomfort group performing least efficiently on the task. A strong relationship was found between total scores on the visual discomfort scale and Coding-B score. As the score on the visual discomfort scale increased the score on the Coding-B test decreased. This relationship accounted for 69% of the variance in the data. The severe visual discomfort group also read a text passage significantly more slowly than other groups, although comprehension did not differ from that of other groups. The performance results were explained in terms of McConkie and Zola's (1987) model of visual attention when reading. This model used a four level object hierarchy extending from the global percept of the page to the word level. It was argued that as a result of extreme sensitivity to the pattern percept the severe visual discomfort group is unable to avoid attending to the global pattern percept of the page. This produces unpleasant somatic and perceptual effects and reduces attention to the word and letter level, thus producing performance difficulties. It was predicted that this difficulty may be induced by anomalous interactions between the sustained and transient mechanisms, due to increased activity in the transient mechanism or decreased activity in the sustained mechanism. In some cases visual discomfort may be so great that the perceptual and physical difficulty generated may produce interference leading to higher level cognitive difficulties. This explanation does not fully describe visual discomfort as some observers experience performance difficulty when a square-wave-like percept is not presented. In this case more severe difficulty may concurrently exist.It was concluded that subjective report of physical and perceptual difficulty may suggest the presence of visual discomfort, however, coexisting performance difficulty must also be observable in the case of severe visual discomfort where a visual processing deficit is present. Overall this research demonstrates that a latent visual discomfort trait does exist. Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome can be explained within this framework as a perceptual difficulty resulting from sensitivity to the pattern percept from the page of printed text. The efficacy of colour in reducing the unpleasant effects induced was less clear, although performance for the severe visual discomfort group only was enhanced when colour was added to the display. The colour producing improved performance, however, varied between observers. More detailed research is required to further investigate this effect.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Kylie Anne, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This program of research investigated the nature and processes of autobiographical memory deficits in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Study 1 examined the proposition that difficulties in the retrieval of specific memories present a risk factor for posttraumatic psychopathology. A prospective study of fire-fighters found that a significant predictor of posttraumatic stress was a deficit in retrieving specific memories to positive cues before trauma. Study 2 investigated whether autobiographical retrieval deficits in PTSD can be modified by psychological treatment. Results found that as PTSD symptoms reduced following treatment, individuals with PTSD retrieved more specific memories to positive cues. Together, these results indicated that specific retrieval deficits to positive cues present a vulnerability factor for PTSD. However, this memory style appears to be receptive to modification following therapy. Study 3 investigated the association between autobiographical retrieval deficits and impaired problemsolving in PTSD. Participants with PTSD retrieved more overgeneral categoric memories and took longer to retrieve memories than non-PTSD trauma controls. This deficit was associated with impaired social problem-solving, suggesting that specific retrieval is related to successful problem solving. In an analogue design, Studies 4 and 5 investigated the proposition that resource limitations may underpin autobiographical retrieval deficits. Results generally supported the proposal that reduced cognitive resources may be a mechanism contributing to specific retrieval deficits. Studies 6 and 7 examined rumination as another possible mechanism responsible for these retrieval deficits. Study 6 found high anxious participants retrieved fewer specific memories to positive cues following rumination, compared  to distraction. Study 7 found evidence that negative rumination in the high anxious group increased categoric retrieval, whereas positive rumination had no effect. Study 8 found retrieval of trauma-related self-defining memories was strongly associated with personal goals connected to the trauma. Study 9 found that discrepancies in one???s self construct were related to the retrieval of trauma memories to positive cues.

In populations, inbreeding depression can reduce growth rates and increases extinction risk. The aims of this thesis are to investigate inbreeding depression in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and to study the evolution of mechanisms for inbreeding avoidance in females, using guppies from a feral population in Queensland, Australia. Male guppies are highly polymorphic in their sexual ornamentation, indeed they show one of the most extreme polymorphisms observed in nature. Female guppies exhibit complex mate choice based on preferences for ornamentation, as well as social context.  I aim is to examine how these factors of inbreeding avoidance alter sexual selection.   In male guppies I found strong inbreeding depression in male sperm numbers, which is amplified under semi-natural compared to laboratory conditions (Chapter 2). Moreover, inbreeding depression results in low fertility under sperm competition: an experiment using artificial insemination techniques reveals that highly inbred males are heavily disadvantaged in gaining paternity (Chapter 3). On population level, inbreeding depression is manifest in reduced growth rates, predominantly in the early stages of inbreeding (Chapter 4). Population growth at inbreeding coefficients f=0.375-0.59 did not seem to lead to inbreeding depression, whereas lower levels of inbreeding reduced population growth. Although the growth rates in inbred populations appear normal, severe inbreeding depression is uncovered after outbred immigrants are added.  Specifically, male immigrants are most efficient in short-term genetic rescue, probably due to insemination of large numbers of females whereas females are limited in the number of eggs they can produce (Chapter 4).  Male ornamental traits show significant inbreeding depression in semi-natural conditions only (Chapters 2 &amp; 3). Inbreeding avoidance mechanisms seem to have evolved in females: they prefer courtship displays of non-inbred males (Chapter 2), unfamiliar males (Chapter 5) and males with rare patterns (Chapter 6). This preference might increase the mating success of immigrants, and may have evolved to facilitate the avoidance of inbreeding. Together with context-independent preferences for ornament combinations (Chapter 6), it also offers an explanation for the maintenance of polymorphism in this species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guppy</field><field name="subject">sexual selection</field><field name="subject">inbreeding avoidance</field><field name="subject">Poecilia reticulata</field><field name="subject">mate choice</field><field name="subject">familiarity</field><field name="subject">female preference</field><field name="subject">inbreeding depression</field><field name="subject">sperm competition,</field><field name="subject">complex traits</field><field name="subject">selection analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance: issues related to executive compensation, corporate boards and institutional investor monitoring</field><field name="creator">Smith, Gavin Stuart, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains five research projects within the context of two distinctive issues that concern the effectiveness of executive compensation in aligning executive interests with shareholders and how institutional investors play a role in structuring corporate governance mechanisms. The objective of this dissertation is to first determine how institutions should exert their influence if they are serious about alleviating agency problems and improving firm performance. Second, the thesis seeks to determine whether institutional investors use their influence to shape executive compensation and corporate governance mechanisms in a manner consistent with aligning managerial interests with shareholders and increasing shareholder wealth. The thesis finds that CEOs with option incentives increase the likelihood that a firm will increase risk by undertaking both major real investments and acquisitions. Moreover, CEO option grants are positively related to measures of firm valuation and operating performance suggesting option incentives are an important mechanism to align CEO interests with shareholders. This is robust to alternative measures of firm valuation and operating performance, also various estimation techniques. Using these findings to motivate the direction of institutional influence on executive compensation, it is found that institutional investors, particularly smaller activist traders, significantly increase option grant incentives received by executives. Institutional influence also raises CEO pay which is consistent with preservation of reservation CEO utility levels. Addressing the role of institutional investors in the context of other corporate governance mechanisms, it is found that institutional investor influence is also negatively related to board size and positively related to board independence, which is achieved by removal of inside directors. Such actions are consistent with empirical studies that show smaller boards and increased levels of independent directors improve firm performance and board decision making.  The main conclusion from this dissertation is that option incentives are an effective mechanism to align CEO interests with those of shareholders. Institutional investors appear to recognise this importance, and effectively use their influence to increase options received by executives. Combined with institutional investors putting in place corporate boards that provide better oversight of management, institutional investors appear to be effective monitors of the firms in which they invest.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Institutional Investors</field><field name="subject">Corporate Governance</field><field name="subject">Executive Compensation</field><field name="subject">Compensation management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geomorphology of Southeast Australian mountain streams</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Chris J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the morphology and sediment transport dynamics of mountain streams in southeast Australia. Mountain streams represent important geomorphological and ecological systems in Australia which have hitherto been poorly studied. The variability of mountain stream reach morphology was investigated at the regional scale using topographical surveys and sediment sampling techniques. Study sites were stratified by slope and local lithology. Eight channel-morphologies including Bedrock, Cascade, Step-pool, Planebed, Pool-Riffle, Cascade-pool, Riffle-step and Infilled, were identified using an objective statistical approach. Overall, channel types were found to correspond to existing reach-scale mountain stream templates. Five morphologies were associated with a specific lithology type which controlled the size and shape of grains supplied to the channels.  Differences in coarse sediment transport processes between morphologies were investigated using stream monitoring techniques and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Monitoring results from a 3 year period indicated that channel beds are resistant to entrainment with shear stress thresholds for bedload transport ranging between 64 to 74 N/m2. Transport of reach median grain sizes requires floods that exceed bankfull discharge. Existing competence equations were found to over-predict the hydraulic driving force and consequently, a modified entrainment model was used to account for the regional channel characteristics.   OSL dating was investigated as a tool to provide data on long-term sediment transport processes. Minimum age model results from the OSL dates show overall agreement with a selected entrainment model, and indicate differences in sediment transport dynamics between some reach morphology types. A regime model was used to quantify the physical domains of different channel morphologies. Limitations of the model were overcome by modifying the sediment supply surrogate to better reflect the dominant transported bedload size. Morphology types were delineated according to different sediment transport capacity-sediment supply domains.  The distribution of channel morphology types within a series of catchments in southeast Australia was modelled within a GIS platform using the diagnostics of reach morphology derived from this study. The model provides a conceptual framework to evaluate the potential link between channel form, potential habitat diversity and aquatic biodiversity within the channel network in mountain streams.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mountain streams</field><field name="subject">morpho-statistical classification</field><field name="subject">channels</field><field name="subject">optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL)</field><field name="subject">bed material storage</field><field name="subject">morphologies</field><field name="subject">habitat diversity</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">bedload transport</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Southeast</field><field name="subject">Southeastern</field><field name="subject">river channels</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating five models of dissemination of NHMRC 'Guideline depression in young people for GP's' through divisions of general practice</field><field name="creator">Penrose-Wall, Jonine., Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Dissemination of evidence-based mental health clinical practice guidelines had not been studied in Australia prior to the National General Practice Guideline Implementation Program. This naturalistic research reports ten national interventions designed to disseminate the NHMRC 1997 Clinical Practice Guideline Depression in Young People for GPs (GDIYP-GP) through 123 Divisions of General Practice. The guideline covered depression and suicide in young people aged 13 to 20 years. Aim: To evaluate a 'coordinated link agent' and 'enhanced packaged approach' for disseminating a national guideline by engaging 20 Divisions in using 5 dissemination models and to measure Divisions' capacities in performing unfunded local dissemination to GPs. Method: An Implementation Kit was the main national intervention, housing the guidelines and 5 models: Education by the Division; Education by an external provider; 3) Clinical Audit; 4) Segmented Formats and 5) Appraisal. Five studies are reported: 1) an organisational census on guideline-related practices in all topics; 2) a Case Study Database of 3 consecutive interviews of 51 participating Divisions; 3) a Guideline Appraisal study of 9 cohorts of doctors; 4) a Clinical Audit study of 54 doctors involving 1200 patients; and 5) a 'Segmented Formats' documentary analysis of Division communications on GDIYP-GP. Results: Prior dissemination by most Divisions was administrative mail outs rather than planned programs. In all, 70 instead of the pilot 20 organisations participated (57% of the sector) using 10,000 guidelines: 45 participated by 7 weeks and 71 by 35 weeks and the majority used multiple active strategies showing fidelity to the Kit. Education by the Division, Segmented Formats and Appraisal were the most adopted models. GDIYP-GP was acceptable and relevant to the majority of Divisions and to 9 samples of doctors. Conclusion: Divisions are one appropriate system through which evidence-based mental health guidelines can be disseminated to general practitioners. Uptake can be rapid using a flexible enhanced package approach with link-agent support. 3-6 months is needed for organisations to begin effective interventions.

With the development of high Dk/t lens materials, overnight therapy has become the modality of choice for OK. Overnight OK lens wear has been previously investigated in terms of its efficacy to reduce myopia. However, the underlying effects of overnight OK lens wear on the human cornea have received less attention. As well as the clinical efficacy of overnight OK, this study investigated the effects of overnight OK on topographical corneal thickness and the overnight corneal edema response, and corneal tissue changes with overnight OK. Eighteen subjects participated as the OK lens-wearing group, wearing BE lenses (UltraVision, Brisbane, Queensland) in both eyes. A further ten subjects participated as control subjects, wearing conventional rigid lenses (J-Contour, UltraVision) in the right eye (RE) only. The left eye (LE) acted as a non-lens-wearing control. Both groups wore lenses overnight only, with no lens wear during the day. Measurements were conducted at baseline then on day 1, 4, 10, 30, 60, and 90 for the OK lens-wearing eyes; and up to day 30 for the control group, in the morning (after overnight lens wear) and in the evening (after 8-10 hours of lens removal). Variables measured included best vision sphere (BVS), unaided logMAR visual acuity (VA), refractive astigmatism, apical corneal power (ACP), simulated K readings (Medmont E300 corneal topographer), topographical corneal thickness (Holden-Payor optical pachometer), and keratocyte and endothelial cell densities (ConfoScan2 confocal microscope).  Approximately 75% of myopia was corrected after the first night of OK lens wear and the changes in refractive error stabilised by day 10. By day 90, myopia reduction averaged 2.54 ?? 0.63 D. This was associated with significant improvement in unaided VA of about 82% after the first night of lens wear. There was no change in refractive astigmatism over the 3-month period. There was significant reduction in ACP in the OK lens-wearing eyes after the first night of lens wear, which accounted for more than 70% of the total ACP change over the 3-month period (RE: -2.16 ?? 0.53 D; LE: -2.11 ?? 0.86 D). There was significant central epithelial thinning (about 30%) and significant thickening (about 3%) in the mid-peripheral stroma in the OK lens-wearing eyes. Significant central epithelial thinning was found after the first night of lens wear while thickening in the mid-peripheral stroma reached statistical significance by day 4. Further analysis suggests that topographical corneal thickness changes account for the refractive error changes with overnight OK lens wear, rather than corneal bending. The central overnight stromal edema response was significantly reduced in the OK lens-wearing eyes (1.2 ?? 0.5%) to a level lower than in the conventional RGP (6.2 ?? 1.2%) and non-lens-wearing eyes (2.5 ?? 0.9%) in the control group. Mid-peripheral and peripheral stromal edema responses showed similar levels to those predicted based on lens Dk/t. A single overnight wear of BE and Paragon Corneal Refractive Therapy (CRT) lenses showed that the edema response to BE lens wear is significantly less than in the CRT lens-wearing eyes (BE: 2.5 ?? 0.7%; CRT 3.5 ?? 1.3%) immediately on eye opening.  No significant changes were found in either central stromal keratocyte or endothelial cell densities in either OK or control groups over the study period. In conclusion, overnight OK lens wear induces significant reductions in myopia after the first night of lens wear associated with improvement in unaided VA. Overnight OK lens wear causes significant thinning in the central epithelium and significant mid-peripheral stromal thickening which results in flattening of the central cornea and steepening in the mid-periphery. Although there were no significant changes in central stromal keratocyte and endothelial cell densities, thinning of the central epithelial layer raises concerns regarding the safety of the procedure, especially with the alarming number of corneal infections reported recently in the literature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orthokeratology</field><field name="subject">myopia</field><field name="subject">corneal thickness</field><field name="subject">corneal curvature</field><field name="subject">contact lenses</field><field name="subject">cornea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">External loads and the neural control of posture</field><field name="creator">Chew, John Zong Zheng, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the processes of human postural control. How do we keep still? In any action, the force required changes with limb position. This force-position relationship is elastic stiffness. Holding a desired posture requires muscle activation that accounts for this load property. The studies here examine the physiological processes of postural control as elastic stiffness changes. Psychophysical studies show that thresholds for detecting differences in load stiffness are large relative to those normally encountered. To discriminate stiffness, subjects made consistent movements and judged the force required and detection thresholds followed rules for force perception. For the purposes of postural control, stiffness per se is not a variable of primary interest. The effects of load stiffness on postural stability were investigated using a pendulum that allowed independent control of load force and stiffness. Postural stability varied with load stiffness and this effect was independent of load force. Performance deteriorated as load stiffness became more negative. Load-dependent changes were at low frequencies only, suggesting neural processes operating at long latency, and perhaps ???volitional??? tracking, are the key to postural control. Imposed perturbations evoke patterns of muscle activation reflecting the state of the neural pathways of postural control. Stretch responses obtained while subjects held different loads show that the short-latency spinal reflex and the long-latency functional reflex in the active flexor muscle are unaffected by load stiffness. However, a stereotyped response observed after stretch-reflex latency varied systematically with load stiffness, as did reciprocal activation of the antagonist extensor muscle. The long-latency reflex appears to be a part of a coordinated reciprocal response of antagonist muscle pairs. Adapting to load properties involves modulating these later neural responses. A method was developed, based on ultrasound, to track changes in muscle and tendon length associated with small postural movements. The relationship between wrist angle and muscle and tendon length in the active muscle changed with load stiffness. Particularly with negative-stiffness loads, the wrist moves on the end of a compliant tendon without corresponding changes in muscle length. Thus, compensation of postural performance by neural modulation is limited by the properties of muscle and tendon.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motor control</field><field name="subject">Posture</field><field name="subject">Proprioception</field><field name="subject">Muscle</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural design of shape-adaptive composite marine propellers</field><field name="creator">Mulcahy, Norman Lex, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Nickel-Aluminium-Bronze alloy is the most common material for ship propellers but, more recently, composite materials have been used in propeller construction. One of the advantages of the use composite materials for ship propellers is that they allow the possibility of shape-adaptability. A shape-adaptive propeller is one that is designed so that the blades deform with load changes in such a way that the propeller performance is enhanced in comparison to that of a conventional ??rigid?? propeller, e.g. the goal of shape-adaptability may be higher efficiency over a greater range of operating conditions, or reduced cavitation and noise. This shape-adaptability can be achieved through the choice of the appropriate blade geometry, and the optimum arrangement of composite materials. A design method for composite shape-adaptive propellers is developed and tested in this work. The method has a baseline rigid propeller as the starting point. A novel method is used to identify a design condition at which the rigid and flexible propellers have identical shapes, and therefore performance. Optimisation procedures, to find the unloaded shape and composite material properties, are a necessary part of the shape-adaptive propeller design method. A shape-adaptive flexible propeller has generally improved performance compared to that of the baseline rigid propeller. As well, a coupled hydrodynamic/structural analysis is required so that the performance of flexible and rigid propellers can be compared. The results of a study of the twist characteristics of straight and curved cantilever beams with various amounts of skew are reported. The cantilever beams are structural analogues of hydrofoils and propeller blades, and the aim of the study is to identify the desired material and geometrical characteristics for shape-adaptive propellers and hydrofoils. Two case studies, that demonstrate the developed design procedures, are described: Design of a flexible hydrofoil, and Design of a flexible propeller. In both cases, the desired shape-adaptive behaviour is achieved but the performance gains are small. It is felt that the example structures do not have sufficient flexibility to take full advantage of shape-adaptability. Possible means of achieving greater flexibility are optimisation of the baseline shape (planform and thickness distribution) for flexibility, and selection of composite materials that maximise flexibility, within the strength requirements. An expression is developed for estimating the efficiency gain of a shape-adaptive propeller operating at the design condition in a ship??s wake. Calculations show that, even for what is considered to be a relatively flexible propeller, the expected efficiency gains are small (&lt; 1%). However, small gains in efficiency across the range, can be significant for the operation of a ship. Furthermore, efficiency gains are higher at off-design conditions as a shape-adaptive design broadens the efficiency curve.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Titanium surface modification by oxidation for biomedical application</field><field name="creator">Abdullah, Hasan Zuhudi, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surface modification is a process that is applied to the surfaces of titanium substrates in order to improve the biocompatibility after implanting in the body.  Two methods were used in the present work:  Anodisation and gel oxidation.  Anodisation was performed at room temperature in strong mineral acids (sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4)), an oxidising agent (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)), mixed solutions of the preceding three, and a weak organic acid mixture (&#946;-glycerophosphate + calcium acetate).  The parameters used in anodisation were:  Concentrations of the electrolytes, applied voltage, current density, and anodisation time.  Gel oxidation was carried out by soaking titanium substrates in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solutions at different concentrations (0.5 M, 1.0 M, 5.0 M, and 10.0 M) at 60??C for 24 h, followed by oxidation at 400??, 600??, and 800??C for 1 h.  Conceptual models representing changes in the microstructure as a function of the experimental parameters were developed using the anodisation data.  The relevant parameters were:  Applied voltage, current density, acid concentration, and anodisation time:  ??	The model for anodisation using the strong acid (H2SO4) illustrates the growth rate of the film, identification of the threshold for the establishment of a consistent microstructure, and prediction of the properties of the film. ??	For the oxidising agent (H2O2), two models were developed:  Current-control and voltage-control, the applicability of which depends on the scale of the current density (high or low, respectively).  These models are interpreted in terms of the coherency/incoherency of the corrosion gel, arcing, and porosity. ??	The model for the strongest acid (H3PO4) is similar to that of H2O2 in current-control mode, although this system showed the greatest intensity of arcing and consequent pore size. ??	Anodisation in mixed solutions uses Ohm??s law to explain four stages of film growth in current-control mode.  These stages describe the thickness of the gel, its recrystallisation, and the achievement of a consistent microstructure. ??	Anodisation in weaker organic acids allows the most detailed examination of the anodisation process.  Both current density and voltage as a function time reveal the nature of the process in six stages:  (1) instrumental response, (2 and 3) gel thickening, (4) transformation of the amorphous gel to amorphous titania, (5) recrystallisation of the amorphous titania, and (6) subsurface pore generation upon establishment of a consistent microstructure.  Gel oxidation was done at low and high NaOH concentrations followed by oxidation.  Three models were developed to represent the gel oxidation process:  (1) Low concentration, (0.5 M and 1.0 M NaOH), (2) Medium concentration (5.0 M NaOH), and (3) high concentration (10.0 M NaOH).  For the low concentrations with increasing temperature, the model involves:  (1) amorphous sodium titanate forms over a layer of amorphous anatase and (2) a dense layer of rutile forms.  For the high concentrations with increasing temperature, the model involves:  (1) amorphous sodium titanate forms over a layer of amorphous anatase, (2) a dense layer of anatase forms and raises up the existing porous anatase layer, and (3) the dense and porous anatase layers transform to dense and porous rutile layers, respectively.  The main difference between the two is the retention of crystalline sodium titanate in the higher NaOH concentration.  Anodised and gel oxidised samples subsequently were soaked in simulated body fluid in order to study the precipitation of hydroxyapatite in the absence and presence of long UV irradiation, which has not been investigated before.  With the anodised surfaces, the porous and rough titania coating facilitated both the precipitation of hydroxyapatite and the attachment of bone-like cells.  UV irradiation showed greatly enhanced hydroxyapatite precipitation, which is attributed to its photocatalytic properties.  With the gel oxidised surfaces, the greatest amount of hydroxyapatite precipitation occurred with the presence of both anatase and amorphous sodium titanate.

This view has been supported by a number of researchers who hypothesise that to achieve reductions in transport emissions individuals need to be encouraged to use public transport, and the most appropriate method of increasing public transport use occurs predominately from building residential areas at high densities around public transport nodes.  This notion is integral to recent urban growth management policies in Sydney, which have sought to increase residential densities under the rubric of urban consolidation. There are a number of researchers who have promoted the benefit of increasing urban densities as a way of increasing public transport use.  In Australia, the most cited research in this area is that of Newman and Kenworthy.  Nonetheless, there are a number of commentators who have criticised the emphasis of density in increasing public transport use.  These commentators assert that factors other than density, particularly socio-economic factors, are more important in influencing public transport use.  Nevertheless, a major gap within this concept is that the research is conducted at the macro-level with minimal analysis at the meso or micro level.  This thesis attempts to fill a gap in our knowledge by assessing the relationship between urban density and public transport use, particularly trains, at the macro, meso and micro level.  The analyses used data across the Sydney metropolitan area and by geographical location to assess the implications of the density-public transport debate, and its articulation in urban consolidation policies.  Such an analysis also has implications for other Australian cities who have promoted urban consolidation.  The study concludes that residential density is not as important as socio-economic factors in influencing one form of public transport use, namely trains.  Variables such as car ownership, country of origin, housing tenure, and the type and location of employment are more important in influencing train use than density.  The study concludes that at the macro level the notion of increasing densities increases public transport use is plausible, yet at the micro level the relationship between high density housing and public transport use (in this case train use) is more complex.  This suggests that the promotion of urban consolidation policies as a means to increase public transport use needs to be re-assessed.  Importantly, there is still much research to be conducted to fully comprehend the relationships between housing and transport in order to better inform urban growth management policies in cities, including Sydney.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Residential density</field><field name="subject">Urban consolidation</field><field name="subject">Public transport</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of nanoparticle dispersion, biological interactions and drug incorporation of polyurethane nanocomposite materials</field><field name="creator">Farrugia, Brooke Louise, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of polymer nanocomposites (NCs) in industrial applications has received growing attention over the past decade due to their improved mechanical properties.  However, little work has been reported which analyses the efficacy of NCs in biological applications, including drug delivery systems and implantable materials. This thesis examines the effect of the chemistry of the organic modifier (OM) on the structure and biological performance of poly(ether)urethane NCs (PUNCs) and the influence of the method of drug incorporation on interactions between drug and NC.  Organically modified silicates (OMS) were prepared using OMs varying in terminal functionality and alkyl chain length.  PUNCs were solvent cast containing 1 and 3wt% OMS and particle dispersion analysed using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.  Findings revealed that use of an OM with methyl terminal, dodecylamine (12CH3), resulted in superior dispersion of OMS compared with a carboxyl terminated OM, aminododecanoic acid (12COOH), of equivalent alkyl chain length.  This is believed to result from increased self interaction of 12COOH compared with 12CH3.  Additionally, increased alkyl chain length was shown to improve NC dispersion with a chain length of sixteen units resulting in the optimum dispersion with a partially exfoliated NC structure.  Analysis of cellular interactions with the PUNCs revealed a significant difference in both fibroblast and platelet adhesion to NCs incorporating 12CH3 compared with 12COOH.  Surface analysis using ToF-SIMS demonstrated the presence of 12CH3 fragments on the NC surface supporting the hypothesis that surface expressed OMs alter cellular interactions with the NC.  Altering the alkyl chain length also affected cellular interaction with an alkyl chain length of twelve units or greater, substantially reducing fibroblast adhesion without affecting cell growth inhibition or viability. Incorporation of a model drug, crystal violet, into the PUNCs demonstrated a lower degree of disruption to OMS dispersion when loaded post NC fabrication compared with pre fabrication.  This is believed to result from interactions between the drug and NC constituents which also impacted on drug release from the NC system.  Results show PUNC properties and biological interactions can be modulated through OM variation and fabrication method, thus showing potential for use in biomedical applications.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomaterial</field><field name="subject">Polyurethane</field><field name="subject">Nanocomposite</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immunological correlates of illness severity and course in acute Q fever</field><field name="creator">Everett, Beth Jennifer, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Acute Q fever is the disease manifestation of Coxiella burnetii infection.  This obligate intracellular bacterium is phagocytosed by innate immune cells, where it replicates within the usually bactericidal environment of the phagolysosome.  As the immune response is activated, the resultant pro-inflammatory cytokines aid in pathogen clearance but also trigger an acute sickness response in the host.  This thesis describes the natural history of acute Q fever in a prospective cohort ??? the Dubbo Infection Outcomes Study (DIOS).  In these subjects, the acute febrile illness was characterised by severe headache, drenching sweats and fatigue.  In approximately 10% of subjects, symptomatic illness marked by fatigue remained present for months, or occasionally years, after the acute illness.  Subjects with more severe acute illness were more likely to develop this post Q fever fatigue syndrome (QFS).  The aim of this thesis was to determine whether ongoing infection or aberrant immune activation drive the prolonged symptoms of QFS.  Sensitive real time PCR detection of Coxiella DNA revealed a significant minority of subjects had very low copy numbers in circulating monocytes, with an increased prevalence in those with QFS. However, the detection was not consistently found within individual subjects and the copy number was at the threshold of reliable detection.  C. burnetii was shown here to stimulate cytokine production in monocytic cells via interaction with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and not TLR-4.  Functional polymorphisms in these TLRs were identified in subjects with Q fever, but were not associated with Q fever susceptibility, severity or duration.  Phase I-specific responses are believed to be critical in the generation of protective immunity to C. burnetii, yet the phase II-specific responses of innate and adaptive immune components were consistently of higher magnitude. Whole C. burnetii organisms induced antigen-non-specific T cell activation, presumably via the indirect activation of monocytes by C. burnetii LPS.  No significant differences were found in the magnitude or kinetics of the host response to infection, or in the carriage of genetic polymorphisms, when comparing subjects who developed QFS with subjects who had promptly resolving illness.  It remains unclear what factors mediate the progression of acute Q fever to QFS.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fatigue</field><field name="subject">Q fever</field><field name="subject">Coxiella burnetii</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ORIGINS OF ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS</field><field name="creator">Meng, Jia</field><field name="description">The present study is a unity of science and philosophy. Previous studies of the attitudes towards animals suggest they are far from universal. The majority of existing studies are largely based on animal welfare in the Western world, which represents approximately 12% of the world human population. Little attention has been given to people in other parts of the world. People sometimes assume that animal welfare is the equivalent of animal protection, or positive attitudes towards animals, though the difference between animal welfare and animal rights has gained some attention. The present study was placed in a global context; it not only investigated the attitudes of people from vastly different backgrounds, but also investigated the relationship between attitudes towards animal issues and world issues. Three distinct types of animal protection, Animal Welfare, Reverence for Animals, and New Welfarism were identified by scientific methods. The major research method was an international survey of university students distributed online during 2007 &#8211; 2008. The survey was presented in the official languages of participating nations, and over 90 variables were investigated. The participants were invited by local collaborators from different parts of the nation based on probability sampling. In total, 4,514 filled questionnaires were received from 12 nations by the middle of 2008. The 12 nations were: China (mainland), Czech Republic, Iran, Ireland, Macedonia, Norway, Portugal, Serbia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J.Meng - ORIGINS OF ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS - 2009 Abstract 19 The results were weighted by the gender ratio, level of education and area of study obtained from other sources; the results were also adjusted by tertiary enrolment rate of the nation. Factor analysis, one self-developed program and other types of statistical techniques were applied to the raw results. In total nine Attitudes to Animal Indices were established for different types of attitudes. Two indices were created to calculate people&#8217;s attitudes to animal welfare and animal rights. The origin of positive attitude to animals was discussed from an evolutionary perspective; the relationship between holism and reverence for animals was explored. Important conclusions of the present study are shown below: &#183; The definitions for animal protection and vegetarianism are different in different nations. &#183; Prevalent stereotypes of the attitudes of some societies are incomplete and unrepresentative. &#183; Animal Welfare and Reverence for Animals are two fundamentally different attitudes towards animals. &#183; A holistic world view is tied to high Reverence for Animals. &#183; Animal Rights is a product of animal welfare and Reverence for Animals. Societies can have low levels of animal welfare but high levels of animal rights when Animal Welfare is low but the Reverence for Animals is high. &#183; &#8216;New Welfarism&#8217;, a term coined by Gary L. Francione, is identified scientifically. This type of animal protection does not challenge the property status of animals and is different from Animal Rights; Integrity of animals and zoo issues are important aspects of Animal Rights but have been given limited attention in New Welfarism. &#183; In total the four types of animal protection explain 32.8% of the variation in the overall attitudes to animals. The degree of the different types of animal protection are: Animal Welfare &#8211; UK&gt; Spain, Iran, Norway, Serbia&gt;China, Czech, Ireland, South Korea, Macedonia, Sweden; New Welfarism &#8211; UK&gt;Serbia&gt;Macedonia&gt;Spain&gt;China, Czech, Ireland, Norway&gt;Iran, Sweden&gt;South Korea; Reverence for Animals &#8211; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J.Meng - ORIGINS OF ATTITUDES TOWARDS ANIMALS - 2009 Abstract 20 UK&gt;Macedonia&gt;China, Serbia&gt;Spain&gt;Czech, Ireland, South Korea, Norway, Sweden&gt;Iran; Animal Rights &#8211; UK&gt;Serbia&gt;Macedonia, Spain&gt;China, Czech, Ireland, Iran, South Korea,Norway, Sweden; Other types of attitudes analysed were: naturalness (Genetic changes) of animals, autonomy of animals, animal experimentation, wildlife protection, spiritual power of animals. &#183; Respect for the autonomy of animals is identified as a positive attitude towards animals. This attitude is sometimes mistaken for the avoidance of animals. &#183; The attitude to animal welfare is a more consistent predictor of the attitudes to world issues among different types of animal protection at the present time. &#183; Females on average have more positive attitudes to animals than males. &#183; Overall ranking of perceived sentience is: Human Infant&gt; apes&gt;other mammals&gt; birds&gt; cold-blooded animals. &#183; Far East tradition, Greek tradition and many indigenous traditions have higher levels of reverence for animals than do Abrahamic religions. &#183; There is some evidence to suggest that people in higher levels of the social hierarchy tend to have lower reverence for animals. &#183; Students from nations sharing similar political ideologies, in particular those sharing communist influences, share similar overall attitudes to animals and world issues, but this association can also be explained by the similar human welfare levels in these nations. The present author concluded that though many factors are associated with the attitudes towards animals, memes (tradition, religion, political ideology, education, etc.) and genes (empathy, position in social hierarchy, genetic similarity to the animals, etc.) are two fundamental origins of attitudes towards animals, and the two can be further unified by the information they carry.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production and differentiation of a vascular graft grown in the host&#8217;s peritoneal cavity: devices and bioreactors</field><field name="creator">Peter Stickler</field><field name="description">The main question that this thesis addresses is what is the optimal way of producing tissue grown in the peritoneal cavity around a foreign body for its use as a vascular graft? It is known that a foreign body implanted into the peritoneal cavity induces an inflammatory response with cells recruited from within the peritoneal cavity to encapsulate the foreign body. Over the course of two to three weeks these cells produce an organised matrix and differentiate to become myofibroblasts. Tubes of these &#8215;tissue capsules&#8216; have been transplanted into the arterial vasculature in several animal models where the tissue capsule differentiates into an arterial structure. This structure consists of a layer of smooth muscle-like cells, adventitia of dense connective tissue including vasa-vasorum and an endothelial layer of flattened mesothelial cells. In order to determine whether the tissue would further differentiate ex vivo in response to mechanical stimulus an in-vitro bioreactor system was built to house tissue capsules produced in a variety of animal models. This bioreactor system could house 4 tissue capsules under physiological conditions including standard pulse rates, pressures and temperatures experienced by an artery. Boiled blood clot (BBC) scaffolds were implanted into the peritoneal cavity of rats to produce tissue capsules. After two weeks of development in the peritoneal cavity, tissue capsules were harvested and implanted into the bioreactor. Tissue capsules grafted into the bioreactor were subjected to mechanical force for a range of time-points, pressure, pulse and flow rates. When analysing tissue immunohistochemically, elastin, myosin, &#945;SMA and desmin were detected. This staining was not consistent across all samples and only present in small parts of some tissue tested. Western analysis did not show any expression of &#945;SMA or myosin. Finally the morphology of the tissue also resembled that of tissue previously implanted into the arterial circulation, but development of mechanical properties were not to the extent that would make the tissue useful as a vascular graft. The bioreactor system was thus modified to be able to house tissue for a period of 3 weeks. This system successfully housed tissue capsules under mechanical force in physiological ranges. Next, a range of materials were tested for their ability to be included into the peritoneal implant device used for the large animal model. Elasteon 80A did not produce any cellular growth or peritoneal pathology in all implanted samples (n = 4). Cloisite, a pro-inflammatory material produced large tissue capsule development over a 2 week implant period in 25% of samples however this tissue was heavily adhered to the greater omentum and dependent on its vascular supply. This data suggested that Elasteon could be used to coat the outer surface of a peritoneal implant device to decrease the rate of peritoneal adhesions. Three devices were designed and fabricated for their use in generating tissue for the modified Mitrofanoff procedure which requires a length of tissue to be implanted between the umbilicus and the bladder as a fistula. In all three cases no implantable material was produced that could be used for this procedure. To modify the device that could be used to produce tissue for any surgical application, a range of devices was produced and the animal model was changed to pigs. Materials incorporated into these devices include Dexon mesh and polyethylene. These devices also did not produce any tissue that could possibly be used as a vascular graft. A novel material, polymer BD347 was then produced for use in developing tissue within the interior of the device to provide greater growth and mechanical properties for developing a vascular graft. In toxicological studies, the replacement rate of cells was unaffected after seven days of incubation of fibroblasts at confluence with the polymer. A range of mechanical properties from pig vasculature was gained so that a sheet of polymer with similar properties to that of a vascular graft could be made. This polymer was fabricated as a tube and implanted into the peritoneal cavity of rats. The implanted polymer remained free-floating with a capsule of tissue in 78% of cases. A device was designed that has the ability to impart a physiological pulsation force on the developing tissue capsule in the peritoneal cavity using a sheep model. When two devices were implanted for a period of 10 days in each animal these devices produced no complications for the animal. Upon harvest all devices were free of adhesion and did not cause any peritoneal or dermal infection. In 100% of cases this device produced tissue that was thick and consistent along the length of the implant. The quality of tissue differed greatly macroscopically between tissue produced around pulsing and non-pulsing scaffolds, but microscopically the structure of both tissues was not significantly different. Approximately 90% of cells in this tissue stained positively for CD45. Tissue in pulsing devices produced a higher amount of vimentin expression in CD45 positive staining cells than tissue in non-pulsing devices. Mechanical properties of tissue in pulsed devices were also much greater than tissue in non-pulsed devices. Two of the pulsed tissues were grafted into the carotid artery of sheep as arterial patches. In one animal tissue lasted a period of 1 week before it ruptured. In the second animal tissue lasted a period of 2 weeks at which time the animal was sacrificed. In this sheep a layer of endothelial cells had migrated to populate areas of the tissue patch. Pulsation of the implant device enhanced the development of tissue capsule in the peritoneal cavity towards arterial properties. These studies provide information on the materials and designs required to produce peritoneal-derived tissue capsules that can be used in a range of surgical applications. These studies also provide information on how this tissue responds to mechanical force and provides an in vitro system for testing this tissue. This work in this thesis has produced a device that is in the stage of pre-clinical development to be used as a potential therapy for cardiovascular disease. This device is a novel development from previous devices used for generating tissue capsules for engraftment and is a significant contribution to work in developing a replacement artery.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioreactor</field><field name="subject">Peritoneal</field><field name="subject">Tissue Capsule</field><field name="subject">Vascular</field><field name="subject">Surgery</field><field name="subject">Tissue Engineering</field><field name="subject">Foreign Body</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linear Programming for Scheduling Waste Rock Dumping from Surface Mines</field><field name="creator">Nan Zhang</field><field name="description">Abstract The removal of overlying waste rock in open pit mines to dumps is conventionally undertaken by draglines or by trucks and shovels, or by a combination of these. Waste rock dumps are the largest remnant structures of open cut mining operations and can absorb a large proportion of the mine operating costs. If the dumps are not properly developed they can be excessively expensive and can become a major safety risk and environmental hazard. There are many examples worldwide where poor design and construction of waste rock dumps have resulted in failures causing considerable loss of life and widespread damage, or have resulted in erosion and seepage that have led to severe environmental pollution. The proper design and scheduling of waste rock dumps and haul routes can significantly reduce costs, minimise the possibility of failures, and avoid harming the environment. This Thesis is limited to the consideration of trucks and shovels for waste rock haulage in open cut mining operations. It describes the development and application of a waste rock dump scheduling model using the Operations Research technique of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, implemented in the mathematical modelling language AMPL. The model focuses on minimising the haulage cost for each block of waste rock taken from the open pit and placed in the dump. Allowance is made for the selective placement of benign and reactive waste rock, based on an open pit block model that delineates benign and reactive waste rock. The formulation requires input data including the xyz-coordinates of the block model for the open pit, information on whether the waste rock blocks are benign or reactive, the proposed time scheduling of waste rock haulage from the open pit, unit haulage costs, and the geometry of the waste rock dump, including the delineation of the zones that are benign and those that are reactive. The model was successfully tested by using both simple test data and actual mine site data. The application of the model to a simple case confirmed that it produces results that meet the Objective Function in producing an optimal haulage time and cost, and meets the various Constraints imposed. This model for scheduling the removal of waste rock from open cut mining operations with trucks and shovels will require further research and testing and, because the results are generated in a numerical format, there will also be a need to convert them to a graphical format to facilitate their interpretation. Ultimately, it will have the potential to provide a relatively low-cost scheduling tool that meets operators&#8217; economic, safety and environmental goals.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AMPL mathematical programming language</field><field name="subject">acid rock drainage (ARD)</field><field name="subject">Microsoft C++ programming language</field><field name="subject">linear programming</field><field name="subject">mixed integer programming</field><field name="subject">net present value</field><field name="subject">truck and shovel</field><field name="subject">waste rock dump</field><field name="subject">haulage</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-Port Reflectometer in Multilayer Microstrip-Slot Technology for Ultra Wideband Applications</field><field name="creator">Norhudah Seman</field><field name="description">A microwave reflectometer is an instrument to measure a complex ratio between reflected and incident waves at an input port of a uniform transmission line that is terminated in a Device Under Test (DUT). The conventional reflectometer is formed by a four-port network with two ports connected to a microwave source and DUT, and the remaining ports coupled to a heterodyne receiver which acts as a Complex Ratio Detector (CRT). By using the heterodyne receiver technique, the two microwave signals at the input to CRT are converted in the linear manner to an Intermediate Frequency (IF) of hundreds of kHz where they are processed using digital means. As the ratio of two original microwave signals has to be preserved at IF, a very advanced electronic circuitry is required to accomplish the linear conversion process. This complicated electronic circuitry leads to a large size of the conventional reflectometer and its high price tag. Many applications require compact-size and low-cost reflectometers. They can be built using N-port networks, with N being greater than 5, equipped only in scalar (power) detectors. The thesis describes the concept of a multi-port reflectometer which determines the complex reflection coefficient of DUT with the use of scalar detectors instead of the complex ratio detector. It is shown that this device can be designed using an assembly of linear circuits in the form of quadrature (Q) and/or divider (D) hybrids. Assuming ideal operation of these components, it is shown that the reflection coefficient of DUT can be determined using simple mathematical operations on the power values measured by scalar detectors. Alternatively, it can be obtained from the intersection of power circles in a complex reflection coefficient plane. These simple mathematical expressions can be used to obtain an approximate real-time operation of reflectometer. For more accurate results, the multi-port has to be calibrated using calibration standards. A review of full calibration methods for a multi-port reflectometer is presented. In order to obtain wideband performance, the multi-port reflectometer has to be formed by components all having wideband performance. To obtain its low manufacturing cost, these components should preferably be of planar format and lead to a full integration of reflectometer. The thesis investigates a variety of planar couplers and dividers which can offer wideband performances. However, not all of them can lead to a fully integrated multi-port reflectometer. In order to overcome this shortfall, a multilayer microstrip-slot technique is proposed and investigated to obtain wideband components that can lead to a full integration of multi-port reflectometer. It is demonstrated that through the use of multilayer microstrip-slot technique, ultra wideband microwave 3-dB couplers and two-way dividers of in-phase or out-of-phase type can be designed. It is shown that the chosen configurations of dividers are compatible with the 3-dB couplers so that a fully integrated reflectometer can be formed. This compatibility is accomplished through the use of suitably designed microstrip to slotline transitions. An attractive feature of the designed couplers and dividers is that they are of sub-wavelength size and thus are very compact. A fine operation of these components is demonstrated via full electromagnetic wave simulations and experimental tests over and ultra wide frequency band of 3.1 to 10.6 GHz. Rogers substrate RO4003 featuring a relative dielectric constant of 3.38 and a loss tangent of 0.0027 is chosen as a microwave substrate for the design of these components. The design and analysis are carried out with the commercially available full EM simulator CST Microwave Studio while the experimental tests are done with the Vector Network Analyser, HP8510C. By using these components, an ultra wideband complex ratio measuring unit (CRMU), which is the heart of a multi-port reflectometer, is designed. This CRMU is fully integrated and of compact size. Its operation over an ultra wide frequency band is demonstrated via simulations. A particular attention is paid to its real-time mode of operation. Using this mode of operation, the complex ratio of two waves can be displayed on an oscilloscope using an analog electronics performing simple mathematical operations on the measured powers by detectors. While discussing the operation of CRMU, the attention is paid to the location and spacing of power circles centres (q-points) which are used for geometrical interpretation of operation of this device. Good operation of CRMU in this approximate operation mode indicates that the device will operate very well when it is fully calibrated. For simulations of CRMU, CST Microwave Studio, Agilent&#8217;s Advanced Design System (ADS) and MATLAB software are applied. Having accomplished the successful design of CRMU, the last step includes the formation of a fully integrated multi-port reflectometer. To this purpose an extra circuitry including multilayer microstrip-slot 3-dB couplers is added to CRMU. The purpose of this additional circuitry is to reroute the incident and reflected signals from the DUT to the input ports of CRMU. A few configurations of multi-port relectometer formed by multilayer microstrip-slot couplers or dividers are investigated via simulations with respect to real-time mode of operation. Then, the best performing configuration is selected for the final development. The device is manufactured in Rogers RO4003 substrate. Its S-parameters are measured with HP8510C analyser and compared with the simulated values. Having obtained a relatively good agreement between the simulated and measured results, the device is calibrated using multiple calibration standards. Its operation is verified for selected DUTs by comparing the measured reflection coeffcients with those obtained using the conventional VNA (HP8510C) over an ultra wide frequency band. A relatively good agreement is obtained between the two sets of measured results. The obtained results prove that the multilayer microstrip-slot technology can successfully be used for the development of a compact low-cost and fully integrated UWB multi-port reflectometer. Because of its compact size and good electrical performance, this device can be used in many microwave sub-systems offering a limited space for implementation of microwave measurements. The thesis shows that the accomplished multi-port device can also be used to build UWB communication transceivers. The concept of such UWB transceivers is addressed in the final sections of this thesis.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coupler</field><field name="subject">power divider</field><field name="subject">reflectometer</field><field name="subject">ultra wideband</field><field name="subject">q-points</field><field name="subject">microwave</field><field name="subject">multilayer</field><field name="subject">microstrip-slot</field><field name="subject">reflection coefficient</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GMMEDA : A demonstration of probabilistic modeling in continuous metaheuristic optimization using mixture models</field><field name="creator">Naveen Kumar</field><field name="description">Optimization problems are common throughout science, engineering and commerce. The desire to continually improve solutions and resolve larger, complex problems has given prominence to this field of research for several decades and has led to the development of a range of optimization algorithms for different class of problems. The Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are a relatively recent class of metaheuristic optimization algorithms based on using probabilistic modeling techniques to control the search process. Within the general EDA framework, a number of different probabilistic models have been previously proposed for both discrete and continuous optimization problems. This thesis focuses on GMMEDAs; continuous EDAs based on the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with parameter estimation performed using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. To date, this type of model has only received limited attention in the literature. There are few previous experimental studies of the algorithms. Furthermore, a number of implementation details of Continuous Iterated Density Estimation Algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Model have not been previously documented. This thesis intends to provide a clear description of the GMMEDAs, discuss the implementation decisions and details and provides experimental study to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. The effectiveness of the GMMEDAs with varying model complexity (structure of covariance matrices and number of components) was tested against five benchmark functions (Sphere, Rastrigin, Griewank, Ackley and Rosenbrock) with varying dimensionality (2&#8722;, 10&#8722; and 30&#8722;D). The effect of the selection pressure parameters is also studied in this experiment. The results of the 2D experiments show that a variant of the GMMEDA with moderate complexity (Diagonal GMMEDA) was able to optimize both unimodal and multimodal functions. Further, experimental analysis of the 10 and 30D functions optimized results indicates that the simpler variant of the GMMEDA (Spherical GMMEDA) was most effective of all three variants of the algorithm. However, a greater consistency in the results of these functions is achieved when the most complex variant of the algorithm (Full GMMEDA) is used. The comparison of the results for four artificial test functions - Sphere, Griewank, Ackley and Rosenbrock - showed that the GMMEDA variants optimized most of complex functions better than existing continuous EDAs. This was achieved because of the ability of the GMM components to model the functions effectively. The analysis of the results evaluated by variants of the GMMEDA showed that number of the components and the selection pressure does affect the optimum value of artificial test function. The convergence of the GMMEDA variants to the respective functions best local optimum has been caused more by the complexity in the GMM components. The complexity of GMMEDA because of the number of components increases as the complexity owing to the structure of the covariance matrices increase. However, while finding optimum value of complex functions the increased complexity in GMMEDA due to complex covariance structure overrides the complexity due to increase in number of components. Additionally, the affect on the convergence due to the number of components decreases for most functions when the selection pressure increased. These affects have been noticed in the results in the form of stability of the results related to the functions. Other factors that affect the convergence of the model to the local optima are the initialization of the GMM parameters, the number of the EM components, and the reset condition. The initialization of the GMM components, though not visible graphically in the 10D optimization has shown: for different initialization of the GMM parameters in 2D, the optimum value of the functions is affected. The initialization of the population in the Evolutionary Algorithms has shown to affect the convergence of the algorithm to the functions global optimum. The observation of similar affects due to initialization of GMM parameters on the optimization of the 2D functions indicates that the convergence of the GMM in the 10D could be affected, which in turn, could affect the optimum value of respective functions. The estimated values related to the covariance and mean over the EM iteration in the 2D indicated that some functions needed a greater number of EM iterations while finding their optimum value. This indicates that lesser number of EM iterations could affect the fitting of the components to the selected population in the 10D and the fitting can affect the effective modeling of functions with varying complexity. Finally, the reset condition has shown as resetting the covariance and the best fitness value of individual in each generation in 2D. This condition is certain to affect the convergence of the GMMEDA variants to the respective functions best local optimum. The rate at which the reset condition was invoked could certainly have caused the GMM components covariance values to reset to their initials values and thus the model fitting the percentage of the selected population could have been affected. Considering all the affects caused by the different factors, the results indicates that a smaller number of the components and percentage of the selected population with a simpler S-GMMEDA modeled most functions with a varying complexity.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estimation of distribution algorithms, expectation maximization, gaussian mixture model, metaheuristic, optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient Representation and Effective Reasoning for Multi-Agent Systems</field><field name="creator">Duy Hoang Pham</field><field name="description">A multi-agent system consists of a collection of agents that interact with each other to fulfil their tasks. Individual agents can have different motivations for engaging in interactions. Also, agents can possibly recognise the goals of the other participants in the interaction. To successfully interact, an agent should exhibit the ability to balance reactivity, pro-activeness (autonomy) and sociability. That is, individual agents should deliberate not only on what they themselves know about the working environment and their desires, but also on what they know about the beliefs and desires of the other agents in their group. Multi-agent systems have proven to be a useful tool for modelling and solving problems that exhibit complex and distributed structures. Examples include real-time traffic control and monitoring, work-flow management and information retrieval in computer networks. There are two broad challenges that the agent community is currently investigating. One is the development of the formalisms for representing the knowledge the agents have about their actions, goals, plans for achieving their goals and other agents. The second challenge is the development of the reasoning mechanisms agents use to achieve autonomy during the course of their interactions. Our research interests lie in a model for the interactions among the agents, whereby the behaviour of the individual agents can be specified in a declarative manner and these specifications can be made executable. Therefore, we investigate the methods that effectively represent the agents' knowledge about their working environment (which includes other agents), to derive unrealised information from the agents' knowledge by considering that the agents can obtain only a partial image of their working environment. The research also deals with the logical reasoning about the knowledge of the other agents to achieve a better interaction. Our approach is to apply the notions of modality and non-monotonic reasoning to formalise and to confront the problem of incomplete and conflicting information when modelling multi-agent systems. The approach maintains the richness in the description of the logical method while providing an efficient and easy-to-implement reasoning mechanism. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we investigate n-person argumentation as an application that benefits from the efficiency of our approach.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multi-agent systems, defeasible logic, non-monotonic reasoning, artificial intelligence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charged Liposaccharide Based Drug Delivery Systems</field><field name="creator">Adel Abdel Rahim</field><field name="description">Abstract Many hydrophilic drugs do not easily cross biological membranes. One approach to improve intestinal absorption of hydrophilic compounds is to co-administer these drug molecules with absorption enhancers to optimize their physico-chemical properties. In this project, novel liposaccharides were used to modulate the aqueous solubility as well as increase the lipophilicity, improve the intestinal permeability and hence, oral bioavailability of hydrophilic molecules. However, the solubility of the drug/liposaccharide mixtures in aqueous system might be poor, therefore, introducing a hydrophilic component such as quaternization of amine derivatives or sodium salt of carboxylic acid is required to modulate hydrophilic/lipophilic balance and in the same time and promote surfactant and ion pairing characteristics of these derivatives. This dissertation illustrates the development of novel liposaccharide absorption enhancers to be used for oral delivery of hydrophilic drugs. This research includes chemical synthesis of new ionic liposaccharides, examination of their physico-chemical properties, and their in vitro and in vivo biological examinations. The work consists of two parts; cationic and anionic liposaccharide absorption enhancers. a) Cationic Liposaccharide Absorption Enhancers The focus of this work was on the molecular design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel cationic liposaccharide derivatives as drug delivery agents to improve the oral bioavailability of piperacillin as a model hydrophilic drug. These derivatives were designed to possess surfactant as well as ion pairing properties, and were synthesized from biocompatible and biodegradable materials such as glucose, lipoamino acids and lipophilic amino acids. Thermodynamic profiles of these derivatives as well as haemolytic activity were examined. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of piperacillin/liposaccharide conjugates were studied to investigate the effect of liposaccharides on piperacillin activity. The usefulness of these derivatives as absorption enhancers for the oral delivery of piperacillin was assessed in vitro (Caco-2 cells) and in vivo (rat oral absorption). It was concluded that these derivatives did show hemolytic activity in low concentration (suitable for enhancing activity), while they increased permeability of piperacillin through Caco-2 cells. However, these promising results obtained from in vitro assay were not confirmed in vivo. viii b) Anionic Liposaccharide Absorption Enhancers In this thesis, molecular design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel anionic liposaccharide derivatives as absorption enhancers to improve the intestinal permeability of a model hydrophilic drug such as tobramycin were carried out. These derivatives were designed to have surfactant as well as ion pairing properties, and were synthesized from biocompatible materials such as sugar, lipoamino acids and amino acids. Thermodynamic profiles of these derivatives as well as haemolytic activity were examined. Many absorption enhancers have (to some extent) cytotoxic activity, therefore, cytotoxic activity of the novel anionic liposaccharides were examined. The usefulness of these derivatives as absorption enhancers to increase the lipophilicity of tobramycin and hence, its oral bioavailability, was evaluated through carrying out partition coefficient examination. It was concluded that these derivatives did not show haemolytic and cytotoxic activities in low concentration (suitable for enhancing activity). In addition, the permeability of tobramycin into the organic phase (n-octanol) was increased when liposaccharide derivatives were used. The obtained results are promising and encouraging to continue the work to include Caco-2 cells assay (in vitro assay) and oral absorption in rats (in vivo assay) as a prospective work in the future.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sugar, lipoamino acids, amino acids cationic liposaccharides, anionic liposaccharides.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive crosstalk cancellation and Lattice aided detection in multi-user communications</field><field name="creator">Mandar Gujrathi</field><field name="description">Digital subscriber lines (DSL) have revolutionised the provision of high speed data over the &#8216;last mile&#8217;. Subscribers demand even more bandwidth and the penetration of the service is now nearly universal. While it is feasible to provide improved broadband services on the new very high speed DSL, such as VDSL2/3, one of the greatest challenges to further improvements in speed is the problem of crosstalk. Operating over the unused higher frequencies of the twisted pair network, this technology is subjected to electromagnetic coupling among the wires, limiting the DSL data rate and service reach. Crosstalk suppression methods such as zero-forcing or decision feedback mainly use block processing. However, to cope with the time-varying VDSL environment huge computational costs can be incurred. In contrast, adaptive processing approaches are much simpler and are more beneficial to track such a channel environment. An adaptive canceller uses a training sequence and the convergence speed depends on the number of crosstalk coefficients it has to estimate. In a populated DSL binder, only a few of the crosstalking neighbours to a particular user are significant. With the aim to reduce the computational complexity in such environments, this thesis introduces the concept of detection-guided adaptive crosstalk cancellation for DSL. We propose a least-squares test feature to detect and concentrate the adaptation only on the dominant crosstalking coefficients. In comparison to conventional adaptive cancellers, the cancellers proposed in this thesis demonstrate early convergence. Thus, by incorporating the test feature, these cancellers have to detect only the most significant canceller coefficients and therefore, the length of the training sequence is reduced. Together with enhanced adaptive cancellation with a low run-time complexity and improved convergence, the greatest advantage obtained here is in the bandwidth efficiency. While enhanced adaptive cancellation is a bandwidth-efficient approach, the frequent re-transmission of training sequences may still be required for a rapidly changing VDSL channel. Again, this can be a disadvantage in terms of bandwidth consumption. To overcome this difficulty, we propose fast-converging unsupervised cancellers with an aim to improve the bandwidth efficiency by not transmitting a training sequence. An added advantage obtained here is that this would enable Internet service providers to include multiple or improved broadband services within a single subscription. Certain properties of the DSL channel ensure the communication channel is properly conditioned. This ensures the basis vectors of the channel matrix are near-orthogonal and hence, the linear cancellers, such as zero-forcing perform near-optimally. However, this is not the case with wireless channels. We investigate user detection in wireless channels using the principle of lattice reduction. User detection can also be seen as a search for the closest vector point in the lattice of received symbols. Though a maximum likelihood (ML) detector facilitates optimal user-detection, it has exponential complexity. We identify that the closest vector problem can be cast as a non-linear optimisation problem. Using the periodicity of the maximum likelihood function, we first present a novel algorithm that approximates the ML function using the Taylor series expansion of a suitable cosine function. With the aim of minimising the approximation error, we represent the ML function as a Fourier Series expansion and later, propose another approximation using Jacobi theta functions. We study the performance of these approximations when subjected to a suitable unconstrained optimisation algorithm. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the newly-developed approximations perform better than the conventional cancellers, close to the ML and, importantly, converging in polynomial time.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adaptive, partial crosstalk cancellation, detection guided, blind crosstalk cancellation, adaptation, activity criterion, lattice reduction, Jacobi-theta function approximation, Taylor series approximation, non-linear optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">United Kingdom educated migrant midwives' experience of working in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Mary Sidebotham</field><field name="description">Abstract The nursing and midwifery workforce is becoming increasingly mobile and the globalisation of the midwifery workforce has been fuelled by the marketing strategies used by employers within Queensland to recruit midwives from overseas to fill vacancies within both the public and private sector. The United Kingdom has been specifically targeted, and the numbers of nurses and midwives moving to Queensland has more than doubled in five years and continues to rise. Little is known about the reasons why midwives are leaving the United Kingdom and what their experience is of working within midwifery in Queensland. This research was conducted within a phenomenological framework. A total of 18 midwives who had moved to Queensland within an eight year period were interviewed, who also completed a reflective journal about their motivations for moving, and subsequent experience of midwifery within Queensland. Data analysis was undertaken using an adaptation of the Van Kaam method of analysis of phenomenological data, as described by Moustakas. A Textural &#8211;Structural description of the meanings and essences of the experience incorporating the invariant constituents and themes was constructed for each participant. From the Textural &#8211;Structural Descriptions from all of the participants a composite description was constructed of the meanings and essences of the group experience. The reasons for leaving the United Kingdom were predominantly associated with an expectation of achieving an improved lifestyle for themselves and their families; and there was also a sense of seeking adventure. Participants also expressed dissatisfaction with life in the United Kingdom, which was particularly associated with work related issues such as bullying and harassment, increased workloads and burn out. Midwives reported choosing Queensland because of weather and lifestyle factors, but were also influenced by having friends, family or former colleagues already settled in the State. The main essences of the reported experience of working within the midwifery profession in Queensland included feelings of fear, frustration, shock and sadness. Despite the initial difficulties experienced in settling in to the midwifery profession, most midwives found a way to resume their midwifery career in Queensland by moving between jobs until they found one that enabled them to practise midwifery in a way they were comfortable with. Recommendations are made based on the findings to guide employers in their recruitment practices and assist with orientation of midwives recruited from the United Kingdom with a view to improved retention. In order to avoid the feelings of frustration and sadness described by the midwives in this study, employers should seek to match the skills of the midwives recruited to the positions available within the unit, and ensure systems are in place to facilitate recognition of prior learning and early credentialing to allow midwives to practise to their full scope and ability. In addition, in order to enable UK trained midwives to practise at their highest potential, supportive management structures should include access for migrant midwives to support in adjusting to midwifery practice differences between the UK and Queensland.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">midwife, recruitment, migration, experience Australia,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Hepatic Glucose Metabolism</field><field name="creator">Matthew Stephenson</field><field name="description">The incidences of obesity and type 2 diabetes are reaching epidemic proportions worldwide. A cardinal feature of these conditions is resistance to the effects of the hormone insulin and a resulting hepatic overproduction of glucose. Insulin resistance is also implicated in a range of liver diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatitis C infection. Insulin is released after a meal and acts on liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue to reduce blood glucose concentration. In the liver, insulin inhibits the production and release of glucose into the circulation and stimulates its storage as glycogen. Glucagon, on the other hand, is present in the fasting state and causes breakdown of hepatic glycogen along with production of new glucose. This glucose is released from hepatocytes into the circulation. For the studies in this thesis, functional assays to measure various aspects of hepatic glucose metabolism in vitro were developed. This included measuring glucose output into culture medium, hepatocyte uptake of radiolabelled glucose and incorporation into glycogen, and total cellular glycogen content. These assays were used to investigate glucose metabolism in primary rat hepatocytes and FaO rat hepatoma cells. Both cell types responded to physiological concentrations of insulin, showing decreased glucose output and increased glycogen synthesis. Glucagon increased glucose output and reduced glycogen synthesis in primary cells but had no effect on FaO cells. Factors that have been identified that may inhibit or potentiate insulin action were investigated. Increased body iron stores have been linked with insulin resistance. De-ironing patients improves insulin sensitivity, suggesting a causal relationship between iron and insulin resistance. Hepatocytes store the majority of the body&#8217;s excess iron. This project investigated the effects of increasing hepatocyte iron stores, through addition of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), or depleting iron stores by chelation with dipyridyl. Small increases or decreases of iron in primary cells had negative effects on cell viability, resulting in significantly reduced glucose output and glycogen synthesis. Dipyridyl treatment had similar effects on FaO cells as on primary cells but FAC treatment increased FaO glucose output, although significant iron loading was not achieved. With concentrations of FAC and dipyridyl low enough to not significantly influence cell viability, insulin sensitivity was not affected. Adiponectin is an insulin sensitiser and appears to exert this effect primarily through the liver. Adiponectin can also reduce hepatic glucose output (HGO) independent of insulin. It is believed adiponectin mediates its effects in liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In muscle, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) has been implicated as a downstream component of adiponectin signalling. In this study, recombinant human adiponectin was produced and collected in culture medium which was then concentrated. Despite the presence of both high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) adiponectin multimers, the concentrated medium had no effect on HGO in the presence or absence of insulin. Concentrated adiponectin medium did not affect AMPK or p38 MAPK phosphorylation in hepatocytes or other cell types previously shown to respond to adiponectin. However, commercially-sourced purified recombinant adiponectin also failed to elicit any observable responses. AICAR and metformin are pharmacological activators of AMPK and were used to treat primary rat hepatocytes and FaO cells. These treatments reduced HGO independent of insulin in both cell types. In primary cells, these reductions were partially inhibited with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, suggesting that both AICAR and metformin action is at least partly AMPK dependent. In FaO cells, Compound C only inhibited the AICAR-mediated reduction of glucose output, indicating that metformin may act independently of AMPK in these cells. Compound C significantly inhibited AICAR and metformin-mediated increases in AMPK phosphorylation in primary hepatocytes and FaO cells. There was a trend towards inhibition of AICAR-mediated p38 MAPK phosphorylation with Compound C treatment, suggesting that p38 MAPK may lie downstream of AMPK in hepatocytes. Adenoviral expression of constitutively active (CA) and dominant negative (DN) AMPK in primary rat hepatocytes was used to further study the role of AMPK in hepatic glucose metabolism. Despite significant expression of CA AMPK, phosphorylation of downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was not affected nor was HGO. CA AMPK did, however, increase phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. DN AMPK completely inhibited AICAR-mediated AMPK phosphorylation and partially inhibited phosphorylation of ACC. In addition, AICAR-mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was inhibited by DN AMPK. Taken together, these results suggest that p38 MAPK is downstream of AMPK in hepatocytes. The implication that p38 MAPK is involved in hepatic AMPK signalling is a novel finding. A greater understanding of this pathway in the liver may identify novel therapeutic targets, leading to improved treatment strategies for metabolic disorders linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">liver</field><field name="subject">hepatocyte</field><field name="subject">hepatic glucose output</field><field name="subject">gluconeogenesis</field><field name="subject">glycogen</field><field name="subject">glucagon</field><field name="subject">insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">adiponectin</field><field name="subject">AMPK</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silicon and acibenzolar-S-methyl induced defence responses in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) infected with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Whan</field><field name="description">In previous studies silicon has been associated with reduced disease severity and incidence, the enhanced accumulation of phenolic compounds and lignin, and with changes in the defence-related enzyme activity and transcript abundance of defence and stress related genes. All of these aspects of plant defence were considered in this study on cotton infected with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (Fov), and the results obtained have greatly enhanced our understanding of the effects of silicon on this interaction. In all experiments conducted, defence responses were only significantly enhanced by silicon treatment following inoculation with Fov, strongly suggesting that silicon can prime defence responses in cotton infected with Fov. Sicot F-1 was the cultivar most resistant to Fov infection at the commencement of this research, whilst Sicot 189 was considered to have moderate resistance to the pathogen. Vascular discolouration was significantly reduced in the more resistant cultivar, Sicot F-1 following treatment with potassium silicate, compared to mock inoculated plants and inoculated plants treated with potassium sulphate or calcium sulphate. No significant differences between treatments were observed in the moderately resistant cultivar, Sicot 189, though further trials may need to be conducted to confirm this result. In both cultivars, silicon content was significantly greater in plants which had been treated regularly with liquid potassium silicate, rather than with calcium silicate powder. Histological investigation of cotton infected with Fov, with and without silicon treatment, was conducted to ascertain the effects of this element on the accumulation of fungitoxic phenolic compounds, cell ultrastructural changes and fungal infection structures. Fov proliferated through the cortex and stele of plants from both the resistant (Sicot F-1), and moderately resistant (Sicot 189) cultivars, regardless of silicon treatment. However, defences were more rapidly and intensely induced in endodermal and vascular regions of inoculated, potassium silicate treated Sicot F-1 plants. Significantly more phenolic compounds were present at seven days post infection (dpi) in root extracts of inoculated, potassium silicate treated Sicot F-1 plants. Phenolic compounds were not significantly increased in inoculated, potassium silicate treated root extracts of Sicot 189 plants at three or seven dpi. Lignin assays demonstrated that the dry weight percentage of lignin in root material from inoculated, potassium silicate treated Sicot F-1 plants was significantly higher than that of extracts from inoculated plants not receiving silicon treatment at three dpi. This trend was also observed at seven dpi; however lignin content was not significantly different in this case. Percentage lignin content in the roots of Sicot 189 plants was not significantly different between inoculated potassium silicate treated plants and those not treated with silicon. Histological alterations were not observed in mock inoculated water or potassium silicate treated plants, nor were any significant increases in phenolic compounds or lignin accumulation detected in control treatments not inoculated with the pathogen. The expression of several defence related genes was assessed with quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results obtained verify that potassium silicate can enhance defence responses in Sicot 189 and Sicot F-1 plants inoculated with Fov, with silicon having a more pronounced effect on the more resistant cultivar, Sicot F-1. Genes upregulated at three and four dpi in potassium silicate treated, Fov inoculated Sicot F-1 plants included peroxidase, cadinene synthase and polygalacturonase inhibiting protein (PGIP), with peroxidase associated with phenol oxidation and lignification and cadinene synthase with phytoalexin biosynthesis. Osmotin-like protein and chitinase class I were consistently upregulated in potassium silicate treated, inoculated Sicot 189 plants; both genes coding for pathogenesis related (PR) proteins, with chitinase also classified as an antifungal protein. In both cultivars, silicon treatment without Fov inoculation did not result in the significant up-regulation of any of the defence genes assessed, providing further evidence for the role of silicon in priming in this interaction. The activities of three defence related enzymes, peroxidase, chitinase and &#946;-1, 3- glucanase was assessed in root and shoot material by colourimetric assays. Regular application of potassium silicate significantly increased the activity of peroxidase in root extracts from the highly resistant cultivar Sicot F-1, at three, four and seven dpi with Fov, and in root extracts from the moderately resistant Sicot 189 at three and four dpi. Significant increases in chitinase activity in inoculated, silicon treated Sicot 189 plants were observed in root extracts at three dpi, and in shoot extracts at four dpi. Soluble potassium silicate treatment resulted in significant increases in &#946;-1, 3- glucanase activity in Sicot 189 root extracts at four dpi. Few significant differences between treatments in terms of chitinase and &#946;-1, 3- glucanase activity were detected in Sicot F-1 plants, though higher levels of each of these enzymes were present in root and shoot extracts from this cultivar. In this study the effects of acibenzolar-S-methyl, applied in the form of Bion&#174;, on defence gene expression and enzyme activity in cotton infected with Fov were more pronounced in plants cultivated from treated seed, rather than in plants treated via foliar spray; a finding which is particularly relevant to the industry presently. Significant up-regulation of chitinase class I, peroxidase, and &#946;-1, 3-glucanase transcripts and enzyme activities occurred in the Bion&#174; seed soak treatment with Fov inoculation compared to all other treatments. It was possible to compare the actions of silicon with those of Bion&#174; in this study. Bion&#174; primed defence responses in cotton infected with Fov, in a manner similar to that observed in silicon treated cotton. The use of silicon and Bion&#174; treatments, both alone and in combination as part of integrated disease management programmes, may potentially contribute to increased protection against this pathogen in Australian cotton fields in the future.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cotton</field><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="subject">Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum</field><field name="subject">Defence responses</field><field name="subject">Vascular discolouration</field><field name="subject">Transmission electron microscopy</field><field name="subject">Phenolics</field><field name="subject">Lignin</field><field name="subject">Quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyoctanediol citrate/sebacate elastomers : a new class of tissue engineering materials</field><field name="creator">Djordjevic, Ivan</field><field name="description">The thesis focuses on elastic polymer material that is biodegradable and compatible with human cells and tissues.

Success in enterprise may support the achievement of a range of social, political and economic objectives for Indigenous peoples. The thesis offers a contribution to knowledge and literature on IED by bringing understanding to the meaning of success for Indigenous enterprise, identifying those factors that contribute to its success as well as presenting the barriers that prevent it. This study is the most recent rigorous scholarly work of IED on Indigenous land in the Northern Territory. The focus of this research is on Indigenous commercial enterprise development at a communal and individual level. Indigenous enterprise development is said to be different from other forms of enterprise development because of the legal rights of Indigenous peoples and because of particular cultural attributes, such as different perceptions of property rights in the Indigenous context and an emphasis on values like collectivism and sharing. These differences are found to shape notions of success and approaches to development. The research reviews literature in the international and domestic context on Indigenous economic development and Indigenous entrepreneurship. It also draws from internal and external documents of relevant institutions and news sources. These sources and findings are then built upon with fifty six in-depth, face-to-face interviews of selected participants who are experts or opinion leaders on IED in the region. These participants represented a variety of interest groups such as the government, academia, the Indigenous community and businesses from both Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultures in the Northern Territory. This study used a qualitative research approach for data collection and analysis. The researcher utilized a qualitative data analysis method, including the reporting of field notes, preparation of field notes into transcripts, coding of data, display of data, the development of conclusions, and creation of a report. This study identified five categories of barriers to successful enterprise development on Indigenous land in the Northern Territory. These barriers are: high levels of conflict and mistrust, socio-cultural norms and values that can work against success, a lack of human capital, a poor institutional framework and economic and structural factors. There were four categories of factors found that support the development of successful Indigenous enterprise: developing business acumen, integrating culture within the enterprise, separating business from community politics and greater independence from government. While definitions of success varied across the region there were common objectives for Indigenous enterprise, such as eliminating welfare dependency and maintaining a link to land. Ultimately, success for Indigenous enterprise was deemed to be business survival, but in ways that are congruent with each Indigenous community?s values. The findings in this research emphasize that certain cultural attributes may act to constrain successful enterprise development, but can be integrated into an enterprise through changes in enterprise structure, or practice, to support successful economic outcomes. The research also emphasizes the importance of institutional settings on human capital and successful enterprise development in the region. This study?s findings can potentially guide and inform further research in this field. The research develops a number of policy recommendations which offer potential support to policymakers in addressing the important social problem of Indigenous disadvantage through enterprise development initiatives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous people</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal people</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">Cultural industries</field><field name="subject">Arts</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Enterprise Development</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Economic Development</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Enterprise Development</field><field name="subject">Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">Economic Development and Growth</field><field name="subject">Business and Management not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Public Policy</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Studies</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Law</field><field name="subject">Law and Society</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Economic Development</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Entrepreneurship</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48854</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Overcoming practitioner resistance to health informatics systems in general practice medicine</field><field name="creator">Knight, John</field><field name="description">This thesis results from a multi-method study into why GPs in Australia resist the adoption of technology capable of collecting, amalgamating and potentially transferring patient health data outside their practice.

This is especially the case in mineral processing, where differences in surface hydrophobicity lie at the heart of the separation process of flotation. Chemicals are used to increase and decrease the natural hydrophobicity of minerals to attain a better separation between valuable and worthless material. Polymers are often used to reduce mineral surface hydrophobicity. Decades of empirically based decision making have produced a list of effective depressants. However the detailed study of how these polymer depressants affect surface hydrophobicity and mineral recovery lags behind applied investigations. The aim of this thesis was to study the adsorption of commonly used depressants on model surfaces and to interrogate the action of these polymers in reducing surface hydrophobicity. We have modelled the degree of hydrophobicity of common minerals in order to study polymer depressants with methods not commonly used in studies of surface characterisation in flotation. The model surfaces (self-assembled monolayers, SAMs) allowed us to use the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to study the adsorption of polymers. The QCM-D can be used to obtain adsorption isotherms, adsorption kinetics, water content of adsorbed layers, and information on the conformation of the adsorbed polymer. The results from the QCM-D were correlated with the contact angle data from the captive bubble measurements, with which we assessed the hydrophobicity of the surface before and after polymer adsorption. Three of the polymers layers were probed with dynamic dewetting studies, in order to test other modes of depressant action. Three types of polymers were studied - a polyacrylamide (Polymer-H), a polyelectrolyte CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) and a group of dextrins (Dextrin-TY, a phenyl succinate substituted dextrin (PS Dextrin) and a styrene oxide substituted dextrin (SO Dextrin)). These polymers are commonly used or have potential to be used in the depression of talc and graphite. Polymer-H was used to investigate the hydrophobic bonding between a non-ionic polymer depressant and chemically inert and non charged surfaces by probing the influence of substrate hydrophobicity on polymer adsorption and reduction of contact angle. Three different model surfaces were used (mixed self-assembled 0.5 SAM, 0.7 SAM or single self-assembled 1.0 SAM monolayers) with advancing contact angles between 75?? and 119??. The study of Polymer-H found that the substrate hydrophobicity is an important factor in adsorption of this polymer and the change in contact angle upon adsorption depends on adsorbed amount. The effectiveness of Polymer-H to reduce surface hydrophobicity was established to correlate with its conformation and morphology. CMC was investigated to find out how a stimulus responsive polymer depressant can be used in flotation. It was established that the adsorbed amount and rate of adsorption of CMC increase with decreasing of pH or increasing of ionic strength. It was shown that the surface hydrophobicity of a CMC pre-adsorbed layer changes with the environment and these alterations are fully reversible. A switch of ionic strength (from 10-2 M KCl to 10-1 M KCl) caused partial dehydration of the adsorbed layer and a decrease of the receding contact angle by 20??. A pH switch (pH = 9 to pH = 3) resulted in a 40?? change in receding contact angle. The CMC investigation showed that the use of a stimulus responsive polymer presents opportunities for exploiting solution conditions as a means to effect a better mineral separation in flotation The adsorption of three dextrin-based polymers on a model hydrophobic surface has been characterized using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The three polymers (one standard dextrin and two dextrins with different aromatic group substitutions) exhibited varying affinities and capacity for adsorption on the hydrophobic substrate. The effect of the three polymers on the static contact angle of the surface was studied using captive bubble contact angle measurements. The three polymers were seen to reduce the receding contact angle by similar amounts (approximately 14 degrees) in spite of having varying adsorbed amounts and differences in adsorbed layer water content. Although no differences were observed in the ability of the polymers to reduce the static contact angle, measurements of the dewetting dynamics between a rising air bubble and the polymer covered substrate yielded stark differences between the polymers, with one polymer slowing the dewetting dynamics by an order of magnitude more than the other two polymers. The differences in dewetting behaviour correlate with the adsorbed layer characteristics determined by QCM-D.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrophobic surfaces</field><field name="subject">Polymer solutions</field><field name="subject">Adsorption</field><field name="subject">249901 Biophysics</field><field name="subject">249903 Instruments and Techniques</field><field name="subject">250103 Colloid and Surface Chemistry</field><field name="subject">250204 Bioinorganic Chemistry</field><field name="subject">250405 Sensor (Chemical and Bio-) Technology</field><field name="subject">250599 Macromolecular Chemistry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">260101 Mineralogy and Crystallography</field><field name="subject">QCM-D</field><field name="subject">AFM</field><field name="subject">polymer depressant</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/92477</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and demonstration of a new non-equilibrium rate-based process model for the hot potassium carbonate process.</field><field name="creator">Ooi, Su Ming Pamela</field><field name="description">Chemical absorption and desorption processes are two fundamental operations in the process industry. Due to the rate-controlled nature of these processes, classical equilibrium stage models are usually inadequate for describing the behaviour of chemical absorption and desorption processes. A more effective modelling method is the non-equilibrium rate-based approach, which considers the effects of the various driving forces across the vapour-liquid interface. In this thesis, a new non-equilibrium rate-based model for chemical absorption and desorption is developed and applied to the hot potassium carbonate process CO&#8322; Removal Trains at the Santos Moomba Processing Facility. The rate-based process models incorporate rigorous thermodynamic and mass transfer relations for the system and detailed hydrodynamic calculations for the column internals. The enhancement factor approach was used to represent the effects of the chemical reactions. The non-equilibrium rate-based CO&#8322; Removal Train process models were implemented in the Aspen Custom Modeler&#174; simulation environment, which enabled rigorous thermodynamic and physical property calculations via the Aspen Properties&#174; software. Literature data were used to determine the parameters for the Aspen Properties&#174; property models and to develop empirical correlations when the default Aspen Properties&#174; models were inadequate. Preliminary simulations indicated the need for adjustments to the absorber column models, and a sensitivity analysis identified the effective interfacial area as a suitable model parameter for adjustment. Following the application of adjustment factors to the absorber column models, the CO&#8322; Removal Train process models were successfully validated against steady-state plant data. The success of the Aspen Custom Modeler&#174; process models demonstrated the suitability of the non-equilibrium rate-based approach for modelling the hot potassium carbonate process. Unfortunately, the hot potassium carbonate process could not be modelled as such in HYSYS&#174;, Santos&#8217;s preferred simulation environment, due to the absence of electrolyte components and property models and the limitations of the HYSYS&#174; column operations in accommodating chemical reactions and non-equilibrium column behaviour. While importation of the Aspen Custom Modeler&#174; process models into HYSYS&#174; was possible, it was considered impractical due to the significant associated computation time. To overcome this problem, a novel approach involving the HYSYS&#174; column stage efficiencies and hypothetical HYSYS&#174; components was developed. Stage efficiency correlations, relating various operating parameters to the column performance, were derived from parametric studies performed in Aspen Custom Modeler&#174;. Preliminary simulations indicated that the efficiency correlations were only necessary for the absorber columns; the regenerator columns were adequately represented by the default equilibrium stage models. Hypothetical components were created for the hot potassium carbonate system and the standard Peng-Robinson property package model in HYSYS&#174; was modified to include tabular physical property models to accommodate the hot potassium carbonate system. Relevant model parameters were determined from literature data. As for the Aspen Custom Modeler&#174; process models, the HYSYS&#174; CO&#8322; Removal Train process models were successfully validated against steady-state plant data. To demonstrate a potential application of the HYSYS&#174; process models, dynamic simulations of the two most dissimilarly configured trains, CO&#8322; Removal Trains #1 and #7, were performed. Simple first-order plus dead time (FOPDT) process transfer function models, relating the key process variables, were derived to develop a diagonal control structure for each CO&#8322; Removal Train. The FOPDT model is the standard process engineering approximation to higher order systems, and it effectively described most of the process response curves for the two CO&#8322; Removal Trains. Although a few response curves were distinctly underdamped, the quality of the validating data for the CO&#8322; Removal Trains did not justify the use of more complex models than the FOPDT model. While diagonal control structures are a well established form of control for multivariable systems, their application to the hot potassium carbonate process has not been documented in literature. Using a number of controllability analysis methods, the two CO&#8322; Removal Trains were found to share the same optimal diagonal control structure, which suggested that the identified control scheme was independent of the CO&#8322; Removal Train configurations. The optimal diagonal control structure was tested in dynamic simulations using the MATLAB&#174; numerical computing environment and was found to provide effective control. This finding confirmed the results of the controllability analyses and demonstrated how the HYSYS&#174; process model could be used to facilitate the development of a control strategy for the Moomba CO&#8322; Removal Trains. In conclusion, this work addressed the development of a new non-equilibrium rate-based model for the hot potassium carbonate process and its application to the Moomba CO&#8322; Removal Trains. Further work is recommended to extend the model validity over a wider range of operating conditions and to expand the dynamic HYSYS&#174; simulations to incorporate the diagonal control structures and/or more complex control schemes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HYSYS; Hot Potassium Carbonate Process; Rate-based model; Carbon dioxide removal</field><field name="subject">Chemical processes.</field><field name="subject">Chemical engineering.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A step towards a broader understanding of complex traumatization in victims of crime: psychological and physical health impacts and implications for psychological interventions and treatment evaluation.</field><field name="creator">Pfitzer, Birgit Elisabeth</field><field name="description">Epidemiological studies have revealed high rates of criminal victimization in the general community as well as in treatment seeking populations. As a consequence, many crime victims present with a broad range of psychological and physical health impacts which exceed far beyond the current conceptualization of posttraumatic stress disorder. Accordingly, the current project aimed at an exploration of the complex problems faced in the context of severe interpersonal violence, using a mixed methodological design within a pragmatist paradigm. The first study (n=58) involved a quantitative exploration of the psychological and physical health problems in victims of crime as compared to a normally stressed community sample without a history of traumatization. Psychological impacts were assessed by standardized psychological measures, whereas influences on physical health were captured by an analysis of biochemical markers that reflect stress- related changes in immune functioning. Once impacts on psychological and physical health were established, a second study (n=17) was conducted to gain a better understanding of individual stress conceptualizations. This study involved a qualitative framework analysis of semi-structured interviews with victims of crime. The results from Study I and II informed the development of a phase oriented psychological treatment program for victims of crime, using cognitive-behavioural and hypnotherapeutic treatment components. This was followed by an outcome &#8211;and process evaluation of a combined CBT/Hypnotherapy treatment in comparison to a CBT treatment only to explore additive benefits of hypnotherapy. Although a multiplicity of traumatic sequelae was indicated by the results of the preceding studies, the treatment process revealed an even greater complexity of traumatization which was difficult to accommodate in the proposed treatment program. Moreover, twelve out of nineteen participants discontinued treatment, making it difficult to determine the additive benefits of hypnotherapy. A qualitative analysis of the treatment sessions was conducted to elucidate critical treatment variables with a particular emphasis on the differences between treatment completers and non-completers. The results were interpreted with respect to recently suggested theories and associated treatment approaches such as the Theory of Structural Dissociation (Van der Hart, Nijenhuis, &amp; Steele, 2006) which may better accommodate the needs of complex trauma survivors encountered in a real world clinical practice. Furthermore, the challenges associated with interventions and treatment evaluations involving a highly complex clinical sample such as victims of crime are discussed in light of the current debate on evidence-based practice and the dilemma of providing reliable, methodologically sound evidence without compromising internal validity of the treatment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complex traumatization; psychological impacts of trauma; physical impacts of trauma</field><field name="subject">Victims of crimes Psychological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-care practices of adults with poorly controlled Diabetes Mellitus in Malaysia.</field><field name="creator">Tan, Ming Yeong</field><field name="description">This doctoral portfolio presents two separate but related research study reports on &#8216;self-care practices of adults with poorly controlled diabetes in Malaysia&#8217;. It is comprised of five sections. Section one which is the introduction begins with a general discussion on diabetes mellitus (henceforth referred to as diabetes), a common, growing, serious and costly health problem. The importance of self-care in the management of diabetes and its many disabling long-term complications are emphasised. This is followed by a specific discussion of diabetes in Malaysia - its prevalence, the quality of care, cost and the need for research to uncover new information to improve the care provided to Malaysians with diabetes. Section two is the report on the first research study that investigates the four cornerstones of diabetes self-care practices, namely: dietary intakes, medication adherence, physical activity and self-monitoring of blood glucose in Malaysian adults with poorly controlled diabetes. It also explores the factors that influence these self-care practices. Section three is the report on the second research study that assessed the efficacy of an out-patient diabetes educational program based on a self-efficacy theoretical approach to improve firstly, self-care practices and secondly, clinical outcomes of adults with poorly controlled diabetes in Malaysia. It also identified some of the factors that facilitate or impede such a programme in the Malaysian context. Section four integrates the findings of the two related research studies - the first defining the problem and the second providing possible solutions in the Malaysian context. It points out limited diabetes knowledge on self-care can compromise or create problems regarding self-care practices for Malaysians with poor glycaemic control. It also identifies possible areas of research that can uncover new knowledge that may improve the quality of diabetes care and enhance the quality of life of Malaysian with diabetes.

They have been implicated in controlling various aspects of grape berry development, in particular, the important process of ripening and are used in some crops to control growth and ripening. Abscisic acid (ABA), is associated in grapevine with the response to water stress but may also have a role in berry ripening. We have shown over three seasons that ABA levels in Cabernet Sauvignon berries increase dramatically at veraison, consistent with it being involved either as a trigger for ripening or as a response to the increase in sugars that occurs at this time. Net ABA accumulation doesn't occur until veraison, the decrease in ABA concentration in the first phase of berry development being due to berry expansion. The decrease in ABA that occurs later in development is likely to be due to a combination of catabolism and sequestration into the bound form. The genes crucial to ABA synthesis, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) and zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), were expressed throughout berry development and no clear correlation was found between their levels and that of ABA. Laboratory studies have shown that isolated berries respond to the presence of sucrose through an increase in ABA biosynthesis pathway gene expression (NCED and ZEP). This resulted in de novo synthesis of ABA as inhibition of the carotenoid synthesis pathway by a phytoene desaturase inhibitor prevented ABA accumulation. Replicated field trials clearly showed that ABA treatments can be effective in significantly enhancing ripening when applied in at or near the end of the first period of berry expansion. Colour accumulation in the skins commenced earlier in ABA-treated fruit as did the increase in sugar levels. ABA treatment also advanced the timing of the second phase of berry expansion as it appeared to eliminate the lag phase of berry growth. Taken together these data demonstrate that ABA is likely to play some part in the control of berry ripening and can be used to advance the timing of ripening. Further investigation into the characteristics of ABA-treated fruit will be needed to investigate the compositional character of treated fruit and to gauge its suitability for winemaking. An ability to control the timing of ripening may provide considerable benefits to the wine industry in terms of wine style/quality and for winery scheduling.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grape; berry; hormone; ABA; abscisic</field><field name="subject">Abscisic acid.</field><field name="subject">Viticulture.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences on the sorption affinity of soil organic matter for non-ionic organic pollutants.</field><field name="creator">Ahangar, Ahmad G.</field><field name="description">Sorption of non-ionic organic compounds to organic matter is usually characterized as a partitioning interaction, which is quantified by K [subscript]oc, the organic-C normalized partitioning coefficient. However K [subscript]oc for any single compound varies considerably between soils, often by a factor of 3-10. This study addresses some of the potential causes of this variability. Forty-four soil cores were collected from a 2 ha paddock. Ten of these cores were selected for sorption measurements. The chemical composition of the soil organic matter (SOM) was determined using &#185;&#179;C NMR analysis. It was found that K [subscript]oc for diuron was positively correlated with aryl C (r&#178; = 0.59) and negatively correlated with O-alkyl C (r&#178; = 0.84). There were no such correlations for phenanthrene K [subscript]oc. A second set of experiments was carried out to investigate the effects of SOM&#8211; mineral interactions on the sorption properties of a selection of the soils. It was found that HF-treatment increased K [subscript]oc for both phenanthrene and diuron. The HF treatment removes mineral matter leaving the organic phase unaffected by the treatment. The increase in K [subscript]oc on HF-treatment soils provides strong evidence that interactions between organic matter and soil minerals block organic matter sorption sites. Furthermore, following HF-treatment, there was a positive correlation between K [subscript]oc for phenanthrene and aryl C and carbonyl C and a negative correlation with O-alkyl C. This suggests that the non-constancy of the relationship between organic matter chemistry and K [subscript]oc, for whole soils in the case of phenanthrene, may be a consequence of variability of the effect of organic matter-mineral interactions on K [subscript]oc. The influence of lipids on the sorption of diuron and phenanthrene to soils was also investigated. Lipids are known to cover the surfaces of organic matter in soil. K [subscript]oc for diuron and phenanthrene were consistently higher for the lipid-extracted soils than for the whole soils (average of 31% for diuron and 29% for phenanthrene), indicating that lipids block sorption sites on the organic matter. Sorption experiments on one pair of HF-treated soils indicated that the blocking effects of minerals and lipids are independent, because lipid extraction and HF-treatment combined increased K [subscript]oc by more than either treatment alone. In the last experiment, the effect of solvent conditioning on the sorption of diuron and phenanthrene was investigated. The K [subscript]oc values for compounds were consistently higher for solvent-treated whole soil and lipid-extracted soil than corresponding soils before solvent treatment. Solid-state &#185;&#179;C NMR spectra of the solvent-treated soils indicated that there were no significant changes in the chemical structure of SOM caused by solvent treatment. Solvent treatment changes the physical conformation of the SOM, increasing its sorption affinity. The key findings from the research are: &#8226;	Variations in sorption affinity for diuron are related to differences in the soil organic matter chemistry. &#8226;	SOM-mineral interactions can have a substantial influence on K [subscript]oc for non- ionic compounds. &#8226;	Lipids may block the active sorption sites on the SOM thereby diminishing sorption overall. &#8226;	Solvent conditioning can change the physical conformation of SOM and lead to enhancement sorption of diuron and phenanthrene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sorption; Non-ionic organic pollutant; Soil sorption affinity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of Cl&#8315; transport across the roots of two grapevine rootstocks, K 51-40 and Paulsen, differing in salt tolerance.</field><field name="creator">Abbaspour, Nasser</field><field name="description">Soil salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses that decreases agricultural crop production through imposition of both ionic and osmotic stresses. The accumulation of Na&#8314; and Cl&#8315; in the cytosol to toxic levels inhibits metabolism. Unlike Na&#8314;, less is known about Cl&#8315; uptake and transport in plants. Grapevine is moderately sensitive to salinity and accumulation of toxic levels of Cl&#8315; in leaves is the major reason for salt-induced symptoms. In this study Cl&#8315; uptake and transport mechanism(s) were investigated in two grapevine (Vitis sp.) rootstock hybrids differing in salt tolerance: 1103 Paulsen (salt tolerant) and K 51-40 (salt sensitive). Increased external salinity caused high Cl&#8315; accumulation in shoots of the salt sensitive K 51-40 in comparison to Paulsen. Measurement of &#185; &#8309;  NO&#8323;&#8315; net fluxes under high salinity showed that by increasing external Cl&#8315; concentrations K 51-40 roots showed reduced NO&#8323;&#8315; accumulation. This was associated with increased accumulation of Cl&#8315;. In comparison to Paulsen, K 51-40 showed reduced NO&#8323;&#8315; / Cl&#8315; root selectivity with increased salinity, but Paulsen had lower selectivity over the whole salinity range (0-45 mM). In order to examine if root hydraulic and permeability characterisations accounted for differences between varieties, the root pressure probe was used on excised roots. This showed that the osmotic Lpr was significantly smaller than hydrostatic Lpr, but no obvious difference was observed between the rootstocks. The reflection coefficient (&#963;) values (0.48-0.59) were the same for both rootstocks, and root anatomical studies showed no obvious difference in apoplastic barriers of the main and lateral roots. Comparing the uptake of Cl&#8315; with an apoplastic tracer, PTS (3-hydroxy-5, 8, 10-pyrentrisulphonic acid), showed that there was no correlation between Cl&#8315; and PTS transport. These results indicated that by-pass flow of salts to the xylem is the same for both rootstocks (10.01&#177;3.03 % and 12.1&#177;1.21 %) and hence pointed to differences in membrane transport to explain difference in Cl&#8315; transport to the shoot. &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; fluxes across plasma membrane and tonoplast of K 51-40 and Paulsen roots showed that &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; influx in root segments of Paulsen was greater than K 51-40 over the first 10 minutes. Unidirectional influx within 10 min loading time showed increases with increases in the external concentrations in both rootstocks but Paulsen had higher influx rate when compared to K 51-40. This appeared to be due to a greater Vmax. There was no significant difference in Km. It was shown that &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; accumulation and transport rate to the shoot of K 51-40 was higher than that of Paulsen. Compartmental analysis of &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; efflux from intact roots confirmed that the difference in influx observed between the rootstocks was consistent with the results obtained for excised roots, although the values were not exactly the same. It was also shown that the main root of Paulsen had greater contribution to &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; uptake than lateral roots. &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; fluxes by lateral roots were not significantly different between the rootstocks. Cl&#8315; and Na&#8314; distribution patterns in different root cell types were determined using the X-ray microanalysis technique. It was shown that Cl&#8315; content in the hypodermis and cortical cells was higher than the other cell types in both rootstocks, but overall Cl&#8315; content in the root of Paulsen was higher than K 51-40. The pericycle of the main root of Paulsen accumulated more Cl&#8315; than K 51-40. It was concluded that Cl&#8315; loading to the xylem was different in the rootstocks and Paulsen tended to prevent the xylem Cl&#8315; loading process. Lateral roots also displayed opposite behaviour consistent with flux analysis. Membrane potential difference (PD) of the cortical cells showed a rapid and transient depolarization by adding 30 mM NaCl in both rootstocks that was followed by a gradual hyperpolarization. Depolarizations caused by 30 mM Choline-Cl, Na-MES and NaCl measured by the root surface potential method showed that Choline-Cl in K 51-40 and Na-MES in Paulsen caused greater depolarization than that of Na-MES in K 51-40 and Choline-Cl in Paulsen respectively. Assuming that PD measured in this method was the trans-root potential (TRP), it was concluded that the higher depolarization by Choline-Cl in K 51-40 can be due to higher Cl&#8315; efflux rate to the xylem. Two different mechanisms were also detected for Cl&#8315; transport: HATS which was observed in the range of 0.5-5 mM and a LATS in the range of 10-30 mM of the external NaCl concentration. This was consistent with the concentration dependence of Cl&#8315; influx. In conclusion, evidence obtained from different experiments of this study indicated that in the grapevine rootstocks (Paulsen and K 51-40) Cl&#8315; was mostly transported through the symplastic pathway. From ECl values determined for the rootstocks by the Nernst equation, a proton-driven transport system was responsible for Cl&#8315; transport in both the HATS and LATS range of external NaCl concentrations. The rate of Cl&#8315; transport from the root to shoot (xylem loading) was the major difference in Cl&#8315; transport between the rootstocks in terms of salinity tolerance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinity; grapevine; Cl- transport; pressure probe; x-ray microanalysis; potential difference; NO3- /Cl- interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of high protein-high red meat vs high carbohydrate weight loss diets on genome stability and biomarkers of colorectal cancer risk in overweight men.</field><field name="creator">Benassi, Bianca Jane</field><field name="description">It has been suggested that high protein diets are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer due to the higher content of red meat. However, the study of the overall dietary and lifestyle pattern may prove more important than any individual component when assessing colorectal cancer risk. From this, it is proposed that a dietary pattern used for weight loss that is higher in protein but remains low in fat and high in foods rich in fibre and micronutrients that are required for genome stability may not increase the risk of colorectal cancer, thus providing a safe and effective dietary method of weight loss in overweight subjects. This thesis describes the development of a novel in vitro faecal water genotoxicity test using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) cytome assay in the WIL2-NS cell line. This thesis then investigates faecal water genotoxicity and peripheral blood lymphocyte genome stability in overweight men following a weight loss dietary pattern either high in protein, specifically red meat, or high in carbohydrate. Results from this thesis indicate that the genotoxic potential of faecal water can be successfully assessed in vitro using the CBMN cytome assay. A high protein-high red meat weight loss diet did not increase faecal water genotoxicity or peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA damage, measured with the CBMN cytome assay, differently to a high carbohydrate weight loss diet. Faecal water genotoxicity data suggests weight loss and/or caloric restriction following either a high protein or high carbohydrate diet may beneficially modify the carcinogenic load of the colon in the short term, however this needs to be validated in a study that includes a non-weight loss control group. A lack of relationship was seen between faecal water genotoxicity and genome damage in lymphocytes which may suggest that the assessment of both the genome damage potential of the bowel contents and the assessment of the genome stability profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes may be important in comprehensively assessing the impact on genome damage by different dietary patterns.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diet; cander; weight loss; high protein diet; cytokinesis block micronucleus cytome assay; genome damage; faecal water genotoxicity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and production of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae haze protective factor 2 for sensory studies and further investigation into the role of glycosylation.</field><field name="creator">Macintyre, Oenone Jean</field><field name="description">White wine clarity is essential, but it can be marred by the presence of a protein haze. This protein haze is predominantly formed by grape-derived thaumatin-like proteins and chitinases, which can slowly denature and aggregate if left in bottled wines. Currently bentonite fining is used by the wine industry to prevent protein haze. Bentonite consists of fine clay particles that, when added to wine, bind and remove the haze-forming proteins. However this method is inconvenient, time-consuming, and causes significant losses of wine. It is estimated that this process costs the Australian wine industry $50 m annually in wine losses alone. Alternatives are thus being investigated. The principal objective of this thesis was to investigate the sensory effects on wine of an alternative method to bentonite fining: addition of haze protective factor 2, known as Hpf2. Hpf2 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannoprotein that has been shown to reduce protein haze in wines. It is a highly mannosylated 180 kDa protein, of which approximately 75% by weight is mannose. Previous work has shown that the addition of approximately 200 mg L&#8315;&#185; Hpf2 to wines reduces the visible haze in wine by approximately 50%. Hpf2 is naturally present in wines at concentrations of less than 10 ng L&#8315;&#185;, much lower than the concentration required for haze protection activity. However, the sensory impacts involved with the addition of such high concentrations of Hpf2 in wine have never been studied. This knowledge is essential for the future commercial prospects of this alternative approach to protein stabilisation of wine. To undertake sensory studies, over 1 g of Hpf2 would be required. Presently, the laboratory-scale process for the production of a 6-histidine tagged version of the protein, 6xHisHpf2, in a laboratory yeast strain of S. cerevisiae, produces only milligram quantities. Consequently, the first challenge of this research was to scale up the existing process to produce sufficient quantities of Hpf2. The first attempt to increase the production level was by over-expression in the bacteria Escherichia coli. Although several approaches were trialled, 6xHisHpf2 was unable to be successfully and consistently expressed in this system. The second method was by improving the original yeast expression system, and the expression level was able to be improved approximately 10-fold. This improved expression method was scaled up to produce and then purify over 1 g of protein. Several quantification methods were assessed to determine the efficiencies of each purification step, with slot blot analysis proving successful. Sensory trials were conducted to establish the effect of 6xHisHpf2 on wines, with duo-trio studies conducted assessing both aroma and palate of the wines. Invertase, another yeast haze protective factor, was also trialled. It was found that the addition of an active level of 6xHisHpf2 or invertase did not cause a significant difference in the aroma or palate of wines. In addition to this main study, the role of the glycosylation was studied. 6xHisHpf2, produced in a different yeast, Pichia pastoris, was found to be 83 kDa, with only 50% mannose. This protein was compared to the S. cerevisiae protein in its ability to reduce protein haze, and it was shown that the P. pastoris protein could reduce haze, but not as effectively as the S. cerevisiae protein. The finding that Hpf2 does not affect the sensory properties of wine is essential if Hpf2 is to be used commercially, as winemakers and wine consumers would most likely reject an additive that alters the wine aroma or palate. This work has brought the wine industry a step closer to a new method for protein haze prevention in white wines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein expression; protein purification; wine haze; haze protective factor; mannoproteins; Hpf2</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating chromosome pairing in bread wheat using ASYNAPSIS I.</field><field name="creator">Boden, Scott Andrew</field><field name="description">Pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes are required for normal chromosome segregation and the exchange of genetic material during meiosis. Pairing is defined as the recognition and alignment of chromosomes that occurs either pre-meiotically or during early prophase I to ensure that associations via synapsis and recombination occur only between homologues. Synapsis is the intimate juxtaposition of homologous chromosomes that is complete at pachytene following formation of a tri-partite proteinaceous structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC). In yeast, HOP1 is an essential component of the SC that localises along chromosome axes during prophase I and promotes homologous chromosome interactions. Homologues in Arabidopsis (AtASY1), Brassica (BoASY1) and rice (OsPAIR2) have been isolated through analysis of mutants that display decreased fertility due to severely reduced synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Analysis of these genes has indicated that they play a similar role to HOP1 in pairing and formation of the SC through localisation to axial/lateral elements of the SC. In this study, we have characterised the bread wheat homologue of HOP1, TaASY1, and its encoded protein. The full length cDNA and genomic DNA clones of TaASY1 have been isolated, sequenced and characterised. TaASY1 is located on chromosome group 5 and the open reading frame displays significant similarity to OsPAIR2 (84%) and AtASY1 (63%). In addition to OsPAIR2 and AtASY1, the deduced amino acid sequence also displays sequence similarity to ScHOP1, with all four proteins containing a HORMA domain. Transcript and protein analysis showed that expression is largely restricted to meiotic tissue, with elevated levels during the stages of prophase I when pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes occurs. Antibodies specific to TaASY1 were used in immuno-fluorescence microscopy and immuno-gold transmission electron microscopy to investigate the localisation of TaASY1 in meiotic cells. Immuno-fluorescence analysis initially detected ASY1 in pollen mother cells (PMCs) during meiotic interphase as foci randomly distributed over the chromatin. The ASY1 signal became increasingly continuous during leptotene, reflecting the changes occurring in chromosome morphology. Throughout zygotene, the signal became progressively more continuous, localising along the entire length of the axial elements as chromosomes synapsed. This signal appeared to persist until pachytene, before disappearing from the chromatin as the SC disassociated through late pachytene and early diplotene. The immuno-gold based electron microscopy displayed that TaASY1 localises to chromatin that is associated with both axial elements before SC formation as well as chromatin of lateral elements within formed SCs. Analysis of RNAi Taasy1 mutants was performed to further define the role of ASY1 in bread wheat meiosis. ASY1 localisation was disrupted in these mutants, with a diffuse and non-continuous signal observed through leptotene and zygotene. Feulgen staining of meiotic chromosomes displayed reduced synapsis during prophase I, as well as multivalents at metaphase I and abnormal chromosome segregation during anaphase I. These observations are consistent with the presence of homoeologous chromosome interactions. TaASY1 expression and localisation was also investigated in the bread wheat pairing mutant, ph1b. Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) revealed that TaASY1 is significantly up-regulated in ph1b, with greater then 20-fold expression compared to wild-type Chinese Spring, while maintaining the same pattern of expression as wild-type through progressive stages of meiosis. ASY1 localisation was significantly disrupted in ph1b, with irregular loading on axial elements during mid to late zygotene, indicative of abnormal chromatin remodelling and multiple axial element associations that have previously been reported in ph1b. Taken together, these results indicate that TaASY1 is essential for promoting homologous chromosome interactions during meiosis, and that impairment of ASY1 function in bread wheat meiosis results in reduced restriction of chromosome associations to homologues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bread wheat; ASYNAPSIS 1; meiosis; chromosome pairing; synapsis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation and scale-up of a biotechnological process for production of L(+)-Lactic Acid form waste potato starch by Rhizopus arrhizus.</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Zhanying</field><field name="description">L(+)-Lactic acid is a commonly occurring organic acid, which is valuable due to its wide use in food and food-related industries, and its potential for the production of biodegradable and biocompatible polylactate polymers. The aim of this study was to optimize and scale-up a biotechnological process of L(+)-lactic acid production by suspended cells of R. arrhizus DAR 36017 with waste potato starch as the substrate. Commonly used inorganic and organic nitrogen sources, including ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, urea, yeast extract and peptone, were assessed in conjunction with various ratios of carbon to nitrogen (C:N). Fermentation media with a low C:N ratio enhanced the production of lactic acid, biomass and ethanol, while a high C:N ratio led to production of more fumaric acid as a by-product. The use of organic nitrogen sources (yeast extract, peptone and urea) resulted in a significant reduction of lactic acid yields by 15% - 34% with a decrease of C:N from 168 to 28. The use of inorganic nitrogen sources (ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate) led to a high lactic acid yield of 84% - 91% at a C:N below 168. Therefore, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate were considered to be better nitrogen sources for lactic acid production. Small pellets are the favoured morphological form for many fermentation processes by filamentous fungi. However, to control filamentous Rhizopus sp in the pellet form in a submerged fermentation system is difficult due to its filamentous characteristics. An acidadapted preculture technique was developed to induce the formation of the pellet form in bioreactors. Using the acid-adapted precultures, the fungal biomass can be controlled in small dispersed pellets as a dominant morphological form. With these small pellets, a lactic acid yield of 86-89%, corresponding to a concentration of 86-89g/L, was obtained in a laboratory scale process using a stirred tank reactor (STR) and a bubble column reactor (BCR). A batch bioprocess for lactic acid production was successfully scaled-up from shake flasks to laboratory scale bioreactors. Results from a simulated scale-up process revealed that the concentration and productivity of lactic acid decreased with the increase of the scale-up steps because of increased pellet size. This suggested that a one-step scale-up process using the acid-adapted preculture may be feasible in an industrial-scale bioreactor system. A comprehensive investigation of the impact of cultivation parameters on the morphology of R. arrhizus and lactic acid production was carried out in the BCR. The results showed that the fungal morphology was significantly influenced by carbon sources, pH, starch concentrations, sparger designs and aeration rates. The favoured morphology for lactic acid production was freely dispersed small pellets, which could be retained as a dominant morphology under operation conditions at pH 5.0 &#8211; 6.0, starch concentrations of 60 &#8211; 120 g/L and aeration rates of 0.2 &#8211; 0.8 vvm, using a sintered stainless steel disc sparger. The optimal cultivation conditions at pH 6.0 and aeration rate of 0.4 vvm resulted in the formation of the freely dispersed small pellets and production of 103.8 g/L lactic acid, with a yield of 87%, from 120 g/L liquefied potato starch in 48 h. This study shows a technically feasible and economically promising process for the production of lactic acid from waste potato starch. The use of waste potato starch instead of pure glucose or starch as substrate can significantly reduce the production cost, making this technology environmentally and economically attractive.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L(+)-Lactic acid; Rhizopus arrhizus; optimisation; scale-up; waste potato starch; nitrogen sources; morphology; stirred tank reactor; bubble column reactor</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting air temperatures in city streets on the basis of measured reference data.</field><field name="creator">Erell, Evyatar</field><field name="description">Knowledge of site-specific conditions is essential for the development of an architectural design that responds to the local environment. However, while meteorological data are recorded by the weather service in stations that are assumed to be representative of the surrounding region, generally no account is made of changes in local conditions caused by urban development - though these may be substantial. Micro-climate in city streets can be predicted by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with fine spatial resolution. However, CFD requires extremely detailed input, involves long computation times and is thus limited to simulating short periods. The aim of this project was to create a model capable of simulating weather conditions for extended periods, with simplified inputs and less detailed, yet accurate, outputs. The CAT (Canyon Air Temperature) computer model predicts site- pecific air temperature in a city street based on data from a rural reference station. In addition to a rudimentary description of the two sites, it requires only inputs measured at standard weather stations, yet is capable of predicting accurately the evolution of air temperature in all weather conditions for extended periods. It simulates the effects of urban geometry on radiant exchange; the effect of moisture availability on latent heat flux; energy stored in the ground and in building surfaces; air flow in the street based on wind above roof height; and the sensible heat flux from individual surfaces and from the street canyon as a whole. A monitoring program was carried out in Adelaide, South Australia, in which weather conditions were recorded continuously at two streets and at a reference location outside the city centre for nearly a year. In addition to providing data required to calibrate and to validate the CAT model, the measurements provided evidence of a substantial nocturnal heat island in the city, of up to 8.6 &#176;C. The weather records also demonstrate the existence of an urban cool island during the daytime of up to 3.8 &#176;C, the intensity of which is related to the diurnal temperature range. The CAT model may be used to generate realistic, site- pecific temperature inputs for building thermal simulation software, required to produce more accurate modelling of energy use. It may also be used to evaluate the effect on micro-climatic conditions of proposed development at new urban locations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhanced surveillance of potentially foodborne enteric disease within a New Zealand public health service : thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies in Public Health at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Shadbolt, Tui Louise</field><field name="description">An enhanced notified enteric disease surveillance trial began on 1 July 2007 and continued until 30 June 2008. The aim of the trial was to measure the quality, timeliness and completeness of data collected and submitted by a regional Public Health Service (PHS) to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research Limited (ESR), via the national disease database (EpiSurv) for notified cases of enteric diseases. The trial evaluated two different methods of data collection: postal questionnaires and telephone interviews. Telephone interview techniques were used to improve the contact rate, timeliness and completeness of data gathered from all notified cases of campylobacteriosis in the Manawatu, Horowhenua and Tararua regions. The target set for the project was to achieve a 95% contact rate with 90% full completion of all EpiSurv data fields. For all notified cases of campylobacteriosis a 97% contact rate was achieved in a time frame of between zero to 20 days (three day median) and completeness of all the EpiSurv case report fields ranged between 96 &#8211; 100% in the final data. Prior to the commencement of the study, between 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, MidCentral PHS (MCPHS) made contact with around 58% of all notified cases of campylobacteriosis and 77% of all other notified enteric disease cases1 . A short pre-screen mail questionnaire, with reply-paid envelope, was sent to all notified cases of cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, salmonellosis and yersiniosis in the MCPHS regions. EpiSurv case report fields were completed using information supplied in the returned questionnaires. Return rate, timeliness, and completeness were compared with the telephone interview group. Fifty three percent of cases we attempted to contact via mail questionnaire responded within two to 63 days (six day median) and completeness of all the EpiSurv case report fields ranged between 81 &#8211; 100%. In addition, we monitored the newly introduced ESR Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) flags for increased levels of disease compared to historical disease rates, and assessed its usefulness as a tool to identify potential outbreaks in the region. While no outbreaks that had not already been identified by PHS staff were found by monitoring the EARS system, EARS has become an important tool in the MCPHS for comparing our rates of disease with bordering PHSs. EARS also provided a good quick reference tool for media enquiries and the graphs produced in EARS have been well utilised as visual aids for training and seminars presented during the trial period. The results of the surveillance trial initiatives were compared to the rest of New Zealand (NZ) over the same time frame and with a comparable, medium-sized, PHS. While the results of the telephone interviews from the MCPHS trial were close to the comparable PHS, they were significantly higher than for the rest of NZ. The postal questionnaires achieved a lower contact rate than the comparable PHS but similar to the rest of NZ. However, the quality of data gathered in the returned MCPHS postal questionnaire was significantly higher in most fields. Additional analysis was undertaken which indicated that those cases living in higher deprivation and rural areas were less likely to respond to a postal questionnaire. An over-representation of common enteric disease notifications from rural areas in the MCPHS was also highlighted by our research. This trial has shown the effectiveness of utilising telephone interviews and telemarketing techniques for gathering timely and complete data for human enteric disease surveillance within the MCPHS. It has also demonstrated that a short pre-screen questionnaire can be effective in collecting good quality data needed to complete the standard EpiSurv case report form.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enteric disease surveillance trial</field><field name="subject">Enteric diseases</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Campylobacteriosis</field><field name="subject">Cryptosporidiosis</field><field name="subject">Giardiasis</field><field name="subject">Salmonellosis</field><field name="subject">Yersiniosis</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring animal disease and productivity in Samoa : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Taule'alo, Sina Fuatino</field><field name="description">This thesis presents two studies that form the basis of the Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries&#8217; (MAF) recent efforts to enhance its animal disease surveillance capacity. The first study investigated a method of enhancing the surveillance value of veterinary case data collected by the MAF&#8217;s Animal Health Service, which provides the only veterinary service for livestock in the country, through temporal analysis of cases and syndromes by species. Threshold levels generated from 3-monthly moving averages combined over 3 years of veterinary case data were used to identify unusually high numbers of cases and the cause of these unusual events were investigated. Further, the analysis of data in the system identified gaps in the coverage of the Animal Health Service which helped identify alternative methods for conducting surveillance in these areas using the Crops Division advisory officers. The objective of the second study was to identify if the veterinary case data collected by the Animal Health Service represented pig health problems in the general population. Reproduction and mortality patterns were compared on a group of 10 holdings that were regularly attended by the veterinary staff and 13 holdings that did not utilise the Animal Health Service. The performance of these holdings, measured in liveborn piglets per sow year and pre-weaning and post-weaning mortality were compared given their status as client or non-client of the service and their exposure to various management factors like confinement, protein supplementation, frequency of feeding, management time per sow per day, the use of improved or exotic breeds, the extent of commercial activity and, in the case of piglets their season of birth (rainy or dry season). The mean number of sows per herd was 6, producing a mean litter size of 6.1 piglets with a mean interfarrowing interval of 235 days. The median pre-weaning mortality per litter was 0 and a median of 1 piglet per litter was used for productive purposes (consumed, gifted or sold) at a median age of 153 days. It was found that the greatest influence on productivity in these holdings was nutrition. Sow productivity (in terms of liveborn piglets per sow year and pre-weaning survival) was best in the non-client, free range herds that did not provide protein supplementation (but whose feeding was unrestricted due to their freedom to roam and scavenge) and worst in client and non-client herds that were confined and not given protein supplementation (due to restricted and underfeeding). The mortality of pigs postweaning was significantly higher if they were free roaming, due to their loss to predation, theft and being hit by car. The study showed that the health status of pigs was better on holdings that did not use the Animal Health Service compared with those that did.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pigs</field><field name="subject">Swine</field><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="subject">Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Animal Health Service</field><field name="subject">Diseases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of physical planning policy on household energy use and greenhouse emissions.</field><field name="creator">Rickwood, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of physical planning policy on combined transport and dwelling-related energy use by households. Separate analyses and reviews are conducted into dwelling-related and transport-related energy use by households, before a model is developed to investigate the city-wide implications of different land-use scenarios in Sydney, Australia. The analysis of household energy use in Chapter 3 suggests that medium density housing (i.e. lose-rise apartments, townhouses, and terraces) is likely to result in the lowest per-capita energy use, while also allowing for sufficient densities to make frequent public transport service viable. The analysis of transport energy in Chapter 4 confirms that increasing urban density is associated with decreased car ownership and use, independent of other factors. However, land use changes alone are likely to result in modest changes to travel behaviour. The results of the scenario modelling in Chapters 7-9 support the view that changes to land use alone can reduce household energy consumption, but the changes, even over a long time period (25 years) are small (~0-10%) for all but the most extreme land-use policies. Instead, a coordinated (land-use/transport and other policy levers) approach is much more effective. The results confirm that it is transport energy that is most sensitive to planning policy, but that a combined consideration of dwelling-related and transport-related energy use is still useful. The micro-simulation model developed to assess the impact of different land-use planning scenarios allows the establishment of a lower-bound estimate of the effect that housing policy has on household energy use, assuming &#8216;business as usual&#8217; transport policy, household behaviour, and technology.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenhouse gas mitigation.</field><field name="subject">Greenhouse emissions.</field><field name="subject">Urban modelling.</field><field name="subject">Urban planning.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speech as a surrogate marker of central nervous system function: practical, experimental and statistical considerations</field><field name="creator">Vogel, Adam P.</field><field name="description">The speech of an individual conveys a great deal of information about how their central nervous system (CNS) is performing. Whether they are tired, distressed or suffering from a degenerative disease affecting the brainstem, speech can change as a function of an individual&#8217;s condition. Yet, when assessing the speech in an individual on the first occasion, it is often difficult to determine whether their performance is different from a pre-morbid level. Therefore, the repeated acquisition and analysis of a set of brief and simple speech measures could provide information on changes in a patient&#8217;s performance over time. This could ultimately lead to the inclusion of objective markers of change in trials of conditions and disorders that currently rely of subjective, clinician derived measures of severity or patient self report, such as pain, depression or fatigue. Furthermore, the information could be used to track patient performance in treatment trials for degenerative disorders, such as Friedreich ataxia or Huntington&#8217;s disease.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">voice, speech, acoustics, central nervous system, monitoring change</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interconnections between Crete, the Aegean, and Anatolia, 11th-4th Millennia BCE</field><field name="creator">Krsmanovic, Damjan</field><field name="description">The topic of investigation of this thesis concerns a co-extensive analysis of Crete and Anatolia from the beginning of the Early Holocene (ca. 10,000 BCE) to the start of the Bronze Age (ca. 3000 BCE), with a select analysis of other locales in the Aegean, Levant, and eastern Mediterranean for comparative purposes.

Motivated primarily by their concern that the employment of cheap female labour threatened male jobs and wage standards, the union movement demanded that the women entering industry receive the same pay rates as the men they were replacing. Rather than institute equal pay by regulation, however, the Govemment decided on the compromise solution of establishing a special wage-fixation tribunal, the Women's Employment Board, and empowering it to award pay rates between 60% and 100% of the male rate assessed on the basis of the female workers' relative efficiency and productivity. This unique wage-fixing method was a radical departure from the entrenched 'family wage' basis long followed by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court under which female wage rates were set at around 54% of the minimum male rate. However, the potential it represented for a significant change in women's secondary position in the workforce, was contained.A primary concern of the thesis is to assess the relative influence of patriarchal ideology and Marxist theory, and of social, political, economic and industrial factors, on the attitudes and practices of key actors towards the issue of equal pay; also, the extent to which the traditional gender order was challenged by the wartime shift in the 'normal' sexual division of labour. It illustrates how the impetus for equal pay became dissipated during the second half of the war, in the face of pragmatic political and economic pressures and the dominant pattern of gender relations.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The invisible giant: a history of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia, 1915-1985</field><field name="creator">Sheil, Christopher</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an account of the history of the growth and character of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia from 1915 to 1985. With an emphasis on its New South Wales Branch and the years up until 1955, the argument is pursued in examinations of the union's origins and its periods of major change and development.It is argued that the union was originally created by craft unionists out of the arbitration laws enacted in Australia during the first two decades of the century. The union's general composition initially derived from the fact that its early manbers lacked the fundamental sectionalism assumed by craft unionism and these laws.The major changes to the union over its first 30 years occurred during the period of working class radicalism between 1917 and 1927 and in the aftermath of the Great Depression fran 1934 until the Second World War. As a consequence of this history, by 1945 the union reached a point of profound internal contradiction. It had a goverrment that had becone philosophically and structurally integrated with arbitration and a maonbership v*iere sections vAiich had come under militant rank-and-file leadership had developed to the extent that they were capable of taking their own direct action.Arising from this contradiction, between 1945 and 1955 the union underwent a major period of internal conflict and re-definition that ushered in a new and more radical leadership and generally accounts for the union's subsequent growth and character. Between 1955 and 1970 the organisation developed into one of the largest, more progressive and most effective unions in Australia.Against the orthodoxy that has defined trade unions primarily as autonomous instruments of sectional economic interests, it is argued throughout that the union's growth and character were determined by a much greater conplexity of social relations. While recognising the special significance of this institution's relationship with the state and the labour movanent at large, central to the thesis is the proposition that at least as important to the union's history as its immediate relationships were the wider social relations which these presupposed. Trade unions are evidence as well as agents of change in society and, it is argued, any understanding of their history depends on the extent to which both these aspects of their past and the relationship between them are able to be realised."The Giants who formed this world into its sensual existence and now seem to live in it in chains, are in truth the causes of its life and the sources of all activity, but the chains are the cunning of weak and tame minds which have power to resist energy according to the proverb the weak in courage is strong in cunning. Thus one portion of being is the Prolific, the other the Devouring: to the devourer it seams as if the producer was in his chains; but it is not so, he only takes portions of existence and fancies that the whole ... But the Prolific would cease to be Prolific unless the Devourer as a sea received the excess of his delights. Seme will say: 'Is not God alone the Prolific?' I answer: 'God only Acts &amp; Is in existing beings or Men'.

Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiconductor oxide supported Mo and Mo-W carbide catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Tuan Huy, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction to produce sulphur free hydrocarbons has enjoyed a resurgent in interests due to increases in world oil prices. In this work, the suitability of Mo and Mo-W carbides has been investigated as a possible cost-effective alternative to noble metals in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The molybdenum and tungsten monometallic and bimetallic carbides were prepared through precipitation from homogeneous solution to the sulphide followed by carburization with a mixture of propane and hydrogen to produce the resulting metal carbide. A 23 factorial design strategy was employed to investigate the effect of three carburizing variables, namely, time, temperature and gas ratio on the resulting catalyst. In particular, the effect of supports was also examined through four common semiconductor oxide supports, namely: Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2. Thermogravimetric analysis of the carburization reactions showed that the conversion from metal sulphide to the metal carbides is a multistep process producing different phases of carbides, namely ??-MoC1-x, ??-Mo2C, ?? -WC1-x and ??-W2C, depending on heating rate and temperature. The rate determining step of the carburising reaction is the diffusion of carbon atoms into the metal matrix, hence giving relatively low activation energy values. Statistical analysis of the factorial design revealed that all three carburizing variables affect the final physiochemical makeup of the catalyst. SEM analysis showed that the carbides are well dispersed on the surface of the support and catalyst particles produced are nanoparticles in the range of 25 to 220 nm depending on the support. Fischer-Tropsch activity test showed that monometallic molybdenum carbide is active under Fischer-Tropsch conditions while tungsten carbide is inactive for the conditions studied in this project. However, bimetallic carbide catalyst, consisting of the two mentioned metals gave overall higher reaction rates and decreased methane selectivity. Steady state analysis revealed that there are two active sites on the surface of molybdenum carbide catalyst resulting in two chain growth propagation values when analysed via the Anderson-Schulz-Flory kinetics. Overall, ZrO2 support appeared to be the most suitable support followed by SiO2, TiO2 and Al2O3. Finally, kinetic modelling of data showed that methanation and higher hydrocarbons formation path occurs via combination of the oxygenated intermediate and Eley-Rideal mechanism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fischer-Tropsch process</field><field name="subject">Catalysts -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Carbides</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc and nickel disrupt tubular vacuole and mitochondrial networks, but only nickel disrupts microtubules in hyphal tip cells of two Paxillus involutus strains</field><field name="creator">Tuszynska, Sandra, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ectomycorrhizal fungi are able to ameliorate heavy metal stress to host trees in polluted soils. Their sensitivity or tolerance to heavy metals is usually examined based on growth and proliferation on heavy metal amended media. However, there are no data on cellular effects of heavy metals and detoxification in live cells of these fungi. Organelle morphology has recently been recognized as an indication of cellular health and its changes can be used to assess cytotoxicity. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate short term effects of common heavy metal pollutants, Zn2+ and Ni2+ on the morphology of vacuoles, mitochondria and microtubules in hyphal tip cells of two Paxillus involutus strains. Vacuoles, mitochondria and microtubules were labeled with Oregon Green?? 488 carboxylic acid diacetate, 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide ((DiOC6(3)) and anti-??- tubulin antibodies, respectively. They were treated with 0-1 mmol L-1 NiSO4 or 0-100 mmol L-1 ZnSO4 or K2SO4 (SO4 2- control) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Vacuoles and mitochondria in untreated hyphal tip cells of strain P2 which originated from a heavy metal-rich soil were motile and tubular forming networks. Exposure to the metals caused tubular vacuole thickening and vesiculation as well as fragmentation of tubular mitochondria in living hyphal tip cells. The highest K2SO4 concentration also had severe effects on mitochondria. These effects were metal, concentration and exposure time dependent. NiSO4 caused these effects at a hundred fold lower concentration than ZnSO4 and induced severe microtubule disruption. Vacuole tubularity recovered after removal of the metal solutions depending on the metal, concentration and exposure time. Mitochondrial tubularity recovered to pretreatment morphology in a shorter time and even during exposure to the highest metal concentration. Vacuoles of strain P46 which originated from a non-polluted soil were pleomorphic, but mainly spherical with occasional tubular interconnections. The vacuoles were too sensitive to UV light exposure required for fluorescence microscopy to investigate their response to heavy metals. The mitochondrial network and microtubules resembled those of strain P2. The highest ZnSO4 and NiSO4 concentrations caused similar trends in response of mitochondria and microtubules of the two strains. However, mitochondria of strain P46 were less sensitive at lower metal concentrations. The highest K2SO4 concentration had more severe effects on mitochondria of strain P46 than in strain P2 from which tubularity was not recovered. This investigation is the first to reveal that heavy metals affect organelle morphology in two strains of an ectomycorrhizal fungus. Nickel effects on the organelles are likely to result from microtubule disruption. Metal induced mitochondrial fragmentation is possibly an apoptotic response and the recovery of tubular organelle networks suggests cellular detoxification.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interplay between sexual selection, inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata</field><field name="creator">Zajitschek, Susanne, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Inbreeding can have profound negative effects on individuals by reducing fertility and viability. In populations, inbreeding depression can reduce growth rates and increases extinction risk. The aims of this thesis are to investigate inbreeding depression in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and to study the evolution of mechanisms for inbreeding avoidance in females, using guppies from a feral population in Queensland, Australia. Male guppies are highly polymorphic in their sexual ornamentation, indeed they show one of the most extreme polymorphisms observed in nature. Female guppies exhibit complex mate choice based on preferences for ornamentation, as well as social context.  I aim is to examine how these factors of inbreeding avoidance alter sexual selection.   In male guppies I found strong inbreeding depression in male sperm numbers, which is amplified under semi-natural compared to laboratory conditions (Chapter 2). Moreover, inbreeding depression results in low fertility under sperm competition: an experiment using artificial insemination techniques reveals that highly inbred males are heavily disadvantaged in gaining paternity (Chapter 3). On population level, inbreeding depression is manifest in reduced growth rates, predominantly in the early stages of inbreeding (Chapter 4). Population growth at inbreeding coefficients f=0.375-0.59 did not seem to lead to inbreeding depression, whereas lower levels of inbreeding reduced population growth. Although the growth rates in inbred populations appear normal, severe inbreeding depression is uncovered after outbred immigrants are added.  Specifically, male immigrants are most efficient in short-term genetic rescue, probably due to insemination of large numbers of females whereas females are limited in the number of eggs they can produce (Chapter 4).  Male ornamental traits show significant inbreeding depression in semi-natural conditions only (Chapters 2 &amp; 3). Inbreeding avoidance mechanisms seem to have evolved in females: they prefer courtship displays of non-inbred males (Chapter 2), unfamiliar males (Chapter 5) and males with rare patterns (Chapter 6). This preference might increase the mating success of immigrants, and may have evolved to facilitate the avoidance of inbreeding. Together with context-independent preferences for ornament combinations (Chapter 6), it also offers an explanation for the maintenance of polymorphism in this species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guppy</field><field name="subject">sexual selection</field><field name="subject">inbreeding avoidance</field><field name="subject">Poecilia reticulata</field><field name="subject">mate choice</field><field name="subject">familiarity</field><field name="subject">female preference</field><field name="subject">inbreeding depression</field><field name="subject">sperm competition,</field><field name="subject">complex traits</field><field name="subject">selection analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance: issues related to executive compensation, corporate boards and institutional investor monitoring</field><field name="creator">Smith, Gavin Stuart, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains five research projects within the context of two distinctive issues that concern the effectiveness of executive compensation in aligning executive interests with shareholders and how institutional investors play a role in structuring corporate governance mechanisms. The objective of this dissertation is to first determine how institutions should exert their influence if they are serious about alleviating agency problems and improving firm performance. Second, the thesis seeks to determine whether institutional investors use their influence to shape executive compensation and corporate governance mechanisms in a manner consistent with aligning managerial interests with shareholders and increasing shareholder wealth. The thesis finds that CEOs with option incentives increase the likelihood that a firm will increase risk by undertaking both major real investments and acquisitions. Moreover, CEO option grants are positively related to measures of firm valuation and operating performance suggesting option incentives are an important mechanism to align CEO interests with shareholders. This is robust to alternative measures of firm valuation and operating performance, also various estimation techniques. Using these findings to motivate the direction of institutional influence on executive compensation, it is found that institutional investors, particularly smaller activist traders, significantly increase option grant incentives received by executives. Institutional influence also raises CEO pay which is consistent with preservation of reservation CEO utility levels. Addressing the role of institutional investors in the context of other corporate governance mechanisms, it is found that institutional investor influence is also negatively related to board size and positively related to board independence, which is achieved by removal of inside directors. Such actions are consistent with empirical studies that show smaller boards and increased levels of independent directors improve firm performance and board decision making.  The main conclusion from this dissertation is that option incentives are an effective mechanism to align CEO interests with those of shareholders. Institutional investors appear to recognise this importance, and effectively use their influence to increase options received by executives. Combined with institutional investors putting in place corporate boards that provide better oversight of management, institutional investors appear to be effective monitors of the firms in which they invest.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Institutional Investors</field><field name="subject">Corporate Governance</field><field name="subject">Executive Compensation</field><field name="subject">Compensation management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of systematic increase in pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability, and microstructural characteristics of concrete</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mohammad Sharfuddin, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of high performance concrete in construction has been enhanced by the use of pozzolanic materials. However, the use of these materials has not been optimized. Such optimization may be achieved by a systematic increase in the amount and combination of pozzolanic material additions, with accompanying studies of their effects on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of blended concrete. This work evaluated various concrete durability issues by studying systematic increases of pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and blast furnace slag (BFS) in the range of 25, 50 and 70%, and silica fume at 10% of total cementitious materials, forming various binary and ternary concrete blends. The concrete specimens were cured for a period of seven days after demoulding in line with widely practiced commercial curing procedures. The research explored the role and effectiveness of various binary and ternary blends of pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of concrete. Durability was evaluated by two independent rapid chloride permeability tests measured as charge passed and chloride conductivity from the RCPT and UCT tests respectively. These two rapid tests were coupled with long-term ponding tests to evaluate chloride ingress and the extent of corrosion for a period of two years. Further durability tests such as carbonation, drying shrinkage and porosity of these blends were also undertaken. This study also utilized micro-analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy to follow the hydration mechanism in various binary and ternary blends. Statistical significance testing was used to analyse and confirm all experimental results and conclusions. It is well known that a level of caution is exercised in the construction industry in the use of ternary blends. This study aims to evaluate the durability aspects of ternary concrete blends, in addition to binary blends, for resistance to chloride, corrosion, carbonation attacks and provide recommendations relating to the limits of blending level, as well as exposure conditions for blended concretes, based on the results of this study. It is expected that this will fill a major knowledge gap observed in the concrete industry. A comparison of two rapid chloride permeability tests such as UCT and RCPT indicates that the UCT test is easy and practicable, and does not contradict results obtained in the standard RCPT. However, the statistical significance of results obtained for some blends was only able to be established by using the RCPT. This effect can be attributed to the larger size specimens compared to UCT. The recommended blend to acquire both early-age and long-term strength development in fly ash is the ternary blends comprising 10% silica fume and 25% fly ash cast using lower w/b ratio. In addition, the same blend exhibited lower carbonation depth, lower charge passed from RCPT, lower chloride ingress and higher corrosion resistance characteristics from long-term ponding test compared to other blends of fly ash. In BFS blends, an increase in compressive strength was observed only in the specimens of 25% BFS compared to other higher percentage blends, while the higher addition of 50 and 70% replacement showed no significant difference in compressive strength between them and their corresponding ternary blends with addition of silica fume. The results of this study indicate that control (OPC) specimens cast with increased w/b ratio of 0.48 showed higher chloride ingress compared to both binary blends of 70% fly ash and 70% BFS specimens. This indicates that (OPC) cast using higher w/b ratio is to be avoided in chloride environments. On the other hand, though, the ternary blends of 10% silica fume and up to 50% fly ash exhibited lower chloride ingress compared to their respective binary blends of fly ash. However, these ternary blends exhibited lower compressive strength, more negative corrosion potential and higher corrosion rate, compared to the respective binary blends of 25% fly ash and its ternary blends. Therefore, the recommended blend observed in the long-term ponding test is the ternary blend of 25% fly ash and 10% silica fume. The recommended level of corrosion resistance in slag specimens is achieved by the use of ternary blends comprising silica fume at 10% added to the blend that contains up to 70% slag. However, the recommended level of slag for a lower carbonation effect is the use of a ternary blend comprising 50% slag and 10% silica fume (3B5S1) which showed a carbonation depth of 10.8 mm and a compressive strength of 53.2 MPa after 365 days of exposure. The drying shrinkage of concrete increased with the increase in fly ash and the same trend was observed in BFS specimens. However, the results were not significantly different between their respective blends. The extent of carbonation in fly ash specimens was higher compared to BFS blends specimens. This can be attributed to the formation of dusty and weak surfaces on the outer surface in addition to the excessive leaching of sodium chloride solution from the long-term ponding test in the former specimens compared to later. The high volume pozzolanic materials, irrespective of fly ash or BFS and addition of silica fume (70% fly ash and 10% silica fume, and 70% BFS and 10% silica fume), showed higher cumulative pore volume indicating that these blends with seven days of curing were not beneficial. These high volume ternary blends required prolonged curing to release portlandite from the hydration of cement to continue the pozzolanic reaction. This study has shown that 7-days curing of the pozzolanic concrete is inadequate if pozzolanic activity is to be invoked. This is particularly the case when it is expected that the concrete is likely to be subjected to a harsher than usual environment characterised by a dry atmosphere.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concert</field><field name="subject">durability</field><field name="subject">additives</field><field name="subject">pozzolanic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geomorphology of Southeast Australian mountain streams</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Chris J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the morphology and sediment transport dynamics of mountain streams in southeast Australia. Mountain streams represent important geomorphological and ecological systems in Australia which have hitherto been poorly studied. The variability of mountain stream reach morphology was investigated at the regional scale using topographical surveys and sediment sampling techniques. Study sites were stratified by slope and local lithology. Eight channel-morphologies including Bedrock, Cascade, Step-pool, Planebed, Pool-Riffle, Cascade-pool, Riffle-step and Infilled, were identified using an objective statistical approach. Overall, channel types were found to correspond to existing reach-scale mountain stream templates. Five morphologies were associated with a specific lithology type which controlled the size and shape of grains supplied to the channels.  Differences in coarse sediment transport processes between morphologies were investigated using stream monitoring techniques and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Monitoring results from a 3 year period indicated that channel beds are resistant to entrainment with shear stress thresholds for bedload transport ranging between 64 to 74 N/m2. Transport of reach median grain sizes requires floods that exceed bankfull discharge. Existing competence equations were found to over-predict the hydraulic driving force and consequently, a modified entrainment model was used to account for the regional channel characteristics.   OSL dating was investigated as a tool to provide data on long-term sediment transport processes. Minimum age model results from the OSL dates show overall agreement with a selected entrainment model, and indicate differences in sediment transport dynamics between some reach morphology types. A regime model was used to quantify the physical domains of different channel morphologies. Limitations of the model were overcome by modifying the sediment supply surrogate to better reflect the dominant transported bedload size. Morphology types were delineated according to different sediment transport capacity-sediment supply domains.  The distribution of channel morphology types within a series of catchments in southeast Australia was modelled within a GIS platform using the diagnostics of reach morphology derived from this study. The model provides a conceptual framework to evaluate the potential link between channel form, potential habitat diversity and aquatic biodiversity within the channel network in mountain streams.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mountain streams</field><field name="subject">morpho-statistical classification</field><field name="subject">channels</field><field name="subject">optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL)</field><field name="subject">bed material storage</field><field name="subject">morphologies</field><field name="subject">habitat diversity</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">bedload transport</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Southeast</field><field name="subject">Southeastern</field><field name="subject">river channels</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating five models of dissemination of NHMRC 'Guideline depression in young people for GP's' through divisions of general practice</field><field name="creator">Penrose-Wall, Jonine., Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Dissemination of evidence-based mental health clinical practice guidelines had not been studied in Australia prior to the National General Practice Guideline Implementation Program. This naturalistic research reports ten national interventions designed to disseminate the NHMRC 1997 Clinical Practice Guideline Depression in Young People for GPs (GDIYP-GP) through 123 Divisions of General Practice. The guideline covered depression and suicide in young people aged 13 to 20 years. Aim: To evaluate a 'coordinated link agent' and 'enhanced packaged approach' for disseminating a national guideline by engaging 20 Divisions in using 5 dissemination models and to measure Divisions' capacities in performing unfunded local dissemination to GPs. Method: An Implementation Kit was the main national intervention, housing the guidelines and 5 models: Education by the Division; Education by an external provider; 3) Clinical Audit; 4) Segmented Formats and 5) Appraisal. Five studies are reported: 1) an organisational census on guideline-related practices in all topics; 2) a Case Study Database of 3 consecutive interviews of 51 participating Divisions; 3) a Guideline Appraisal study of 9 cohorts of doctors; 4) a Clinical Audit study of 54 doctors involving 1200 patients; and 5) a 'Segmented Formats' documentary analysis of Division communications on GDIYP-GP. Results: Prior dissemination by most Divisions was administrative mail outs rather than planned programs. In all, 70 instead of the pilot 20 organisations participated (57% of the sector) using 10,000 guidelines: 45 participated by 7 weeks and 71 by 35 weeks and the majority used multiple active strategies showing fidelity to the Kit. Education by the Division, Segmented Formats and Appraisal were the most adopted models. GDIYP-GP was acceptable and relevant to the majority of Divisions and to 9 samples of doctors. Conclusion: Divisions are one appropriate system through which evidence-based mental health guidelines can be disseminated to general practitioners. Uptake can be rapid using a flexible enhanced package approach with link-agent support. 3-6 months is needed for organisations to begin effective interventions.

The literature review in this thesis found that one of the measurement tools, arthroscopy, had not been fully evaluated. This body of work evaluated the performance of arthroscopic assessments of articular cartilage (AC) in early OA with specific reference to the OMERACT filter. Preliminary studies in plastic knee arthroscopy simulation models found that estimates of AC lesion area had poor accuracy and reliability. Measurements of lesion diameter were greatly improved by the use of specially designed measurement probes but these did not prove feasible in vivo. Ovine studies evaluated discriminant and criterion validity. Biomechanical assessments served as the gold standard for AC stiffness while macroscopic, thickness and histologic assessments were used for gross structural damage. An hybrid gold standard assessment was devised to validate arthroscopic estimates of Severity and Extent of chondropathy. Arthroscopic global assessments discriminated between normal and very early OA but discrimination between different states of OA was less impressive. Assessments of the Severity of chondropathy had acceptable accuracy and moderate reliability. While arthroscopy could not examine the entire articular surface and estimates of Extent of chondropathy were subject to very large error they broadly resembled those of the hybrid gold standard assessment and they enhanced composite score performance. Composite score validity was further improved by inclusion of estimates of chondro-osteophyte. An empirical approach to composite algorithm weighting to optimise discriminant validity was developed. This approach compared favourably with previously described methods. Composite scores proved best at discriminating between normal and very early OA but were also capable of detecting small changes in OA. Arthroscopic asessments of AC damage meet the OMERACT filter criteria of Truth and Discrimination. Assessments using current arthroscopic technology should include estimates of the Extent of all grades of chondropathy. The optimal scoring algorithm should be determined empirically. Arthroscopic assessments using existing technology may be used to validate noninvasive assessments of the Severity chondropathy but not of Extent. Future efforts to improve arthroscopic assessments of AC should focus on reducing random error associated with estimates of extent.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">please verify keywords</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors which affect refractive outcome following LASIK for myopia.</field><field name="creator">Feltham, Mark Hayes, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Purpose: To improve the predictability, accuracy and stability of laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK), by evaluating the clinical, procedural and tissue response factors that affect refractive outcomes.

Results: Clinical factors associated with a refractive outcome of within ??0.50 D of the target included; corrections less than 5.00 DS (OR 0.21x, 95% CI 0.11-0.40x compared with corrections over -5.00 DS[referent]), patients younger than 40 years (patients over 50 OR 8.27x, 95% CI 3.41-20.03x, patients 40 to 50 years OR 1.93x, 95% CI 0.96-3.90x, compared with patients under 40[referent]) and average pre-operative curvatures between 43.50 and 45.50D (OR 0.39x, 95% CI 0.18-0.83 compared with curvatures of less than 43.50D [referent]). Refractive stability was improved using optic zone sizes between 5.5-6.0 mm, reduced myopic corrections, flatter pre-operative corneal curvatures and thicker corneal flaps (R??=25%, p&amp;lt0.001). Procedural factors associated with poorer outcomes included: thinner measured flap thickness, deeper ablations and the use of the automated corneal shaper (ACS) microkeratome with a novice surgical team (R??=34%, p &amp;lt 0.001). Delaying the ablation from 20 to 90 seconds (s) after flap lift was associated with a more stable refractive outcome at three months (p=0.017). In the 90 s following flap lift, the cornea thinned by 5??3%. The ablation rate per scan varied between procedures, however, the effect on refractive outcome was small (r=0.15, p=0.267). Changes in central corneal thickness indicated refractive stability (p=0.039). Conclusions: Applying the optimal clinical and procedural factors as described afforded a refractive outcome in a further 8% of cases, resulting in 94% to 96% of cases within ??0.50 DS of target. Refractive predictability was limited due to the inability of the keratome to produce a consistent corneal flap thickness and unexpected changes in corneal thickness. The accuracy of refractive outcome will decrease with larger ablations. The degree of refractive inaccuracy with high refractive corrections (&amp;gt -10.00 D) can be over 1.00 D.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LASIK (Eye surgery)</field><field name="subject">Myopia</field><field name="subject">Eye</field><field name="subject">Refractive errors</field><field name="subject">laser in-situ keratomileusis</field><field name="subject">Eye surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of tumour and metastasis suppressor genes in colorectal and bladder cancer</field><field name="creator">Nixdorf, Sheri , Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Together, colorectal (CRC) and bladder cancer (BlCa) are responsible for a large percentage of cancer related morbidity and mortality in Western society. A dramatic reduction in patient survival occurs as these cancers progress towards invasive and metastatic disease, from a five year survival rate of about 90% for localised disease to approximately 5-10% for advanced disease involving distant metastasis. A greater understanding of disease progression will lead to enhanced screening, diagnostic and treatment strategies, in turn providing an improved prognosis for the patient.  The purpose of this study was to expand the current molecular knowledge of CRC and BlCa by elucidating the role of Mxi1 mutations and MTSS1 expression in CRC and BlCa respectively, and to examine the diagnostic potential of these genes.  The Mxi1 coding region for 41 tumours, collected by the South Western Sydney Colorectal Cancer Tumour Bank from 2000-2001, was screened for mutations using Dideoxy Fingerprinting (ddF) and sequencing. Sequence alterations were detected in 34% of tumours. Three different polymorphisms and three mutations were detected. One mutation could possibly affect the tumour suppressor function of Mxi1. The presence of a gene mutation did not correlate to any clinical characteristics and is therefore not a suitable diagnostic marker. Microsatellite instability (MSI) status however, significantly correlated with tumour grade.  Expression levels of MTSS1 and an associated gene, MTSS2, were examined in 16 BlCa cell lines, 9 clonally-derived BlCa sublines, and 30 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) collected by the Heinrich-Heine University from 1993-2000. Variable gene expression was observed in BlCa cell lines and tumour samples. No significant correlation of MTSS expression and invasive ability was observed for the cell lines or tumour samples. Further studies eliminated promoter methylation and p53 functional status as mechanisms involved in MTSS1 and MTSS2 down-regulation.  Functional studies performed on stable MTSS1-expressing BlCa lines found that although migration was increased, cells displayed reduced anchorage-independent growth. The invasive ability of these cells was unchanged confirming that expression does not correlate with invasive ability. These data support the role of MTSS1 as a tumour suppressor and not as a metastasis suppressor gene. Although MTSS1 may not be useful in predicting more invasive disease, its role as a tumour suppressor in cancer may be useful.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mxi1</field><field name="subject">Colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Bladder cancer</field><field name="subject">MIM</field><field name="subject">Tumour suppressor</field><field name="subject">Metastasis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corneal response to overnight orthokeratology</field><field name="creator">Alharbi, Ahmed A, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Orthokeratology (OK) is the reduction, modification or elimination of myopia through application of contact lenses. With the development of high Dk/t lens materials, overnight therapy has become the modality of choice for OK. Overnight OK lens wear has been previously investigated in terms of its efficacy to reduce myopia. However, the underlying effects of overnight OK lens wear on the human cornea have received less attention. As well as the clinical efficacy of overnight OK, this study investigated the effects of overnight OK on topographical corneal thickness and the overnight corneal edema response, and corneal tissue changes with overnight OK. Eighteen subjects participated as the OK lens-wearing group, wearing BE lenses (UltraVision, Brisbane, Queensland) in both eyes. A further ten subjects participated as control subjects, wearing conventional rigid lenses (J-Contour, UltraVision) in the right eye (RE) only. The left eye (LE) acted as a non-lens-wearing control. Both groups wore lenses overnight only, with no lens wear during the day. Measurements were conducted at baseline then on day 1, 4, 10, 30, 60, and 90 for the OK lens-wearing eyes; and up to day 30 for the control group, in the morning (after overnight lens wear) and in the evening (after 8-10 hours of lens removal). Variables measured included best vision sphere (BVS), unaided logMAR visual acuity (VA), refractive astigmatism, apical corneal power (ACP), simulated K readings (Medmont E300 corneal topographer), topographical corneal thickness (Holden-Payor optical pachometer), and keratocyte and endothelial cell densities (ConfoScan2 confocal microscope).  Approximately 75% of myopia was corrected after the first night of OK lens wear and the changes in refractive error stabilised by day 10. By day 90, myopia reduction averaged 2.54 ?? 0.63 D. This was associated with significant improvement in unaided VA of about 82% after the first night of lens wear. There was no change in refractive astigmatism over the 3-month period. There was significant reduction in ACP in the OK lens-wearing eyes after the first night of lens wear, which accounted for more than 70% of the total ACP change over the 3-month period (RE: -2.16 ?? 0.53 D; LE: -2.11 ?? 0.86 D). There was significant central epithelial thinning (about 30%) and significant thickening (about 3%) in the mid-peripheral stroma in the OK lens-wearing eyes. Significant central epithelial thinning was found after the first night of lens wear while thickening in the mid-peripheral stroma reached statistical significance by day 4. Further analysis suggests that topographical corneal thickness changes account for the refractive error changes with overnight OK lens wear, rather than corneal bending. The central overnight stromal edema response was significantly reduced in the OK lens-wearing eyes (1.2 ?? 0.5%) to a level lower than in the conventional RGP (6.2 ?? 1.2%) and non-lens-wearing eyes (2.5 ?? 0.9%) in the control group. Mid-peripheral and peripheral stromal edema responses showed similar levels to those predicted based on lens Dk/t. A single overnight wear of BE and Paragon Corneal Refractive Therapy (CRT) lenses showed that the edema response to BE lens wear is significantly less than in the CRT lens-wearing eyes (BE: 2.5 ?? 0.7%; CRT 3.5 ?? 1.3%) immediately on eye opening.  No significant changes were found in either central stromal keratocyte or endothelial cell densities in either OK or control groups over the study period. In conclusion, overnight OK lens wear induces significant reductions in myopia after the first night of lens wear associated with improvement in unaided VA. Overnight OK lens wear causes significant thinning in the central epithelium and significant mid-peripheral stromal thickening which results in flattening of the central cornea and steepening in the mid-periphery. Although there were no significant changes in central stromal keratocyte and endothelial cell densities, thinning of the central epithelial layer raises concerns regarding the safety of the procedure, especially with the alarming number of corneal infections reported recently in the literature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orthokeratology</field><field name="subject">myopia</field><field name="subject">corneal thickness</field><field name="subject">corneal curvature</field><field name="subject">contact lenses</field><field name="subject">cornea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting-based composite market multiples and equity valuation</field><field name="creator">Chan, Kelly, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this study I investigate the potential improvement in multiple-based valuations from using composite valuations based on price to earnings and price to book ratios against their respective individual ratios and actual price in terms of their predictive accuracy against future price. It is motivated by the popularity of accounting-based market multiples used by practitioners in valuation activities with little published research documenting the absolute and relative performance of composite multiples and its vulnerability to manipulation by biased analysts. First, I generate benchmark multiples using a multiple regression approach and in turn these benchmark multiples are used in the generation of composite valuations.  Second, I incorporate firm characteristics such as anticipated growth and financial positions in the development of these composite valuations. Third, I investigate any further improvement in predictive accuracy from enterprise value to sales ratio which is less subjective to accounting policy choices and conservative accounting.  The main results support the hypothesis that composite benchmark multiples lead to improved valuations over single multiples and further improvement is achieved by incorporating the potential growth rate and financial condition in the composite benchmark multiples.  In particular, the three ratio regression-based composite multiples with the growth and the financial condition factor has the smallest mean and median absolute valuation errors.  Findings remain unchanged when the analysis is based on December fiscal year end firms and using a parsimonious model in the estimation regression.  However, the analysis of mispricing reveals that the valuation model might be useful in settings where market price is not available, such as initial public offerings and court valuation of private firms where a valuation is needed due to strong evidence that high positive pricing errors identify subsequent high returns.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparable firms</field><field name="subject">Equity valuation</field><field name="subject">Composite market multiples</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating the pull of the normal: embodied narratives of living with hepatitis C in New Zealand and Australia</field><field name="creator">Harris, Magdalena, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hepatitis C is known as the ??silent epidemic??. Globally 170 million people live with chronic hepatitis C, yet it receives little policy, media or public attention. In developed countries the blood-borne virus is primarily transmitted through illicit drug injecting practices, aiding its silenced and stigmatised status. In this thesis I uncover some of these silences by exploring the narratives of forty people living with hepatitis C in New Zealand and Australia. My status as a person living with hepatitis C informed all aspects of this research project; I therefore also include my own experiences, foregrounding researcher reflexivity and the co-constructed nature of the interview process. My aims are both practical and theoretical. On a practical level I explore the experiences of people living with hepatitis C in order to inform recommendations for policy, research and practice, while also working to elucidate and employ an approach that allows for an analysis of the ill body as a lived experiencing agent, located in a substantive web of connections whereby discourse, corporeality and sociality, inform and mediate one another. To this end I employ a ??political phenomenology?? influenced by phenomenological and poststructuralist theoretical approaches. The central, previously under-researched, issues that arose in participants?? narratives structure the chapter outline, with results chapters focusing on participants?? experiences of diagnosis, living with hepatitis C, stigma, support group membership, alcohol use, and hepatitis C treatment. For many participants, it was found that living with hepatitis C was a liminal experience where distinctions between what it was to be healthy or ill were not clear-cut. Indeed, many of the participants?? narratives exposed the inadequacy of Western binary categorisations to   speak to their experiences of living with hepatitis C. Throughout this thesis it can be seen that the meanings that participants ascribed to health, illness, and their hepatitis C were fluid and contextual, informed by the interplay of corporeality and discourse. From this interplay comes the ability to speak into the gaps of dominant discourses, creating the potential for the disruption, or subtle realignment, of normative ways of knowing.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Governmentality</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Researcher reflexivity</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and application of hop count in multi-hop wireless ad-hoc networks</field><field name="creator">Chen, Quanjun, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hop count, i.e., the number of wireless hops a packet has to go through to reach the destination, is a fundamental metric in multi-hop wireless ad-hoc networks. Network performance, such as throughput, end-to-end delay, energy consumption, and so on, depends critically on hop count. Previous work on modeling hop count is limited in making unrealistic simplifying assumptions either at the physical or network, or both layers of the communication protocol stack. A key contribution of this thesis is to present an analytical model to derive the probability distribution of hop count under realistic assumptions at both physical and network layers. Specifically, the model considers a log-normal shadowing radio propagation capable of accommodating the random signal fading observed in most wireless communication environments, and the widely used geographic routing at the network layer. Validation of the model is achieved by a comprehensive set of simulation experiments including a trace driven simulation of a real-word vehicular ad-hoc network. The model reveals that the presence of randomness in radio propagation reduces the required number of hops to reach a given destination significantly. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed hop count model, the thesis proposes three new applications which address some of the key challenges in multi-hop wireless networks. The first application derives the per-node packet forwarding load in multi-hop wireless sensor networks and reveals that the nodes in the vicinity of the base station has a significantly less forwarding load than previously thought under simplifying radio propagation and routing assumptions. The second application demonstrates that using hop count as a measure of distance traveled by a data packet, geocasting can be achieved in multi-hop wireless networks in situations when some of the network nodes do not have access to reliable location information. Finally, the proposed hop count model is used to evaluate the performance of the third application which demonstrates that the overhead of geographic routing can be reduced significantly by embracing a position update philosophy which adapts to the mobility and communication patterns of the underlying ad-hoc network.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geographic routing protocols</field><field name="subject">Wireless ad-hoc network</field><field name="subject">Performance analysis</field><field name="subject">Hop count</field><field name="subject">Routing protocol design</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor network</field><field name="subject">Geocasting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secure network programming in wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Tan, Hailun, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Network programming is one of the most important applications in Wireless Sensor Networks as It provides an efficient way to update program Images running on sensor nodes without physical access to them. Securing these updates, however, remains a challenging and important issue, given the open deployment environment of sensor nodes. Though several security schemes have been proposed to impose the authenticity and Integrity protection on network programming applications, they are either energy Inefficient as they tend to use digital signature or lacks the data confidentiality. In addition, due to the absence of secure memory management in the current sensor hardware, the attacker could inject malicious code into the program flash by exploiting buffer overflow In the memory despite the secure code dissemination.  The contribution of this thesis Is to provide two software-based security protocols and one hardware-based remote attestation protocol for network programming application.  Our first protocol deploys multiple one-way key chains for a multi-hop sensor network. The scheme Is shown to be lower In computational, power consumption and communication costs yet still able to secure multi??hop propagation of program images.  Our second protocol utilizes an Iterative hash structure to the data packets in network programming application, ensuring the data confidentiality and authenticity. In addition, we Integrated confidentiality and DoS-attack-resistance in a multi??hop code dissemination protocol.  Our final solution is a hardware-based remote attestation protocol for verification of running codes on sensor nodes. An additional piece of tamper-proof hardware, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), is imposed into the sensor nodes. It secures the sensitive information (e.g., the session key) from attackers and monitors any platform environment changes with the Internal registers. With these features of TPM, the code Injection attack could be detected and removed when the contaminated nodes are challenged in our remote attestation protocol.  We implement the first two software-based protocols with Deluge as the reference network programming protocol in TinyOS, evaluate them with the extensive simulation using TOSSIM and validate the simulation results with experiments using Tmote. We implement the remote attestation protocol on Fleck, a sensor platform developed by CSIRO that Integrates an Atmel TPM chip.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Network Programming</field><field name="subject">Broadcast Authentication</field><field name="subject">Wireless Sensor Network</field><field name="subject">Code Dissemination</field><field name="subject">Trusted Platform Module</field><field name="subject">Sensor Worm Attack</field><field name="subject">Wormhole Attack</field><field name="subject">Remote Attestation</field><field name="subject">Secure Network Protocol</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an enterprise knowledge base (EKB) framework for new product development (NPD) in customer order driven engineering (CODE) environment</field><field name="creator">Sharif, Syed Ahsan, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is widely believed that with the transition from the industrial to information-based economics, organizational knowledge has emerged as the single most critical resource at both macro and micro levels, which promotes the creation, sharing, and leveraging of the organization???s knowledge in current Customer Order Driven Engineering (CODE) environment. Insufficient knowledge management, hence lack of a structured Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) in a CODE environment, whilst involved in New Product Development (NPD) process may result in several problems resulting in creating less successful products. This research establishes an ???Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) framework??? with focus on the Product, Process and Organizational issues related to the NPD process. The framework has three major stages, namely ???Knowledge Acquisition???, ???Knowledge Organizing??? and ???Knowledge Validating???. Various frameworks/methods/models are developed as steps for each of these stages. The framework may increase the effectiveness of product and process development as well as enterprise competitiveness through developing a system architecture to understand, analyse and map organisational, operational activities and business objectives; and increasing the ability of an organisation to establish an integrated partnerships to share efforts on the design, manufacture and delivery of products. In knowledge acquisition stage, a ???Knowledge Capture framework??? and the ???Relationship matrices??? are developed to analyse and link the generic knowledge items of a NPD process in concurrent engineering environment. Among the relationship matrices, Task versus Task (Design Structure Matrix - DSM) matrix is comprehensively explored and decomposed to structure and link several processes at different levels for effective representation of the overall enterprise representation. In knowledge organizing stage, the acquired knowledge (important relations identified in the Task versus Task matrices) is represented in the form of ???Questionnaires???. Best practices gathered from several manufacturing firms in NPD in CODE have also been  used as knowledge resource base for the Questionnaires. For grouping and validation of these Questionnaires, an ???Assessment Model??? is developed, which consists of five performance indicators of the organization namely ???Marketing???, ???Technical???, ???Financial???, ???Resource Management???, and ???Project Management???. Industry applications are carried out in two Australian Manufacturing Companies for the validation of the acquired knowledge. Two tests are carried out; in order to assess the sensitivity of question categories followed by another test to observe whether the model can accurately display the overall performance of the company in the five categories of NPD phases. These two tests have identified possible improvement areas in the NPD process of manufacturing organizations involved in the validation phase. Up to 80% of the findings of the EKB framework and assessment model were found to reflect the actual practices of the organizations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">New products - Management</field><field name="subject">Product management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Nation of Sadness? Reading history, culture, and gender in Hou Hsiao-hsien???s A City of Sadness</field><field name="creator">Hung, Christine Yu-Ting, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis engages with Taiwanese history by offering a reading of Hou Hsiaohsien???s A City of Sadness (1989), making reference to the film???s historical dimensions, cultural representations and gender issues in the period 1945 to 1949. In addition, Hou???s cinematography is detailed with comparison to Yasujiro Ozu and the influences of Japanese colonisation. Hou???s immense contribution to Taiwanese film consists principally in a Taiwanese trilogy that traces Taiwan???s history in the 20th century. In The Puppet Master (1993) Hou details the era of Japanese colonisation from 1895 to the restoration of Taiwan by the Kuomintang in 1945. Later, A City of Sadness focuses on the fate of the Lin family from 1945 to 1949, which epitomises people???s life in Taiwan during the initial stages of Kuomintang domination. Finally, Good Men, Good Women (1995) highlights two different eras in Taiwan: the political movement in the 1950s and the pop culture in the 1990s. The thesis uses illustrations from all three films to explore Hou???s historical, cultural and gender representations. In order to understand Hou???s ideology and beliefs in greater depth, I also review his autobiographical film, A Time to Live, and A Time to Die (1985). This thesis examines Taiwan???s indigenous culture and the impact of Japanese and Chinese cultural practices in A City of Sadness through the post-colonial theories of Perry Anderson, Homi Bhabha, and Chris Berry. I draw on their theories of cultural hegemony and my empiricism to investigate Hou???s representation of the political situation in Taiwan. Finally, the thesis evaluates gender issues in A City of Sadness, with reference to Julia Kristeva???s notion of ???feminine time??? and the debate between Emilie Yeh and Mizou concerning ???whether women can really enter history???. In evaluating A City of Sadness I argue that Hou Hsiao-hsien???s use of a family???s microhistory to parallel the national macro-history of the February 28th Incident opens an important historical window through which the audience may re-encounter and reflect on Taiwan???s past, and think positively about its future.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion pictures - Taiwan - History</field><field name="subject">Women - Taiwan - History</field><field name="subject">Taiwan - History - 1945-</field><field name="subject">Taiwan - Civilization - Japanese influences</field><field name="subject">Taiwan - Civilization - Chinese influences</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The logos of land: economic and proprietarian conceptions of statutory access rights</field><field name="creator">Grattan, Donald Scott, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Legislation in various jurisdictions alters the common law right to control access to one???s land by allowing the imposition of rights of access in favour of one landowner over the land of another.  The relevant legislation can be divided into two categories.  The first-generation legislation (s 88K, Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) and s 180, Property Law Act 1974 (Qld)) permits the creation of easements over servient land to facilitate the development of dominant land.  The second-generation legislation (the Access to Neighbouring Land Act of New South Wales, Tasmania and the United Kingdom) permits the creation of temporary rights of access over servient land to facilitate work on dominant land.  This thesis examines the extent to which this change in the law can be justified by three modes of ethical discourse: right-based, duty-based, and goal-based reasoning.  An examination of the first-generation legislation and the cases in which it has been applied suggests that a form of goal-based reasoning can be used to justify its enactment.  The legislation is needed to facilitate the efficient use of land where the existence of a bilateral monopoly and the possibility of strategic bargaining puts at risk the conclusion of a mutually beneficial agreement regarding access.  A review of the second-generation legislation and the law reform reports and parliamentary debate that preceded its enactment indicates that the legislation can be justified by a form of duty-based reasoning.  The legislation is needed to bring about a proper social ordering by imposing access rights where this would be consistent with the ideal of good neighbourliness.  The thesis concludes that although these goal-based and duty-based discourses make an arguable case for the enactment of both generations of the legislation, neither of them, in an unadulterated form, provides a conclusive justification.  Rather, an eclectic approach that draws on both discourses is required.  It proposes that the legislation???s compensation provisions be amended to reflect the commingling of the ideas of efficiency, a properly ordered society and intensive land use, and to allow the servient owner to share in the benefits generated by the imposition of access.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land tenure -- Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Land use -- Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Right of property</field><field name="subject">Law -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Law -- Interpretation and construction</field><field name="subject">Law -- Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Jurisprudence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction.

This Heideggerian study explores the experience of six men, with prostate cancer: five of whom were approximately five months post a robotic prostatectomy and one man post brachytherapy. The purpose of the study is to understand and describe the meaning men attach to the disease using a hermeneutic existential phenomenological approach to research. Four themes emerged from the interviews: 1) Disappointment, 2) Being-a-man, 3) Sense of Control, and 4) Life-Threatening Disease. The findings of the study suggest men's identities changed due to the side effects of treatments, the need of a sense of control to deal with the disease, and the importance of understanding prostate cancer as a potentially life-threatening disease within the Heideggerian concept of "being-towards-death". Using this concept future research was also identified. The outcomes of the study suggest implications for health professionals in promoting existential care to the men by listening and taking into account their concerns.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prostate cancer</field><field name="subject">Heidegger</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Disappointment</field><field name="subject">Being-a-man</field><field name="subject">Sense of control</field><field name="subject">Life-threatening disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of Cl&#8315; transport across the roots of two grapevine rootstocks, K 51-40 and Paulsen, differing in salt tolerance.</field><field name="creator">Abbaspour, Nasser</field><field name="description">Soil salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses that decreases agricultural crop production through imposition of both ionic and osmotic stresses. The accumulation of Na&#8314; and Cl&#8315; in the cytosol to toxic levels inhibits metabolism. Unlike Na&#8314;, less is known about Cl&#8315; uptake and transport in plants. Grapevine is moderately sensitive to salinity and accumulation of toxic levels of Cl&#8315; in leaves is the major reason for salt-induced symptoms. In this study Cl&#8315; uptake and transport mechanism(s) were investigated in two grapevine (Vitis sp.) rootstock hybrids differing in salt tolerance: 1103 Paulsen (salt tolerant) and K 51-40 (salt sensitive). Increased external salinity caused high Cl&#8315; accumulation in shoots of the salt sensitive K 51-40 in comparison to Paulsen. Measurement of &#185; &#8309;  NO&#8323;&#8315; net fluxes under high salinity showed that by increasing external Cl&#8315; concentrations K 51-40 roots showed reduced NO&#8323;&#8315; accumulation. This was associated with increased accumulation of Cl&#8315;. In comparison to Paulsen, K 51-40 showed reduced NO&#8323;&#8315; / Cl&#8315; root selectivity with increased salinity, but Paulsen had lower selectivity over the whole salinity range (0-45 mM). In order to examine if root hydraulic and permeability characterisations accounted for differences between varieties, the root pressure probe was used on excised roots. This showed that the osmotic Lpr was significantly smaller than hydrostatic Lpr, but no obvious difference was observed between the rootstocks. The reflection coefficient (&#963;) values (0.48-0.59) were the same for both rootstocks, and root anatomical studies showed no obvious difference in apoplastic barriers of the main and lateral roots. Comparing the uptake of Cl&#8315; with an apoplastic tracer, PTS (3-hydroxy-5, 8, 10-pyrentrisulphonic acid), showed that there was no correlation between Cl&#8315; and PTS transport. These results indicated that by-pass flow of salts to the xylem is the same for both rootstocks (10.01&#177;3.03 % and 12.1&#177;1.21 %) and hence pointed to differences in membrane transport to explain difference in Cl&#8315; transport to the shoot. &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; fluxes across plasma membrane and tonoplast of K 51-40 and Paulsen roots showed that &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; influx in root segments of Paulsen was greater than K 51-40 over the first 10 minutes. Unidirectional influx within 10 min loading time showed increases with increases in the external concentrations in both rootstocks but Paulsen had higher influx rate when compared to K 51-40. This appeared to be due to a greater Vmax. There was no significant difference in Km. It was shown that &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; accumulation and transport rate to the shoot of K 51-40 was higher than that of Paulsen. Compartmental analysis of &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; efflux from intact roots confirmed that the difference in influx observed between the rootstocks was consistent with the results obtained for excised roots, although the values were not exactly the same. It was also shown that the main root of Paulsen had greater contribution to &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; uptake than lateral roots. &#179; &#8310;Cl&#8315; fluxes by lateral roots were not significantly different between the rootstocks. Cl&#8315; and Na&#8314; distribution patterns in different root cell types were determined using the X-ray microanalysis technique. It was shown that Cl&#8315; content in the hypodermis and cortical cells was higher than the other cell types in both rootstocks, but overall Cl&#8315; content in the root of Paulsen was higher than K 51-40. The pericycle of the main root of Paulsen accumulated more Cl&#8315; than K 51-40. It was concluded that Cl&#8315; loading to the xylem was different in the rootstocks and Paulsen tended to prevent the xylem Cl&#8315; loading process. Lateral roots also displayed opposite behaviour consistent with flux analysis. Membrane potential difference (PD) of the cortical cells showed a rapid and transient depolarization by adding 30 mM NaCl in both rootstocks that was followed by a gradual hyperpolarization. Depolarizations caused by 30 mM Choline-Cl, Na-MES and NaCl measured by the root surface potential method showed that Choline-Cl in K 51-40 and Na-MES in Paulsen caused greater depolarization than that of Na-MES in K 51-40 and Choline-Cl in Paulsen respectively. Assuming that PD measured in this method was the trans-root potential (TRP), it was concluded that the higher depolarization by Choline-Cl in K 51-40 can be due to higher Cl&#8315; efflux rate to the xylem. Two different mechanisms were also detected for Cl&#8315; transport: HATS which was observed in the range of 0.5-5 mM and a LATS in the range of 10-30 mM of the external NaCl concentration. This was consistent with the concentration dependence of Cl&#8315; influx. In conclusion, evidence obtained from different experiments of this study indicated that in the grapevine rootstocks (Paulsen and K 51-40) Cl&#8315; was mostly transported through the symplastic pathway. From ECl values determined for the rootstocks by the Nernst equation, a proton-driven transport system was responsible for Cl&#8315; transport in both the HATS and LATS range of external NaCl concentrations. The rate of Cl&#8315; transport from the root to shoot (xylem loading) was the major difference in Cl&#8315; transport between the rootstocks in terms of salinity tolerance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinity; grapevine; Cl- transport; pressure probe; x-ray microanalysis; potential difference; NO3- /Cl- interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and production of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae haze protective factor 2 for sensory studies and further investigation into the role of glycosylation.</field><field name="creator">Macintyre, Oenone Jean</field><field name="description">White wine clarity is essential, but it can be marred by the presence of a protein haze. This protein haze is predominantly formed by grape-derived thaumatin-like proteins and chitinases, which can slowly denature and aggregate if left in bottled wines. Currently bentonite fining is used by the wine industry to prevent protein haze. Bentonite consists of fine clay particles that, when added to wine, bind and remove the haze-forming proteins. However this method is inconvenient, time-consuming, and causes significant losses of wine. It is estimated that this process costs the Australian wine industry $50 m annually in wine losses alone. Alternatives are thus being investigated. The principal objective of this thesis was to investigate the sensory effects on wine of an alternative method to bentonite fining: addition of haze protective factor 2, known as Hpf2. Hpf2 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannoprotein that has been shown to reduce protein haze in wines. It is a highly mannosylated 180 kDa protein, of which approximately 75% by weight is mannose. Previous work has shown that the addition of approximately 200 mg L&#8315;&#185; Hpf2 to wines reduces the visible haze in wine by approximately 50%. Hpf2 is naturally present in wines at concentrations of less than 10 ng L&#8315;&#185;, much lower than the concentration required for haze protection activity. However, the sensory impacts involved with the addition of such high concentrations of Hpf2 in wine have never been studied. This knowledge is essential for the future commercial prospects of this alternative approach to protein stabilisation of wine. To undertake sensory studies, over 1 g of Hpf2 would be required. Presently, the laboratory-scale process for the production of a 6-histidine tagged version of the protein, 6xHisHpf2, in a laboratory yeast strain of S. cerevisiae, produces only milligram quantities. Consequently, the first challenge of this research was to scale up the existing process to produce sufficient quantities of Hpf2. The first attempt to increase the production level was by over-expression in the bacteria Escherichia coli. Although several approaches were trialled, 6xHisHpf2 was unable to be successfully and consistently expressed in this system. The second method was by improving the original yeast expression system, and the expression level was able to be improved approximately 10-fold. This improved expression method was scaled up to produce and then purify over 1 g of protein. Several quantification methods were assessed to determine the efficiencies of each purification step, with slot blot analysis proving successful. Sensory trials were conducted to establish the effect of 6xHisHpf2 on wines, with duo-trio studies conducted assessing both aroma and palate of the wines. Invertase, another yeast haze protective factor, was also trialled. It was found that the addition of an active level of 6xHisHpf2 or invertase did not cause a significant difference in the aroma or palate of wines. In addition to this main study, the role of the glycosylation was studied. 6xHisHpf2, produced in a different yeast, Pichia pastoris, was found to be 83 kDa, with only 50% mannose. This protein was compared to the S. cerevisiae protein in its ability to reduce protein haze, and it was shown that the P. pastoris protein could reduce haze, but not as effectively as the S. cerevisiae protein. The finding that Hpf2 does not affect the sensory properties of wine is essential if Hpf2 is to be used commercially, as winemakers and wine consumers would most likely reject an additive that alters the wine aroma or palate. This work has brought the wine industry a step closer to a new method for protein haze prevention in white wines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein expression; protein purification; wine haze; haze protective factor; mannoproteins; Hpf2</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting air temperatures in city streets on the basis of measured reference data.</field><field name="creator">Erell, Evyatar</field><field name="description">Knowledge of site-specific conditions is essential for the development of an architectural design that responds to the local environment. However, while meteorological data are recorded by the weather service in stations that are assumed to be representative of the surrounding region, generally no account is made of changes in local conditions caused by urban development - though these may be substantial. Micro-climate in city streets can be predicted by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with fine spatial resolution. However, CFD requires extremely detailed input, involves long computation times and is thus limited to simulating short periods. The aim of this project was to create a model capable of simulating weather conditions for extended periods, with simplified inputs and less detailed, yet accurate, outputs. The CAT (Canyon Air Temperature) computer model predicts site- pecific air temperature in a city street based on data from a rural reference station. In addition to a rudimentary description of the two sites, it requires only inputs measured at standard weather stations, yet is capable of predicting accurately the evolution of air temperature in all weather conditions for extended periods. It simulates the effects of urban geometry on radiant exchange; the effect of moisture availability on latent heat flux; energy stored in the ground and in building surfaces; air flow in the street based on wind above roof height; and the sensible heat flux from individual surfaces and from the street canyon as a whole. A monitoring program was carried out in Adelaide, South Australia, in which weather conditions were recorded continuously at two streets and at a reference location outside the city centre for nearly a year. In addition to providing data required to calibrate and to validate the CAT model, the measurements provided evidence of a substantial nocturnal heat island in the city, of up to 8.6 &#176;C. The weather records also demonstrate the existence of an urban cool island during the daytime of up to 3.8 &#176;C, the intensity of which is related to the diurnal temperature range. The CAT model may be used to generate realistic, site- pecific temperature inputs for building thermal simulation software, required to produce more accurate modelling of energy use. It may also be used to evaluate the effect on micro-climatic conditions of proposed development at new urban locations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring spiritual landscape in Sitka Alaska to enhance cross-cultural understanding</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Jordan Marijana</field><field name="description">This thesis examines spiritual landscapes, illustrating their richness in understanding cross-cultural relations and revealing deeper cultural attitudes toward the environment. It also shows that spiritual landscapes hold visible and invisible remnants of the past, providing insights for intercultural relations today. The research is timely, building on the momentum of international and national efforts to better understand and preserve indigenous cultures and settler heritages. The collisions of diverse cultures during first contact (1400s to 1700s) left society with enduring intercultural challenges. Perspectives on colonial impacts range from culture annihilation and land dispossession to legitimate expressions of imperial power and politics. Regarding land issues, conflicts persist in ownership and management (e.g., legislation and treaties), preservation and designation (e.g., how and whose values apply), and use and access (e.g., equitable provision and regulation of rival commercial, community and conservancy interests). This thesis elevates earlier judgements to reveal insights into land issues focusing on multicultural contributions. The comprehensive approach used to study Sitka Alaska&#8304;&#769;&#8328;s spiritual landscape considers spiritual indicators including burial grounds, worship buildings, homelands, and place names, alongside lasting cultural attitudes toward such places (geomentalities). Indigenous Tlingit, Russian and American contributions to patterns of settlement and development of sacred places are revealed in the cultural layering (palimpsest) evident in the contemporary landscape. Using an inclusive comparable platform broadens Western discourses of spirituality, planning and land management. It recognises multicultural aspects evident in contemporary settings, including power relations and settler practices of appropriation and conquest that continue in planning instruments and perpetuated spatial preferences. Such observations, together with spiritual indicators and attitudes provide a comprehensive exploration of Sitka&#8304;&#769;&#8328;s spiritual landscape to celebrate several cultural heritages on equal terms. With globalisation and ongoing land conflicts this work urges planners, policy makers and educators to consider the value of adding geographic and spiritual dimensions to enhance cross-cultural understanding. Practical applications for a range of local and international settings and individual decision-making are presented for consideration.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the notion of interdependence, and the dynamics of willingness to communicate</field><field name="creator">Cao, Yiqian</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 12/2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for annotating and visualizing cellML models</field><field name="creator">Wimalaratne, Sarala M.</field><field name="description">The Physiome Project was established to develop tools for international collaboration and sharing physiological knowledge in the form of biological models and experimental data. The CellML language was developed in response to the need for a high-level language to represent and exchange mathematical models of biological processes.  The language provides a flexible framework for describing the dynamics of biological processes but does not explicitly lend itself to capturing the underlying biological concepts such as the entities and processes that these models represent. The relationship between the biological process and the mathematical model describing the biological process is also often complex. This makes it difficult to see the biological concepts which the CellML structures represent. A framework which supports visualizing the biological concepts and its relationship to the underlying CellML model would provide a very useful toolset for understanding the biological concepts modeled in CellML.  The CellML models need to be annotated with biological concepts in order to provide the machine interpretable data for generating a visual representation. We have developed an ontological framework which can be used to explicitly annotate CellML models with physical and biological concepts, a method to derive a simplified biological view from the annotations, a visual language for representing all biophysical processes captured in the CellML models, and a method to map the visual language to the ontological framework in order to automate the generation of visual representations of a model.  The proposed method of model visualization produces a result that is dependent on the structure of the CellML models which requires modelers to structure the model in a way that best describes the biophysical concepts and abstractions they wish to demonstrate. Our argument is that this leads to a best practice approach to building and organizing models.  As a part of this research, a software tool for visualizing CellML models was developed. This tool combines the visual language and the ontologies to generate visualizations that depict the physical and biological concepts captured in CellML models and enables different communities in diverse disciplines to more easily understand CellML models within the biological domain they represent.  As research continues, with further improvement to the framework it would be possible to visually construct composite CellML models by selecting high level biological concepts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhanced surveillance of potentially foodborne enteric disease within a New Zealand public health service : thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies in Public Health at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Shadbolt, Tui Louise</field><field name="description">An enhanced notified enteric disease surveillance trial began on 1 July 2007 and continued until 30 June 2008. The aim of the trial was to measure the quality, timeliness and completeness of data collected and submitted by a regional Public Health Service (PHS) to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research Limited (ESR), via the national disease database (EpiSurv) for notified cases of enteric diseases. The trial evaluated two different methods of data collection: postal questionnaires and telephone interviews. Telephone interview techniques were used to improve the contact rate, timeliness and completeness of data gathered from all notified cases of campylobacteriosis in the Manawatu, Horowhenua and Tararua regions. The target set for the project was to achieve a 95% contact rate with 90% full completion of all EpiSurv data fields. For all notified cases of campylobacteriosis a 97% contact rate was achieved in a time frame of between zero to 20 days (three day median) and completeness of all the EpiSurv case report fields ranged between 96 &#8211; 100% in the final data. Prior to the commencement of the study, between 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, MidCentral PHS (MCPHS) made contact with around 58% of all notified cases of campylobacteriosis and 77% of all other notified enteric disease cases1 . A short pre-screen mail questionnaire, with reply-paid envelope, was sent to all notified cases of cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, salmonellosis and yersiniosis in the MCPHS regions. EpiSurv case report fields were completed using information supplied in the returned questionnaires. Return rate, timeliness, and completeness were compared with the telephone interview group. Fifty three percent of cases we attempted to contact via mail questionnaire responded within two to 63 days (six day median) and completeness of all the EpiSurv case report fields ranged between 81 &#8211; 100%. In addition, we monitored the newly introduced ESR Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) flags for increased levels of disease compared to historical disease rates, and assessed its usefulness as a tool to identify potential outbreaks in the region. While no outbreaks that had not already been identified by PHS staff were found by monitoring the EARS system, EARS has become an important tool in the MCPHS for comparing our rates of disease with bordering PHSs. EARS also provided a good quick reference tool for media enquiries and the graphs produced in EARS have been well utilised as visual aids for training and seminars presented during the trial period. The results of the surveillance trial initiatives were compared to the rest of New Zealand (NZ) over the same time frame and with a comparable, medium-sized, PHS. While the results of the telephone interviews from the MCPHS trial were close to the comparable PHS, they were significantly higher than for the rest of NZ. The postal questionnaires achieved a lower contact rate than the comparable PHS but similar to the rest of NZ. However, the quality of data gathered in the returned MCPHS postal questionnaire was significantly higher in most fields. Additional analysis was undertaken which indicated that those cases living in higher deprivation and rural areas were less likely to respond to a postal questionnaire. An over-representation of common enteric disease notifications from rural areas in the MCPHS was also highlighted by our research. This trial has shown the effectiveness of utilising telephone interviews and telemarketing techniques for gathering timely and complete data for human enteric disease surveillance within the MCPHS. It has also demonstrated that a short pre-screen questionnaire can be effective in collecting good quality data needed to complete the standard EpiSurv case report form.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enteric disease surveillance trial</field><field name="subject">Enteric diseases</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Campylobacteriosis</field><field name="subject">Cryptosporidiosis</field><field name="subject">Giardiasis</field><field name="subject">Salmonellosis</field><field name="subject">Yersiniosis</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring animal disease and productivity in Samoa : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Taule'alo, Sina Fuatino</field><field name="description">This thesis presents two studies that form the basis of the Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries&#8217; (MAF) recent efforts to enhance its animal disease surveillance capacity. The first study investigated a method of enhancing the surveillance value of veterinary case data collected by the MAF&#8217;s Animal Health Service, which provides the only veterinary service for livestock in the country, through temporal analysis of cases and syndromes by species. Threshold levels generated from 3-monthly moving averages combined over 3 years of veterinary case data were used to identify unusually high numbers of cases and the cause of these unusual events were investigated. Further, the analysis of data in the system identified gaps in the coverage of the Animal Health Service which helped identify alternative methods for conducting surveillance in these areas using the Crops Division advisory officers. The objective of the second study was to identify if the veterinary case data collected by the Animal Health Service represented pig health problems in the general population. Reproduction and mortality patterns were compared on a group of 10 holdings that were regularly attended by the veterinary staff and 13 holdings that did not utilise the Animal Health Service. The performance of these holdings, measured in liveborn piglets per sow year and pre-weaning and post-weaning mortality were compared given their status as client or non-client of the service and their exposure to various management factors like confinement, protein supplementation, frequency of feeding, management time per sow per day, the use of improved or exotic breeds, the extent of commercial activity and, in the case of piglets their season of birth (rainy or dry season). The mean number of sows per herd was 6, producing a mean litter size of 6.1 piglets with a mean interfarrowing interval of 235 days. The median pre-weaning mortality per litter was 0 and a median of 1 piglet per litter was used for productive purposes (consumed, gifted or sold) at a median age of 153 days. It was found that the greatest influence on productivity in these holdings was nutrition. Sow productivity (in terms of liveborn piglets per sow year and pre-weaning survival) was best in the non-client, free range herds that did not provide protein supplementation (but whose feeding was unrestricted due to their freedom to roam and scavenge) and worst in client and non-client herds that were confined and not given protein supplementation (due to restricted and underfeeding). The mortality of pigs postweaning was significantly higher if they were free roaming, due to their loss to predation, theft and being hit by car. The study showed that the health status of pigs was better on holdings that did not use the Animal Health Service compared with those that did.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pigs</field><field name="subject">Swine</field><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="subject">Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Animal Health Service</field><field name="subject">Diseases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a community based programme for male perpetrators of intimate partner violence : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Albany</field><field name="creator">Hetherington, Sally</field><field name="description">Treatment for perpetrators of Intimate partner violence (IPV) is most often provided by community based IPV perpetrator programmes.  These programmes have become an integral part of the response to IPV despite the fact that they are plagued by high rates of attrition and researchers suggest their effectiveness may be limited.  It has been suggested that the retention rates and effectiveness of the programmes may be improved by tailoring treatment to specific subgroups of IPV perpetrators.  This study was an evaluation of a community based IPV perpetrator programme.  Participants were twenty two male IPV perpetrators who were court and not court ordered to treatment for violence towards a female intimate partner.  Only seven participants completed the programme.  Their self reported incidents of violence, alcohol consumption, change readiness and levels of working alliance were measured up to four times during the 18 week programme.  Results indicated that participants who completed the programme or the majority of it significantly reduced their violence towards intimate partners and their levels of alcohol consumption.  Higher levels of violence were associated with alcohol abuse and non court ordered status.  As expected, court ordered participants reported lower levels of readiness to change and working alliance, and higher levels of alcohol abuse. However they were more likely to complete the programme compared with non court ordered participants.

However, this framework has been criticized for its reliance on retrospective recall for empirical support (Mineka &amp; &#214;hman, 2002), which has been found to be highly unreliable (Taylor, Deane, &amp; Podd, 1999). Thirty height-fearful undergraduate students completed the Origins Questionnaire-II (OQ-II; Menzies &amp; Parker, 2001) and were classified into one of the several associative and non-associative pathways of fear onset based on their responses. A control group of 43 non-fearful students completed a modified version of the OQ-II to report any past experiences with heights. To examine the stability of these responses over time, the same questionnaires for both groups were completed again three months (Time 2) and 12 months (Time 3) after the initial administration of the test, along with measures of fear severity. Results showed that neither associative nor non-associative accounts took precedence over the other in explaining the onset of height fear. Instabilities in pathway ascriptions were observed in 18.18% of cases over three months (between Time 1 and Time 2), and 27.27% of cases over nine months (between Time 2 and Time 3). The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed with consideration of some of the study&#8217;s procedural and instrumental limitations. In light of these limitations, this study identified a substantial role of non-associative pathways on the development of height fear, and provided further support for the limitations of retrospective recall for ascertaining the pathway to fear onset.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Height fear</field><field name="subject">Acrophobia</field><field name="subject">Fear of heights</field><field name="subject">Specific phobias</field><field name="subject">Etiology</field><field name="subject">Pathways</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value of rapport in rangatahi Maori mental health: A Maori social work perspective:  a thesis  presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Social  Work at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mooney, Hannah Aroha</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the rapport building that occurs between rangatahi M&#257;ori whaiora (adolescent M&#257;ori who use mental health services) and M&#257;ori social workers in the field of community mental health. Six M&#257;ori social workers were interviewed to explore how they view and practice rapport building with rangatahi M&#257;ori whaiora. The M&#257;ori social workers were able to provide valuable perspectives based on years of personal and professional experience. The research was conducted using a social constructionist perspective, informed and guided by M&#257;ori-centred research principles. A qualitative research method was used and both Massey University and M&#257;ori ethical considerations thoroughly explored. Face to face interviews guided by an integrated practice framework, enabled the voices of the M&#257;ori social workers to be heard, eliciting in detail where their views have come from. The findings from the research showed that M&#257;ori social workers view rapport as essential in their practice and therefore they practice in a way that facilitates this with rangatahi. The social workers utilise their values and beliefs in their practice, according to their worldview; how they were raised; what they have experienced, and what they have learned. Specifically, M&#257;ori social workers identified the importance of practicing with a M&#257;ori worldview, therefore enabling physical connection, spiritual connection, and cultural connection with the rangatahi. These all contributed towards rapport building with the rangatahi and also their wh&#257;nau. The importance of action reflection processes were also highlighted. This is due to the balance required from M&#257;ori social workers to fulfil the needs of the rangatahi as aligned with their values and beliefs, while meeting the requirements of the organisation, profession and wider community. This thesis explores these key findings.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rangatahi Maori whaiora</field><field name="subject">Adolescent Maori</field><field name="subject">Maori social workers</field><field name="subject">Affinity</field><field name="subject">Mutual understanding</field><field name="subject">Rapport</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work::370204 Counselling , welfare and community services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of a person-centred approach to care of older people with cognitive impairment and disturbed behaviour in the acute care setting using action research.</field><field name="creator">Poole, Julia Lorna</field><field name="description">Increasing numbers of older patients with cognitive impairment and disturbed behaviour are likely to present to acute care hospitals in the future. Nurses are not well disposed towards care due to safety and morale issues caused by knowledge deficits, job stress, oppressed group behaviours and ageist attitudes. Patient outcomes are often poor with multiple adverse events, long lengths of stay and levels of mortality. Disturbed behaviour may be caused by delirium, depression or other mental disorders and dementia or all. The research question addressed was &#8220;Can the instigation of a person-centred approach to care of patients with cognitive impairment and disturbed behaviour result in decreased nursing stress, improved patient care practices, outcomes and relatives&#8217; satisfaction?&#8221; A conceptual framework incorporating the constructs of Person-Centred Care, the Integrated Structural Model of Human Behaviour and Practice Development informed the action research methods utilised. The processes of facilitation were used to undertake four action research cycles incorporating plans, actions, observations and reflections in one 25-bed acute aged care ward in a large tertiary referral hospital The first cycle involved setting up the study, recruitment of nurses and patients, gathering of baseline data and application of nonparticipant observational studies of the quality of nurse-patient interactions which served to inform the plan for interventions. The following three cycles demonstrated efforts to undertake those interventions through strategies to increase nursing empowerment and knowledge in the context of constant staff turnover and diversions that compromised support and participation. During the study there were few apparent adverse patient outcomes with significant improvements in patient analgesic administration, relatives&#8217; satisfaction with care, nursing care practices involving the completion of a Communication and Care Cues form and nurses&#8217; interactions with the patients. New care planning tools were developed that will enable ongoing activities for practice improvement. Conversely, there was a significant increase in the nurses&#8217; stress levels when caring for hypoactive delirious patients, a trend towards more emotional exhaustion, high nursing turnover and increased sick leave rates. Nursing care practices were unchanged and the new care planning tools were not well utilised. Reflection on the implications and limitations of action research methods supported by practice development strategies in the dynamic, often chaotic environment experienced during the study, suggested that if there is an absence of hierarchical managerial sponsorship for such activities, then sustainable change is difficult. Therefore, it was shown that a person-centred approach to care of patients with cognitive impairment and disturbed behaviour using action research methods in this environment, can result in some enhanced nurse-patient interactions, patient care practices, outcomes and relatives&#8217; satisfaction. However, progress is likely to be slow and time consuming. Further improvements require attention to the well-being status of the nurses through actions that generate feelings of empowerment through individual recognition, knowledge enhancement, adequate access to patient information and sufficient time to undertake their duties as equal members of the multidisciplinary team.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Person centred care.</field><field name="subject">Action research.</field><field name="subject">Cognitive impairment.</field><field name="subject">Older people.</field><field name="subject">Acute care nursing.</field><field name="subject">Dementia.</field><field name="subject">Delirium.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of BCG vaccine strain on the immune response and protection against tuberculosis</field><field name="creator">Ritz, Nicole</field><field name="description">More than 100 million doses of Bacille-Calmette-Gu&#233;rin (BCG) vaccine are given each year to protect infants against tuberculosis (TB).

Culture under dissimilar conditions led to the evolution of more than 20 BCG vaccine strains in different countries. Phenotypic differences between these BCG vaccine strains were first recognised in the 1920s and, more recently, molecular studies have defined their genomic differences. Although several animal and human studies suggest that the particular BCG vaccine strain used for immunisation influences the mycobacterial-specific immune response, there is currently insufficient data to favour or recommend one BCG vaccine strain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How effective are current drug education programs as a means of preventing illicit substance abuse in teenagers</field><field name="creator">Lees-Amon, Karen</field><field name="description">Western Governments have been obliged to tackle illicit substance abuse by focusing on health issues, this has resulted in preventative policies that direct drug education through schools.

E. H.</field><field name="description">In order to understand, more fully, some of the factors affecting the S requirements of pastures, S&#179;&#8309;-labelled gypsum fertilizer was applied to several field trials located on soils within the recent, yellow brown earth and high country yellow brown earth soil groups in Canterbury, New Zealand.  Among the major processes studied were the incorporation of the S&#179;&#8309;-labelled gypsum fertilizer into the soil organic matter, its movement in the soil and its uptake by pasture plants.  The results obtained showed that on the same soil type, plant uptake of fertilizer S and its incorporation into the organic matter were greater under improved pastures. However, the movement of fertilizer S was relatively unaffected by the pastoral improvement. Rainfall conditions affected all three processes studied, particularly the downward movement of fertilizer S. Over the growing seasons of the first year almost all of the added fertilizer S remained within the upper 15 cm of the soil at a low rainfall trial. On a similar textured soil, receiving almost twice as much rainfall over a similar time period, fertilizer S was distributed evenly to a depth of 60 cm.  Where the rainfall was similar, but soils differed in their water holding capacity, large differences in the downward movement of fertilizer S occurred. On a steepland yellow brown earth soil almost 70% of the applied fertilizer S was lost from the 0-45 cm soil depth two months after application. While on a recent soil, with a much higher water holding capacity, greater amounts of fertilizer S remained within the upper 45 cm over the same period..  Large differences in the downward movement of fertilizer S were shown by soils with contrasting retention capacities, but under similar rainfall conditions. On a yellow brown earth soil, with a medium S retention in the subsoil, fertilizer S was found not to have moved beyond 60 cm in the winter following the spring application. In contrast, fertilizer S penetrated beyond the 60 cm on a recent low S retentive soil. Under improved pastoral conditions, applying fertilizer S in late spring rather than early spring, to two different soils gave larger (almost twofold) residual effects the following year. Total recovery of the added fertilizer S in the soil-plant systems studied were generally greater than 80%. The pattern and rate of the downward movement of fertilizer S was little affected by fertilizer rates. Pasture recovery (%) of fertilizer S at the lower rate (22.5 kgS/ha) was slightly higher than that at the higher rate (45 kgS/ha). Fertilizer rates did not produce a consistent effect on the extent of fertilizer S incorporation into soil organic matter.  The magnitude of the sulphur cycling pool was determined at each trial location by using the equilibrium specific activity of pasture. This pool was found to vary between trials and showed no relationship to their respective S response patterns. The rate of S cycling appeared to be more important.  At some trials a strong correlation was found between the specific activity of the S in pasture and that for phosphate-extractable sulphate in particular soil depths. This relationship was used to assess indirectly, the likely soil zones from which plants extract S to meet their nutritional requirements.  A new technique was developed to study, directly, the soil zone from which plants extract S to meet their-nutritional requirements. Carrier-free S&#179;&#8309;, injected horizontally into various soil depths in a recent and a yellow brown earth soil, showed that both grasses and clovers recovered S&#179;&#8309; to a depth of 52 cm, in the spring. However, most of the S&#179;&#8309; uptake by plants was found to occur in the upper 30 cm (A horizon) in both soils. In the autumn, S&#179;&#8309; uptake experiments on these soils showed uptake to occur at 100 cm on the recent soil, and cease at 52 cm on the yellow brown earth soil.  Growth cabinet experiments, using S&#179;&#8309;-labelled pasture residue, recovered from the field plots, and added to various soils, showed that ryegrass recovery of labelled fertilizer S ranged from 6-16% and it varied according to soil type, degree of pastoral development, type and form of plant residue added. This extent of recovery represents only a small proportion (1%) of the fertilizer S recovered by pasture in the first year.  The overall experimental results were considered in relation to both the S response patterns obtained from the present field trials and also those from other similar trials conducted in recent years in the Canterbury area. Some possible reasons for the variable S responses obtained were discussed and methods for improving the efficiency of fertilizer use, at farm level, were proposed.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sulphur</field><field name="subject">fertiliser</field><field name="subject">pasture</field><field name="subject">pasture recovery</field><field name="subject">gypsum fertiliser</field><field name="subject">079902 - Fertilisers and Agrochemicals (incl.

This situation poses two fundamental unresolved issues of conflict: first, is the issue on the breadth of its territorial sea, and second, its treatment of supposed archipelagic waters as internal waters. The twin issues of the legal status of the Philippine Treaty Limits and its extensive historic claims to territorial waters have been subject of much academic debate and serious criticisms.The delimitation of Philippine territorial and maritime boundaries in conformity with international law necessitates the reform of the existing national legal, policy and administrative framework to resolve fundamental issues of conflict between domestic legislation and international law. This thesis, proceeding from both a national and an international legal perspective, clarifies the legal status of the Philippine Treaty Limits and territorial waters claim in international law, with a view to facilitating such reforms.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New South Wales Teachers' Federation, c.1957-1975</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, John Michael</field><field name="description">This work analyses the history of the New South Wales Teachers' Federation from 1957 to 1975. The Federation is one of the largest unions in New South Wales and as an affiliate of the Australian Teachers' Federation, is part of one of the largest industrial organisations of employees in Australia. The period under review was a time of significant economic, political and social change, both in Australia and internationally. This thesis examines the Federation's response to those changes and its attempts to influence the direction of those changes. It seeks to identify the changes within the union and the degree of continuity in the union's experience during the whole of the period under discussion. Previous work on the Federation has not dealt with this particular period of its history in any comprehensive way.The thesis is informed by, and in part endeavours to make a contribution to, the debates about the role teachers and their organisations play in a capitalist society. It examines the activity of the Federation as an organisation of employees of the State. It discusses the constraints operating upon teachers as State employees. It traces the sometimes contradictory influence of the ideology of professionalism, in its various forms, upon the attitudes and behaviour of teacher unionists. It considers the difficulties which can arise from teachers' contradictory position as both wage earners and professionals. The thesis endeavours to make some contribution to the task of identifying the class position, class location and the degree of class consciousness of teachers as unionists.The primary material on which this thesis is based is taken, for the most part, from the extensive archives and publications of the Federation itself. The author has had unrestricted access to this material. It has been supplemented by material of an official nature such as government education reports and by contemporary newspapers that have devoted a considerable amount of space to the activities of teachers' unions and to education generally. Interviews with persons involved in the union during the period under review, brought differing perspectives to the information and differing insights from those gleaned from the written sources. For the most part, however, the argument of the thesis is derived from the written sources.The work examines the policies, and particularly the methods, adopted by the Federation in the period under review. It traces the process of transformation from a concept of 'united action' which did not include resort to strike action, and which was largely determined by the central decision-making bodies of the union, to action initiated by local units and vanguard elements of the union and which often involved strike action. The movement towards the use of strike action as an industrial tactic is examined, together with the implications of the use of that tactic for the internal operations and politics of the union. It also considers the consequences of the use of strike action for the union's relationship with various authorities of the State.Indeed the 1968 strike, the first in Federation history, is the pivotal point both of the narrative and the argument of the thesis. Much of the thesis is developed chronologically. There are, however, important exceptions to this approach. Two chapters discuss the Federation's federal funding campaigns. Another two chapters deal with the background to the period under discussion and the wider social, political and economic context in which the Federation operated. There is also a chapter which discusses changes in the structure and operation of the union in the 1960s.Chapter one deals with the context in which the union operated in the 1940s and early 1950s, as well as giving some background to the internal structure and politics of the organization in this period. The second chapter examines the Federation's federal funding campaign, particularly the attempt to build a broadly-based united front by the mobilisation of arguments about the role of education in economic, scientific and technological development.Chapter three discusses the Federation's campaign for the reform of secondary education. The next chapter analyses the role that the union's Education Commission policy played in providing a central focus for the activities of the Federation in the first half of the 1960s.Chapter five analyses the various constituent elements within the union and the changes that took place within the organisation during the 1960s. The objective of this chapter is to explain what constituted, both 'unity' and acceptable 'action' within the traditional Federation concept of 'united action&#8217;. This is followed by a chapter which sets out the broader economic, social and political framework in which the union operated in the late 1960s and in the first half of the 1970s. Chapter seven is the second chapter on the federal funding issue, covering the period 1967 to 1975.Chapter eight examines the changes within the teaching service and within the union itself which contributed to the resort to strike action in 1968. The next two chapters deal with the consequences of that action for the union's relationship with the State authorities. They also examine the related struggle within the union between those who desired to maintain the maximum degree of central control and those elements that demanded greater autonomy from the centre in the ordering of the campaign priorities of the union.The last chapter covers the period of the new leadership which emerged victorious from the internecine warfare of the late 1960s and early 1970s. It analyses whether this period constituted a 'new era' in Federation history fundamentally different from the period preceding it. The work concludes that important changes took place within the union which, in turn, had a significant effect on the union's relationships with the State. It also suggests, however, that these changes had not, in any fundamental way, swept away the constraints placed upon teachers as employees of the State. It also concludes that the ideology of professionalism, although weakened and redefined in the interests of the union rather than the employer, still prevented teachers from identifying themselves as an integral part of the working class in its continuing struggle with Capital and the State. In the period 1957 to 1975 there had been much change, but nevertheless significant continuity, in the history of the New South Wales Teachers' Federation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transport boundaries for pneumatic conveying</field><field name="creator">Yi, Jianglin</field><field name="description">Pneumatic conveying is being selected for an increasing number of industrial applications and products and is playing a more vital and integral role in the transportation of solid materials such as plastic pellets, grain and chemicals. However, despite all the minimum conveying velocity research (one of the operating boundaries for pneumatic conveying) that has been undertaken for several decades, the wide scatter and contradictions in the predictions of the minimum conveying velocity for dilute phase pneumatic conveying exist yet, determination of the operating boundaries for pneumatic conveying (mainly maximum conveying velocity for dense phase and minimum conveying velocity for dilute phase) still has been one of the most important tasks to be solved for the design, optimising and upgrade of pneumatic conveying systems as a consequence of that the mechanisms involved in the formation of boundaries between dilute-phase and dense-phase pneumatic conveying through a horizontal pipeline have not been well explored.Saltation velocity was investigated initially in this thesis and then the emphasis was placed on the transition between dilute-phase and dense-phase. With careful observations, it is found that pneumatic conveying of granular solid materials through a horizontal pipeline can exhibit five different flow modes (as the air velocity is decreased): fully suspended flow; strand flow; stable or unstable strand flow over a stationary layer for low solid mass flow rates; stable or unstable strand flow over a slowly moving bed for high solid mass flow rates; low-velocity slug-flow. The pressure fluctuations within the unstable zone result from the flow mode alternation between a strand flow over a stationary layer (or slowly moving bed) and slug flow starting at the inlet due to a decrease in air velocity. The first slug moves quickly at a relatively high velocity and picks up a relatively thick stationary layer in front of it but only deposits a small amount of the material behind it. The increase in slug length and large increase in pressure cause severe pressure fluctuations and pipeline vibrations. Two different flow modes may exist simultaneously in the conveying pipeline: strand flow over a stationary layer or slowly moving bed near the feed point followed by the dilute-phase (suspension) flow of particles. For the latter, material erodes away from the end of the stationary layer or slowly moving bed and is conveyed in the form of small dunes (or pulsating strand flow).Based on the mass balance, force balance, momentum balance and the unstable flow forming mechanism, a theoretical three-layer model for the prediction of the transition zone boundaries has been established. With stability analysis, the boundaries of the transition zone in the state diagram have been identified, and have been found to agree very well with experimental data. According to the model established, the discussion on the influence of design parameters of particle and bulk properties of the material being conveyed and pipe wall properties on boundaries in the state diagram has been conducted.The discussion on the operating boundaries for pneumatic conveying of granular materials has been extended to conveying of powder materials and a principle for classification of granular materials and powder materials, which have different flow mode in PCC, has been proposed.The research also has been carried out on the pressure drop prediction for pneumatic conveying of granular materials in the form of low-velocity slug-flow in order to have a perfect PCC state diagram. A new approach for the direct measurement of stress transmission factor has been developed in this thesis. The effect of the weight of the granular material in the slug on pressure drop is taken in account according to the experimental test results. The model for pressure drop prediction also includes a modified equation for the frontal force of the moving slug - allowing for momentum balance of accelerating particles and the additional force from the stationary layer to resist the movement. The modelling predictions agree very well with test results obtained on poly pellets conveyed through 98 mm and 60.3 mm ID horizontal stainless steel pipelines, each 21 m in length.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiconductor oxide supported Mo and Mo-W carbide catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Tuan Huy, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction to produce sulphur free hydrocarbons has enjoyed a resurgent in interests due to increases in world oil prices. In this work, the suitability of Mo and Mo-W carbides has been investigated as a possible cost-effective alternative to noble metals in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The molybdenum and tungsten monometallic and bimetallic carbides were prepared through precipitation from homogeneous solution to the sulphide followed by carburization with a mixture of propane and hydrogen to produce the resulting metal carbide. A 23 factorial design strategy was employed to investigate the effect of three carburizing variables, namely, time, temperature and gas ratio on the resulting catalyst. In particular, the effect of supports was also examined through four common semiconductor oxide supports, namely: Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2. Thermogravimetric analysis of the carburization reactions showed that the conversion from metal sulphide to the metal carbides is a multistep process producing different phases of carbides, namely ??-MoC1-x, ??-Mo2C, ?? -WC1-x and ??-W2C, depending on heating rate and temperature. The rate determining step of the carburising reaction is the diffusion of carbon atoms into the metal matrix, hence giving relatively low activation energy values. Statistical analysis of the factorial design revealed that all three carburizing variables affect the final physiochemical makeup of the catalyst. SEM analysis showed that the carbides are well dispersed on the surface of the support and catalyst particles produced are nanoparticles in the range of 25 to 220 nm depending on the support. Fischer-Tropsch activity test showed that monometallic molybdenum carbide is active under Fischer-Tropsch conditions while tungsten carbide is inactive for the conditions studied in this project. However, bimetallic carbide catalyst, consisting of the two mentioned metals gave overall higher reaction rates and decreased methane selectivity. Steady state analysis revealed that there are two active sites on the surface of molybdenum carbide catalyst resulting in two chain growth propagation values when analysed via the Anderson-Schulz-Flory kinetics. Overall, ZrO2 support appeared to be the most suitable support followed by SiO2, TiO2 and Al2O3. Finally, kinetic modelling of data showed that methanation and higher hydrocarbons formation path occurs via combination of the oxygenated intermediate and Eley-Rideal mechanism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fischer-Tropsch process</field><field name="subject">Catalysts -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Carbides</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc and nickel disrupt tubular vacuole and mitochondrial networks, but only nickel disrupts microtubules in hyphal tip cells of two Paxillus involutus strains</field><field name="creator">Tuszynska, Sandra, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ectomycorrhizal fungi are able to ameliorate heavy metal stress to host trees in polluted soils. Their sensitivity or tolerance to heavy metals is usually examined based on growth and proliferation on heavy metal amended media. However, there are no data on cellular effects of heavy metals and detoxification in live cells of these fungi. Organelle morphology has recently been recognized as an indication of cellular health and its changes can be used to assess cytotoxicity. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate short term effects of common heavy metal pollutants, Zn2+ and Ni2+ on the morphology of vacuoles, mitochondria and microtubules in hyphal tip cells of two Paxillus involutus strains. Vacuoles, mitochondria and microtubules were labeled with Oregon Green?? 488 carboxylic acid diacetate, 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide ((DiOC6(3)) and anti-??- tubulin antibodies, respectively. They were treated with 0-1 mmol L-1 NiSO4 or 0-100 mmol L-1 ZnSO4 or K2SO4 (SO4 2- control) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Vacuoles and mitochondria in untreated hyphal tip cells of strain P2 which originated from a heavy metal-rich soil were motile and tubular forming networks. Exposure to the metals caused tubular vacuole thickening and vesiculation as well as fragmentation of tubular mitochondria in living hyphal tip cells. The highest K2SO4 concentration also had severe effects on mitochondria. These effects were metal, concentration and exposure time dependent. NiSO4 caused these effects at a hundred fold lower concentration than ZnSO4 and induced severe microtubule disruption. Vacuole tubularity recovered after removal of the metal solutions depending on the metal, concentration and exposure time. Mitochondrial tubularity recovered to pretreatment morphology in a shorter time and even during exposure to the highest metal concentration. Vacuoles of strain P46 which originated from a non-polluted soil were pleomorphic, but mainly spherical with occasional tubular interconnections. The vacuoles were too sensitive to UV light exposure required for fluorescence microscopy to investigate their response to heavy metals. The mitochondrial network and microtubules resembled those of strain P2. The highest ZnSO4 and NiSO4 concentrations caused similar trends in response of mitochondria and microtubules of the two strains. However, mitochondria of strain P46 were less sensitive at lower metal concentrations. The highest K2SO4 concentration had more severe effects on mitochondria of strain P46 than in strain P2 from which tubularity was not recovered. This investigation is the first to reveal that heavy metals affect organelle morphology in two strains of an ectomycorrhizal fungus. Nickel effects on the organelles are likely to result from microtubule disruption. Metal induced mitochondrial fragmentation is possibly an apoptotic response and the recovery of tubular organelle networks suggests cellular detoxification.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out of order: explorations in digital materiality</field><field name="creator">Ballard, Susan Patricia, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Digital art installation is the result of informatic materials entering gallery spaces and challenging the establishment of media forms. This thesis contends that the open, recursive and recombinatory process of looking at digital installation is in fact the result of noisy relations between information and the spatial temporal contexts of the art gallery. In order to focus on the processes of informatic materials within gallery spaces, this thesis identifies four key modulations of noise and materiality ? emergence, feedback, entropy and delay. I demonstrate how these impact on a range of recent digital installations by Australian and New Zealand artists. The lens of digital materiality shifts from an informational context into that of art history where it is found to highlight the systemic relationality of the installation. The thesis opens with a consideration of histories of media-specificity, and argues for a necessary separation of our concepts of media and materiality. This context provides a set of tools by which the remainder of the thesis investigates a range of digital material flows that are not tied to fixed media definitions. I draw on a range of theorists including Umberto Eco, Gilles Deleuze, Claude Shannon and Jack Burnham to further locate these material flows within two strands: experimental sound and information theory. This discussion forms the basis of the thesis? re-appraisal of media distinctions and highlights the complex relationship of informational materials to both sonic and visual histories. The second half of the thesis undertakes an appraisal of emergence, feedback, entropy and delay in specific works and suggests dimensionality, movement and duration as key determinants of the digital installation. These chapters demonstrate that what is at stake in digital installation is the viewer?s implicit role in the shifting relationships of digital materiality. Overall, this thesis presents a framework for emergent materiality in digital installation. I develop a theory of emergent materiality as a process specific to digital installation, and argue that digital installation is in fact a subject-forming assemblage of information-noise in which relations of dimensionality, movement and duration coalesce without cohering. And, within which gallery spaces begin to get noisy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noise</field><field name="subject">Digital materiality</field><field name="subject">Media-specificity</field><field name="subject">Digital installation art</field><field name="subject">Experimental film</field><field name="subject">Experimental music</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Media ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Aotearoa</field><field name="subject">Digital art</field><field name="subject">Installations (Art)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of systematic increase in pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability, and microstructural characteristics of concrete</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mohammad Sharfuddin, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of high performance concrete in construction has been enhanced by the use of pozzolanic materials. However, the use of these materials has not been optimized. Such optimization may be achieved by a systematic increase in the amount and combination of pozzolanic material additions, with accompanying studies of their effects on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of blended concrete. This work evaluated various concrete durability issues by studying systematic increases of pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and blast furnace slag (BFS) in the range of 25, 50 and 70%, and silica fume at 10% of total cementitious materials, forming various binary and ternary concrete blends. The concrete specimens were cured for a period of seven days after demoulding in line with widely practiced commercial curing procedures. The research explored the role and effectiveness of various binary and ternary blends of pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of concrete. Durability was evaluated by two independent rapid chloride permeability tests measured as charge passed and chloride conductivity from the RCPT and UCT tests respectively. These two rapid tests were coupled with long-term ponding tests to evaluate chloride ingress and the extent of corrosion for a period of two years. Further durability tests such as carbonation, drying shrinkage and porosity of these blends were also undertaken. This study also utilized micro-analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy to follow the hydration mechanism in various binary and ternary blends. Statistical significance testing was used to analyse and confirm all experimental results and conclusions. It is well known that a level of caution is exercised in the construction industry in the use of ternary blends. This study aims to evaluate the durability aspects of ternary concrete blends, in addition to binary blends, for resistance to chloride, corrosion, carbonation attacks and provide recommendations relating to the limits of blending level, as well as exposure conditions for blended concretes, based on the results of this study. It is expected that this will fill a major knowledge gap observed in the concrete industry. A comparison of two rapid chloride permeability tests such as UCT and RCPT indicates that the UCT test is easy and practicable, and does not contradict results obtained in the standard RCPT. However, the statistical significance of results obtained for some blends was only able to be established by using the RCPT. This effect can be attributed to the larger size specimens compared to UCT. The recommended blend to acquire both early-age and long-term strength development in fly ash is the ternary blends comprising 10% silica fume and 25% fly ash cast using lower w/b ratio. In addition, the same blend exhibited lower carbonation depth, lower charge passed from RCPT, lower chloride ingress and higher corrosion resistance characteristics from long-term ponding test compared to other blends of fly ash. In BFS blends, an increase in compressive strength was observed only in the specimens of 25% BFS compared to other higher percentage blends, while the higher addition of 50 and 70% replacement showed no significant difference in compressive strength between them and their corresponding ternary blends with addition of silica fume. The results of this study indicate that control (OPC) specimens cast with increased w/b ratio of 0.48 showed higher chloride ingress compared to both binary blends of 70% fly ash and 70% BFS specimens. This indicates that (OPC) cast using higher w/b ratio is to be avoided in chloride environments. On the other hand, though, the ternary blends of 10% silica fume and up to 50% fly ash exhibited lower chloride ingress compared to their respective binary blends of fly ash. However, these ternary blends exhibited lower compressive strength, more negative corrosion potential and higher corrosion rate, compared to the respective binary blends of 25% fly ash and its ternary blends. Therefore, the recommended blend observed in the long-term ponding test is the ternary blend of 25% fly ash and 10% silica fume. The recommended level of corrosion resistance in slag specimens is achieved by the use of ternary blends comprising silica fume at 10% added to the blend that contains up to 70% slag. However, the recommended level of slag for a lower carbonation effect is the use of a ternary blend comprising 50% slag and 10% silica fume (3B5S1) which showed a carbonation depth of 10.8 mm and a compressive strength of 53.2 MPa after 365 days of exposure. The drying shrinkage of concrete increased with the increase in fly ash and the same trend was observed in BFS specimens. However, the results were not significantly different between their respective blends. The extent of carbonation in fly ash specimens was higher compared to BFS blends specimens. This can be attributed to the formation of dusty and weak surfaces on the outer surface in addition to the excessive leaching of sodium chloride solution from the long-term ponding test in the former specimens compared to later. The high volume pozzolanic materials, irrespective of fly ash or BFS and addition of silica fume (70% fly ash and 10% silica fume, and 70% BFS and 10% silica fume), showed higher cumulative pore volume indicating that these blends with seven days of curing were not beneficial. These high volume ternary blends required prolonged curing to release portlandite from the hydration of cement to continue the pozzolanic reaction. This study has shown that 7-days curing of the pozzolanic concrete is inadequate if pozzolanic activity is to be invoked. This is particularly the case when it is expected that the concrete is likely to be subjected to a harsher than usual environment characterised by a dry atmosphere.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concert</field><field name="subject">durability</field><field name="subject">additives</field><field name="subject">pozzolanic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Salinity hazard mapping and risk assessment in the Bourke irrigation district</field><field name="creator">Buchannan, Sam, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">At no point in history have we demanded so much from our agricultural land whilst simultaneously leaving so little room for management error. Of the many possible environmental impacts from agriculture, soil and water salinisation has some of the most long-lived and deleterious effects. Despite its importance, however, land managers are often unable to make informed decisions of how to manage the risk of salinisation due to a lack of data. Furthermore, there remains no universally agreed method for salinity risk mapping. This thesis addresses these issues by investigating new methods for producing high-resolution predictions of soil salinity, soil physical properties and groundwater depth using a variety of traditional and emerging ancillary data sources. The results show that the methodologies produce accurate predictions yielding natural resource information at a scale and resolution not previously possible. Further to this, a new methodology using fuzzy logic is developed that exploits this information to produce high-resolution salinity risk maps designed to aid both agricultural and natural resource management decisions. The methodology developed represents a new and effective way of presenting salinity risk and has numerous advantages over conventional risk models. The incorporation of fuzzy logic provides a meaningful continuum of salinity risk and allows for the incorporation of uncertainty. The method also allows salinity risk to be calculated relative to any vegetation community and shows where the risk is coming from (root-zone or groundwater) allowing more appropriate management decisions to be made. The development of this methodology takes us a step closer to closing what some have called our greatest gap in agricultural knowledge. That is, our ability to manage the salinity risk at the subcatchment scale.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fuzzy analysis</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Precision agriculture</field><field name="subject">Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Multiple criteria analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regulation of megakaryocyte-specific genes by Fli-1 and GATA-1</field><field name="creator">Eisbacher, Michael, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The successive activation of tissue-specific genes during cellular differentiation is orchestrated by the formation of transcriptional complexes consisting of cellspecific and ubiquitous transcription factors. Understanding the molecular events associated with normal megakaryocyte (Mk) differentiation is an issue of central importance to haematology. The aims of this study were therefore to: (i) define the transcription factors responsible for regulating the expression of Mkspecific genes such as Glycoprotein IX, (ii) identify the protein partners of such important Mk-regulatory transcription factors and (iii) examine the mechanisms utilised by these factors to regulate gene expression. First, the regulatory elements in the GPIX promoter required for basal and inducible expression were examined in megakaryoblastic Dami cells stimulated to undergo differentiation. The resulting data suggested that an Ets site in the GPIX promoter binding the Ets-family member Fli-1 was crucial in regulating both constitutive and inducible GPIX expression. Second, a two-hybrid screen of a K-562 cDNA library was used to identify transcription factors that interacted with Fli-1 and were potential regulators of Mk development. Results of this screen identified a novel protein-protein interaction with GATA-1, a previously well-characterised zinc finger transcription factor also implicated in erythroid and Mk development. Mapping of the domains required for the interaction show that the zinc fingers of GATA-1 interact with the Ets domain of Fli-1. The biological significance of the Fli-1/GATA-1 interaction was demonstrated in transient transfection assays, which resulted in synergistic activation of Mkspecific promoters. Analysis of Fli-1 and GATA-1 expression in a series of erythroleukaemic and megakaryoblastic cell lines demonstrated that the Fli- 1/GATA-1 combination correlates with a Mk-phenotype. Moreover, expression of Fli-1 in K-562 cells (a line rich in GATA-1 but normally lacking Fli-1) induces endogenous GPIX expression. Quantitative mobility shift assays reveal that Fli- 1 and GATA-1 exhibit cooperative DNA-binding in which the binding of GATA-1 to DNA is increased approximately 26 fold in the presence of Fli-1. This data provides a mechanism for the observed transcriptional synergy. In conclusion, this work suggests that Fli-1 and GATA-1 work together through protein-protein interaction and cooperative DNA-binding to activate the expression of genes associated with the terminal differentiation of Mks.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Megakaryocytes</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arthroscopic assessment of articular cartilage in an animal model of osteoarthritis.</field><field name="creator">Oakley, Stephen Philip, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Advances in our understanding of osteoarthritis (OA) have made development of sensitive measurement tools a priority. The literature review in this thesis found that one of the measurement tools, arthroscopy, had not been fully evaluated. This body of work evaluated the performance of arthroscopic assessments of articular cartilage (AC) in early OA with specific reference to the OMERACT filter. Preliminary studies in plastic knee arthroscopy simulation models found that estimates of AC lesion area had poor accuracy and reliability. Measurements of lesion diameter were greatly improved by the use of specially designed measurement probes but these did not prove feasible in vivo. Ovine studies evaluated discriminant and criterion validity. Biomechanical assessments served as the gold standard for AC stiffness while macroscopic, thickness and histologic assessments were used for gross structural damage. An hybrid gold standard assessment was devised to validate arthroscopic estimates of Severity and Extent of chondropathy. Arthroscopic global assessments discriminated between normal and very early OA but discrimination between different states of OA was less impressive. Assessments of the Severity of chondropathy had acceptable accuracy and moderate reliability. While arthroscopy could not examine the entire articular surface and estimates of Extent of chondropathy were subject to very large error they broadly resembled those of the hybrid gold standard assessment and they enhanced composite score performance. Composite score validity was further improved by inclusion of estimates of chondro-osteophyte. An empirical approach to composite algorithm weighting to optimise discriminant validity was developed. This approach compared favourably with previously described methods. Composite scores proved best at discriminating between normal and very early OA but were also capable of detecting small changes in OA. Arthroscopic asessments of AC damage meet the OMERACT filter criteria of Truth and Discrimination. Assessments using current arthroscopic technology should include estimates of the Extent of all grades of chondropathy. The optimal scoring algorithm should be determined empirically. Arthroscopic assessments using existing technology may be used to validate noninvasive assessments of the Severity chondropathy but not of Extent. Future efforts to improve arthroscopic assessments of AC should focus on reducing random error associated with estimates of extent.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">please verify keywords</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors which affect refractive outcome following LASIK for myopia.</field><field name="creator">Feltham, Mark Hayes, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Purpose: To improve the predictability, accuracy and stability of laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK), by evaluating the clinical, procedural and tissue response factors that affect refractive outcomes. Methods: Myopic LASIK surgeries (n=5,978) were carried out using the Technolas planoscan and Nidek EC-5000 excimer lasers. Clinical variables associated with a refractive outcome of within ??0.50 D of the target were identified using regression analysis. Possible procedural variations such as the timing of the procedure and accuracy of both the chosen keratome and excimer laser were evaluated. The predictability and accuracy of the ablation was assessed by measuring changes in corneal thickness during and after the procedure. Factors influencing the stability of refractive outcome were assessed. Results: Clinical factors associated with a refractive outcome of within ??0.50 D of the target included; corrections less than 5.00 DS (OR 0.21x, 95% CI 0.11-0.40x compared with corrections over -5.00 DS[referent]), patients younger than 40 years (patients over 50 OR 8.27x, 95% CI 3.41-20.03x, patients 40 to 50 years OR 1.93x, 95% CI 0.96-3.90x, compared with patients under 40[referent]) and average pre-operative curvatures between 43.50 and 45.50D (OR 0.39x, 95% CI 0.18-0.83 compared with curvatures of less than 43.50D [referent]). Refractive stability was improved using optic zone sizes between 5.5-6.0 mm, reduced myopic corrections, flatter pre-operative corneal curvatures and thicker corneal flaps (R??=25%, p&amp;lt0.001). Procedural factors associated with poorer outcomes included: thinner measured flap thickness, deeper ablations and the use of the automated corneal shaper (ACS) microkeratome with a novice surgical team (R??=34%, p &amp;lt 0.001). Delaying the ablation from 20 to 90 seconds (s) after flap lift was associated with a more stable refractive outcome at three months (p=0.017). In the 90 s following flap lift, the cornea thinned by 5??3%. The ablation rate per scan varied between procedures, however, the effect on refractive outcome was small (r=0.15, p=0.267). Changes in central corneal thickness indicated refractive stability (p=0.039). Conclusions: Applying the optimal clinical and procedural factors as described afforded a refractive outcome in a further 8% of cases, resulting in 94% to 96% of cases within ??0.50 DS of target. Refractive predictability was limited due to the inability of the keratome to produce a consistent corneal flap thickness and unexpected changes in corneal thickness. The accuracy of refractive outcome will decrease with larger ablations.

A greater understanding of disease progression will lead to enhanced screening, diagnostic and treatment strategies, in turn providing an improved prognosis for the patient.  The purpose of this study was to expand the current molecular knowledge of CRC and BlCa by elucidating the role of Mxi1 mutations and MTSS1 expression in CRC and BlCa respectively, and to examine the diagnostic potential of these genes.  The Mxi1 coding region for 41 tumours, collected by the South Western Sydney Colorectal Cancer Tumour Bank from 2000-2001, was screened for mutations using Dideoxy Fingerprinting (ddF) and sequencing. Sequence alterations were detected in 34% of tumours. Three different polymorphisms and three mutations were detected. One mutation could possibly affect the tumour suppressor function of Mxi1. The presence of a gene mutation did not correlate to any clinical characteristics and is therefore not a suitable diagnostic marker. Microsatellite instability (MSI) status however, significantly correlated with tumour grade.  Expression levels of MTSS1 and an associated gene, MTSS2, were examined in 16 BlCa cell lines, 9 clonally-derived BlCa sublines, and 30 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) collected by the Heinrich-Heine University from 1993-2000. Variable gene expression was observed in BlCa cell lines and tumour samples. No significant correlation of MTSS expression and invasive ability was observed for the cell lines or tumour samples. Further studies eliminated promoter methylation and p53 functional status as mechanisms involved in MTSS1 and MTSS2 down-regulation.  Functional studies performed on stable MTSS1-expressing BlCa lines found that although migration was increased, cells displayed reduced anchorage-independent growth. The invasive ability of these cells was unchanged confirming that expression does not correlate with invasive ability. These data support the role of MTSS1 as a tumour suppressor and not as a metastasis suppressor gene. Although MTSS1 may not be useful in predicting more invasive disease, its role as a tumour suppressor in cancer may be useful.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mxi1</field><field name="subject">Colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Bladder cancer</field><field name="subject">MIM</field><field name="subject">Tumour suppressor</field><field name="subject">Metastasis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of labour markets in countries in transition in South East Europe</field><field name="creator">Kecmanovic, Milica, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores several aspects of the labour market in Serbia and Croatia during the process of transition from socialism to a market economy. First, it examines how women??s position in the labour market has changed in Serbia. Using five annual Labour Force Surveys (2001-2005), I find that the gender wage gap is still very low in Serbia, and is even decreasing during this period. However, decompositions that apply the Oaxaca (1974) methodology reveal that the unexplained component of the gap is very large, and is increasing. Likewise, quantile decompositions suggest that while the raw gap is falling at each of the quantiles analysed, the unexplained component is increasing at most quantiles at the same time. Thus, the relatively small gap in earnings could be masking considerable discrimination in the labour market.  Second, changes in men??s wage inequality in Serbia in the period from 2001 to 2005 are analysed using five annual Labour Force Surveys. Changes in the distribution of earnings are examined using the Lemieux (2002) decomposition methodology. I find that the change in wage inequality is mostly driven by changes in wage premiums, while the effect of changes in the composition of the labour force is very small. Isolating the effect of the emerging private sector reveals that changes in the private sector size and wage premium account for an average 25 percent of the changes in inequality during this period. Third, the effect that the recent war in Croatia (1991-1995) had on the educational and employment trajectories of the 1971 birth cohort of men is investigated. This birth cohort was most affected by the armed forces draft. I treat the occurrence of the war as a natural experiment and use data from the Croatian and Slovenian Labour Force Surveys. Applying the difference-in-difference framework and comparing this cohort to adjacent cohorts, women, and to respective cohorts in Slovenia, a neighbouring country that did not experience war, I find that the war has had a negative effect on educational outcomes and a small positive effect on the employment and earnings outcomes of this cohort of men. &#8195;</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Veteran effect</field><field name="subject">Gender wage gap</field><field name="subject">Wage inequality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tragic sublime: libidinal pessimism and the problem of existence</field><field name="creator">Elbourne, Sean G., School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the attempt by Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche and Georges Bataille to confront the problem of the meaning and value of existence. I consider each of these philosophers as involved in the development of a stream of post-Kantian thought that, following Nick Land, I call libidinal pessimism. Libidinal pessimism is both the metaphysical principle of the primacy of willing as the fundamental reality, and the moral principle that the greatest value to our existence is to be found in liberating willing from the small-scale concern of the good of individual beings. Each sees a crisis in the dominance of optimism: the belief that willing is commensurate with the good of individuated beings. They attack the dominance of optimism not just in the history of philosophy, but also in the values that dominate the culture at large. My contention is that these thinkers were provoked to think about the meaning and value of existence by encountering the tragic sublime: a pleasure in the destruction of the happiness of the individual. This affective intensity provokes them to the realisation that our will is not directed towards the happiness of the individual, contra the dominant values of our culture. Yet since the tragic sublime is non-conceptual, its implications for the meaning and the value of existence are not explicit. The task of philosophy is to conceptualise this affective intensity to specify the inadequacy of the values that dominate the age, and to assert the values that can liberate human possibility from its current wretchedness to a new glory. To structure the thinking of these philosophers on the problem of existence, I analyse their thinking using the following logical model: 1) specifying what they regard as the predominant symptoms of the problem regarding existence, our current wretchedness; 2) their diagnosis of the source of this wretchedness in the dominant optimism; 3) their pronouncement of the solution to this problem, through liberating willing from the small-scale; and 4) their prescription for how to overcome this problem, for how the tragic sublime can liberate willing from the fetters of a concern for individuated beings. In elaborating upon the thinking of these philosophers as a definite stream of post- Kantian thought, I also highlight how each engages with the thinking of the earlier of the philosophers. I explore how Schopenhauer's philosophy develops out of Kant's philosophy, how Nietzsche develops the thinking of Schopenhauer and how Bataille develops the problematics of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Through this I attempt to explore how these three philosophers mark a development in the attempt to conceptualise the tragic sublime as the key to address the problem of the meaning and value of existence.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">Nietzsche</field><field name="subject">Schopenhauer</field><field name="subject">Bataille</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural integrity of carbon fibre/aluminium foam sandwich composites</field><field name="creator">Idris, Maizlinda Izwana, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on closed-cell aluminium foams (ALPORAS and ALULIGHT) and on sandwich panels comprising these foams laminated with 2/2 twill carbon fibre (MTM56/0300) skins. The thesis experimentally and analytically investigates the response of foam-only panels (ALPORAS) to indentation with various indenter sizes and shapes; and also studies the behaviour of sandwich panels to contact damage caused quasi-statically or by impact.  Quasi??static uniaxial compression testing is used to determine the mechanical properties of the foams (ALPORAS and ALULIGHT). It is revealed that the plastic collapse strength (&#963;* pl) obtained from the stress??strain curves is lower than the values predicted by the Gibson-Ashby theoretical model. This phenomenon is explained by the fact that the aluminium foams tested are imperfect, non-homogeneous and non-isotropic, and show a distinct cell elongation. Whereas, the Gibson-Ashby theoretical model was based on the finite element method applied to the response of a unit tetrakaidecahedral closed cell having flat faces.  The experimental work shows that the deformation of the foam-only panels to indentation is caused by progressive crushing of the cell bands and by shearing and tearing of the cell walls. This thesis presents new analytical models for the response of the foam-only panels and estimates the applied deformation load in all types of indentation. By fitting the experimental load-displacement curves, the shear strength (&#964;* pl) and the tear energy (&#947;) are deduced. Compared to the literature, more consistent results are obtained for the shear strength (&#964; * pl) and the tear energy (&#947;) from all types of indentation. It is also suggested to determine (&#964; * pl) and (&#947;) through indentations with long punches (FEP and LCP), instead of hemi-spherical or cylindrical indenters, because indentation on enclosed areas shows some indenter size dependence. It is concluded that thinner panels are not suitable for the determination of the tear energy (&#947;) since the densification of the foam is achieved before the tear resistance is fully engaged.  Another objective of this thesis is to study the response of sandwich panels comprising a closed??cell aluminium foam core and laminated with carbon fibre skin to quasi-static and impact local damage. Special attention is paid to the residual (remnant) strength in bending of the already indented sandwich panels (quasi-statically or by impact) up to the failure point. The remnant strength in bending is determined by carrying out four point bending strength tests. The local damage is located on either the compressive or on the tensile side of the sandwich panels. Thus, the capacity of the panels to resist transverse loads after they have been locally damaged at contact is investigated. The contact damage on the sandwich panels is experimentally simulated using spherical indenters. The quasi-static indentation is carried out at a low constant velocity (0.5mm/min) ?? the induced contact damage is found to be independent on the sample thickness but dependent on the indenter diameter. On the contrary, the impact test indicates velocity-dependence of the failure mode of the sandwich panel (i.e. skin breakage or punch through) which is found from the load-displacement curves. The results reveal that there is a correlation between the area of the contact damage and the remnant strength, and that the use of metal foam cores leads to high contact damage resilience of composite structures.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sandwich Composites</field><field name="subject">Aluminium Foam</field><field name="subject">Carbon Fibre</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond needs-based health funding: resource allocation and equity at the state and area health service levels in New South Wales - Australia</field><field name="creator">Kirigia, Doris Gatwiri, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Addressing inequities in health both within and between countries has attracted considerable global attention in recent years. In theory, equity remains one of the key policy objectives of health systems and underpins the allocation of health sector resources in many countries. In practice, however, current evidence demonstrates that only limited progress has been made in terms of bridging the health inequity gap and improving the health of the least advantaged. The persistence of inequities in health and health outcomes raises concerns about how governments and health authorities distribute limited health resources to improve the health of the poor and most vulnerable and thereby promote equity. This thesis is about equity and allocation of financial resources in the health system of New South Wales, one of the eight states of Australia. It investigated the extent to which there has been a movement towards equity in resource allocation to Area Health Services under the NSW Health Resource Distribution Formula and whether this has been reflected in equitable resource allocation within Area Health Services. It considered only resources allocated through the NSW Department of Health. The study employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to gather and analyse data. The qualitative component analysed data gathered through semi&#150;structured interviews with policy makers, health executives, managers, and other stakeholders to establish the resource allocation processes and the factors upon which the allocation decisions were based. The quantitative component analysed health expenditure and health needs data to assess the extent to which allocation of resources from the State to Area Health Service levels has been equitable in terms of reflecting the level of health needs. Two indices were constructed and used as proxies for health needs. Principal component analysis was used in the construction of one of the indices, using demographic, socio&#150;economic and health-related data. The other index was developed using a combination of premature mortality and morbidity data. The quantitative study spans the two decades 1989/90 to 2006/07, with a more detailed analysis of material for the years 2003/04 to 2006/07. The findings of the study show a considerable degree of inequity in resource allocation with several Area Health Services (AHSs) receiving less than a fair share of funding for the years analysed, although some movements towards equity were evident. This contradicts the general impression that the introduction of the resource distribution formula in NSW has significantly improved equity in resource allocation. In general, funding allocation at the State level correlated significantly with population size but not with health needs of the eight AHSs in NSW. Similarly, within the AHSs, allocation of funds was based on programs and services and not on health needs. Key issues that emerged from the qualitative data as affecting the equity with which health funds are allocated in the NSW health system include limited use of the resource distribution formula at the state level, lack of an effective resource allocation tool to guide the distribution of funds within AHSs, and insufficient emphasis on equity at the AHS level. It is crucial that these and several other issues identifies in the study are addressed if current inequities in funding and in health outcomes generally are to be effectively reduced.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disadvantaged population groups</field><field name="subject">Resource Allocation</field><field name="subject">Equity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the ignition and deflagration mechanisms relating to the testing of permitted explosives with reference to British health and safety executive???s TM2</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Alison , Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In an effort to provide the underground coal mining industry with an understanding of what governs if an explosive is classed as permitted, a preliminary research project was undertaken to investigate the scientific basis of the British Health and Safety Executives Testing Memorandum#2 (TM2). Previous literature indicates that the TM2 standard is empirical and based on comparative testing of the explosive in use at the time, nitroglycerine. Eighty Type I tests were carried out and preliminary findings were that the mechanism that causes ignition is a reflected shockwave which compresses and reheats detonation products. The origin of the reflected pressure wave changed when the primer position was altered within the cannon. With a pressure transducer and pyrometer mounted on the side of the gallery the measurements aided in identifying those maximum pressures and temperatures prior to ignition that are collectively a set of parameters that could be used to identify if an explosive would cause an ignition in the gallery. Additionally numerical modelling was employed to characterise pressure, temperature and velocity profiles within the gallery for blown out and cut off shots. Whilst the pressure and temperature results predicted by the CFD model were 1.5 to 3 times the magnitude of those measured in the field, the modelling results exhibited the behaviour of the shockwaves reflecting off the gallery walls, rebounding, gaining intensity and travelling back towards the centre axis of the gallery. This predicted behaviour reinforced the belief that re-heating of detonation gases by reflected shockwaves is the prime ignition mechanism of the Type I TM2 tests. One hundred and eight deflagration tests were conducted in the Type II cannon. The main finding was that the longer a receptor is subjected to elevated pressures due to confinement the higher the probability of deflagration. Additionally emulsion explosives were found to detonate in the cannon rather than deflagrate raising the question, ???if the explosive is consumed instantaneously, then isn???t the risk of deflagration occurring eliminated???? In reading this thesis it must be noted that all findings are preliminary and many more tests are required to confirm trends and behaviours observed in the testing to date.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Permitted</field><field name="subject">Explosives</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I don???t mind being a diabetic but not every day!: learning to live with a chronic condition</field><field name="creator">Demirkol, Abdullah, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chronic conditions and their management have become a major global public health problem which poses a serious challenge for both health care systems and affected individuals. Type 2 diabetes is one such condition affecting almost 200 million people around the world, a number that is expected to double by 2020. As with most chronic conditions its management requires significant and permanent changes in people???s daily life practices as well as a strict medication regimen. Recent research demonstrates that it is possible to control the complications of diabetes, and even to prevent its development in predisposed individuals by following recommended treatments. Yet studies show that only 2% of people living with diabetes heed their treating team???s advice. This signals a serious discordance between scientifically generated information and its place in the daily lives of people living with diabetes. This study sought to discover how to change the factors that prevent people with type 2 diabetes from following their recommended treatments. Firstly a participant observation process in four diabetes education centres was used to define the characteristics of the context in which people with diabetes and their treating teams interacted. This was followed by a nine-month participatory action process in two of the four centres in which participants defined the problematic areas in the management of their diabetes and devised plans to tackle these problems. They then attempted to implement these plans while exploring how and why their plans did or did not work. The findings indicate that the decision to follow recommended treatments is far from being a matter of individual choice. Rather it is heavily influenced by a complex interaction of numerous factors that people with diabetes have limited power to change. This study reveals that the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes could be enhanced where operational and practical knowledge about the condition is provided to people living with the disorder by health care providers responsive to patients??? perspectives, and where patients, providers and policy-makers recognise that health is a resource constructed in the wider social context, whose every element needs to be harnessed in encouraging people to make healthier life decisions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interaction between N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma</field><field name="creator">Whittall, Christine, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant pathogen of immunocompromised individuals, and the main mechanism by which it mediates virulence is through the coordination of gene expression by an intricate quorum sensing system. One of the signalling molecules of this system, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) has been shown to have immunomodulatory capabilities, discrete to its quorum sensing role.  While the general focus of research in this area is on the physiological outcomes of this interaction on cell function, there is currently little concrete evidence identifying the receptor(s) for OdDHL in mammalian cells, and hence the biochemical mechanism behind the immunomodulation caused by OdDHL remains largely unknown. This study identifies peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947; (PPAR&#947;) as a mammalian target for OdDHL. PPAR&#947; is a mammalian transcription factor involved in fatty acid metabolism and is heavily involved in the inflammatory response, being a negative regulator of inflammation.  It is shown here that OdDHL is able to instigate signalling through PPAR&#947; by activation of the ligand binding domain (LBD), suggesting that OdDHL may act as a PPAR&#947; agonist. OdDHL is able to compete with the PPAR&#947; agonist, rosiglitazone, causing a relative antagonism of PPAR&#947; activity when given in tandem with the agonist. The bacterial signalling molecule is unable to displace the irreversible PPAR&#947; antagonist GW9662. This effect on PPAR&#947; is specific to OdDHL, as the smaller P. aeruginosa signalling molecule, N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone had no significant effect on PPAR&#947; activation.  In order to confirm PPAR&#947; as a putative receptor for OdDHL in mammalian cells, initial experiments were undertaken to optimise conditions to produce PPAR&#947; LBD protein for binding interaction studies. The fidelity of the protein sequence was established and expression of the protein in an appropriate vector was confirmed. The protein produced was insoluble and hence not functional for binding studies, suggesting that additional optimisation of expression conditions, or manipulation and refolding of the protein is necessary before further experimentation can take place.  The identification of PPAR&#947; as a receptor for OdDHL in mammalian cells is an important step in understanding the nature and scope of the interaction between OdDHL and host cell physiology, especially the significance of this interaction during P. aeruginosa infection. Continuation of this research, in particular completion of protein-ligand binding studies between OdDHL and PPAR&#947; has the potential to clarify the significance of the immunomodulation caused by OdDHL, while providing us with a platform from which we may exploit it.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunomodulation</field><field name="subject">OdDHL</field><field name="subject">PPAR</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Highly efficient multimetallic catalysts for sequential reactions</field><field name="creator">Ho, Joanne Hui Hui, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes investigations into metal-catalysed sequential reactions using both single metal and bimetallic Rh(l) and Ir(l) complexes containing N-donor ligands as catalysts. Two types of bimetallic catalyst systems were developed including the combined use of single metal complexes and bimetallic complexes. All catalyst systems were highly effective for catalysing the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds using sequential reactions.  The complexes [M(bpm)(CO)2]BArf4, (M =Rh, Ir: bpm =bis(1-pyrazolyl)methane; Barf4, =tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate) were found to be highly efficient for the dihydroalkoxylation reaction forming spirokelals and fused bicyclic acetals. The catalysed dihydroalkoxylation reactions for a series of alkynediols showed that the Rh(l) complex favours the formation of 6-membered spiroketals while the Ir(l) complex favours the formation of 5-membered O-rings. A dual metal (Rh(l) and Ir(1)) catalyst system was used here for the first time to promote the formation of mixed 5,6- and 6,5-spiroketals and was found to be a more effective catalyst system than the individual single metal complexes.  A new bitopic ligand [1,8-bis(bis(1-pyrazolyl)methyl)anthracene] was synthesised. A series of homobimetallic complexes [M2(COD)2(L)][ BArf4]2 and [M2(CO)4.(L)][ BArf4]2 (M = Rh, Ir) each containing two bis(1-pyrazolyl)methane motifs bridged by one of three well-defined rigid aromatic scaffolds, where L is m-C6H4[CH(pz)2]2 (Lm), p-C6H4[CH(pz)2]2 (L,) and anthracene-dibpm (LAnt), were synthesised. The solid-slate structures of the three sets of homobimetallic complexes showed very different spatial relationships between the ligand pairs in each.  For the catalysed dihydroalkoxylation reaction, the homobimetallic complexes are more active catalysts than the single metal complexes. The order of catalytic activity of the bimetallic complexes was found to be M2(LAnt)&gt;M2(Lm)&gt;M2(Lp). This order of activity can be attributed to the degree of bimetallic cooperativity, where the anthracene-linked complexes achieve the greatest level of cooperativity in solution and the two metal centers of the anthracene system are closest together in space. For the catalysed tandem hydroamination/hydrosilation of 4-phenyl-3-butyn-1-amine with silanes, a combination of the dirhodium and diiridium complexes was found to be a more efficient catalyst than the single metal complexes.  A series of chiral ligands and their complexes were synthesised and tested for the catalysed asymmetric dihydroalkoxylation reaction but showed no significant stereoselectivity in the products formed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an enterprise knowledge base (EKB) framework for new product development (NPD) in customer order driven engineering (CODE) environment</field><field name="creator">Sharif, Syed Ahsan, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is widely believed that with the transition from the industrial to information-based economics, organizational knowledge has emerged as the single most critical resource at both macro and micro levels, which promotes the creation, sharing, and leveraging of the organization???s knowledge in current Customer Order Driven Engineering (CODE) environment. Insufficient knowledge management, hence lack of a structured Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) in a CODE environment, whilst involved in New Product Development (NPD) process may result in several problems resulting in creating less successful products. This research establishes an ???Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) framework??? with focus on the Product, Process and Organizational issues related to the NPD process. The framework has three major stages, namely ???Knowledge Acquisition???, ???Knowledge Organizing??? and ???Knowledge Validating???. Various frameworks/methods/models are developed as steps for each of these stages. The framework may increase the effectiveness of product and process development as well as enterprise competitiveness through developing a system architecture to understand, analyse and map organisational, operational activities and business objectives; and increasing the ability of an organisation to establish an integrated partnerships to share efforts on the design, manufacture and delivery of products. In knowledge acquisition stage, a ???Knowledge Capture framework??? and the ???Relationship matrices??? are developed to analyse and link the generic knowledge items of a NPD process in concurrent engineering environment. Among the relationship matrices, Task versus Task (Design Structure Matrix - DSM) matrix is comprehensively explored and decomposed to structure and link several processes at different levels for effective representation of the overall enterprise representation. In knowledge organizing stage, the acquired knowledge (important relations identified in the Task versus Task matrices) is represented in the form of ???Questionnaires???. Best practices gathered from several manufacturing firms in NPD in CODE have also been  used as knowledge resource base for the Questionnaires. For grouping and validation of these Questionnaires, an ???Assessment Model??? is developed, which consists of five performance indicators of the organization namely ???Marketing???, ???Technical???, ???Financial???, ???Resource Management???, and ???Project Management???. Industry applications are carried out in two Australian Manufacturing Companies for the validation of the acquired knowledge. Two tests are carried out; in order to assess the sensitivity of question categories followed by another test to observe whether the model can accurately display the overall performance of the company in the five categories of NPD phases. These two tests have identified possible improvement areas in the NPD process of manufacturing organizations involved in the validation phase. Up to 80% of the findings of the EKB framework and assessment model were found to reflect the actual practices of the organizations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">New products - Management</field><field name="subject">Product management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Nation of Sadness? Reading history, culture, and gender in Hou Hsiao-hsien???s A City of Sadness</field><field name="creator">Hung, Christine Yu-Ting, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis engages with Taiwanese history by offering a reading of Hou Hsiaohsien???s A City of Sadness (1989), making reference to the film???s historical dimensions, cultural representations and gender issues in the period 1945 to 1949. In addition, Hou???s cinematography is detailed with comparison to Yasujiro Ozu and the influences of Japanese colonisation. Hou???s immense contribution to Taiwanese film consists principally in a Taiwanese trilogy that traces Taiwan???s history in the 20th century. In The Puppet Master (1993) Hou details the era of Japanese colonisation from 1895 to the restoration of Taiwan by the Kuomintang in 1945. Later, A City of Sadness focuses on the fate of the Lin family from 1945 to 1949, which epitomises people???s life in Taiwan during the initial stages of Kuomintang domination. Finally, Good Men, Good Women (1995) highlights two different eras in Taiwan: the political movement in the 1950s and the pop culture in the 1990s. The thesis uses illustrations from all three films to explore Hou???s historical, cultural and gender representations. In order to understand Hou???s ideology and beliefs in greater depth, I also review his autobiographical film, A Time to Live, and A Time to Die (1985). This thesis examines Taiwan???s indigenous culture and the impact of Japanese and Chinese cultural practices in A City of Sadness through the post-colonial theories of Perry Anderson, Homi Bhabha, and Chris Berry. I draw on their theories of cultural hegemony and my empiricism to investigate Hou???s representation of the political situation in Taiwan. Finally, the thesis evaluates gender issues in A City of Sadness, with reference to Julia Kristeva???s notion of ???feminine time??? and the debate between Emilie Yeh and Mizou concerning ???whether women can really enter history???.

The first-generation legislation (s 88K, Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) and s 180, Property Law Act 1974 (Qld)) permits the creation of easements over servient land to facilitate the development of dominant land.  The second-generation legislation (the Access to Neighbouring Land Act of New South Wales, Tasmania and the United Kingdom) permits the creation of temporary rights of access over servient land to facilitate work on dominant land.  This thesis examines the extent to which this change in the law can be justified by three modes of ethical discourse: right-based, duty-based, and goal-based reasoning.  An examination of the first-generation legislation and the cases in which it has been applied suggests that a form of goal-based reasoning can be used to justify its enactment.  The legislation is needed to facilitate the efficient use of land where the existence of a bilateral monopoly and the possibility of strategic bargaining puts at risk the conclusion of a mutually beneficial agreement regarding access.  A review of the second-generation legislation and the law reform reports and parliamentary debate that preceded its enactment indicates that the legislation can be justified by a form of duty-based reasoning.  The legislation is needed to bring about a proper social ordering by imposing access rights where this would be consistent with the ideal of good neighbourliness.  The thesis concludes that although these goal-based and duty-based discourses make an arguable case for the enactment of both generations of the legislation, neither of them, in an unadulterated form, provides a conclusive justification.  Rather, an eclectic approach that draws on both discourses is required.  It proposes that the legislation???s compensation provisions be amended to reflect the commingling of the ideas of efficiency, a properly ordered society and intensive land use, and to allow the servient owner to share in the benefits generated by the imposition of access.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land tenure -- Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Land use -- Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Right of property</field><field name="subject">Law -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Law -- Interpretation and construction</field><field name="subject">Law -- Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Jurisprudence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The shell mounds of Albatross Bay: an archaeological investigation of late Holocene production strategies near Weipa, north eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of an archaeological investigation of shell matrix sites, and in particular, shell mounds sites that occur around the shores of Albatross Bay, near Weipa on the north western Cape York Peninsula, northern Australia. It is the contention of this thesis that earlier approaches to the investigation of shell mound sites in northern Australia have tended to place too much emphasis on developing long-term explanatory models that gloss over explanations for the specific roles of these unique sites in past economic systems. While long-term explanations represent important contributions, it is argued here that short-term decadal scale modelling of the production systems associated with shell mound formation and use are required in order to fully understand the significance of the mid- to late Holocene emergence of these types of sites. A focus on production &#150; defined in a substantive economic sense &#150; is a suitable avenue through which archaeologists can expand our understanding of the role of these features in past gatherer-hunter societies, and their broader importance on longer-term time scales

The thesis thus develops a detailed model of the production strategies associated with the formation of shell mound sites that occur around Albatross Bay, while also considering the broader significance of this model, particularly within the context of Cape York Peninsula. It presents the results of field surveys and excavations carried out around Albatross Bay by the author, as well as a detailed review and analysis of work carried out by others. It is argued that shell mounds are the result of relatively specialised production activities focussing on a very specific resource base: mudflat shellfish species. Shell mounds offered a range of unique benefits for people engaged in these specialised activities, including as camp sites and as specialised activity areas. These events were inherently flexible in size and in terms of timing, reflecting the dynamic nature of the resource base itself; yet the flexible nature of this production strategy also enabled more regular small scale social gatherings, along with a range of social and economic benefits to participants, than would have been otherwise possible.  It is proposed that these types of strategies may represent an important characteristic of the production systems employed by gatherer-hunter peoples in late Holocene Cape York. 

Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to both our understanding of late Holocene lifeways at Albatross Bay as well as to our understanding of the broader significance of the emergence of shell mound sites in Cape York. Furthermore, it highlights the range of insights that can come from a focus on short-term modelling of gatherer-hunter lifeways alongside approaches oriented toward longer-term explanations of economic, social and environmental change.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">shell mounds</field><field name="subject">shellfish</field><field name="subject">production</field><field name="subject">Weipa</field><field name="subject">Albatross Bay</field><field name="subject">northern Australia</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100602.095058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

The emerging greener ultrasound technology has the potential to serve the remediation industry. In this study, the use of low power, high frequency (HF) ultrasound (1.6 MHz, 145 W/L) has been shown to effectively remediate DDT (90% of 8 mg/L) in water and sand slurries. Addition of iron powder accelerated DDT degradation in the sand slurry under ultrasonication. The potential of HF ultrasound (1.6 MHz, 160 W/L) in degradation of the non-volatile, polar model compound methylene blue (MB) was studied in MB spiked demineralised water and wastewater. A 70 % of 0.4 mg/L of MB was degraded in demineralised water whereas only 54% of MB degraded in MB spiked wastewater. There was a decrease in MB degradation rate with an increase in MB concentration. High power, low frequency (LF) ultrasound (20 kHz, 932 W/L) was used to desorb 400 mg/L of DDT added to three different natural soil slurries at 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt. % each. Each soil slurry was prepared in 0.1% v/v SDS surfactant solution, soaked for 30 min. and heated for another 30 min. at 40 oC before sonication. For the neutral pH soil slurry with higher dissolved organic carbon, the desorption efficiency achieved was over 80% in 30 s sonication. Alkaline soil with higher surface area than neutral soil indicated 60% desorption efficiency while the acidic soil, with the highest surface area and a higher amount of non-soluble organic matter, yielded 30% desorption efficiency under similar desorption conditions. Coconut fibre, used to biosorb the desorbed DDT in the decanted solution, was found to have over 25 g/kg of biosorption capacity for DDT. The surfactant SDS and associated DDT were completely separated from decanted liquid of the desorbed slurry with alum using adsorptive micellar flocculation in 60 min. settling. Acidic pH and molar concentration ratio of Al3+/SDS = 0.5 was used to completely remove the DDT. Using 20 kHz, 1125 W/L of sonication in an 80 mL reactor with air saturated 50 mg/L DDT at 20oC, the DDT removal efficiency achieved was 80% in 20 min. With zero valent iron addition, DDT removal efficiency in 15 min. is 100% with 15 and 22 mg/L of initial DDT concentrations. The settled DDT slurrywas remediated using 20 kHz at 240 W/L achieving DDT removal efficiency of 87% in 15 min. Also LF ultrasound was found to be effective in remediating chloroform (8 mg/L in 60 min) from spiked demineralised water and contaminated groundwater in both batch (120 W/L) and flow cell (6000 W/L) modes. Modeling and simulation of the ultrasonic reactor under 20 kHz ultrasonication was performed for various shape reactors using commercially available software. For almost all reactors, the highest ultrasonic intensity was observed near the transducer???s vibrating area. It was found that the highest acoustic pressure distribution, which is critical to the performance of the reactor, occurred in the conical reactor and flow cell configuration.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organic water pollutants</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Water quality management</field><field name="subject">Pollution control equipment</field><field name="subject">250399 Organic Chemistry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">291104 Environmental Technologies</field><field name="subject">ultrasound</field><field name="subject">persistent organic</field><field name="subject">DDT</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/93186</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paying for sustainable natural resources management : the role of levies</field><field name="creator">Wu, Zhifang</field><field name="description">Sustainable development is the modern rhetoric to guide environmental or natural resources management. There are many ways to do this and one concern the wider utilization of economic instruments, such as taxes or levies. Although such levies are becoming common in Australia and worldwide, the role of the taxes or levies is still limited. In many cases, these taxes/levies -although environmentally related- have a fiscal rather than a purely environmental motive, for example, the Natural Resources Management (NRM) Levy in South Australia. In South Australia, under the NRM Act 2004, all property owners are required to pay the NRM levy. Local governments collect the levy and distribute it to the relevant NRM board. The NRM boards have selected to calculate the levy on the basis of property value or simply applied a flat rate. The percentage of property value or the amount of the flat rate can vary amongst local government areas. How a tax or levy is designed should be determined by its ultimate purpose. Taxes or levies for fiscal and/or redistributive reasons should be designed in a way securing stable inflow of revenues, such as, levying on the values of property. However, this approach is often in sharp contrast with the goal of environmental taxes or levies which aim to change resource consumption behaviour. This study evaluates the NRM levy policy in South Australia using one NRM region and focussing on the urban community. The justification of this research is that few analyses of the effectiveness of environmental taxes or levies have ever been carried out, although the implementation of these measures has increased significantly during the last decades. There are fewer studies analysing the impacts of the tax or levy base method. This is the first study on this NRM levy policy from the perspective of the urban community who actually pay it. This study employed the Theory of Reasoned Action (Ajzen &amp; Fishbein 1980) to examine the relationships between community attitudes to the levy policy and water consumption behaviour. Data was collected through a web-based survey with 770 respondents who answered 59 questions. The key findings show that governments are perceived to have the main responsibility for water resources management by respondents. However, there is huge information void towards the NRM levy policy. Community has few complaints about the levy level but strongly prefers to have a levy calculated on the volume of water consumed. Respondents also indicated that they would use less water if the levy were calculated on the volume of water consumed. The study makes contributions to relevant theory and policy analysis. Theoretically, the results show that the theory of reasoned action has limited strength in explaining the present research context. Practically, the study provides recommendations for policymakers and practitioners in South Australia, other Australian States, and internationally. The clear implications of the results suggest that if a tax or levy aims to change water consumption behaviour then it should be based on the volume of water consumed not on property value.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural resources</field><field name="subject">Water supply</field><field name="subject">300903 Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">360201 Public Policy</field><field name="subject">370102 Social Policy and Planning</field><field name="subject">water resource management</field><field name="subject">levy</field><field name="subject">natural resource management</field><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="subject">300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/93170</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-agent decision support system in avionics : improving maintenance and reliability predictions in an intelligent environment</field><field name="creator">Haider, Kamal</field><field name="description">Safety of the airborne platforms rests heavily on the way they are maintained. This maintenance includes repairs and testing, to reduce platform down time. Maintenance is performed using generic and specific test equipment within the existing maintenance management system (MMS). This thesis reports the work undertaken to improve maintainability and availability of avionics systems using an intelligent decision support system (IDSS). In order to understand the shortcomings of the existing system, the prevalent practices and methodologies are researched. This research thesis reports the development and implementation of an IDSS and the significant improvements made by this IDSS by integrating autonomous and independent information sources by employing a multi-agent system (MAS). Data mining techniques and intelligence agents (IA) are employed to create an expert system. The developed IDSS successfully demonstrates its ability to integrate and collate the available information and convert into valuable knowledge. Using this knowledge, the IDSS is able to generate interpreted alerts, warnings and recommendations thereby reasonably improving platform maintainability and availability. All facets of integrated logistics support (ILS) are considered to create a holistic picture. As the system ages, the IDSS also matures to assist managers and maintainers in making informed decisions about the platform, the unit under test (UUT) and even the environment that supports the platform.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiagent systems</field><field name="subject">Avionics</field><field name="subject">280109 Decision Support and Group Support Systems</field><field name="subject">280201 Expert Systems</field><field name="subject">280213 Other Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">290903 Other Electronic Engineering</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">multi-agent systems</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">integrated logistics support</field><field name="subject">maintainability</field><field name="subject">availability</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/93158</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45888</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preterm birth has impact on the long term health of two generations</field><field name="creator">Abraham, Sarah</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until June 2011, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biotic and physical forces as determinants of Ad&#233;lie penguin population location and size</field><field name="creator">Ballard, Grant</field><field name="description">Ad&#233;lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are among the most thoroughly studied wild animals, which is remarkable considering they are sea-ice obligates, living only in the Antarctic, one of the most remote regions on Earth. Building on several decades of research on the Ross and Beaufort Island metapopulation, I have focused on understanding the underlying mechanisms related to colony size and growth patterns. I have found that life for a penguin at a large colony is extremely competitive, and that the ultimate size of these colonies is determined by the trade-off between the needs of parents and chicks, with penguins at large colonies approaching an energetic limit not reached at smaller colonies. However, some individuals are consistently able to utilize the available resources within these limits more efficiently than others by diving more deeply and recovering more quickly, especially when environmental conditions are less favorable. It is likely that these individuals thereby exhibit increased fitness in terms of their genetic contribution to the population. At smaller colonies, this kind of advantage does not necessarily translate to increased fitness, since there appear to be ample resources for all, or for none, depending more closely on simple yet extreme physical environmental stochasticity. Finally, in the larger context of Ad&#233;lie penguin life-history throughout the annual cycle, they are confronting large scale changes in their environment that have been occurring for millennia, but which are currently in an unusual state of flux. Ultimately a lack of sufficient daylight overlapping the region of sea ice that is accessible to them during the inter-breeding period may constrain their populations.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontogeny and ecology of snapper (Pagrus auratus) in an estuary, the Mahurangi Harbour</field><field name="creator">Usmar, Natalie R.</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the use of an estuary by the sparid Pagrus auratus, commonly known as snapper. The density and distribution of snapper (juveniles through to adults) was quantified over multiple spatial and temporal scales and associated with habitat. Juveniles enter or are spawned within the Mahurangi Harbour over the warmer months, with densities highest in March. Ontogenetic shifts in fine-scale habitat occurred. Fine-scale analysis from the beam trawl showed juvenile snapper (&lt; 10 cm) were mostly associated with horse mussels. Larger juveniles (&gt; 4 cm) were also associated with bare areas. The 0+ fish (from the DUV) occupied fine-scale habitat comprised of muddy to sand substrata with structure of sponges and horse mussels with and without epifauna. The remaining year-classes occupied a coarser substratum, with shell hash the major secondary structure. An artificial reef experiment showed juvenile snapper were attracted to artificial horse mussels with and without epifauna rather than bare areas or controls. The 1+ year-class increased their habitat range, occupying areas with more uniform substrata. A growth shift through to the 2+ year-class was not observed, and this may be due to increasing mortality, (natural or predation), or emigration out of the harbour. Densities of the larger year-classes decreased over the cooler months but not all snapper leave permanently, with tagging showing up to 80% of fish to be resident. Ontogenetic shifts occurred in diet with growth. Juveniles &lt; 2 cm consumed planktonic copepods, with &gt; 2 cm consuming benthic copepods, mysid and caridean shrimps and polychaetes. Snapper &gt; 10 cm consumed brachyuran crabs, caridean shrimps, bivalves, polychaetes and hermit crabs, with &gt; 30 cm fish able to consume harder shelled molluscs and bivalves. The a priori habitats were equally productive in terms of prey, and this may be advantageous for juveniles who can then select a habitat for other qualities, i.e. protection from predation. Despite the potential of snapper to utilise any sort of structure as cover or for rest, most structure within the Mahurangi are biogenic and susceptible to anthropogenic effects, especially sedimentation. The loss or decline of these biogenic species may therefore have a significant impact on the way snapper utilise the Mahurangi. Overall, understanding the ontogeny of snapper within estuaries will contribute to better management strategies for snapper in general.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fisheries' trinity: re-conceptualising New Zealand's inshore fisheries management</field><field name="creator">Walshe, Kim A. R.</field><field name="description">This thesis is the culmination of 35 years of fisheries management experience shaped by reflections  and academic study.  While New Zealand is often positioned as an acclaimed success with the development and  application of the Quota Management System, this thesis outlines some of the serious flaws that  underpin current trajectories. Tensions have been created by the Ministry of Fisheries focusing  almost exclusively on developing solutions for New Zealand's fisheries policy and management  problems through the commercial sector management regime. The 'command and control' management approach sits uneasily with the 'rights-based' management regime in the commercial  fishery and the common property resource management regime in the customary Maori fishery.This study attempts to identify how the management of New Zealand inshore fisheries could be  improved by using an integrated approach -  a trinity of fisheries (institutions, rights, and  governance) to manage all three sectors (commercial, recreational and customary Maori).  The international literature provides a narrow view of fisheries policy and management in New  Zealand and the discussion is strongly oriented around a limited range of issues - particularly  commercial fisheries and a 'rights-based' approach. Drawing on a depth of experience in both  central policy development and fisheries management (particularly in the Auckland Fisheries  Management Area), four arguments are identified:  Firstly, that New Zealand's fisheries management policies for both commercial and non-commercial  fisheries management have been largely based on the commercial fishery. Secondly, that the international literature is heavily skewed towards issues and events in the  commercial fishery without adequate recognition of the non-commercial (customary Maori and  recreational) fisheries.  Thirdly, that the three fisheries in the inshore waters cannot be managed effectively unless the  management of all sectors is integrated under a common policy and management framework.  And finally, that the 'rights-based' focus is faltering because of inadequate and inappropriate  institutions and governance.  The trajectories of the three inshore wild harvest sectors (commercial, recreational, and customary  Maori) are explored, with a particular interest on how they influence and impact on each other. The  primary focus of the analysis is the role that institutions, rights and governance play on the  management and development of the three sectors.  The thesis concludes with a chapter on the current positioning of institutions, rights, and  governance within a three-sector trajectory and suggests tentative principles which could be used in  New Zealand's inshore wild stock fisheries to build an integrated policy and management. It  concludes that New Zealand's inshore fishery requires a re-conceptualisation to a governance  approach, based on ecosystem management. A common management approach across all sectors of  fisheries can be achieved by incorporating a wider institutional framework than a rights-based  approach and moving beyond a focus on harvesting alone.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Least-squares optimal interpolation for direct image super-resolution : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gilman, Andrew</field><field name="description">Image super-resolution aims to produce a higher resolution representation of a scene from an ensemble of low-resolution images that may be warped, aliased, blurred and degraded by noise. There are a variety of methods for performing super-resolution described in the literature, and in general they consist of three major steps: image registration, fusion and deblurring. This thesis proposes a novel method of performing the first two of these steps. The ultimate aim of image super-resolution is to produce a higher-quality image that is visually clearer, sharper and contains more detail than the individual input images. Machine algorithms can not assess images qualitatively and typically use a quantitative error criterion, often least-squares. This thesis aims to optimise leastsquares directly using a fast method, in particular one that can be implemented using linear filters; hence, a closed-form solution is required. The concepts of optimal interpolation and resampling are derived and demonstrated in practice. Optimal filters optimised on one image are shown to perform nearoptimally on other images, suggesting that common image features, such as stepedges, can be used to optimise a near-optimal filter without requiring the knowledge of the ground-truth output. This leads to the construction of a pulse model, which is used to derive filters for resampling non-uniformly sampled images that result from the fusion of registered input images. An experimental comparison shows that a 10th order pulse model-based filter outperforms a number of methods common in the literature. The use of optimal interpolation for image registration linearises an otherwise nonlinear problem, resulting in a direct solution. Experimental analysis is used to show that optimal interpolation-based registration outperforms a number of existing methods, both iterative and direct, at a range of noise levels and for both heavily aliased images and images with a limited degree of aliasing. The proposed method offers flexibility in terms of the size of the region of support, offering a good trade-off in terms of computational complexity and accuracy of registration. Together, optimal interpolation-based registration and fusion are shown to perform fast, direct and effective super-resolution.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image resolution</field><field name="subject">optimal filters</field><field name="subject">optimal interpolation</field><field name="subject">image registration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software::291601 Arithmetic and logic structures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of migration on development in Tuvalu : a case study of PAC migrants and their families : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simati, Sunema Pie</field><field name="description">International migration and development have been traditionally treated as separate policy portfolios; however, today the two are increasingly viewed as interlinked. While the development status of a country could determine migration flows, migration can, in turn, contribute positively to national development, including economic, social and cultural progress. Consequently, if migration is not well managed, it can pose development challenges to a country&#8217;s development and progress. Therefore, partnership through greater networking between countries of origin and destination is needed to fully utilise the development potential of migration. For Tuvalu, migration has remained a vital ingredient for economic development and more importantly, the welfare of its people. The implementation of New Zealand&#8217;s Pacific Access Category (PAC) scheme in 2002 offered for the first time a formal migration opportunity for permanent or long-term migration of Tuvaluans. The PAC scheme allows 75 Tuvaluans per year to apply for permanent residence to work and live in New Zealand, provided they meet the scheme&#8217;s conditions. The goal of this research is to investigate, more than five years after PAC&#8217;s implementation, the ways in which long-term migration of Tuvaluans, through the PAC scheme, has benefited Tuvalu. To give a broader perspective on the issues explored in this study, the views of Tuvaluan leaders, as significant players in traditional Tuvaluan society, are included, in addition to the perspective of migrants&#8217; families in Tuvalu and the migrants themselves in New Zealand. Combining transnationalist and developmental approaches as a theoretical framework, this thesis explores how Tuvalu&#8217;s mobile and immobile populations, through articulation of transnationalism, enhance family welfare, and grassroots and national development. The eight weeks&#8217; fieldwork in Tuvalu and Auckland demonstrated that the physical separation of Tuvaluans from one another through migration does not limit the richness of the interactions and connections between them. In fact, the existence of active networking between island community groups and other Tuvaluan associations in Auckland and in Tuvalu strengthens the Tuvaluan culture both abroad and at home, thus ensuring strong family and community coherence. Maintaining transnational networks and practices is identified as of great significance to grassroots and community-based development in Tuvalu. However, the benefits of long-term migration can only be sustained as long as island loyalty, or loto fenua, and family kinship stays intact across borders, and networking amongst families, communities and church remains active.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Tuvalu</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of BCG vaccine strain on the immune response and protection against tuberculosis</field><field name="creator">Ritz, Nicole</field><field name="description">More than 100 million doses of Bacille-Calmette-Gu&#233;rin (BCG) vaccine are given each year to protect infants against tuberculosis (TB).

Even more rare are in-depth empirical studies of the contribution of the financial sector to the real sector in developing countries. In an attempt to fill this gap in the literature on finance and development, an empirical study on the role and realities of bank operations in the economic growth of Malaysia was undertaken. Malaysia was selected since it is one of the few developing countries to achieve rapid economic growth and it was interesting to explore the impact of banks on such a growth.In short, the primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the significance of finance (banks) to economic growth in Malaysia. To accomplish this objective the following analyses were undertaken:(i) examination of the relationship between functions and operations of banks and on the other hand, and the growth of the financial and real assets of the country on the other (on a macro-level);(ii) collection of information on the impact of banks, as perceived by the public (on a micro-level via surveys, interviews and case studies);(iii) an investigation of the effects of the growth in banking on the informal credit market (moneylenders, pawnbrokers, tontine operators - through interviews).The findings generally indicated that the banks have been essential to the economic growth of Malaysia. Although the econometric analysis failed to conclusively link finance to economic growth, the micro-level analysis pointed to the important contribution that banks made to the business sector. The surveys, interviews and case studies brought out the realities of bank operations in Malaysia. Relevant recommendations were made as a consequence of these original and significant findings. The recommendations should be useful while formulating policies to enhance the contribution of banks to economic growth in Malaysia.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out of order: explorations in digital materiality</field><field name="creator">Ballard, Susan Patricia, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Digital art installation is the result of informatic materials entering gallery spaces and challenging the establishment of media forms. This thesis contends that the open, recursive and recombinatory process of looking at digital installation is in fact the result of noisy relations between information and the spatial temporal contexts of the art gallery. In order to focus on the processes of informatic materials within gallery spaces, this thesis identifies four key modulations of noise and materiality ? emergence, feedback, entropy and delay. I demonstrate how these impact on a range of recent digital installations by Australian and New Zealand artists. The lens of digital materiality shifts from an informational context into that of art history where it is found to highlight the systemic relationality of the installation. The thesis opens with a consideration of histories of media-specificity, and argues for a necessary separation of our concepts of media and materiality. This context provides a set of tools by which the remainder of the thesis investigates a range of digital material flows that are not tied to fixed media definitions. I draw on a range of theorists including Umberto Eco, Gilles Deleuze, Claude Shannon and Jack Burnham to further locate these material flows within two strands: experimental sound and information theory. This discussion forms the basis of the thesis? re-appraisal of media distinctions and highlights the complex relationship of informational materials to both sonic and visual histories. The second half of the thesis undertakes an appraisal of emergence, feedback, entropy and delay in specific works and suggests dimensionality, movement and duration as key determinants of the digital installation. These chapters demonstrate that what is at stake in digital installation is the viewer?s implicit role in the shifting relationships of digital materiality. Overall, this thesis presents a framework for emergent materiality in digital installation. I develop a theory of emergent materiality as a process specific to digital installation, and argue that digital installation is in fact a subject-forming assemblage of information-noise in which relations of dimensionality, movement and duration coalesce without cohering. And, within which gallery spaces begin to get noisy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noise</field><field name="subject">Digital materiality</field><field name="subject">Media-specificity</field><field name="subject">Digital installation art</field><field name="subject">Experimental film</field><field name="subject">Experimental music</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Media ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Aotearoa</field><field name="subject">Digital art</field><field name="subject">Installations (Art)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexities in the valuation of natural resources and the development of the choice modelling technique</field><field name="creator">Rolfe, John, Economics &amp; Management, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Choice Modelling technique is an emerging technique which appears to have strengths relative to other non-market valuation techniques. The latter group are important in the assessment of the tradeoffs involved in environmental and resource use tradeoffs. However, the use of these techniques is often criticised where ethical and moral frameworks are involved, where it is unclear how difficult choices are being framed against each other, or where it is unclear how values change according to the scope of the amenity under consideration  The primary focus of the thesis is on the development of the Choice Modelling technique, which provides a richer information set to researchers than other techniques such as Contingent valuation method. However, the richness of this data is offset to some degree by the complexity of application, where careful attention is needed for design, application and analytical stages.  In this thesis, a series of four Choice Modelling experiments are reported, as well as two small Contingent Valuation experiments. The Choice Modelling experiments were centred on the estimation of values that Australians might hold for rainforest conservation in Vanuatu. In order to frame and scope the tradeoffs of interest within the broad pool of substitute goods (such as rainforest conservation opportunities in other countries), the Choice Modelling technique appeared more suitable than the single tradeoff preservation of the Contingent Valuation method.  The results of Choice Modelling experiments involved sets of parameters indicating that the probability of choice depended on a number of attributes used to make up the conservation profiles together with the influence of unobserved attributes. As a willingness-to-pay variable was included within the attributes making up choice profiles, estimates of value were available by predicting how changes in particular attributes could be offset by changes in the willingness-to-pay variable.  The major conclusions of the research presented in the thesis were that the involvement with ethical and moral frameworks does not invalidate the use of non-market valuation techniques, and that the Choice Modelling technique has strengths in relation to scooping and framing issues. In particular, the research demonstrates that the information generated from an experiment can be used in an iterative approach to develop more accurate models of choice. As well, the research shows that the amenity of interest, rainforest conservation in Vanuatu, can have positive values for Australian residents relative to other conservation opportunities.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choice modelling technique</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">non-market valuation technique</field><field name="subject">rainforest</field><field name="subject">Vanuatu</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geomorphology of Southeast Australian mountain streams</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Chris J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the morphology and sediment transport dynamics of mountain streams in southeast Australia. Mountain streams represent important geomorphological and ecological systems in Australia which have hitherto been poorly studied. The variability of mountain stream reach morphology was investigated at the regional scale using topographical surveys and sediment sampling techniques. Study sites were stratified by slope and local lithology. Eight channel-morphologies including Bedrock, Cascade, Step-pool, Planebed, Pool-Riffle, Cascade-pool, Riffle-step and Infilled, were identified using an objective statistical approach. Overall, channel types were found to correspond to existing reach-scale mountain stream templates. Five morphologies were associated with a specific lithology type which controlled the size and shape of grains supplied to the channels.  Differences in coarse sediment transport processes between morphologies were investigated using stream monitoring techniques and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Monitoring results from a 3 year period indicated that channel beds are resistant to entrainment with shear stress thresholds for bedload transport ranging between 64 to 74 N/m2. Transport of reach median grain sizes requires floods that exceed bankfull discharge. Existing competence equations were found to over-predict the hydraulic driving force and consequently, a modified entrainment model was used to account for the regional channel characteristics.   OSL dating was investigated as a tool to provide data on long-term sediment transport processes. Minimum age model results from the OSL dates show overall agreement with a selected entrainment model, and indicate differences in sediment transport dynamics between some reach morphology types. A regime model was used to quantify the physical domains of different channel morphologies. Limitations of the model were overcome by modifying the sediment supply surrogate to better reflect the dominant transported bedload size. Morphology types were delineated according to different sediment transport capacity-sediment supply domains.  The distribution of channel morphology types within a series of catchments in southeast Australia was modelled within a GIS platform using the diagnostics of reach morphology derived from this study. The model provides a conceptual framework to evaluate the potential link between channel form, potential habitat diversity and aquatic biodiversity within the channel network in mountain streams.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mountain streams</field><field name="subject">morpho-statistical classification</field><field name="subject">channels</field><field name="subject">optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL)</field><field name="subject">bed material storage</field><field name="subject">morphologies</field><field name="subject">habitat diversity</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">bedload transport</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Southeast</field><field name="subject">Southeastern</field><field name="subject">river channels</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Salinity hazard mapping and risk assessment in the Bourke irrigation district</field><field name="creator">Buchannan, Sam, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">At no point in history have we demanded so much from our agricultural land whilst simultaneously leaving so little room for management error. Of the many possible environmental impacts from agriculture, soil and water salinisation has some of the most long-lived and deleterious effects. Despite its importance, however, land managers are often unable to make informed decisions of how to manage the risk of salinisation due to a lack of data. Furthermore, there remains no universally agreed method for salinity risk mapping. This thesis addresses these issues by investigating new methods for producing high-resolution predictions of soil salinity, soil physical properties and groundwater depth using a variety of traditional and emerging ancillary data sources. The results show that the methodologies produce accurate predictions yielding natural resource information at a scale and resolution not previously possible. Further to this, a new methodology using fuzzy logic is developed that exploits this information to produce high-resolution salinity risk maps designed to aid both agricultural and natural resource management decisions. The methodology developed represents a new and effective way of presenting salinity risk and has numerous advantages over conventional risk models. The incorporation of fuzzy logic provides a meaningful continuum of salinity risk and allows for the incorporation of uncertainty. The method also allows salinity risk to be calculated relative to any vegetation community and shows where the risk is coming from (root-zone or groundwater) allowing more appropriate management decisions to be made. The development of this methodology takes us a step closer to closing what some have called our greatest gap in agricultural knowledge. That is, our ability to manage the salinity risk at the subcatchment scale.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fuzzy analysis</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Precision agriculture</field><field name="subject">Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Multiple criteria analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques and algorithms for solving the multiobjective path optimisation problem for car navigation</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Ching-Sheng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conventional information used to guide automobile drivers in selecting their driving routes is the shortest-distance path (SDP). As several researchers have pointed out, driver route selection is a multiple criteria decision process. This research proposes a multiobjective path optimisation (MOPO) decision model to make a more precise simulation of the decision-making behaviour of driver route selection. Seven single-objective path optimisation (SOPO) decision models are taken into account to establish the MOPO decision model. They relate to travel time, travel cost, cumulative distance, roadway capacity, roadway grade, passed intersections and number of turns.  To solve the MOPO problem, a two-stage technique which incorporates shortest path (SP) algorithms and techniques for solving the multiobjective programming problem and a path genetic algorithm (PGA) are proposed. In addition, algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and GA are reviewed and algorithms that are applicable for solving the MOPO problems are suggested. Furthermore, new algorithms for solving least-node path (LNP) problem, corresponding to the objective of passed intersections, as well as minimum-turn path (MTP) problem, corresponding to the objective of number of turns, are developed.  To conduct the empirical study, a software tool - the multiobjective path optimisation analysis tool (MOPOAT) - was implemented. It contains tools for constructing a road network and its corresponding network topology, the environment of coding techniques for solving the MOPO problems and tools for the manipulation, statistics, analysis and display of experimental results. The purpose of implementing the MOPOAT software is to provide more efficient, convenient and user-friendly tools for solving MOPO and SOPO problems so that an empirical study of real road networks can be carried out more easily.  To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in supporting more diverse information to drivers to assist in route selection, several experiments were conducted utilising three real road networks with different roadway types and numbers of nodes and links. Techniques and algorithms such as the two-stage approach, Dijkstra and the PGA for solving the MOPO problem, and the Dijkstra, LNP and MTP algorithms for solving the SOPO problems were applied.  Finally, to deal with improvements in computational efficiency for identifying SPs in a large road network and for population initialisation of the PGA, the critical-section (CS) approach and the seed-path expansion (SPE) approach are proposed. To compare the run time between the conventional SP and CS algorithms as well as the PGA and the SPE algorithms, tools were implemented with commercial GIS, and experimental tests were conducted using road networks with a large amount of nodes and links and different roadway types.  Through these theoretical and empirical studies, several useful contributions and conclusions were obtained.  Some of the most significant findings are:  1.	The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of integration with commercial GIS packages in supporting both spatial and attribute data displays. It can be safely said that, assisted by the MOPOAT software, it is easy for automobile drivers to obtain the optimal paths of the SDP, LNP, MTP and MOPO problems in seconds, despite these problems being highly complex and difficult to resolve manually. 2.	According to the experimental results, the proposed LNP, MTP and MOPO decision models give automobile drivers richer information for choosing their driving routes in a more diverse way. 3.	It is shown by the experimental results that the SDP and LNP mostly locate different paths in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks, and that the total passed intersections by the SDP are greater than passed by the LNP. Moreover, it is revealed that ambiguous turns might occur in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks. 4.	It is found that the number of nodes of the SDP is in general greater than the number of nodes of the LNP and MTP irrespective of the type of road network. 5.	A sensitivity analysis for weights shows that as the weighting value of the SDP objective incrementally increases by 0.1 units, the corresponding SDP??s objective value varies either low or high. The same results also occur for the LNP and MTP objectives. This verifies the fact that the weighting coefficients do not reflect proportionally the relative importance of the objectives. Moreover, the MTP objective has the higher sensitivity in comparison with the other two objectives. 6.	Despite utilising Dijkstra or PGA algorithms for solving the MOPO problem, the LNP and MTP algorithms have to be employed to solve the non-commeasurable problem, whereby the standardisation objective value can be obtained. In addition, without any assisting information the PGA might fail to reach the best-compromise solution. 7.	It is found that the total run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the Dijkstra algorithm is much faster than by the PGA. However, if the run time excludes the time needed for population initialisation, the PGA is much faster than the Dijkstra algorithm. 8.	Based on calculated bottlenecks, the proposed CS approach partitions a SP into many critical sections in advance, with the result that a long SP can be obtained by combining all SPs of all CSs. The experimental results show that the run time of the CS algorithm is much faster than Dijkstra??s algorithm. Moreover, the test result for the P-pointer indicates that if the total number of nodes of a SP grows the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm becomes significantly better than the Dijkstra algorithm, and that the CS approach has the best performance. 9.	The experimental result for the E-pointer reveals that the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm will decrease gradually as the number of selected CSs increases. Therefore, the total percentage of selected CSs suggested by the experimental result is no more than 30 percent. 10.	According to the experimental results, the performance order among SDP, LNP and MTP algorithms from fast to slow is SDP, MTP and LNP, and the LNP algorithm requires much more time than the other two algorithms. 11.	As the total nodes of a path increase, most of the run time for SDP and LNP also increases. However, there are still some paths that violate the above rule. This result verifies that the run time needed for solving SDP and LNP is not only affected by the node numbers but also depends on the network topology. 12.	Run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the PGA is faster than applying the Dijkstra algorithm, if the run time of the former algorithm does not take into account the population initialisation time. Nevertheless, if the run time of the former algorithm does take into account the population initialisation time, the latter algorithm is much faster than the former algorithm. 13.	In comparing the run time for population initialisation, the run time of the evolution process by applying the PGA is quite small, and the bottleneck of the run time for solving MOPO problem by applying the PGA is the population initialisation. 14.	The population initialisation time is reduced significantly by applying the SPE algorithm, and increases at a very slow rate as the number of nodes of a path increases. As the total nodes of a path grow ever larger, the computing time is reduced more noticeably.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Multiobjective path optimisation problem</field><field name="subject">Car navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GPS study for resolving the stability of Borobudur temple site</field><field name="creator">Lestari, Dwi, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The maintenance of the world???s important cultural monuments is a complex task embracing many disciplines. One important aspect of individual management plans is the stability of the monument. Borobudur, in Central Java, uncovered in a state of dilapidation in the early nineteenth century and finally restored in the second half of the twentieth century was restored using internal beams and injection technology with the view of providing a stable foundation for the foreseeable future. In the past, classical surveying separated the vertical and horizontal components. This separation often resulted in different stations having different information. Moreover, one technique was not generally able to add constraints to the other. Today's surveyors and Cultural Heritage managers use the Global Positioning System which is able to provide precise and reliable information for both the horizontal and vertical components, thereby unifying the networks and maximizing individual strengths, especially the underground marks associated with precise leveling, which are significantly less prone to local erratic movement than surface marks. Of necessity, any measurement of change involves at least two observation epochs. In general the precision is tied to the number of epochs and the span between the epochs. Since this study has had only two observation epochs, the results can only be described as preliminary or indicative. Never the less, there are a number of clear trends that are apparent. The first important point is that GPS is able to deliver precisions that are near 1 mm in the horizontal and 2-3 mm in the vertical relative to a regional fiducial control network. This is comparable to terrestrial surveying techniques. Moreover, it is accomplished in 10 to 14 days compared to many weeks for leveling. The second is that the level of redundancy and spatial coherence is very high enabling errors and outliers to be readily detected. This was used extensively as part of the quality assurance program adopted in this study. The third point is that no alarming deformation of the temple has been detected. At this stage of the study, the 95% confidence levels are quite large due mainly to only 2 epochs being observed but also in part to the way the models, especially the GLOBK model, has been implemented due to the limited number of epochs and the limited time span. It is expected that the model of tectonic motion which connects one epoch to the next will improve dramatically with a third epoch, and this will significantly improve the precision of the observation stations on the temple at the stupa level and on the buttress level. However, there is already clear evidence that some of the buttress level stations are in an unstable environment compared with stupa level stations and this is primarily due to their location. Finally, GPS offers the prospect of fast and hence repeatable work. Kinematic GPS techniques can certainly be used to densify stations and to increase our knowledge of the structural effects of deformation. However, much needs to be done to ensure that satellite tracking is of high quality and able to successfully resolve the ambiguities on an epoch by epoch basis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regulation of megakaryocyte-specific genes by Fli-1 and GATA-1</field><field name="creator">Eisbacher, Michael, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The successive activation of tissue-specific genes during cellular differentiation is orchestrated by the formation of transcriptional complexes consisting of cellspecific and ubiquitous transcription factors. Understanding the molecular events associated with normal megakaryocyte (Mk) differentiation is an issue of central importance to haematology. The aims of this study were therefore to: (i) define the transcription factors responsible for regulating the expression of Mkspecific genes such as Glycoprotein IX, (ii) identify the protein partners of such important Mk-regulatory transcription factors and (iii) examine the mechanisms utilised by these factors to regulate gene expression. First, the regulatory elements in the GPIX promoter required for basal and inducible expression were examined in megakaryoblastic Dami cells stimulated to undergo differentiation. The resulting data suggested that an Ets site in the GPIX promoter binding the Ets-family member Fli-1 was crucial in regulating both constitutive and inducible GPIX expression. Second, a two-hybrid screen of a K-562 cDNA library was used to identify transcription factors that interacted with Fli-1 and were potential regulators of Mk development. Results of this screen identified a novel protein-protein interaction with GATA-1, a previously well-characterised zinc finger transcription factor also implicated in erythroid and Mk development. Mapping of the domains required for the interaction show that the zinc fingers of GATA-1 interact with the Ets domain of Fli-1. The biological significance of the Fli-1/GATA-1 interaction was demonstrated in transient transfection assays, which resulted in synergistic activation of Mkspecific promoters. Analysis of Fli-1 and GATA-1 expression in a series of erythroleukaemic and megakaryoblastic cell lines demonstrated that the Fli- 1/GATA-1 combination correlates with a Mk-phenotype. Moreover, expression of Fli-1 in K-562 cells (a line rich in GATA-1 but normally lacking Fli-1) induces endogenous GPIX expression. Quantitative mobility shift assays reveal that Fli- 1 and GATA-1 exhibit cooperative DNA-binding in which the binding of GATA-1 to DNA is increased approximately 26 fold in the presence of Fli-1.

The fantasy of whiteness refers to the habitually enacted and environmentally entrenched assumption that white people can and should superintend the cultural representation of Otherness. This argument is presented in three parts. Part One examines the complex ways in which white anxieties and concerns were expressed through discourses of blackness in nineteenth-century American blackface entertainment. Part Two examines the various transnational discursive connections enabled by American and Australian blackface entertainments in Australia during the nineteenth century. Part Three examines the legacy of nineteenth-century blackface entertainment in twentieth-century Australian culture. Overall, this dissertation investigates some of the fragmentary histories and stories about Otherness that coalesce within Australian culture. This examination suggests that representations of Aboriginality in Australian culture are influenced and manipulated by whiteness in ways that seek to entrench and protect white cultural authority. Even today, a phantasmal whiteness is often present within cultural representations of Aboriginality.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blackface</field><field name="subject">Whiteness</field><field name="subject">Aboriginality</field><field name="subject">Race</field><field name="subject">Blackness</field><field name="subject">Australian studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tragic sublime: libidinal pessimism and the problem of existence</field><field name="creator">Elbourne, Sean G., School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the attempt by Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche and Georges Bataille to confront the problem of the meaning and value of existence. I consider each of these philosophers as involved in the development of a stream of post-Kantian thought that, following Nick Land, I call libidinal pessimism. Libidinal pessimism is both the metaphysical principle of the primacy of willing as the fundamental reality, and the moral principle that the greatest value to our existence is to be found in liberating willing from the small-scale concern of the good of individual beings. Each sees a crisis in the dominance of optimism: the belief that willing is commensurate with the good of individuated beings. They attack the dominance of optimism not just in the history of philosophy, but also in the values that dominate the culture at large. My contention is that these thinkers were provoked to think about the meaning and value of existence by encountering the tragic sublime: a pleasure in the destruction of the happiness of the individual. This affective intensity provokes them to the realisation that our will is not directed towards the happiness of the individual, contra the dominant values of our culture. Yet since the tragic sublime is non-conceptual, its implications for the meaning and the value of existence are not explicit. The task of philosophy is to conceptualise this affective intensity to specify the inadequacy of the values that dominate the age, and to assert the values that can liberate human possibility from its current wretchedness to a new glory. To structure the thinking of these philosophers on the problem of existence, I analyse their thinking using the following logical model: 1) specifying what they regard as the predominant symptoms of the problem regarding existence, our current wretchedness; 2) their diagnosis of the source of this wretchedness in the dominant optimism; 3) their pronouncement of the solution to this problem, through liberating willing from the small-scale; and 4) their prescription for how to overcome this problem, for how the tragic sublime can liberate willing from the fetters of a concern for individuated beings. In elaborating upon the thinking of these philosophers as a definite stream of post- Kantian thought, I also highlight how each engages with the thinking of the earlier of the philosophers. I explore how Schopenhauer's philosophy develops out of Kant's philosophy, how Nietzsche develops the thinking of Schopenhauer and how Bataille develops the problematics of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Through this I attempt to explore how these three philosophers mark a development in the attempt to conceptualise the tragic sublime as the key to address the problem of the meaning and value of existence.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">Nietzsche</field><field name="subject">Schopenhauer</field><field name="subject">Bataille</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular toolbox for the monitoring and control of water distribution biofilms</field><field name="creator">Moore, Zoe, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The water distribution system represents the final barrier to the degradation of treated water prior to consumption. Maintaining the integrity of these systems therefore is essential for public health. Current strategies for monitoring bacteriological water quality within distribution systems are dependent upon culture-based methods, which are affected by many factors, including conventional disinfection strategies (chlorine) that have been shown to impact the culturability of bacteria on media. Improved methods to assess the bacteriological loads and responses to treatment are needed. This thesis investigated the development and application of alternate means of analysis of water quality analytes, enabling a toolbox approach for bacteriological water quality monitoring. Tools used in this study include biomass concentration using DNA quantification, bacterial community characterisation using 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), targeted population assessment using quantitative PCR (QPCR) and in situ phylogenetic abundance using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Conventional methods such as heterotrophic plate counts were also included. Results show that chlorine does not eradicate bacteria by the proportions generally reported using culture-reliant methods. Within both drinking and recycled water distribution systems, bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and species of Pseudomonas were detected in water containing 2 ppm free chlorine concentrations. The persistence of such bacteria in conditions prevalent within distribution systems necessitates the revision of techniques of analysis as well as improved treatment and disinfection management strategies.  Furthermore, current strategies for water quality monitoring are reliant on the assessment of planktonic bacterial populations, and do not consider attached (biofilm) populations. Molecular methods of analysis showed up to 5-log more bacteria are present in biofilms compared to planktonic sources. Thus, improved methods for water quality maintenance in distribution systems need to consider the contributions of biofilms. This thesis also studied the effects of a nitric oxide (NO) donor, as NO has been shown to encourage detachment of bacterial cells from the biofilm which then enter the planktonic phase of the life cycle. The molecular toolbox analysis approach showed that effects are variable on the diverse bacterial populations present in distribution systems, and some bacteria show heightened resistance compared to other populations. Ongoing work targeting biofilms in distribution systems is required to improve conventional practices of water quality assurance in distribution systems.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talk about sex? - how HIV-positive gay men talk about sexual health with their doctors and health care providers</field><field name="creator">Mietinen, Jan Roar, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a qualitative study investigating the communication about sexual health between HIV-positive gay men and their doctors and other health care providers. The study was conducted in 2007 and 2008 in Sydney, Australia. Data was collected through in-depth interviews with eleven HIV-positive gay men, and analysed according to a modified grounded theory approach. The study aims to explore the men??s needs, expectations and experiences in relation to how sexual health is addressed in clinical consultations. While previous research has documented that HIV/AIDS is a diagnosis that poses significant physical, emotional and social challenges for People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) which may impact on their sexual health and well-being, this thesis examines whether, and to what extent this is communicated between HIV-positive gay men and their doctors. In doing so the study identifies and describes the ways in which HIV-positive gay men understand sexual health, how they currently talk to their clinicians about sexual health issues, the priority that such issues have for these men, and barriers and ??incentives?? to sexual health being discussed within HIV treatment settings. The study reveals that the men??s communication about sexual health with their doctors is essentially limited to discussions about sexually transmissible infections (STIs), which represent a common understanding of what constitutes sexual health. The emotional and social aspects of sexual health and well-being are rarely discussed in doctor-patient communication. Instead, the men rely on sources outside the health system, such as friends, peers, partners, gay and HIV community organizations and the gay and HIV media for sexual health information, advice and support. This indicates that broad, holistic sexual health has a low priority in discussions between patients and their doctors, and that social networks therefore play an important role in how HIV-positive gay men take care of their sexual health.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gay men</field><field name="subject">Sexual health</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">Doctor-patient relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operating system directed power management</field><field name="creator">Snowdon, David, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Energy is a critical resource in all types of computing systems from servers, where energy costs dominate data centre expenses and carbon footprints, to embedded systems, where the system's battery life limits the device's functionality. In their efforts to reduce the energy use of these system's hardware manufacturers have implemented features which allow a reduced energy consumption under software control. This thesis shows that managing these settings is a more complex problem than previously considered. Where much (but not all) of the previous academic research investigates unrealistic scenarios, this thesis presents a solution to managing the power on varying hardware. Instead of making unrealistic assumptions, we extract a model from empirical data and characterise that model. Our models estimate the effect of different power management settings on the behaviour of the hardware platform, taking into account the workload, platform and environmental characteristics, but without any kind of a-priori knowledge of the specific workloads being run. These models encapsulate a system's knowledge of the platform. We also developed a \emph{generalised energy-delay} policy which allows us to quickly express the instantaneous importance of both performance and energy to the system. It allows us to select a power management strategy from a number of options. This thesis shows, by evaluation on a number of platforms, that our implementation, Koala, can accurately meet energy and performance goals. In some cases, our system saves 26\% of the system-level energy required for a task, while losing only 1\% performance. This is nearly 46\% of the dynamic energy.  Taking advantage of all energy-saving opportunities requires detailed platform, workload and environmental information. Given this knowledge, we reach the exciting conclusion that near optimal power management is possible on real operating systems, with real platforms and real workloads.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operating Systems</field><field name="subject">Power Management</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Voltage Scaling</field><field name="subject">Energy</field><field name="subject">Efficiency</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction-oxidation cycling of metal oxides for hydrogen production</field><field name="creator">Sim, Andrew Gregory, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A process for the production of clean hydrogen from methane based upon the sequential reduction and oxidation of metal oxides has been studied. The original process, based on iron oxide, suffers from significant disadvantages including deactivation by sintering and coke deposition. Improvement of the iron based system and identification and development of alternative metal oxides for hydrogen production has formed the basis of this study. The literature review outlines current methods for hydrogen production, followed by a review of the Steam-Iron Process as an improved and simpler method for clean hydrogen production. Thermodynamic assessment shows Fe3O4/FeO/Fe, WO3/WO2/W and SnO2/SnO/Sn to be the most prospective systems for the Steam-Metal Process. Experimental testing showed that Fe and W based systems were suitable for hydrogen production, but Sn based systems were unsuitable due to poor reducibility using methane. Attention was then focused on the addition of CeO2/ZrO2 promoters to Fe and W based systems in order to improve reactivity and prevent catalyst deactivation. CeO2/ZrO2 promoted Fe2O3 showed improved redox reactivity and increased stability, with formation of FeO. This aided in mitigation of sintering and introduced the possibility of prevention of coking, as catalysed by methane decomposition over fully reduced Fe metal.  Although WO3 was found to be a suitable oxide, complete reduction to tungsten metal resulted in the formation of tungsten carbide and contamination of hydrogen produced. The formation of 31mol% [CeO2/ZrO2] / 69 mol% WO3 showed stabilised reduction using methane, allowing for redox cycling of the WO3-WO2 couple and preventing complete reduction to W metal. The use of the doped metal oxide showed the best performance of all the metal oxides tested, with clean hydrogen production over multiple redox cycles and high metal oxide stability. Further kinetic studies of both the reduction and oxidation reactions show reduction is chemical reaction controlled process (WO3/WO2.9 &#8594; WO2) with an apparent activation energy of 142 ?? 3 kJ/mol. Oxidation is also fitted to a chemically controlled process, with a reaction rate expression derived as:  rH2 = [0.064 + (F x 0.00038)].e^(-108750/8.314xT).[PH2O]^(0.75)  The apparent activation energy for oxidation was calculated as 109 ?? 1 kJ/mol.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrogen Production</field><field name="subject">Steam Iron Process</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the ignition and deflagration mechanisms relating to the testing of permitted explosives with reference to British health and safety executive???s TM2</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Alison , Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In an effort to provide the underground coal mining industry with an understanding of what governs if an explosive is classed as permitted, a preliminary research project was undertaken to investigate the scientific basis of the British Health and Safety Executives Testing Memorandum#2 (TM2). Previous literature indicates that the TM2 standard is empirical and based on comparative testing of the explosive in use at the time, nitroglycerine. Eighty Type I tests were carried out and preliminary findings were that the mechanism that causes ignition is a reflected shockwave which compresses and reheats detonation products. The origin of the reflected pressure wave changed when the primer position was altered within the cannon. With a pressure transducer and pyrometer mounted on the side of the gallery the measurements aided in identifying those maximum pressures and temperatures prior to ignition that are collectively a set of parameters that could be used to identify if an explosive would cause an ignition in the gallery. Additionally numerical modelling was employed to characterise pressure, temperature and velocity profiles within the gallery for blown out and cut off shots. Whilst the pressure and temperature results predicted by the CFD model were 1.5 to 3 times the magnitude of those measured in the field, the modelling results exhibited the behaviour of the shockwaves reflecting off the gallery walls, rebounding, gaining intensity and travelling back towards the centre axis of the gallery. This predicted behaviour reinforced the belief that re-heating of detonation gases by reflected shockwaves is the prime ignition mechanism of the Type I TM2 tests. One hundred and eight deflagration tests were conducted in the Type II cannon. The main finding was that the longer a receptor is subjected to elevated pressures due to confinement the higher the probability of deflagration. Additionally emulsion explosives were found to detonate in the cannon rather than deflagrate raising the question, ???if the explosive is consumed instantaneously, then isn???t the risk of deflagration occurring eliminated???? In reading this thesis it must be noted that all findings are preliminary and many more tests are required to confirm trends and behaviours observed in the testing to date.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Permitted</field><field name="subject">Explosives</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why healthcare workers don't wash their hands: a behavioural explanation</field><field name="creator">Whitby, Robert Michael, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hand-washing compliance was examined by thematic analysis of focus group discussions in nurses, mothers and children. Perceptions in these groups were identical, with the purpose of hand-cleansing seen as self-protection from infection. This assessment is not grounded in microbiology, but is strongly driven by emotion. Two types of hand-cleansing (???hand-hygiene???) behaviour were identified: (a)	???inherent??? hand-washing. This behaviour is taught by mothers to their children early in life. The behaviour occurs when hands have been visibly or ???emotionally??? soiled or feel sticky, and drives most hand-hygiene undertaken in the community; and (b)	???elective??? hand-hygiene, which occurs in the absence of perceived threat. As patient contact by healthcare workers is frequently assessed by healthcare workers as not posing risk, healthcare workers omit much elective hand-hygiene, leading to potential cross-infection. Modelling responses of 754 nurses on the Theory of Planned Behaviour for these two hand-hygiene behaviours in the healthcare setting explained 64% of elective hand-hygiene and 76% of inherent hand-washing intention. Translation of hand-washing behaviour patterns of the community into the healthcare setting is the predominant driver of all hand-hygiene in healthcare workers. In-hospital elective hand-hygiene behaviour is further significantly predicted by belief in the benefit from the activity, peer pressure and role modelling of senior physicians and administrators. For inherent hand-washing intent, only attitudes and peer behaviour are predictive. Time constraints, commonly implicated to explain poor compliance, are important mostly to elective hand-hygiene. Reduction in necessary effort by introducing an alcohol-based hand rub without a concomitant behavioural modification program will therefore have only minimal impact. Further components essential to hand-hygiene programs have been identified. These accord with the outcomes of the modelling and include the need for institutional recognition of hand-hygiene as a priority, overt clinician leadership support, and reinforcement of purpose by both education and performance feedback. In the long-term, society would be best served by altering the entire paradigm of hand-hygiene behaviour with nationwide campaigns based on principles of social marketing. Ideally, hand-hygiene should be taught by mothers and reinforced in early education programs as behaviour that is self-protective but with the defining theme: ???clean your hands, and protect others, not just yourself.???</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hand-Hygiene</field><field name="subject">Healthcare Worker</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I don???t mind being a diabetic but not every day!: learning to live with a chronic condition</field><field name="creator">Demirkol, Abdullah, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chronic conditions and their management have become a major global public health problem which poses a serious challenge for both health care systems and affected individuals. Type 2 diabetes is one such condition affecting almost 200 million people around the world, a number that is expected to double by 2020. As with most chronic conditions its management requires significant and permanent changes in people???s daily life practices as well as a strict medication regimen. Recent research demonstrates that it is possible to control the complications of diabetes, and even to prevent its development in predisposed individuals by following recommended treatments. Yet studies show that only 2% of people living with diabetes heed their treating team???s advice. This signals a serious discordance between scientifically generated information and its place in the daily lives of people living with diabetes. This study sought to discover how to change the factors that prevent people with type 2 diabetes from following their recommended treatments. Firstly a participant observation process in four diabetes education centres was used to define the characteristics of the context in which people with diabetes and their treating teams interacted. This was followed by a nine-month participatory action process in two of the four centres in which participants defined the problematic areas in the management of their diabetes and devised plans to tackle these problems. They then attempted to implement these plans while exploring how and why their plans did or did not work. The findings indicate that the decision to follow recommended treatments is far from being a matter of individual choice. Rather it is heavily influenced by a complex interaction of numerous factors that people with diabetes have limited power to change. This study reveals that the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes could be enhanced where operational and practical knowledge about the condition is provided to people living with the disorder by health care providers responsive to patients??? perspectives, and where patients, providers and policy-makers recognise that health is a resource constructed in the wider social context, whose every element needs to be harnessed in encouraging people to make healthier life decisions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology.

Despite the effectiveness of this treatment, CPAP acceptance and adherence rates are generally suboptimal. The aim of this dissertation was to validate a new, inclusive Health Belief Model (HBM) for the prediction of CPAP acceptance and adherence. It was argued that the HBM could predict future adherence even before patients have experienced the treatment, thus providing valid intervention targets to improve CPAP acceptance as well as adherence. Modifiable constructs that are proximal to the decision making process for OSA patients, were identified from the literature (Chapter 1). Along with the generic HBM constructs of perceived benefits, barriers, severity, risk, self-efficacy and cues to action, additional predictors were incorporated in the OSA specific model. These included biomedical indices of objective disease severity and measures of psychological distress. Study One assessed 77 newly diagnosed, CPAP na&#239;ve OSA patients on a questionnaire battery at baseline (prior to CPAP treatment). The questionnaire included HBM measures which were available in the literature; benefits perception, self-efficacy, functional severity, and perceived risk of negative health outcomes. CPAP adherence was assessed at four month follow-up. This initial investigation found that health beliefs alone explained 21.8% of the variance in CPAP adherence, whilst health beliefs and biomedical indices together explained 31.8% of the variance in CPAP adherence. The greatest proportion of CPAP adherence was explained by higher benefits perception, greater severity and lower risk perception. Study Two reported on the development and validation of a measure of the barriers construct (as no measure of this existed). A sample of 113 newly diagnosed, CPAP na&#239;ve OSA patients completed a questionnaire containing potential items of the Barriers to CPAP Use questionnaire (BACQ) at baseline. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) showed a two factor structure of the eight-item BACQ, with &#8216;Barriers&#8217; and &#8216;Cost of Treatment&#8217; subscales identified. The BACQ had an internal consistency of 0.82 and readability at a fifth grade reading level. The aim of Study Three was to develop a valid and reliable measure of the cues to action construct. A sample of 63 OSA patients (from the total 113 patients assessed in Study Two) completed a questionnaire containing potential items of the Cues to CPAP Use questionnaire (CCUQ) one month after being prescribed CPAP. EFA showed a three factor structure of the nine-item CCUQ, with &#8216;Health Cues&#8217;, &#8216;Partner Cues&#8217; and &#8216;Health Professional Cues&#8217; subscales identified. The CCUQ demonstrated modest internal consistency and split-half reliability, and readability at a seventh grade level. Study Four incorporated three sub-studies which assessed the accuracy of the fully articulated HBM (including the BACQ and CCUQ measures) in predicting CPAP adherence at two months. Study Four A reported on the same sample of 113 CPAP na&#239;ve patients (from Study Two). Structural Equation Modelling demonstrated the complex relationship between health beliefs, psychological variables, and biomedical indices in CPAP adherence. The full HBM predicted 24% of the variance in CPAP adherence at two months. Adherence was directly predicted by lower perception of treatment cost as a barrier to CPAP use, higher self-efficacy, and higher BMI. Study Four B reported on 63 patients who completed HBM questionnaires at one month. The model predicted 42% of the variance in CPAP adherence at two months. Adherence was directly predicted by greater benefits perception, greater psychological distress, and lower perception of the Health Professional as the important cue to action. Study Four C investigated changes in health beliefs between baseline and one month. By one month patients generally reported more positive attitudes to CPAP, and better overall functioning. These changes did not correlate with CPAP adherence. Those who used CPAP more than four hours per night demonstrated greater improvement in functional severity and in anxiety score. Study Five used the findings of the HBM studies in developing a theory-driven Motivational Intervention (MI) to target specific beliefs associated with poor adherence. 101 newly diagnosed, CPAP na&#239;ve OSA patients were randomly assigned to nurse-led MI + Standard Care (50 participants), or to Standard Care only (51 participants). MI patients received two sessions before starting CPAP, and one session one month after CPAP prescription. By three months, the MI group used CPAP 50% more of the time, and were six times less likely to reject CPAP. The MI group demonstrated greater self-efficacy and a lower perception of barriers to CPAP use. The findings were largely supportive of the HBM theory of CPAP adherence. The substantive findings of this dissertation were that patients do need relevant, timely and targeted support in order for them to effectively commence on CPAP and then continue to adequately adhere. At a minimum, psychological intervention, such as a Motivational Intervention, is likely to be needed for the subset of patients who report beliefs associated with poor adherence at pre-treatment.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CPAP treatment</field><field name="subject">Obstructive Sleep Apnoea</field><field name="subject">Adherence</field><field name="subject">Prediction</field><field name="subject">Psychological Models</field><field name="subject">Health Belief Model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outside Men: Negotiating Economic and Political Development in Papua New Guinea, 1946-1968</field><field name="creator">Anthony Yeates</field><field name="description">Australia accepted a great responsibility in 1946, when it agreed to abide by the terms outlined in the United Nations Trusteeship Agreement and direct colonial policy in the Territory of New Guinea (after 1949 the Territory of Papua and New Guinea) toward the social, economic, and political development of the Territory&#8217;s indigenous population. Emulating British colonial development in East Africa and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, it introduced cooperative societies to facilitate the growth of the indigenous cash economy and gradually established local government councils to regulate municipal affairs. The public servants primarily responsible for implementing colonial development policy in the field were the &#8220;outside men&#8221;&#8212;patrol officers (often referred to as &#8216;native affairs&#8217; officers or kiaps) working for the Department of District Services and Native Affairs (1946-55) and its successors, the Department of Native Affairs (1956-63) and the Department of District Administration (1964-69). Representing the hard power of the state, patrol officers explored the country and used the threat of force to introduce and maintain British law. They also employed the soft power of enticement, promising development as an incentive for cooperation. Their soft power functions increased after the Pacific War, when they supervised (arguably dominated) cooperative societies and local government councils. In theory, colonial development promised amelioration and progress. In practice, it often exacted a heavy physical and psychological toll on Papua New Guineans, bringing disease, arbitrary violence, and humiliation. Local people adopted a number of strategies in response to white intrusion. Some acquiesced with the government and used compliance as a means of increasing their own position within the colonial culture. Others adopted an uncooperative attitude, neither resisting nor complying with the patrol officers. Colonial intrusion fractured pre-existing forms of self-management, leaving village people struggling to understand the radical changes of culture contact. Many supported alternative development associations&#8212;such as welfare societies, kampanis, and kivungs (often dismissed as &#8216;cargo cults&#8217;)&#8212;in opposition to state structures. Field officers attempted to direct economic and political development in the villages toward state controlled structures and often discouraged independent indigenous development. Although Australia promised to create opportunities for local people, enhanced indigenous participation implied greater indigenous independence. This threatened Australian control in strategically important Papua New Guinea. Careful to contain &#8216;cargo cult&#8217; and communist activity, the Australian Administration attempted to maintain absolute control over indigenous political and economic development and regulate potentially subversive influences in the Territory. The conflicting role of patrol officers as both agents of control and agents of development reflected the contradiction in the Australian Trusteeship. Their policing functions created distrust in the villages and impeded positive relations with local people, who resented white authoritarianism and the demands of the Administration. Lack of trust made it difficult for the patrol officers to implement development policies. This thesis explores these contradictions in Australia&#8217;s trusteeship and the practice of colonial development in Papua New Guinea. It illustrates how Australia&#8217;s obsession with absolute control impeded the creation of appropriate and sustainable economic and political development in Papua New Guinea. Most studies of the kiap system concentrate on the early contact period, or the &#8216;first phase&#8217; of colonial administration. This thesis adds to the literature by exploring how patrol officers and Papua New Guineans negotiated economic and political development during the &#8216;second phase&#8217; of colonial development. It uses patrol reports written by field officers, documents generated by the Department of Territories and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), official correspondence, personal correspondence contained in archival collections, and contemporary newspaper reports to construct a social history of economic and political development in late-colonial Papua New Guinea. Uniquely, it reveals how Cold War political pressures constrained development related discourses in Papua New Guinea and how the security services used patrol officers and compliant Papua New Guineans to keep the Territory under surveillance. While development may have been a common goal for most people in post-war Territory of Papua and New Guinea (henceforth Papua New Guinea), its form was a matter of much negotiation and conflict, involving a number of competing indigenous and non-indigenous interests.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">papua new guinea, colonialism, development, patrol officers, cold war, cargo cults, cooperatives, local government councils</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seniors&#8217; participation at the local level: Challenges for inclusive governance in ageing communities</field><field name="creator">Andrea Petriwskyj</field><field name="description">The current local governance environment in Australia is very complex. One reason for this complexity is that in keeping with the principles of &#8216;good governance&#8217;, there are increasing expectations to involve citizens in policy, planning and practice. In addition, with population ageing, an increasing proportion of these citizens belong to the &#8216;group&#8217; known as &#8216;seniors&#8217; or &#8216;older people&#8217;. This growing proportion of older people is accompanied by increased diversity including in relation to culture and language, socio-economic status, health and disability, as well as different cohorts and life experiences. A key challenge for local governance is not just how to include older people, but how to include such a diverse range of older people, in ways consistent with the principle of inclusiveness. Attention to inclusion is not only a critical component of good local governance practice, but is also a key policy focus in Australia and overseas. Inclusive local governance in ageing communities is not simply about &#8216;involving seniors&#8217;. To be truly inclusive requires an approach to citizen participation that is grounded in evidence about seniors&#8217; needs and preferences, and the motivations, barriers and characteristics that impact on their engagement. However, given the many ways in which seniors differ, ensuring citizen engagement practices are truly inclusive will be increasingly difficult. This thesis explores these issues by asking: What are the key challenges for local governments in facilitating and supporting genuine and inclusive citizen participation in local governance for seniors? The research is based on the premise that addressing the challenge of including older people in local governance requires a sound understanding what motivates, facilitates and impedes seniors&#8217; participation, and the relationships that these factors have with diversity. A review of the available literature addressing seniors&#8217; political participation identified a multiplicity of motivating, impeding and facilitating factors and highlighted some potential challenges relating to the breadth and complex nature of the evidence. However, there was limited consideration of aspects of diversity beyond the direct effect of demographics. The intention of the thesis, therefore, was to explore the challenges to inclusive practice by developing an in-depth understanding of the factors that motivate, facilitate and impede seniors&#8217; participation in local governance activities, as well as the ways in which aspects of diversity impact on their participation, motivations and barriers. The study used a two-stage mixed-method design, involving a series of focus groups at Stage One and a large scale survey at Stage Two, both conducted in one local government area in south-east Queensland, Australia. Findings from the study identified a complex web of interrelated factors impacting on participation in a number of ways. Motivations and barriers were both self- and other- directed, and were related to individual, social and government domains. Findings also highlighted the importance of diversity to seniors&#8217; participation in governance, with different levels of diversity impacting on who participated, the motivations and barriers that were reported, how important they were, and how they were experienced, as well as their impact on participation. Subsequent synthesis and interpretation provided insights into how local governments can better understand the nature of these challenges if they are to pursue inclusive governance. Overall, results from this study demonstrate that developing inclusive local governance practice is not straightforward, and ensuring opportunities for the participation of seniors from diverse backgrounds presents particular challenges. There are two key conclusions from this study. First, there is significant complexity within the evidence base. This relates particularly to the operation of and patterns among these factors, and relationships between them. Identification of this complexity highlights the value of developing a nuanced understanding of the significant factors and the way they work within the specific local governance context, as well as the limitations of a superficial knowledge of the factors impacting on participation. Second, diversity is important. It impacts on participation both directly and indirectly, highlighting the importance of a deeper understanding of the impact of diversity for inclusive practice. In order to ensure that equal opportunities for participation are available to all seniors, diversity at all levels must be considered and built into appropriate processes. Challenges to local governments&#8217; facilitation and support of inclusive participation by seniors in local governance arise as a result of this complexity within the evidence base and the various impacts of diversity. This thesis identifies and discusses a number of these key challenges, from one local government region, in order to inform inclusive local governance practice.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">Citizen Participation</field><field name="subject">Diversity</field><field name="subject">Inclusion</field><field name="subject">Local Governance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation and Function of Jagged 1 in the Immune Response to Helminth Products</field><field name="creator">Felicia Goh</field><field name="description">The host immune response to parasitic helminths is usually characterized by a Th2 phenotype. As the Jagged/Notch pathway has been implicated in driving Th2 development, it was hypothesized that host macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) could detect helminth products and mount an appropriate response via this pathway. Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) rapidly up-regulated expression of the Notch ligand, Jagged 1, in both mouse and human macrophages, as well as in conventional mouse DCs. Other factors associated with Th cell development, including the Th1-promoting factor IL-12 p40, as well as another potential Th2-promoting factor, interleukin (IL)-33, were not transcriptionally responsive to SEA in these same cell types, thus indicating the selectivity of the response. Inducible gene expression was modified by the presence of the macrophage growth factor colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, which inhibited Jagged 1 induction by SEA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but enhanced LPS-induced IL-12p40 expression. Despite the observation that SEA upregulated Jagged 1 in both macrophages and DCs, only SEA-pulsed DCs promoted IL-4 production upon T-cell activation, suggesting that Jagged 1 induction alone is insufficient for instructing Th2 development. A recombinant form of the extracellular region of Jagged 1 did, however, enhance IFN-&#947; production in splenocytes, thus implying that the rapid induction of Jagged 1 in macrophages and DCs can regulate T cell responses. A potential role for SEA-induced Jagged 1 in autocrine responses in macrophages was also investigated through studies with recombinant extracellular Jagged 1, as well as ectopic expression of Jagged 1 in macrophages. A comparison of the responses initiated in macrophages by SEA and the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) revealed common activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) and p38 phosphorylation. However, only LPS triggered I&#954;B degradation, phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphorylation of Tyr701 of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). SEA robustly activated signalling in HEK293 cells expressing either Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or TLR4/MD2, as well as variably in cells expressing TLR3. Jagged 1 upregulation by SEA was not abrogated in TLR4 knockout macrophages, in contrast to the LPS response. Pharmacological inhibition of the ERK-1/2 pathway impaired both SEA- and LPS-inducible Jagged 1 expression in macrophages. In conclusion, the data within this thesis suggests that Jagged 1 is an ERK-dependent target of TLR signalling that has a macrophage-specific function in the response to SEA.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jagged 1</field><field name="subject">Notch</field><field name="subject">Schistosoma mansoni</field><field name="subject">soluble egg antigen</field><field name="subject">macrophage</field><field name="subject">Dendritic Cell</field><field name="subject">Th2</field><field name="subject">Toll-like receptor</field><field name="subject">Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MODULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION TO CONTROL HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</field><field name="creator">Jian Xu</field><field name="description">Hypertension is a major health problem worldwide. In 1999-2000, 29% or 3.6 million Australians aged 25 yrs and over had high blood pressure (&gt; 140 / 90 mmHg) or were on medication for the condition. It is estimated that about one billion of the world&#8217;s population has hypertension and that this will increase to 1.56 billion by 2025. Although antihypertensive drugs have been relatively successful in attenuating elevated blood pressure (BP) and in reducing adverse outcomes, control of BP depends on continuation of therapy. Drugs may have undesirable side effects which diminish compliance and BP may be resistant to treatment. Gene transfer approaches may potentially provide a tool to control BP. RNA interference (RNAi) is a new tool for the study of gene function, producing specific down regulation of protein expression. I tested the hypothesis that angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) inhibition using RNAi technology would result in sustained reduction of blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). To enable in vivo gene delivery into animal models of hypertension, I have developed small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibition of AT1R mRNA delivered in a DNA plasmid (pPlasRi-AT1R). Transfection of the recombinant plasmid into a mammanlian cell line resulted in strong expression of the transgenes and a significant reduction in the level of AT1R expression. pPlasRi-AT1R plasmid DNA was intravenously injected into adult spontaneously hypertensive rats at 1.5mg/kg. Telemetric blood pressure transducers were implanted into eight month old male SHR for long-term recording of blood pressure. Twenty-four hour intra-arterial blood pressure was measured weekly. After a 2 week control period animals were injected via the tail vein with AT1R DNA plasmid (n=6), control plasmid containing green fluorescent protein (GFP, n=6) or saline (NaCl, n=6)) and followed for 8 weeks. Additional animals were treated with the DNA plasmid or saline and euthanized at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks for determination of tissue AT1R expression using RT-PCR. Aims: (i) To develop an accurate radio-telemetry BP recording method in the SHR, (ii) To design rational siRNA sequences and select of methods for effective silencing in vitro, (iii) To measure the expression of DNA delivered RNAi-AT1R plasmid in vitro and in vivo, and (iv) To determine the in vivo effect of systemic delivery of DNA AT1R plasmid on BP. Methods: Continuous 24 h arterial BP was recorded by radio-telemetry using Maclab hardware and a transducer fixed in the abdominal aorta connected to a transmitter in the abdominal cavity. Data was analyzed using software specifically written for the project. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect AT1R transcripts in various tissues following in vivo AT1R gene delivery. BP was monitored weekly for 8 weeks following 1.5 mg DNA delivered RNAi -AT1R plasmid delivery into 8-month-old SHR by tail vein injection. SHR injected with DNA enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) plasmid or saline served as controls. Results: Weekly 24 h BP was successfully recorded for up to 10 weeks. Following transfection with DNA delivered RNAi -AT1R plasmid in vitro, expression of AT1R in transfected cells was determined by western blot, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Furthermore, RT-PCR was employed to confirm the AT1R mRNA levels. Following systemic delivery of RNAi-AT1R plasmid into middle-aged SHR, in animals injected with RNAi plasmid control blood pressure (150 +/- 1mmHg) was reduced 1week after injection (145 +/- 0.5 mm Hg, p&lt;0.05) with maximal reduction 4 weeks after injection (127 +/- 1 mmHg, p&lt;0.01). Blood pressure returned to control level by 8 weeks. There was no change in blood pressure in GFP plasmid or saline injected animals. Tissue expression of AT1R in heart, lung, kidney and liver was reduced following AT1R plasmid injection and was associated with reduction in pressure (r=0.99, p&lt;0.05 for each tissue). There were no significant adverse clinical or biochemical effects. AT1R silencing resulted in significant blood pressure reduction in 8 month old male SHR for approximately 2 months. There was a significant decrease in endogenous AT1R gene expression in tissues as determined by RT-PCR. The results suggest that the systemic delivery of siRNA against AT1R mRNA by DNA-based plasmid vector may have potential for gene therapy of hypertension and that further studies with the plasmid packaged into a recombinant DNA vector for a long-lasting siRNA effect are warranted. RNAi technology with inhibition of AT1R offers a potential new paradigm for the management of high blood pressure. Conclusions: Transfection of cells with DNA delivered RNAi -AT1R plasmid resulted in detection of AT1R transcript in transfected cells confirming a silencing effect in vitro. Significant BP reduction was induced in a group of middle-aged SHR following systemic delivery of DNA plasmid incorporating the siRNA against the AT1R gene. This correlated with significant decrease of endogenous AT1R in various tissues which supported the role of the gene therapy approach in producing a reduction in BP. In summary, the thesis lays the foundation for DNA delivered RNAi mediated AT1R gene delivery as a therapeutic strategy for hypertension. Future work should consider the possible benefits of DNA vector driven AT1R shRNA plasmid containing a regulated tissue-selective promoter and explore approaches which might extend the time during which the hypotensive effect is present</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hypertension</field><field name="subject">RNA interference</field><field name="subject">angiotensin II type 1 receptor</field><field name="subject">spontaneously hypertensive rat</field><field name="subject">gene therapy</field><field name="subject">gene delivery</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The NATAVUS Study Necessity And Technical Adequacy of Vascular Ultrasound Scans</field><field name="creator">Rebecca Jack</field><field name="description">Ultrasound has become a widely available imaging modality for the investigation of patients with a variety of clinical conditions. Concerns have been raised by clinicians and government alike that a sizeable proportion of this imaging may be unnecessary, inappropriate or of inadequate quality for patient management. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the opinions of treating vascular clinicians as to whether the vascular ultrasound imaging studies that patients bring with them when initially referred are necessary, and technically adequate to permit clinical decision-making for the patient&#8217;s management. Vascular clinicians Australia-wide were invited to participate in the study in April 2003. They were asked to recruit their next 50 consecutive new patients, eligible to be enrolled in the study, who presented with ultrasound scans organized by their referring doctor. The clinicians were asked to fill out a two-page proforma detailing the diagnosis, if known, and their opinion regarding the study and report, whether they required further information, and what investigations they would have ordered if seeing the patient for the first time, in a primary setting. 17 vascular clinicians Australia-wide agreed to participate in the study and to recruit their next 50 patients referred to them with vascular ultrasound imaging performed prior to specialist consultation. 473 Proformas were returned for analysis. Of all studies performed, 19 percent were judged unnecessary. Studies that were considered necessary however, were, in some cases, technically inaccurately or inadequately reported in 27 percent of cases, and 67 percent of these studies were then repeated. The NATAVUS Study has demonstrated that a significant percentage of ultrasound imaging performed by referring clinicians to vascular specialists is unnecessary, and that necessary imaging does not, in a large percentage of cases, provide accurate and adequate data to allow for specialist clinical decision-making. The data from this study has the potential to develop guidelines for appropriate use of vascular ultrasound imaging for various vascular conditions. If the results of this study were to be duplicated in a larger study, development and adoption of such guidelines would have the potential to generate significant cost savings to the health system by the elimination of some unnecessary testing. This is of particular relevance with Australia&#8217;s ageing population.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natavus, necessity, technical adequacy, vascular ultrasound</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic Properties of Cerium Oxides:Towards an Effective Valence Model Hamiltonian</field><field name="creator">Elvis Shoko</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis is to develop a minimal model Hamiltonian to describe the electronic properties of ceria (CeO$_{2}$) and its reduced phases. In order to do this, several energy scales of the problem were explored to determine their relative significance to the problem. These included the crystal electric field ($\Delta_{CEF}$), the spin-orbit coupling ($\lambda_{so}$), electron hopping ($t$), on-site Coulomb repulsion for the Ce $4f$ states ($U$), the reorganization energy ($\lambda_{0}$), the direct exchange ($J$) and the energy gap between the oxygen valence band level and the cerium $4f$ states ($\Gamma\epsilon$). Once the relative magnitudes of the various energy scales were determined, it was then possible to define a minimal set of degrees of freedom required to obtain a meaningful description of the system in the minimal model. The first task was to obtain baseline data for both CeO$_{2}$ and Ce$_{2}$O$_{3}$ as well as the metallic phases of Ce. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed on these materials to obtain band structures as well as structural properties. The DFT results indicated that both the LDA and GGA functionals perform poorly for $\gamma$-Ce and Ce$_{2}$O$_{3}$. In the case of Ce$_{2}$O$_{3}$, both LDA and GGA give a metallic ground state contrary to the insulator observed in experiment. The first set of energy scales that were investigated included the crystal electric field and the spin-orbit coupling. Since these calculations, except for the presence of a crystal field, involve an isolated Ce ion, the energy scales associated with spin and charge fluctuations at a Ce site are ignored. In order to perform these calculations, it was necessary to determine the $f^{n}$ configuration at each Ce site in the various phases of the oxides. This was achieved by a simple empirical model called the bond valence model. The bond valence model provides a method for calculating site valences in crystals from bond length data alone. Apart from getting information about the $f^{n}$ configurations at the various Ce sites, the results of the bond valence analysis revealed that there was significant mixed valence in the different phases of the cerium oxies. In addition, it was possible to characterize the charge distribution in the local environment of the oxygen vacancies from the bond valence results. This analysis led to the important result that the charge prefers Ce sites farthest away from the oxygen vacancy. This is contrary to the widely accepted view that the extra charge resulting from oxygen vacancy formation localizes on Ce sites closest to the O vacancy. The LDA calculations which support the widely accepted view do not properly treat electron correlations. Thus this is an important result which emphasizes the role of strong electron correlations in the processes of oxidation and reduction in these materials. The results of the crystal field calculations were not quantitative because we could not find data on crystal field parameters which is required to evaluate the matrix elements. However, it is expected that the splitting of the $f$ manifold by the crystal fields will be smaller than that of the spin-orbit coupling energy which is of the order of $0.07\unit{eV}$. Results for the Hubbard $U$ parameter in Ce oxides were obtained from the literature but these vary widely and fall in the range $1.0 - 10.5\unit{eV}$. The reorganization energy reported from spectroscopic results of the intervalence transition band for reduced ceria is $1.4\unit{eV}$. Tight-binding calculations were performed for CeO$_{2}$ to obtain the energy band structure for this material. It was then possible to extract from these results the matrix elements for electron hopping. The sizes of the matrix elements obtained suggested that the direct $f$-$f$ hopping between Ce sites ($t_{ff}$) is of order $0.02\unit{eV}$ which is negligible compared to the indirect hopping via an O atom (i.e., $t_{eff}$) which is of order $0.2\unit{eV}$. The hopping matrix element between a Ce site and a neighbouring O atom ($t_{fp}$) is even higher $\sim 0.5\unit{eV}$. The role of multiple orbitals on a Ce site was explored to determine the minimal set of orbitals to include in the effective model Hamiltonian. The results indicated that the essential physics could be described well by replacing the $4f$ manifold with two orbitals on a Ce site. The magnitudes of the energy scales of the problem decrease in the order $U &gt; \lambda_{0} &gt; t_{fp}&gt;t_{eff} &gt;\lambda_{so} \gg t_{ff} \approx \Delta_{CEF} \approx J$ with a high uncertainty on the last two relationships. The results of the above analysis led us to the conclusion that the only relevant energy scales for the effective model Hamiltonian are the On-site Coulomb repulsion for the Ce $4f$ states ($U$) and electron hopping between a Ce site and a neighbouring O site ($t_{fp}$). A minimal model Hamiltonian was then constructed to take into account the spin and charge fluctuations on a Ce site due to electron hopping between the Ce site and neighbouring O atoms. In this description, the strongly correlated ground states of cerium oxides is then described by a variational wavefunction whose main feature is that double occupancy of a Ce $f$ orbital is prohibited.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">02 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iron biology of schistosomes: molecular characterisation and vaccine potential of iron homeostasis proteins</field><field name="creator">Amber Glanfield</field><field name="description">Iron is a trace element required for a range of metabolic reactions in virtually all living organisms. Studies of prokaryotes, plants, yeast, and vertebrates have established detailed information on iron uptake and the role iron plays in metabolic processes. Iron is an essential growth requirement of schistosomes in vitro and schistosomes also express the highly conserved iron storage protein ferritin. However, studies into how this iron is taken up by the parasite have been neglected. This study aims to identify molecules involved in iron uptake and homeostasis in the human parasite Schistosoma japonicum. I have characterised two isoforms of a divalent metal transporter (DMT), a membrane bound protein of schistosomes. These DMTs have significant homology to the mammalian DMT1, the primary ferrous iron uptake protein of the intestinal brush border. Both schistosome isoforms displayed functional iron uptake by rescuing growth in a yeast strain deficient in iron uptake (fet3fet4). Interestingly schistosome DMT1 was localised to the tegument and not the gastrodermis of adult parasites, suggesting surface mediated iron uptake across the tegument. In physiological conditions, iron is abundant as largely insoluble ferric iron and hence ferric reductases are an essential component of iron uptake, reducing iron to the soluble ferrous form. Cytochromes b561 (Cyts-b561) are a family of ascorbate reducing transmembrane proteins found in most eukaryotic cells. Recent observations that Cyts-b561 may be involved in iron metabolism have opened new perspectives for their physiological function. Here, I have identified a new member of the cytochrome b561 family in Schistosoma japonicum that localises to the tegument of this trematode. Expression of the SjCytb561 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant that lacks plasma membrane ferrireductase activity (fre1fre2) was able to rescue the growth defect in iron deficient conditions, suggesting involvement in iron metabolism. Plasma membrane ferrireductase activities were also quantified using intact transformed yeast cells. These data further support the hypothesised tegumental uptake of host iron. Further, I have identified a putative schistosome transferrin. In mammals, transferrin is a glycoprotein responsible for binding and transporting iron in the bloodstream and delivering iron into cells via a specific transferrin receptor. Preliminary characterisation of the schistosome transferrin sequence has revealed it does not contain all the conserved amino acid residues associated with iron binding, with conservation seen only in the C-terminal lobe, not in both the N and C-lobes observed in mammalian transferrins. This difference makes it unclear whether the schistosome transferrin shares functional homology with its mammalian counterpart. In addition, no transferrin receptor has been identified to support an iron trafficking and uptake function, nor would this function be expected in an acoelomate organism. Further characterisation and localisation of this protein is required to elucidate its biological significance and function. The tegumental location of both the SjDMT1 and the SjCytb561 for the uptake of host iron make it possible to consider these proteins as potential vaccine candidates. A preliminary vaccination study with these proteins elicited only low to moderate protection from infection, and further studies are required to fully assess their potential. The data presented in this thesis provide evidence for surface-mediated uptake of iron by adult schistosomes, and represent the first characterisation of iron uptake proteins in any helminths. These studies show a novel method of iron uptake in schistosomes, and contribute to our understanding of how these parasites are able to survive and thrive by scavenging nutrients, in this case iron, from the host organism.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schistosomiasis</field><field name="subject">Iron Uptake</field><field name="subject">Transferrin</field><field name="subject">Vaccine</field><field name="subject">ferric reductase</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incubation biology of the Australian Brush-turkey (Alectura lathami)</field><field name="creator">Yvonne Eiby</field><field name="description">Temperature is arguably the most important abiotic factor influencing the embryonic development in ectothermic species. Incubation temperature has demonstrated effects on offspring phenotypes in ectotherms, including traits such as sex, size, shape, colouration and post-hatch growth and survival. However, in endotherms the influence temperature has on development is relatively unexplored due to the narrow range of temperatures that embryonic endotherms are exposed to during develop. Megapode birds utilize environmental heat sources to incubate their eggs and therefore provide a potential model to test how temperature influences embryonic development and offspring phenotypes in endotherms. I used the Australian Brush-turkey (Alectura lathami), a megapode bird that incubates its eggs in mounds of soil and leaf litter to investigate the effects of temperature on embryonic development and chick morphology. Previous reports of Australian Brush-turkey incubation mound temperatures relied on spot measurements and theoretical modeling and thus have not provided a comprehensive examination of the range of temperatures Brush-turkey embryos are exposed to and how these might vary during the course of incubation. Therefore to examine the range of temperatures experienced by developing embryos I continuously recorded the temperature of eggs and mound material at naturally occurring positions within incubation mounds over the full developmental period. As in previous studies I found the average incubation temperature to be about 34&#176;C, however egg temperatures typically fluctuated more than previously reported or predicted from modeling. The thermal tolerance of Brush-turkeys is remarkable compared to non-megapode birds, with embryos developing successfully despite prolonged exposure to sub-optimal temperatures over the range 25-40&#176;C. I also demonstrated that the incubation period was negatively correlated with mean incubation temperature. To simplify the examination of temperature effects on embryonic development, constant temperature artificial incubation of Brush-turkey eggs was used to determine influence of incubation temperature on the energetics of embryonic development and the sex ratio, morphology and chemical composition of chicks. Because initial investigation of mound temperatures determined the mean incubation temperature in Brush-turkeys to be 34&#176;C this was used as the preferred temperature for constant temperature incubation with 32&#176;C and 36&#176;C representing low and high temperatures respectively. Previously, the sex ratio of Brush-turkey chicks at hatching was shown to be temperature dependent. A thermally sensitive period early in development resulted in more females hatching from high temperature and more males hatching from low temperatures with an equal ratio at the preferred temperature. Using molecular sexing techniques to determine the sex of both failed embryos and chicks that hatched, I established that at laying the sex ratio of eggs was 50:50, and that temperature-dependent sex-biased embryo mortality was the mechanism behind the skewed sex ratio of chicks hatching from non-preferred temperatures. Low incubation temperature increased female embryonic mortality and high incubation temperature increased male embryonic mortality. This represents a novel mechanism operating to alter sex ratios in a bird species and offers an unparalleled system to explore sex allocation theory. It is well established that temperature influences the rate of development and the morphology of offspring in reptilian species. Also, in a previous study using artificially incubated Brush-turkey eggs, temperature was found to affect the mass of chicks but not their size (linear dimensions). This finding suggests that at different incubation temperatures the amount of yolk converted into tissue during embryonic development is influenced by incubation temperature. I tested this hypothesis by incubating eggs at different constant temperatures and found high incubation temperatures produce chicks with lighter yolk-free bodies and heavier residual yolks but similar linear dimensions compared to chicks hatching from lower temperatures. Because eggs incubated at low temperatures have longer incubation periods, I hypothesized the proportion of lipid in the yolk-free body would be higher in chicks emerging from eggs incubated at low temperature because more time is available for the conversion of yolk to fat bodies during embryonic development. This hypothesis was not supported as the composition of yolk-free chicks (total water, lipid, protein and ash) was not temperature dependent. A previous study in Malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata), another megapode bird, found that the total energetic cost of production was influenced by incubation temperature. Such that embryos developing at low temperatures required 72% more energy than embryos developing at high temperatures. However these findings were contrary to expectation from studies of reptilian incubation where the energetic cost of development is independent of temperature. Therefore I tested the hypothesis that the total energetic cost of development is temperature dependent in the Australian Brush-turkey. I used bomb calorimetry to measure the energy content of freshly laid eggs and of chicks (both the yolk-free body and residual yolk) that had hatched from eggs incubated 32oC, 34oC and 36oC. I found that the total energy content of chicks at hatching was greater in chicks emerging from eggs incubated at 34oC and 36oC compared to eggs incubated at 32oC. My thesis work demonstrated that incubation temperature is more variable for Brush-turkey embryos than for non-megapode birds and that even a small difference in temperature can have important effects on chick sex ratios, morphology and energy reserves. I have shown that incubation under artificial constant temperature conditions can significantly alter the developmental trajectories and phenotypic outcomes for chicks. In addition to laboratory based work, future studies should continue to examine how embryonic development and chick attributes are influenced by temperatures experienced under natural incubation conditions. Furthermore, investigation is required to determine how incubation temperature induced differences in hatchling phenotypes influence the post-hatch grow and fitness of chicks.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brush-turkey</field><field name="subject">Megapode</field><field name="subject">Incubation mound</field><field name="subject">Chick embryo</field><field name="subject">Yolk Sac</field><field name="subject">Sex Ratio</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">Energetic Costs</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and its determinants</field><field name="creator">Penelope Mcbride</field><field name="description">Context: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common skin cancer. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, its most important risk factor, has mostly been investigated in cross-sectional study designs. This study presents a comprehensive and longitudinal examination of determinants of SCC, including photoageing. Objective: To examine the determinants of SCC and its precursor condition of photoageing. Above all, the objective was to investigate the interplay of phenotypic traits; occupation and leisure-time sun exposure patterns; and personal exposures, in particular, tobacco smoking and life course sun exposure, upon the risk of SCC and photoageing. Setting and Design: This investigation formed part of a large community-based, long-term cohort study of skin cancer. The Nambour Skin Cancer Study (forthwith, the Nambour Study) began in 1986 and concluded in 2007. In 1986 a random sample of 2095 people (aged 20-69 years) from Nambour, Queensland participated in a skin cancer survey. In 1992, a 5 year field trial to assess the preventive actions of sunscreen and beta-carotene was initiated (n=1621). Regular full skin examinations were conducted to determine the presence of skin cancer and actinic skin damage. In 1994, participants detailed their life course sun exposure (n=1290). After the trial ended in 1996, participants continued to complete regular questionnaires and ascertainment of skin cancers continued to 2007. Participants: The participants were 1339 unselected adults aged 25 to 75 years who had taken part in the Nambour Study in 1992 and consented to the follow-up study. Methods: Life course sun exposure hours were estimated from questionnaires and the approximate UVR exposure for Nambour (latitude 26&#61616;S) was determined. Descriptive analyses examined patterns of exposure within the population. Factors influencing the severity of photoageing were also investigated. Informed by these analyses, relative risks were calculated for determinants of SCC and population attributable risk percentage (PAR%) for key modifiable risk factors. To investigate tobacco smoking as a risk factor for SCC, systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Exposure measures: Pigmentary phenotype, estimated UVR exposure, tobacco smoking, sun-related behaviours, e.g. sunscreen use. Outcome measures: Incident and histologically proven SCC of the skin from 1992 to 2007 was the main outcome assessed. Photoageing, assessed clinically and micro-topographically (Beagley and Gibson scale), was an intermediate outcome measure and an objective measure of cumulative sun exposure in the final SCC analysis. Results: Examination of self-reported UVR revealed mean annual exposures were highest in early life and older adulthood (older than 60 years.) Women reported spending less time in the sun than men in all stages of life (p&lt;0.05) and the more sun-sensitive the person&#8217;s skin type, the less sun exposure was reported at each life stage. The role of tobacco smoking in cutaneous SCC was reviewed in the published literature and a small positive association was noted in the meta-analysis. However, few studies had adjusted, or adjusted adequately, for sun exposure. Within the Nambour Study, with adjustment for age, sex, skin phenotype, lifetime sun exposure, current and former smoking had no association with SCC (RR 1.2, 95%CI 0.7, 2.0 and RR 1.1, 95%CI 0.8, 1.5, respectively compared with lifelong non-smokers). In this study population, with moderate to severe photoageing at study baseline, increasing age, male sex, a sun-sensitive phenotype were found to increase the odds of more severe actinic damage (p&lt;0.05). High or very high UVR exposure in adulthood predicted a greater severity (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.3, 4.0). Finally, the determinants of SCC were examined. Increasing age (4% increase per year of life, 95%CI 3% to 5%), male sex (RR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1, 1.9) and fair skin (RR 4.7 95%CI 2.0, 11.4) were associated with SCC. Having light eye colour and fair or red hair also significantly increased SCC risk. Recalled life course sun exposure overall was not found to be associated with SCC. Signs of actinic damage at baseline were, however, very strongly associated with SCC. Recent sun exposure, defined as that reported in the period (1-2 years) before the occurrence of SCC or for those unaffected at the end of the study, was also examined. A strong positive association was found between high recent exposure and SCC (RR 2.1, 95%CI 1.3, 3.3). PAR% estimates of prominent modifiable risk factors for SCC suggested considerable potential for reduction in incidence for at-risk populations if recent sun exposure were reduced. Conclusions: Subjective measures of solar UVR exposure and objective measures of photoageing varied according to personal and phenotypic factors. The interplay between risk factors observed here highlight the need to control for confounding in investigating solar factors as causes of skin cancer. Although SCC occurred on the background of high cumulative UVR exposure, which was best determined with objective rather than recalled measures, recent UVR exposure was also important. Self-reported recent exposure being less subject to recall bias than reported life course exposure may have partly influenced this, but the impact of UVR acting as a tumour initiator and promoter is also likely to explain the relation of SCC to sun exposure in the recent past.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, tobacco smoking, photoageing, epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Whose culture has capital?": Chinese skilled migrant mothers raising their children in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wu, Bin</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with a group of Chinese skilled migrant mothers&#8217; experiences in relation to their children&#8217;s early childhood care and education in New Zealand. Utilising Bourdieu&#8217;s concept of capital, habitus and field, the current research addresses the complexity and ambiguity of the Chinese migrant mothers' lives whose social position transcends multiple fields. Because their children attend mainstream education, and the local educational system is different from those where the migrant mothers were brought up, the migrant mothers had to transcend different cultural fields. Chinese skilled migrants, who were middle class professionals in their native country, usually experienced social and financial downturns in New Zealand. Although skilled, the migrant mothers encountered difficulties in finding paid employment that matched their pre-migration job status. These mothers were more likely to give up paid work or reduce paid working hours on the birth of their children than were their male partners. The current study focuses on these transcendent experiences, encompassing both embeddedness and ambiguity across different fields by examining the interplay of class, gender, and ethnicity in the daily lives of these mothers. Traditional interpretations of cultural capital usually refer only to dominant social and cultural capital, whereas the current thesis expands the concept to include both dominant and non-dominant forms of social and cultural capital. The findings showed that the migrant mothers redefined and reconstructed the concept of capital. The migrant mothers&#8217; attitude towards mainstream education was ambiguous and complex: covering the full spectrum from willing embracing, reluctantly following, selectively utilising to firmly rejecting. Simultaneously, the mothers promoted, criticised, and rejected various traditional Chinese practices and beliefs in order to maximise benefits for their children.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social and cultural capital, habitus, field</field><field name="subject">Gendered migration</field><field name="subject">Sociology of education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood education</field><field name="subject">Mothering</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity, social class, gender</field><field name="subject">Chinese migrants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forensic computing : a deterministic model for validation and verification through an ontological examination of forensic functions and processes</field><field name="creator">Beckett, Jason</field><field name="description">This dissertation contextualises the forensic computing domain in terms of validation of tools and processes.

However, SYS suffers from a serious defect, namely, that it is not possible to obtain an unbiased estimator of sampling variance (&#952;SYS) on the basis of a single sample. A variety of approximations have been suggested, and unbiased modelbased methods have been calculated, but validation of these estimators has been limited within the ecological literature. The heart of any spatial problem is how to deal with spatial autocorrelation. We show that the scale of spatial inference gives a framework that unifies the commonly reported, discordant views about autocorrelation (i.e. &#8216;autocorrelation increases the power of the analysis&#8217; vs &#8216;autocorrelation decreases the power of the analysis&#8217;). The scale of spatial inference is rarely discussed or considered, but we suggest that it should be the first step in any (spatial) analysis. The thesis then uses computer simulation to compare the performance of eleven previously proposed SYS estimators (including simple random sampling, 4SRS). The computer simulations are designed to recreate the spatial distribution characteristics that are common within ecological abundances. We also develop and test a novel method of estimating &#952;SYS based on &#8216;Krige&#8217;s Additivity Relationship&#8217; and variography (geostatistics). This estimator was labelled 4KAR. We found that if the right spatial model (i.e. a reference theoretical variogram) is used, then 4KAR appears to be an unbiased estimator of &#952;. Without a priori knowledge about the spatial structure (so the theoretical variogram is constructed solely from SYS data), 4KAR was generally one of the least biased and most stable estimators out of those examined. The other estimator that fared well, 4r1, was also model-based; it used an estimate of the first order autocorrelation in its estimate of &#952;. 4SRS performed comparatively well on untransformed ecological simulations, but was the worst performing estimator after a log(x+1) transformation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indoor wireless communication system performance enhancement via environmental modification</field><field name="creator">Lee, Derek C.

In the investigation, coordinated deployment of a wireless communication system with multiple base stations is considered in several single-floor office environments. The base stations, each servicing a cell, are assumed to operate at the same set of frequencies thus adjacent interference results. Two modification methods, namely, metal reflectors and metal shields, are considered to enhance desired signals and mitigate adjacent interference, respectively. Significant impact of both methods on the propagation channel is experimentally observed. The potential benefits of deploying structural shielding to control interference are considered. The levels of adjacent interference are estimated for different shielding strategies by an experimentally-validated ray-model, and the outage probabilities are computed with an interference-limited DS-CDMA system model. Deployment of structural shielding is shown to be most effective in drywall-partitioned environments and when the operating frequency is in the vicinity of 5 GHz. The average outage probability is shown to be reduced by approximately 94% and 90% at 1.8 GHz and 5.24 GHz, respectively, for a drywall-partitioned office environment after shielding 14% of the internal wall length. In open plan offices, the effectiveness of structural shielding is observed to diminish as the partition height reduces. Alternatively, considerable interference control is shown to be achieved by highly-reflective reflectors installed on the ceiling above the base stations. In the presence of a significant centrally-located environmental obstacle, the cost effectiveness of structural shielding deployment is shown to increase as the obstacle acts as an effective interference attenuator. If frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) are used instead of metal shields, a good shielding performance is shown to be achievable as long as the FSS stopband attenuation is maintained at above 20 dB for incident angles smaller than 50 degrees.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of mycoviruses in the plant pathogenic fungus, Botrytis cinerea</field><field name="creator">Howitt, Robyn L.J.</field><field name="description">ln recent years a lot of interest has focussed on the role of mycoviruses (fungal viruses) that confer reduced pathogenicity to their fungal hosts. In several plant pathogenic fungi viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) elements have been shown to be the agents responsible for this attenuation of virulence. In New Zealand and other temperate climates the plant pathogenic fungus, Botrytis cinerea is an important pathogen of many horticultural crops. Control of this grey mould disease still relies heavily on the use of fungicides to augment cultural practices- Consequently, there is now increasing interest in the use of biological control as an alternative means of control. This study reports the first large-scale survey of dsRNA elements in B. cinerea. Analysis of 200 New Zealand isolates from a range of hosts revealed 72% contained dsRNA, with high variation in dsRNA profiles, both within and between groups of fungal isolates from different hosts. DsRNA has been associated with isometric particles in many different fungi. In this study virus-like particles (VLPs) were observed in three of five dsRNA-containing isolates examined. Morphological types included isometric particles of varying size classes (approx' 30, 35, 40 and 45 nm) and bacilliform parricles (approx. 25 x 63 nm). In five isolates apparently lacking dsRNA no isometric or bacilliform particles were found but flexuous rods with a modal length of approx. 7ZO nm were detected in one of these isolates. Total RNA extraction of the various partially purified VLP preparations gave similar profiles to those obtained from mycelial dsRNA extractions of the same isolates, suggesting that the VLPs comprise encapsidated dsRNA. Comparison of 12 dsRNA-containing and 12 dsRNA-free isolates indicated slight differences between the two groups in radial growth rate, virulence on bean leaves and sclerotial number, but the differences were minor. ln summary, while dsRNA was found to be common among B. cinerea isolates in this study, the evidence did not reveal any marked phenotypic effects of dsRNA presence. The putative flexuous rod-shaped virus particles rn B. cinerea were studied further. Similar particles have been observed in fungi before but none have been characterised at the molecular level. This study reports the first complete nucleotide sequences of two such mycoviruses, Botrytis Virus F (BVF) and Botrytis Virus X (BVX), and also the first molecular characterisation of viruses infecting B. cinerea. The mycoviruses, which were both present in the same B. cinerea isolate, were similar in size and morphology to ssRNA plant viruses of the family Potexviridae. BVF and BVX contained ssRNA genomes af 6827 and 6966 nucleotides respectively, excluding poly(A) tails. Computer analysis of the genomic cDNA sequence of BVF revealed three potential open reading frames (ORFs) encoding putative proteins of 20 kDa (ORFI),212 kDa (ORFZ) and 32 kDa (ORF3). ORFI, which overlapped ORF2 by 467 nt, did not reveal significant homology with known protein sequences.O RF2, which showed significant sequence identity to the replicase proteins of the plant virus families Tymoviridae and potexviridae, contained a putative opal readthrough codon intermediate between the helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) regions. ORF3 shared amino acid homology with coat proteins of the family Potexviridae. A putative defective RNA (D RNA) of 829 nt was also detected which consisted of a 5' region of the parental genome fused in-frame to the terminal 3' end, complete with poly(A) tail. BVX revealed five potential ORFs encoding putative proteins of 158 kDa (ORFl), 30 kDa (ORF2), 44y,Da(ORF3), 14 kDa (ORF4) and l4kDa (ORFs). ORFI showed significant amino acid sequenceid entity to the replicase proteins and ORF3 to the coat proteins of the potexviridae. The remaining ORFs did not reveal significant homology with known protein sequences. This is the first report of sequence similarities between mycoviruses and the plant virus families Potexviridae and Tymoviridae. Comparisons of sequence and genome organisation suggest that the mycoviruses BVF and BVX may each belong to a new as yet unassigned genus in the plant virus family Potexviridae. An unexpected result from this study was the high level of identity observed between the derived amino acid sequences of the mycoviruses and plant viruses including a region of -7O% for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) region of BVX and similar regions in several potex-like viruses of AIIium spp. This high level of interviral homology has not previously been reported between the plant and fungal kingdoms and is possibly indicative of a recent divergence from a common ancestor. These results suggest that horizontal gene transfer between the plant and fungal kingdoms may occur more frequently than has been appreciated to date. If so it may play a significant role in viral evolution. In addition to providing novel phylogenetic information on the relationship between these morphological types of viruses in fungi and in plants, characterisation of these mycoviral genomes provides a possible strategy for incorporating genes into Botrytis using viruses as vectors. In this context Botrytis strains infected with modified viruses could provide a new approach for the biocontrol of grey mould.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AAV-vector mediated gene delivery for Huntington's Disease: an investigative therapeutic study</field><field name="creator">Kells, Adrian P</field><field name="description">Progressive degeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) of Huntington&#8217;s disease (HD) patients is a relentless debilitating process, resulting from the inheritance of a single gene mutation.  With limited knowledge of the underlying pathological molecular mechanisms, pharmaceutical intervention has to-date not provided any effective clinical treatment strategies to attenuate or compensate the neuronal cell death.  Attention has therefore turned to biotherapeutic molecules and novel treatment approaches to promote restoration and protection of selectively vulnerable populations of neurons in the HD brain. Rapid advances in vectorology and gene-based medicine over the past decade have opened the way for safe and efficient delivery of biotherapeutics to the CNS.  With numerous factors known to regulate the development, plasticity and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system many proteins have emerged as potential therapeutic agents to alleviate HD progression.  This investigative study utilised gene delivery vectors derived from the non-pathogenic adeno-associated virus (AAV) to direct high-level expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), Bcl-xL or X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) within the rodent striatum.  Maintenance of the basal ganglia and functional behaviour deficits were assessed following excitotoxic insult of the striatum by quinolinic acid (QA), a neurotoxic model of HD pathology.  Enhanced striatal expression of BDNF prior to QA-induced lesioning provided maintenance of the striosome-matrix organisation of the striatum, attenuating impairments of sensorimotor behaviour with a 36-38% increase in the maintenance of DARPP-32 / krox-24 expressing striatal neurons, reduced striatal atrophy and increased maintenance of striatonigral projections.  Higher levels of BDNF however induced seizures and weight-loss highlighting the need to provide regulatable control over biotherapeutic protein expression.  Continuous high-expression of BDNF or GDNF resulted in a downregulation of intracellular signal mediating proteins including DARPP-32, with AAV-GDNF not found to enhance the overall maintenance of striatal neurons.  Neither of the anti-apoptotic factors provided significant protection of transduced striatal neurons but tended towards ameliorating QA-induced behavioural deficits, displaying behaviour &#8211; pathology correlations with the survival of parvalbumin-expressing neurons in the globus pallidus.  The results of this thesis suggest BDNF as a promising putative biotherapeutic for HD, but emphasises the requirement to control expression following gene delivery, and for further elucidation of the physiological impact that enhanced expression of endogenous factors has on the host cells.  Additionally the maintenance of neural networks beyond the caudate-putamen will be vital to ensuring efficient clinical outcomes for HD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Huntington's Disease</field><field name="subject">Gene Delivery</field><field name="subject">Adeno-associated virus</field><field name="subject">Brain derived neurotrophic factor</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::329900 Other Medical and Health Sciences::329903 Therapies and therapeutic technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences::320702 Central nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Comparative Form, Function and Ecology of some New Zealand Brittle-Stars (Ophiuroidea)</field><field name="creator">Pentreath, Richard John</field><field name="description">In her classic review of the echinoderms, Hyman (1955), describes the ophiuroids as "the most successful echinoderm group living today".

J. (Thomas J.)</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with a theoretical, laboratory and in situ investigation of the propagation of seismic stress waves through soil media. Analyses are carried out to predict the surface response that results from earthquake motions being transmitted through the upper layers of the earth. The nature of the near surface geological layers affect to a marked degree the intensity of surface motion. The mathematical models presented are used in the evaluation of site response to earthquakes. The theoretical methods used depart from the traditional viscoelastic approach and use a nonlinear hysteretic soil model to describe the complex dynamic stress-strain relationships evident in soil response. The dynamic soil model is based on previous laboratory work carried out at this university. The theoretical solutions formulated are limited to one-dimensional situations. Three methods of analysis are presented for the propagation of seismic shear waves through nonlinear soil media and conclusions are drawn as to the best approach. The results of these analyses are generally significantly different from those obtained using a viscoelastic soil model. Seismic dilatational waves are also considered important and a method is presented to calculate the response of hysteretic soil media to these disturbances. The outcome from these dilatational and shear wave analyses is more accurate surface response spectra for use in aseismic structural design.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel diagnostic technologies for optical communication systems</field><field name="creator">Watts, Regan Trevor</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis was to develop novel technologies for measuring the physical characteristics of high-speed pulse trains, for use in performance monitoring applications. This thesis describes the development of three separate techniques that perform measurements in either the time domain, frequency domain or the phase space of the optical signal. The first section investigates phase-sensitive pulse measurement techniques. A high- resolution SHG-FROG apparatus was custom-designed to measure 40GHz RZ pulse trains, from which an operational characterisation of a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) was realised. A numerical model of a nonlinear pulse compressor was developed to compress 40GHz RZ pulses from 8.5ps down to 3.4ps. These pulses were time-division multiplexed to 80GHz, and phase-retrievals of the 80GHz pulse trains were measured. A comparison between the techniques of SHG-FROG and linear spectrogram has been undertaken for 10GHz pulse sources, exposing SHG-FROG's weaknesses at this particular repetition rate. The second section investigates a simple, time-averaged, nonlinear detection technique. Two-photon absorption in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum-well laser diode was used to measure the duty cycle (and by extension, the pulse duration) of a range of pulse sources. This technique was further developed to measure the extinction ratio of NRZ pulse trains. Additionally, the pulse duration of a mode-locked laser source was measured using the nonlinear absorption in a 1-m length of As2Se3 Chalcogenide glass fiber. This demonstrates that the nonlinear properties of this glass may well find application in future instrumentation. The third section investigates the development of an ultra-high resolution swept heterodyne spectrometer. This spectrometer was used to spectrally-distinguish repetitive 8-bit NRZ patterns at 2.5Gbit/s. It was also used to measure the chirp parameter of an X-cut LiNbO3 MZM, revealing a chirp parameter of &#945;&#960;/2 &lt; 0.1 across a modulation band- width of 250-2500MHz. Additionally, the distinctive CW spectrum of a DFB laser diode was measured. Analysis of the measured CW spectrum yielded a linewidth enhancement factor of &#945;&#8771; 1.8 and also the relative intensity noise of the DFB laser diode.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical Performance Monitoring</field><field name="subject">FROG</field><field name="subject">Linear Spectrogram</field><field name="subject">Two-Photon Absorption</field><field name="subject">Chalcogenide Glass</field><field name="subject">Heterodyne Spectrometer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibin-like activity in bull seminal plasma</field><field name="creator">Peek, John Charles</field><field name="description">Testicular function is stimulated from the pituitary gland by the gonadotrophic hormones FSH and LH. The testis in turn regulates gonadotrophin secretion by negative feedback. The agents of feedback are steroids, and in addition, probably a protein hormone, which has been given the name inhibin. A method capable of detecting inhibin-like activity in bull seminal plasma (bSP) was developed. Administration of bSP at the time of castration to five-week old male rats inhibited the post-castration rise of serum concentrations of FSH and LH otherwise seen 24 h later. The degree of inhibition depended on the dose; 0.5 ml bSP or the equivalent amount of bSP-extract always suppressed FSH and LH to levels typical of intact rats. The rats' sensitivity to 0.2 ml bSP varied with the time of year, possibly reflecting seasonal changes in the onset of puberty. The time-course of action of bSP-extract was studied in intact rats. Serum FSH was suppressed 12, 24 and 48 h after a single injection, but not at 3 or 6 h. LH was suppressed at 6, 12, 24 and possibly 48 h.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Least-squares optimal interpolation for direct image super-resolution : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gilman, Andrew</field><field name="description">Image super-resolution aims to produce a higher resolution representation of a scene from an ensemble of low-resolution images that may be warped, aliased, blurred and degraded by noise. There are a variety of methods for performing super-resolution described in the literature, and in general they consist of three major steps: image registration, fusion and deblurring. This thesis proposes a novel method of performing the first two of these steps. The ultimate aim of image super-resolution is to produce a higher-quality image that is visually clearer, sharper and contains more detail than the individual input images. Machine algorithms can not assess images qualitatively and typically use a quantitative error criterion, often least-squares. This thesis aims to optimise leastsquares directly using a fast method, in particular one that can be implemented using linear filters; hence, a closed-form solution is required. The concepts of optimal interpolation and resampling are derived and demonstrated in practice. Optimal filters optimised on one image are shown to perform nearoptimally on other images, suggesting that common image features, such as stepedges, can be used to optimise a near-optimal filter without requiring the knowledge of the ground-truth output. This leads to the construction of a pulse model, which is used to derive filters for resampling non-uniformly sampled images that result from the fusion of registered input images. An experimental comparison shows that a 10th order pulse model-based filter outperforms a number of methods common in the literature. The use of optimal interpolation for image registration linearises an otherwise nonlinear problem, resulting in a direct solution. Experimental analysis is used to show that optimal interpolation-based registration outperforms a number of existing methods, both iterative and direct, at a range of noise levels and for both heavily aliased images and images with a limited degree of aliasing. The proposed method offers flexibility in terms of the size of the region of support, offering a good trade-off in terms of computational complexity and accuracy of registration. Together, optimal interpolation-based registration and fusion are shown to perform fast, direct and effective super-resolution.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image resolution</field><field name="subject">optimal filters</field><field name="subject">optimal interpolation</field><field name="subject">image registration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software::291601 Arithmetic and logic structures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of migration on development in Tuvalu : a case study of PAC migrants and their families : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simati, Sunema Pie</field><field name="description">International migration and development have been traditionally treated as separate policy portfolios; however, today the two are increasingly viewed as interlinked. While the development status of a country could determine migration flows, migration can, in turn, contribute positively to national development, including economic, social and cultural progress. Consequently, if migration is not well managed, it can pose development challenges to a country&#8217;s development and progress. Therefore, partnership through greater networking between countries of origin and destination is needed to fully utilise the development potential of migration. For Tuvalu, migration has remained a vital ingredient for economic development and more importantly, the welfare of its people. The implementation of New Zealand&#8217;s Pacific Access Category (PAC) scheme in 2002 offered for the first time a formal migration opportunity for permanent or long-term migration of Tuvaluans. The PAC scheme allows 75 Tuvaluans per year to apply for permanent residence to work and live in New Zealand, provided they meet the scheme&#8217;s conditions. The goal of this research is to investigate, more than five years after PAC&#8217;s implementation, the ways in which long-term migration of Tuvaluans, through the PAC scheme, has benefited Tuvalu. To give a broader perspective on the issues explored in this study, the views of Tuvaluan leaders, as significant players in traditional Tuvaluan society, are included, in addition to the perspective of migrants&#8217; families in Tuvalu and the migrants themselves in New Zealand. Combining transnationalist and developmental approaches as a theoretical framework, this thesis explores how Tuvalu&#8217;s mobile and immobile populations, through articulation of transnationalism, enhance family welfare, and grassroots and national development. The eight weeks&#8217; fieldwork in Tuvalu and Auckland demonstrated that the physical separation of Tuvaluans from one another through migration does not limit the richness of the interactions and connections between them. In fact, the existence of active networking between island community groups and other Tuvaluan associations in Auckland and in Tuvalu strengthens the Tuvaluan culture both abroad and at home, thus ensuring strong family and community coherence. Maintaining transnational networks and practices is identified as of great significance to grassroots and community-based development in Tuvalu. However, the benefits of long-term migration can only be sustained as long as island loyalty, or loto fenua, and family kinship stays intact across borders, and networking amongst families, communities and church remains active.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Tuvalu</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An application of Malmquist productivity index to compare technological and growth differences between traditional and non-traditional dairy regions in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Agribusiness at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Laca-Vina, Hector</field><field name="description">The NZ dairy industry has adopted an encompassing measure of performance, total factor productivity (TFP), as a target measure to guide on-farm improvements. Dairy farmers pay a levy in order to fund agricultural research and extension. Extension services and R&amp;D will continue to be of critical importance to maintain and improve productivity at the farm level. Consequently, it is in the best interest of the dairy industry to adequately target R&amp;D and extension funds and make the best use of resources. To date, the methodology employed to estimate productivity growth has some shortcomings that seriously hamper the ability of potential users to extract useful information from it. First, productivity growth has been reported as an aggregate for the entire dairy industry. Second, it makes no assumption about the efficiency with which resources are being used. Third, it implicitly assumes that all farms face the same technology. Productivity growth can be achieved either through better (more efficient) use of the technology applied, through the adoption of a new technology (technical progress) or a combination of both. Given that the sources of productivity change&#8212;technical progress and technical efficiency change&#8212;are fundamentally different phenomena, they are, in turn, influenced by different factors. This distinction is important for policy orientation because different instruments/tools may be required to address them. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that a variety of farming systems have emerged as a result of dairy farming geographical expansion. Farm-level panel data were used to estimate the Malmquist productivity change index. This index can provide additional insights since it can be decomposed into two additional components, one that measures changes in technical efficiency (i.e., whether firms are getting closer to the production frontier over time), and one that measures changes in technology (i.e., whether the production frontier is moving outwards over time). Hence, it provides individual (farm) estimates of TFP. Moreover, the methodology applied allows to test whether farms in the two regions considered in this study are operating under the sametechnology. These two regions were the long-established dairy areas of Waikato-Taranaki and the newly developed dairy areas of Canterbury-Southland. Results for farms in Waikato-Taranaki indicate that annual TFP change is modest, ranging from 0.29% per annum to 0.59% per annum. Most importantly, technical progress is the only source of TFP change in all four models. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage investments in new R&amp;D targeted to remove the technological constraints that impede the realisation of further productivity gains in the regions. However, important differences in the estimates of TFP, technical progress and change in technical efficiency between models were found for farms in Canterbury-Southland. Estimates of TFP change ranged from 0.7% per annum to 2.8% per annum. Even though technical progress and change in technical efficiency contributed to total factor productivity growth (TFPG), the latter component was the most important contributor in three of the four models. Moreover, in two models the rate of technical progress was negative (i.e., technical regress). The analyses indicate that dairy farms in Canterbury-Southland were on average 10% more productive than farms in Waikato-Taranaki when farms in both regions faced the frontier. These results were consistent for all the input/output set chosen. Furthermore, the null hypothesis that the two regions do not face the same production technology (i.e., each region has it own production frontier) was accepted irrespective of the input/output set chosen. The rejection of the null hypothesis, that farms in traditional and non-traditional dairy regions were operating under the same underlying technology (and hence face the same production frontier), called for a review of the traditional approach to R&amp;D in one central experimental station, strengthening the need for a local approach through the promotion of networks and synergies with universities and other research institutions.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand dairy industry productivity</field><field name="subject">Malmquist productivity index</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of family and community resilience in Indigenous wellbeing.</field><field name="creator">McLennan, Vanette</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous health</field><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Wellbeing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liberal Islam in Indonesia - from revelation to reason and freedom: the Mu'tazilites, Harun Nasution and the Liberal Islam Network</field><field name="creator">Bool, Philip John Gill</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how reason and freedom have been expressed in Islam through a study of the Mu'tazilite movement in 8th century Persia, the Indonesian Islamic scholar and educator Harun Nasution and the Liberal Islam Network formed in Indonesia in 2001.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liberal Islam, Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some problems in high dimensional data analysis</field><field name="creator">Pham, Tung Huy</field><field name="description">The bloom of economics and technology has had an enormous impact on society.

Nonadherence rates are particularly high among those with major mental health problems and account for a significant proportion of hospitalisations due to relapse in conditions previously well-managed by medications. Therefore, interventions to enhance the adherence of patients with mental health disorders should be an essential part of mental health services; however this is not always the case. This thesis involved a series of studies which investigated barriers to the implementation of adherence interventions, in particular, clinician skills, attitudes and knowledge, as well as describing a potential strategy to overcome these barriers.  The first study investigated the relationship between the beliefs and knowledge mental health nurses hold about medications and how this influences their self-reported use of strategies to enhance patient adherence to treatment. Participants comprised a convenience sample of 64 mental health nurses who completed questionnaires on their beliefs about medicines, their knowledge of neuroleptic medications and their self-reported difficulties in using commonly cited strategies for enhancing patient adherence. The results indicated that both poorer knowledge and more negative attitudes were associated with greater perceived difficulty in implementing standard adherence strategies.   The first study provided the impetus for a closer examination of specific clinician attitudes in relation to working with non-adherent patients and how such attitudes might influence clinician behaviour. Study 2 was a cross-sectional anonymous survey of 292 mental health clinicians and explored their attitudes about nonadherence in patients.  Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the attitudes items produced a 19 item, 5 factor scale: the Medication Alliance Beliefs Questionnaire (MABQ). The MABQ subscale &#8216;Adequacy&#8217;, (beliefs about the the sufficiency of the clinicians&#8217; own knowledge and skills in working with people who have nonadherence issues), was found to predict the extent to which mental health clinicians tried to enhance patient adherence.   The first two studies identified deficits in clinician skills, knowledge and attitudes as significant barriers to the implementation of adherence interventions. A clinician training program called &#8220;Medication Alliance&#8221; was then developed which specifically targeted skills, attitudes and knowledge relevant to the enhancement of patient medication adherence. Study 3 provided an initial evaluation of this training program in terms of the extent to which clinician participants showed improved skills, had enhanced knowledge and more positive attitudes toward working on adherence issues (using the MABQ). Participants were 23 experienced mental health workers who worked actively with non-adherent patients. The results indicated pre-post training improvements in all three domains (skills, knowledge and attitudes).   The first three studies identified the barriers to the implementation of adherence interventions, (clinician skills, knowledge and attitudes), and demonstrated that the Medication Alliance training program could improve these three clinician domains. Study 4 sought to determine whether Medication Alliance could be implemented in practice by clinicians and whether this resulted in improvements in patient adherence and reductions in levels of mental ill-health. A total of 46 clinicians participated in an &#8216;implementation trial&#8217; of Medication Alliance, with 51 patients providing clinical data. Data was collected at baseline, 6 months following clinician training and then again at 12 months post training. As with Study 3, improvements in clinician knowledge, attitudes and skills coincided with training. In an extension of these findings, most of these improvements were maintained over a 12 month period. It was also shown that clinicians&#8217; ratings of patients&#8217; adherence and their rating of therapeutic alliance also increased over the 12 month period.  Patients demonstrated improved insight into the need for treatment and reduced psychopathology. Overall, the results of Studies 1 through 4 indicated that clinician&#8217;s attitudes are an important consideration in implementing adherence strategies and that these attitudes can be successfully improved as a result of training. Further, preliminary research suggests that clinicians can learn, sustain and implement skills to facilitate medication adherence in their patients. Finally, these training effects appear to be associated with improvements in adherence and mental health in patients.   Although results from these implementation studies are encouraging, there is a need for a randomised clinical trial of Medication Alliance training compared to treatment as usual or a viable comparison intervention.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charge collection in PET detectors</field><field name="creator">Young, Tony</field><field name="description">Improving the spatial resolution in PET will increase the chance of accurate diagnosis of cancer. PET detectors are comprised in part of detectors such as photomultiplier tubes or solid state photodetectors optically coupled to scintillation materials, such as BGO or LSO. In this thesis a study of recently developed photodiode detectors, SPAD4 photodiodes, and LYSO crystals has been undertaken to investigate these properties. As part of this research IV (current-voltage) and CV (capacitance-voltage) characterization measurements were carried out on the photodetectors and results indicate they are of excellent quality. Ion Beam Induced Charge Collection (IBICC) measurements were undertaken to fundamentally investigate the effect of bias on the efficiency and uniformity of charge collection within the photodetector. A reverse bias operating voltage of 50 V was eventually chosen as the optimum bias voltage for the SPAD4 photodiode for the gamma ray spectroscopy and timing resolution experiments that followed the IBICC characterisation. Charge collection uniformity was found to be excellent at this optimum voltage. An investigation into the surface treatment of LYSO crystal and cladding was also completed. Physical measurements and simulations were conducted and the results are compared. Past simulation results have demonstrated that scintillation crystals produced a higher output when the surface was rough as opposed to the industry standard smooth polished surface [1]. Physical measurements and comparisons have also been completed with saw cut finish crystals and chemically etched crystals [2, 3]. Simulations were completed with &#8220;Scintillation Program&#8221;, a simulation code developed at the CMRP, and DETECT2000. Measurements completed for this thesis produced no significant change in the deduced scintillator light output after roughening a crystal side. Timing resolution in commercial PET scanners ranges from 8 to 16ns. Experimentally with a photomultiplier tube coupled to a photodiode, timing resolution as low as 9.4ns FWHM has been achieved [4]. Coincidence timing resolution measurements using standard NIM (Nuclear Instrumentation Module) electronic modules were taken with a iv NaI-photomultiplier tube and the LYSO-SPAD4 photodiode module. The best result obtained was a FWHM coincident time resolution of 22 ns, which is similar to past results. The SPAD4 photodiode and LYSO crystal combination show promise as the basis for a future PET detectors module, although further work needs to be completed to improve the timing performance.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poverty and inequality in Nepal: an analysis of deprivation index 2003-04</field><field name="creator">Bista, Chirangivi</field><field name="description">Poverty in Nepal is widespread, complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon. Both the incidence of poverty (31%) and income inequality (0.37%) is high. This is the result of rapid urbanization process coupled with extended internal conflict and political instability. And, this has serious consequences especially in urban areas where the gaps between &#8216;haves&#8217; and &#8216;haves not&#8217; is highly elevated. On the contrary, rural inequality is declining gradually. The key macro economic indicators for the country show generally poor economic conditions. A huge amount of resources is being injected in the form of nation wide poverty alleviation programmes. However, the achievement level has been very limited.The main objective of the thesis is to study poverty and income inequality in Nepal during post reform period. This is undertaken by exploring the factors explaining the deprivation index from a recent household survey. For this purpose, the study employs factor analysis technique to formulate the deprivation index and run regression to analyse key determinants of deprivation.The result shows that the age and gender of households head, place of residence, educational levels basically primary and secondary schooling, occupational status mainly in the service sectors, status of financial burden in a household and access to basic services are important indicators of deprivation and poverty in the context of Nepal.Poverty levels are highly concentrated in rural areas. A rural resident is more likely to be vulnerable to deprivation than her/his urban counterpart. Deprivation is negatively associated with livestock and positively associated with the degree of indebtedness. The educational attainment of the household head is the most important factor determining the likelihood of a person being in poverty or suffering deprivation. Similarly, households which spends more time to access basic facilities i.e. schools, hospital, markets and road networks etc. are mostly deprived. Empirical evidences suggest that these key findings are also conventional to a developing country.

The pathology industry provided the greatest scope for illicit profits through offers of kickbacks and inducements from pathology companies to referring general practitioners and this practice fuelled the growth of entrepreneurial medicine. Whistleblowers in the late 1970s and early 1980s campaigned for legislative and administrative change, but the reform agenda was more successful when it was led by a managing director of the Health Insurance Commission committed to change. These events are contextualised by several theoretical perspectives, including Foucault&#8217;s theory of governmentality, the sociology of insurance and of whistleblowing.The challenges for the 21st century are to maintain the level of resources needed to provide the intensive policing required for the regulation of the financial abuse of medical benefits particularly in the area of electronic fraud and sophisticated criminal fraud.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of information systems in marketing: a study of empowerment in electronic commerce</field><field name="creator">Al-Dalahmeh, Mahmoud Ali</field><field name="description">This thesis describes post-positivist research in the field of Information Systems (IS), more specifically in Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce). Information systems (IS) and information technology (IT) both play a major role in improving productivity and competitive edge in e-commerce (Lin and Benjamin, 2000). The existence of IS does not depend on computers but it is the utilisation of computers and technology that produces a viable IS system (Davis and Olson, 1985).E-commerce is considered as a new type of information system and was defined by Poong (2006, p. 553) as &#8220;an information system that provides catalogues of products over the World Wide Web&#8221;. Despite the deep employment of technology in Information Systems (IS), they are regarded as social systems. Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce has been rapidly changing the competitive landscape of retailing and service industries. Despite its claimed benefits, this innovative mode of retailing has not yet been accepted by every buyer. For company managers, the delays in the adoption of information systems such as e-commerce systems, and the empowerment of e-commerce users are recognised as a dilemma. An interesting question is why some users accept the idea of online shopping more readily than others. This study aims at helping to improve information systems applications for e-commerce in the complex, technology-oriented marketing sector. This thesis innovates a model to empower e-commerce users based on key critical factors that affect this technology. The core factors in this model are e-commerce self efficacy, Personal Innovation in Information Technology (PIIT), system ease of use, system experience, and technology anxiety. The model was empirically tested in a field experimental setting, using a real retail website for the purchasing decisions. The participants in this study were students at the University of Wollongong in Australia, as they are normal users of e-commerce. The Amazon.com website was chosen for this study, as this website is usually used by university students to buy books and CDs. The results of the investigation were tested using factor analysis and partial least square (PLS). The empirical testing provides support for the proposed theoretical model by explaining seventy-eight percent (78%) of the variance in the users&#8217; intention to use e-commerce systems.The implications of this study are both theoretical and practical. At the theoretical level, this study combined four models in one model. The first model, by Compeau et al. (1999)1, put social cognitive theory into practice for the IT area. The second model, by Thatcher and Perrewe (2002)2, applied personal innovation in information technology, trait anxiety, and computer anxiety to computer self-efficacy. Henry and Stone&#8217;s (1995)3 model is the third model used, as it employed ease of use and system experience in computer self-efficacy and outcome expectation. The final model was constructed by Kim and Kim (2005)4 and used specific self-efficacy (online trading self-efficacy) in customer trust, perceived risk, and buying intention. Therefore, it can be positively confirmed that this research model is a solid model, as it unites these four models into one to generate a clarification of users&#8217; behaviour in the framework of e-commerce utilisation.At the practical level, the study shows that adoption of e-commerce systems is directly, significantly and positively affected by e-commerce self-efficacy, outcome expectation (perceived usefulness), system ease of use, and system experience. It is proposed that individuals with higher levels of e-commerce self-efficacy, outcome expectation, system experience, and perceived system ease of use are more likely to perform an online transaction than those experiencing lower levels of these concepts. The study makes significant contributions across all areas of IT adoption and usage research and practice. There is justification for claiming that the study model will empower the application of management information systems for e-commerce.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and synthesis of novel cationic peptide antibiotics</field><field name="creator">Boyle, Timothy P.</field><field name="description">The results of the research on the development of novel cationic peptoids as potential new antibacterial agents is presented in this thesis. The series of macrocyclic peptoids prepared in this study arises from a previously identified lead which was designed to act as a vancomycin mimic, and possessed many of the features believed to be necessary for antibacterial activity. Chapters 2 and 4 describe the design and synthesis of a number of structurally different cyclised and linear peptoids, which were produced from a multi-step synthetic pathway. The basic strategy involved the synthesis of a hydrophobic scaffold, to which a cationic peptide was attached. Compounds described in Chapter 2 contained two remote allyl substituents which were utilized in the reliable ring-closing metathesis reaction to produce the desired macrocycles. Subsequent removal of the amino acid residue protecting groups yielded the desired targets for antibacterial testing. A total of 163 compounds were synthesized, including 146 new compounds. In Chapters 3 and 5, the results from the antibacterial testing assays against Staphylococcus aureus (Chapters 3 and 5) and several vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) strains (Chapter 5), are discussed and structure-activity trends are highlighted. It was found that for antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus and VRE strains, a (S)-1,1&#8217;-binaphthyl hydrophobic scaffold must be present (MIC 3.9 &#61549;g/mL against Staphylococcus aureus and 15.6 &#61549;g/mL against the VRE for one such derivative). Chapter 6 reports the screening of several peptoids against the HIV integrase enzyme. From the screening, key structure activity trends were observed and a preliminary computational model indicating the mechanism of binding and inhibition is proposed. Four target compounds were prepared to justify the preliminary model.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of imperfect mixing in suspended plant and animal cell cultures</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Caleb Kin Lok, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A common problem observed in large-scale cell cultivation is reduced culture performance compared with small-scale processes due to the existence of concentration gradients caused by poor mixing. Small-scale simulations using microbial cell suspensions have shown that circulation of cells through concentration gradients of oxygen, pH and glucose can result in reduction of cell growth and product formation similar to the effects observed in large-scale bioreactors. This study was aimed at using scale-down studies to investigate poor mixing in large-scale bioreactors used for suspended plant and animal cell culture. Two plant cell suspensions and a hybridoma cell line were used in this work. The range of oxygen transfer coefficients achieved in the hybridoma and plant suspensions were about 50???20 h-1 and 12???6 h-1, respectively. One-vessel simulation was developed to induce fluctuations of dissolved oxygen tension in a 2-L bioreactor using intermittent sparging of air and nitrogen. The effect of dissolved oxygen fluctuations on the cells was examined by comparing the performance of the cultures with those operated at constant dissolved oxygen tension. In the hybridoma suspension culture, only slight effects on cell growth were observed at circulation times above 300 s. No effect on the specific glucose uptake rate or antibody production was observed at the circulation times tested. Analysis of gene expression for selected hypoxia-related genes also suggested that the overall effect was limited. In plant cell suspensions, the specific growth rates and biomass yields on total sugar in the cultures under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension were essentially the same as those at constant dissolved oxygen tension for both transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Thalictrum minus. Under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension, no effect on antibody accumulation was observed in transgenic N. tabacum suspensions, but a decrease in berberine accumulation was observed in T. minus. From the results, it can be concluded that only minimal effects due to the development of concentration gradients would be expected in large-scale bioreactors used for the cultivation of the hybridoma and plant cell suspensions tested in this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Plant cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient computation of advanced skyline queries.</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Yidong, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Skyline has been proposed as an important operator for many applications, such as multi-criteria decision making, data mining and visualization, and user-preference queries.  Due to its importance, skyline and its computation have received considerable attention from database research community recently. All the existing techniques, however, focus on the conventional databases. They are not applicable to online computation environment, such as data stream. In addition, the existing studies consider efficiency of skyline computation only, while the fundamental problem on the semantics of skylines still remains open. In this thesis, we study three problems of skyline computation: (1) online computing skyline over data stream; (2) skyline cube computation and its analysis; and (3) top-k most representative skyline. To tackle the problem of online skyline computation, we develop a novel framework which converts more expensive multiple dimensional skyline computation to stabbing queries in 1-dimensional space.  Based on this framework, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the time complexity of online skyline computation is provided. Then, efficient algorithms are proposed to support ad hoc and continuous skyline queries over data stream. Inspired by the idea of data cube, we propose a novel concept of skyline cube which consists of skylines of all possible non-empty subsets of a given full space.  We identify the unique sharing strategies for skyline cube computation and develop two efficient algorithms which compute skyline cube in a bottom-up and top-down manner, respectively.  Finally, a theoretical framework to answer the question about semantics of skyline and analysis of multidimensional subspace skyline are presented. Motived by the fact that the full skyline may be less informative because it generally consists of a large number of skyline points, we proposed a novel skyline operator -- top-k most representative skyline. The top-k most representative skyline operator selects the k skyline points so that the number of data points, which are dominated by at least one of these k skyline points, is maximized.  To compute top-k most representative skyline, two efficient algorithms and their theoretical analysis are presented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Database management.</field><field name="subject">Database design.</field><field name="subject">Question-answering systems.</field><field name="subject">Natural language processing (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Semantics - Data processing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Arab as spectacle: race, gender and representation in Australian popular culture</field><field name="creator">Abood, Paula, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis, The Arab as Spectacle, is about representation. It is about the limits and the contradictions of representation. It is about the burden and the violence of representation. It is about the persistence of Orientalism and how the hierarchies of race and gender intersect with discourses on sexuality to inform and inflect the representation of Arabs in contemporary literary and media spheres of Australian popular culture. This thesis comprises two sections. Part One is a research dissertation that explores the strategies, devices and parameters of the representation of Arabic culture and identities through close readings of specific texts. This theoretical project inaugurates the second part of my study which takes up the question of the contradictions of representation through a collection of ficto-critical writings. Through these satirical narratives, I seek to expose and disrupt the hegemony of Orientalist representations that proliferate in English language literature and news media by bringing into focus the inherent paradox of representation, working within and against Orientalist representational traditions. In so doing, it is not my aim to 'correct' the Orientalist logic and imagery that I theorise in the first part of this thesis, but rather to undermine the spurious truth-value of Orientalist representations by deploying the literary weapons of satire, parody and irony. In this way, my fiction works to engage creatively and critically with the very tropes that I theorise in my research dissertation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orientalism.</field><field name="subject">Representation (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Arabs in popular culture -- Western countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theory-based description of Australian franchising regulation</field><field name="creator">Moore, Gregory Allison, Business Law &amp; Taxation, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This paper examines franchising regulation in Australia as a case study for the analysis of regulation based on established regulatory theory. A literature review is conducted to establish and critique the theory of regulation based on the four main areas of established theory; regulatory purpose, regulatory strategies, rulemaking and enforcement. Case study data is drawn from primary source material and academic commentary on franchising regulation and presented according to the eras of franchising regulation in Australia, moving from the first proposals for legislation in the 1970s to the prescribed mandatory Franchising Code of Conduct model adopted in 1998 and refinements made to that scheme up to 2006. An analysis is then conducted on each major aspect of Australian franchising regulation using the established theoretical principles and analytical constructs available in the literature. The study concludes that the Franchising Code of Conduct regime, as a culmination of the experience gained and study undertaken in the preceding eras, is characterised by the availability of a broad range of enforcement options from harsh deterrence-oriented measures to more gentle and cooperative compliance-oriented options constituting an effective regulatory pyramid. The effectiveness of the regime is further bolstered by the presence of a credible regulatory strategy pyramid which emphasises the real possibility of escalated intervention, coupled with skilful deployment by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as enforcement agency. The principal weakness of the scheme is identified as unnecessarily ambiguous drafting in some areas, which compromises the quality of the otherwise highly transparent ruleset. It is suggested that the choice of regulatory strategy, often a focus of superficial examinations of regulation, is largely irrelevant to the nature of the regulation, with other features such as enforcement strategy, legitimacy, and availability of credible sanctions proving much more important. A proposal for an analytical framework based on the established theory is developed based on the experience of applying that theory to the case study. While this outlined framework assists in broadening focus across the entire regulatory regime to encourage assessment of the component parts, a lack of cohesion and linkage amongst the components highlights a shortcoming in the development of regulatory theory and an opportunity for further research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Code of Conduct</field><field name="subject">Regulation</field><field name="subject">Franchising</field><field name="subject">Franchises (Retail trade) -- Law and legislation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Trade regulation -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assurance reporting and the communication process: impacts on report users' perceptions and decision-making</field><field name="creator">Pflugrath, Gary, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the effectiveness of communication between assurors and assurance report users, and the role that assurance reports play in this process. It comprises two behavioural experiments undertaken in the context of: (i) wording changes to the audit report (developed product) using shareholders as participants; and (ii) the role of assurance and type of assurance provider for corporate social responsibility reporting (evolving product), using financial analysts as participants. In both studies effectiveness of communication is examined in terms of report users?? perceptions and investment decision-making. The theoretical framework used in these studies is adapted from a communications model developed by Shannon and Weaver (1949), and supplemented by psychology research focused on source credibility (Birnbaum and Stegner, 1979). Two key elements of the communication process are recognised; the: (i) message transmitted; and (ii) source of the message. The first element is considered in the first experiment; the second element in the second study. Useful feedback is provided to standard-setters. From the first study, report users?? perceptions are not impacted by changes to the wording of the audit report. However, in the second experiment they are affected by differences in the source of the message. In terms of trustworthiness, financial analysts perceive the credibility of the source of corporate social responsibility information to be significantly greater when assured. For a company in an industry with stronger incentives to report positive corporate social responsibility information, they perceive the credibility (trustworthiness, overall credibility) of the source of the information to be significantly greater when assured. They also discern differences between types of assuror whereby the credibility (trustworthiness, expertise, overall credibility) of the source of information is perceived to be greater when assured by a professional accountant than a sustainability expert. A contribution of these experiments is the analysis of report users?? investment decision-making, as well as their perceptions. Differences in the message and source of the message for assurance reporting have no impact on report users?? investment decisions. Differences in characteristics of report users (familiarity with reports, extent to which reports are understandable) appear to impact report users?? perceptions and merits further examination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate Social Responsibility</field><field name="subject">Assurance Reporting</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geomorphology of Southeast Australian mountain streams</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Chris J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the morphology and sediment transport dynamics of mountain streams in southeast Australia. Mountain streams represent important geomorphological and ecological systems in Australia which have hitherto been poorly studied. The variability of mountain stream reach morphology was investigated at the regional scale using topographical surveys and sediment sampling techniques. Study sites were stratified by slope and local lithology. Eight channel-morphologies including Bedrock, Cascade, Step-pool, Planebed, Pool-Riffle, Cascade-pool, Riffle-step and Infilled, were identified using an objective statistical approach. Overall, channel types were found to correspond to existing reach-scale mountain stream templates. Five morphologies were associated with a specific lithology type which controlled the size and shape of grains supplied to the channels.  Differences in coarse sediment transport processes between morphologies were investigated using stream monitoring techniques and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Monitoring results from a 3 year period indicated that channel beds are resistant to entrainment with shear stress thresholds for bedload transport ranging between 64 to 74 N/m2. Transport of reach median grain sizes requires floods that exceed bankfull discharge. Existing competence equations were found to over-predict the hydraulic driving force and consequently, a modified entrainment model was used to account for the regional channel characteristics.   OSL dating was investigated as a tool to provide data on long-term sediment transport processes. Minimum age model results from the OSL dates show overall agreement with a selected entrainment model, and indicate differences in sediment transport dynamics between some reach morphology types. A regime model was used to quantify the physical domains of different channel morphologies. Limitations of the model were overcome by modifying the sediment supply surrogate to better reflect the dominant transported bedload size. Morphology types were delineated according to different sediment transport capacity-sediment supply domains.  The distribution of channel morphology types within a series of catchments in southeast Australia was modelled within a GIS platform using the diagnostics of reach morphology derived from this study. The model provides a conceptual framework to evaluate the potential link between channel form, potential habitat diversity and aquatic biodiversity within the channel network in mountain streams.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mountain streams</field><field name="subject">morpho-statistical classification</field><field name="subject">channels</field><field name="subject">optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL)</field><field name="subject">bed material storage</field><field name="subject">morphologies</field><field name="subject">habitat diversity</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">bedload transport</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Southeast</field><field name="subject">Southeastern</field><field name="subject">river channels</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexities in the valuation of natural resources and the development of the choice modelling technique</field><field name="creator">Rolfe, John, Economics &amp; Management, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Choice Modelling technique is an emerging technique which appears to have strengths relative to other non-market valuation techniques. The latter group are important in the assessment of the tradeoffs involved in environmental and resource use tradeoffs. However, the use of these techniques is often criticised where ethical and moral frameworks are involved, where it is unclear how difficult choices are being framed against each other, or where it is unclear how values change according to the scope of the amenity under consideration  The primary focus of the thesis is on the development of the Choice Modelling technique, which provides a richer information set to researchers than other techniques such as Contingent valuation method. However, the richness of this data is offset to some degree by the complexity of application, where careful attention is needed for design, application and analytical stages.  In this thesis, a series of four Choice Modelling experiments are reported, as well as two small Contingent Valuation experiments. The Choice Modelling experiments were centred on the estimation of values that Australians might hold for rainforest conservation in Vanuatu. In order to frame and scope the tradeoffs of interest within the broad pool of substitute goods (such as rainforest conservation opportunities in other countries), the Choice Modelling technique appeared more suitable than the single tradeoff preservation of the Contingent Valuation method.  The results of Choice Modelling experiments involved sets of parameters indicating that the probability of choice depended on a number of attributes used to make up the conservation profiles together with the influence of unobserved attributes. As a willingness-to-pay variable was included within the attributes making up choice profiles, estimates of value were available by predicting how changes in particular attributes could be offset by changes in the willingness-to-pay variable.  The major conclusions of the research presented in the thesis were that the involvement with ethical and moral frameworks does not invalidate the use of non-market valuation techniques, and that the Choice Modelling technique has strengths in relation to scooping and framing issues. In particular, the research demonstrates that the information generated from an experiment can be used in an iterative approach to develop more accurate models of choice. As well, the research shows that the amenity of interest, rainforest conservation in Vanuatu, can have positive values for Australian residents relative to other conservation opportunities.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choice modelling technique</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">non-market valuation technique</field><field name="subject">rainforest</field><field name="subject">Vanuatu</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GPS study for resolving the stability of Borobudur temple site</field><field name="creator">Lestari, Dwi, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The maintenance of the world???s important cultural monuments is a complex task embracing many disciplines. One important aspect of individual management plans is the stability of the monument. Borobudur, in Central Java, uncovered in a state of dilapidation in the early nineteenth century and finally restored in the second half of the twentieth century was restored using internal beams and injection technology with the view of providing a stable foundation for the foreseeable future. In the past, classical surveying separated the vertical and horizontal components. This separation often resulted in different stations having different information. Moreover, one technique was not generally able to add constraints to the other. Today's surveyors and Cultural Heritage managers use the Global Positioning System which is able to provide precise and reliable information for both the horizontal and vertical components, thereby unifying the networks and maximizing individual strengths, especially the underground marks associated with precise leveling, which are significantly less prone to local erratic movement than surface marks. Of necessity, any measurement of change involves at least two observation epochs. In general the precision is tied to the number of epochs and the span between the epochs. Since this study has had only two observation epochs, the results can only be described as preliminary or indicative. Never the less, there are a number of clear trends that are apparent. The first important point is that GPS is able to deliver precisions that are near 1 mm in the horizontal and 2-3 mm in the vertical relative to a regional fiducial control network. This is comparable to terrestrial surveying techniques. Moreover, it is accomplished in 10 to 14 days compared to many weeks for leveling. The second is that the level of redundancy and spatial coherence is very high enabling errors and outliers to be readily detected. This was used extensively as part of the quality assurance program adopted in this study. The third point is that no alarming deformation of the temple has been detected. At this stage of the study, the 95% confidence levels are quite large due mainly to only 2 epochs being observed but also in part to the way the models, especially the GLOBK model, has been implemented due to the limited number of epochs and the limited time span. It is expected that the model of tectonic motion which connects one epoch to the next will improve dramatically with a third epoch, and this will significantly improve the precision of the observation stations on the temple at the stupa level and on the buttress level. However, there is already clear evidence that some of the buttress level stations are in an unstable environment compared with stupa level stations and this is primarily due to their location. Finally, GPS offers the prospect of fast and hence repeatable work. Kinematic GPS techniques can certainly be used to densify stations and to increase our knowledge of the structural effects of deformation. However, much needs to be done to ensure that satellite tracking is of high quality and able to successfully resolve the ambiguities on an epoch by epoch basis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Racism, pluralism and democracy in Australia : re-conceptualising racial vilification legislation</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Tamsin, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australian debates about racial vilification legislation have been dominated by mainstream American First Amendment jurisprudence and popular American notions of 'free speech' to the exclusion of alternative Europeans models. This can be seen from notions of Australian racial vilification legislation as inconsistent with 'free speech' rights as well as the influence of some of the basic assumptions of First Amendment jurisprudence on political speech cases in the Australian High Court. Despite the widespread existence of legislation that penalises racial vilification at State and Federal levels, there has been a rise in Australia over the past 10 years of divisive 'race' politics. Against that background, this thesis considers the scope and limits of racial vilification legislation in Australia. It is argued that First Amendment jurisprudence is inadequate in the Australian context, because it is heavily dependent upon economic metaphors, individualistic notions of identity and outdated theories of communication. It assumes that 'free speech' in terms of lack of government intervention is essential to 'democracy'. It ignores the content, context and effect of harmful speech, except in extreme cases, with the result that socially harmful speech is protected in the name of 'free speech'. This has narrowed the parameters within which racial vilification is understood and hindered the development of a broader discourse on the realities of racist harms, and the mechanisms necessary for their redress. The author calls for the development of an Australian jurisprudence of harmful speech. Failing an Australian Bill of Rights, that jurisprudence would be grounded upon the implied constitutional right of free political speech, informed by an awareness that modern structures of public speech favour a very limited range of speech and speakers. The jurisprudence would take advantage of the insights of Critical Race Theory into the connections between racial vilification and racist behaviour, as well as the personal and social harms of racial vilification. Finally, it is argued that the concepts of human dignity and equality, which underpin European discrimination legislation and notions of justice, provide a way forward for Australian jurisprudence in this area.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Race discrimination</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Freedom of speech</field><field name="subject">Racism in language</field><field name="subject">Racism</field><field name="subject">Civil rights</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of term structure of interest rates - theory, modelling and econometrics</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shuling, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the modelling of the term structure of interest rates, with a particular focus on empirical aspects of the modelling. In this thesis, we explore the ??-parameterised (?? being the length of time to maturity) term structure of interest rates, corresponding to the traditional T-parameterised (T being the time of maturity) term structure of interest rates. The constructions of Australian yield curves are illustrated using generic yield curves produced by the Reserve Bank of Australia based on bonds on issue and by constructed yield curves of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia derived from swap rates. The data used to build the models is Australian Treasury yields from January 1996 to December 2001 for maturities of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 years, and the second data used to validate the model is Australian Treasury yields from July 2000 to April 2004 for maturities of all years from 1-10. Both data were supplied by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Initially, univariate Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH), with models of individual yield increment time series are developed for a set of fixed maturities. Then, a multivariate Matrix-Diagonal GARCH model with multivariate asymmetric t-distribution of the term structure of yield increments is developed. This model captures many important properties of financial data such as volatility mean reversion, volatility persistency, stationarity and heavy tails. There are two innovations of GARCH modelling in this thesis: (i) the development of the Matrix-Diagonal GARCH model with multivariate asymmetric t-distribution using meta-elliptical distribution in which the degrees of freedom of each series varies with maturity, and the estimation is given; (ii) the development of a GARCH model of term structure of interest rates (TS-GARCH). The TS-GARCH model describes the parameters specifying the GARCH model and the degrees of freedom using simple smooth functions of time to maturity of component series. TS-GARCH allows an empirical description of complete interest rate yield curve increments therefore allowing the model to be used for interpolation to additional maturity beyond those used to construct the model. Diagnostics of TS-GARCH model are provided using Australian Treasury bond yields.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GARCH</field><field name="subject">Yields</field><field name="subject">Term structure of interest rates</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of thermal residual stresses on static strength and fatigue life of welded carbon-fibre/epoxy composite joints</field><field name="creator">Djukic, Luke Philip, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thermoset Composite Welding (TCW) is a process designed specifically for joining composite materials, developed by the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures (CRC-ACS). The TCW manufacture process is carried out at higher temperatures than those used in service, causing thermal residual (TR) stresses to develop in the joints. An investigation of the strength of single-lap shear joints (SLJs), and the development of laminate free edge microcracks (LFEMs) is presented in this thesis. The reported investigations are primarily experimental. Finite element analysis has been used to understand observations where appropriate. The effect of TR stresses on static failure of TCW SLJs and Cytec FM1515 thin film epoxy adhesive SLJs over the temperature range of -55??C to 71??C is investigated. At temperatures where the joining material is ductile, plastic flow results in the redistribution of TR stresses within the joints, reducing their effect on the failure strength. No such stress redistributions occur at lower temperatures when the joining material is brittle; hence, the TR stresses cause strength reductions. These results were used to propose a method of shear strength improvement by initiating plastic flow in the joint at the time of manufacture.  Microcracks are common at the free edges of thermoset composites. These develop preferentially near the weld material interface in TCW laminates, and are termed laminate free edge microcracks (LFEMs) in this study. MicroCT scanning was used to find and characterise LFEMs in TCW joints. The results indicated that TR stresses combined with the free edge sectioning process cause their development outside the joint overlap regions. Microcracks developed within the joint overlaps during mechanical fatigue cycling. LFEMs were also found in FM1515 joints. A fatigue life study is presented for TCW and FM1515 SLJs at -55??C, in which the effect of LFEMs is considered. TCW is a new process. This investigation is the first dealing with the effect of thermal residual stresses on the strength of TCW joints, and the development and effect of LFEMs. The shear strength improvement method is also a novel concept for joints.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Finite Element Analysis</field><field name="subject">Carbon-Fibre/Epoxy Composite</field><field name="subject">Welding</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vision and expertise for interceptive actions in sport</field><field name="creator">Mann, David Lindsay, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Exquisite visually-guided movements underpin expertise in fast interceptive sports.  The assumption that skilled performance relies on superior visual skills has been challenged by studies of sporting expertise which typically advocate vision to be a poor predictor of sporting success.  This discordance is addressed in this thesis by examining whether visual degradation (in the form of blur) affects the performance of an interceptive action where successful execution demands precise spatial and temporal visual-motor control.  The vision of skilled cricket batters was blurred using contact lenses (four increasing levels: plano, +1.00, +2.00, +3.00) in each of two experimental phases.  In the first phase batters faced a bowling-machine and in-situ bowlers to examine the effect of blur on bat-ball interception.  The highest level of blur (+3.00) was required to produce a significant decrease in batting performance when facing the bowling-machine at medium-paced ball-velocities (105-115 kph).  A similar effect of blur was found when facing in-situ bowlers of comparable ball-velocity, however performance was found to be affected by a lower level of blur (+2.00) for faster-paced ball-velocities (120-130 kph).  The +1.00 blur was concluded even at this higher ball-velocity to have no measurable effect on interceptive performance in a natural setting.  The second phase sought to investigate the effect of blur on anticipation: a perceptual skill established to be an important component of expertise in many interceptive sports.  It was established, using temporal occlusion of a bowling sequence, that optimal anticipation required an opportunity for bat-ball interception (facilitating close coupling between perception and action).  Coupled anticipation demonstrated velocity-dependent resilience to blur; +3.00 and +2.00 were required for respective decreases in the anticipation of action-sequences for medium- and fast-paced ball-velocities.  Remarkably, results suggest that blur may enhance uncoupled (verbal) anticipation according to the movement velocity of the bowler.  Experimental results led to the conclusion that clear vision is not necessarily required for optimal interceptive performance, even when the demanding spatio-temporal task simulates the conditions experienced at the highest levels of competition.  Results are interpreted based on the predictions of the dual-pathway theory of vision, including differences in the underlying visual information processed via these pathways.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interceptive actions</field><field name="subject">Vision</field><field name="subject">Sport</field><field name="subject">Dual pathway theory of vision</field><field name="subject">Dorsal</field><field name="subject">Ventral</field><field name="subject">Cricket</field><field name="subject">Vision-for-perception</field><field name="subject">Vision-for-action</field><field name="subject">Anticipation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of controlling shareholder identity on firm performance and corporate policies: a study of corporate control transfers in an international context</field><field name="creator">Deng, Hua, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the identity of new controlling shareholders in partial corporate control transactions and its influence on firm performance and corporate policies in an international context. In a transfer of partial corporate control, the identity of controlling shareholder changs, thereby facilitating an event study of corporate changes resulted from controlling shareholder turnover. The dissertation comprises of three empirical research projects to address two questions: Firstly, does the identity of a new controlling shareholder in a partial control transfer matter to firm value? Secondly, how does new controlling shareholder identity explain the differences of firm performance and corporate policies in the long run? The equity block transactions in listed firms from around the world announced between 1996 and 2005 are filtered to arrive at the final sample of 215 corporate control transfers through private negotiation. This hand-collected dataset allows the dissertation to contribute to the existing literature on ownership concentration by introducing the identity of controlling shareholder into the theoretical framework and investigating its significance in an international context.  It is argued that firm value, long-term performance and corporate policies can be influenced by the identity of new controlling shareholders because different controlling shareholders have distinct incentives, skills and styles. This dissertation finds that individual investor controlled firms outperform those controlled by corporate investors in both short-term abnormal returns and long-term performance after a control transfer; and that the sample firms controlled by individual and corporate investors adopt different policies of investment and financial leverage. The evidence presented here shows that individual controlling shareholders are better motivated to monitor managers and improve operational efficiency. Partial corporate control activities have important governance effects and controlling shareholder heterogeneity is a significant contributing factor to firm performance and decision making.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Firm performance</field><field name="subject">Controlling shareholder identity</field><field name="subject">Corporate control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iconic lands: wilderness as a reservation criterion for world heritage</field><field name="creator">Rimini, Mario Gabriele Roberto, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wilderness is crucial for global conservation. Contemporary research established that between 33% and 52% of the Earth qualifies as wilderness. It is a fragile, threatened resource which needs a global conservation framework. This role could be successfully fulfilled by the World Heritage Convention. The founding notion of the World Heritage idea ?? Outstanding Universal Value ?? bears a striking resemblance to the attributes and characteristics of wilderness. The two notions possess an indisputable cultural and historic affinity, embodied by their ??iconic?? dimension. This makes the synergy between wilderness and World Heritage extraordinarily effective, as the history of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area demonstrates. The Franklin Dam dispute, solved after the World Heritage nomination of the Tasmanian wilderness, is emblematic in this respect. It gave birth to the world&#8223;s only protected area which includes close to 100% of the local wilderness resource, and which coincides entirely with World Heritage status. The classic wilderness character of the region matched and enhanced the iconic power of the World Heritage, and the outcome represented a watershed for Australia&#8223;s wilderness politics. Locally, it also paved the way for the establishment of a thriving ecotourism industry, providing the core of Tasmania&#8223;s ??green?? brand. Its lesson is still invoked in unresolved wilderness conflicts throughout the country, and could be applied to other similar international contexts, as a model of proactive wilderness reservation through World Heritage nomination and of economic development based on wilderness tourism. On the other hand, despite the cultural affinity wilderness was never chosen as a criterion for World Heritage identification, and therefore the Convention cannot coherently fulfill this role of wilderness protection framework before solving this paradox. The unresolved dispute over Tasmania&#8223;s wilderness forests indicates that the lack of an official endorsement of wilderness as a World Heritage criterion deprives the Convention of the conceptual tools needed to successfully address those environmental conflicts affecting existing World Heritage areas, in which the resource at stake is namely wilderness. Including wilderness as a World Heritage criterion would fill this gap and provide the global community with an effective framework for the preservation of remaining wilderness regions.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conservation</field><field name="subject">World Heritage</field><field name="subject">Wilderness</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tenant-landlord communicative interaction: the influence of litigation in public housing</field><field name="creator">Morden, Aida, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, public housing was investigated with particular reference to the nature of communication between the landlord and tenant. It focussed on interactive behaviours and the incidence of litigation. The study attempts to bridge the gap between social theory and social practice through the application of existing social theory in the description and analyses of social problems. Based on a critical review of the relevant literature, the characteristics of communicative interaction and human relationships are described, together with the history of housing provision and the growth of litigation to resolve issues in public housing. Research of communicative interaction in the housing sector in general and the landlord-tenant interaction in particular has been a neglected area of research that is addressed in this thesis.  An initial study surveyed both tenants and housing officers in the Sydney metropolitan area. Social analysis focuses on local interaction between landlord and tenant and how these local interactions expand into global patterns. The thesis analyses how power-relating, ideological/evaluative and ethical choices of housing officers and tenants influence their communicative interaction and the subsequent access and distribution of services and resources in the public housing sector.  The theoretical framework explicates on complex responsive processes (CRP) perspective. CRP is a process theory that looks into the simultaneous and co-influencing relationship between the individual and the social and multi-agency approach in social analysis. The conceptualising framework relies on the application of this theory and the principles of Humanity, human rights and social justice to achieve a dialogical communicative interaction.  The thesis applied complementary quantitative and qualitative methods where a quantitative study of a small population was conducted using structured interviews and group meetings to guide the qualitative research. The population was identified by natural experiment, i.e., identification of two populations in a public housing estate: a Participative group, comprising tenants who had consciously participated in the housing authorities?? renewal programs, and a Non-participative group of tenants who had not taken part in the Tenant Participation programs by Housing New South Wales (HNSW). The housing officers and tenants were identified using snowball and quota sampling.  The findings reveal a conspicuous absence of research that focus on local interaction between housing officers and tenants in public housing. The study confirms the anti-dialogical nature of communicative interaction in public housing, which is iterated, sustained and perpetuated by the use of litigation, a mechanism that is increasingly being preferred to settle disputes, by both landlord and tenant.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Litigation</field><field name="subject">Public housing</field><field name="subject">Communicative interaction</field><field name="subject">Street -level bureaucrats</field><field name="subject">Tenant participation</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental study on high speed milling and a predictive force model</field><field name="creator">Ekanayake, Risheeka Ayomi, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the research work carried out in an experimental study on High Speed Milling and a predictive force model. The Oxley??s machining theory [36] that can be considered a purely theoretical approach, which has not yet been applied to the high speed milling process is used to model this process in order to predict the cutting forces. An experimental programme was carried out in order to study and understand the high speed milling process and to collect force data for machining of AISI 1020 plain carbon steel at speeds from 250 to 500m/min, feed rates 0.025 to 0.075mm/tooth and 0.5 and 0.8mm depths of cut, using three different tool configurations with different nose radii. The model developed by Young [5] using the Oxley??s machining theory, for conventional milling, was first applied to the high speed milling operation. The force predictions were satisfactory compared to the measured forces. Using this as the basis, a theoretical model was developed to predict the cutting forces in high speed milling. A smaller chip element was considered in applying the machining theory to satisfy the assumption of two dimensional deformation in the machining theory. Using the flow stress properties for plain carbon steels obtained by Oxley and his co-workers, the cutting force components: tangential, radial and vertical, were predicted with the new developed model for AISI 1020 steel for the same cutting conditions used in the experiment. The model was able to accurately predict the tangential force, while the other two components showed a good agreement with the experimental forces. Then the model was verified using two other materials namely, AISI 1045 plain carbon steel and AISI 4140 alloy steel. The alloy steel was used in both the states, virgin and hardened (heat treated) for the experiment. The comparison of predictions with experimental forces showed good results for these additional two materials. From the results obtained, it is concluded that the developed model can be used to predict the tangential cutting force accurately, while predicting the other force components with a favourable accuracy.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Predictions</field><field name="subject">High speed milling</field><field name="subject">Forces</field><field name="subject">Machining theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A quantitative proteomics investigation of cold adaptation in the marine bacterium, Sphinopyxis alaskensis</field><field name="creator">Ting, Lily Li Jing, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The marine bacterium Sphingopyxis alaskensis was isolated as one of the most numerically abundant bacteria from cold (4&#150;10??C) nutrient depleted waters in the North Pacific Ocean. The objective of this study was to examine cold adaptation of S. alaskensis by using proteomics to examine changes in global protein levels caused by growth at low (10??C) and high (30??C) temperatures. Stable isotope labelling-based quantitative proteomics was used, and a rigorous post-experimental data processing workflow adapted from microarray-based methods was developed. The approach included metabolic labelling with 14N/15N and normalisation and statistical testing of quantitative proteomics data.  Approximately 400,000 tandem mass spectra were generated resulting in the confident identification of 2,135 proteins (66% genome coverage) and the quantitation of 1,172 proteins (37% genome coverage). Normalisation approaches were evaluated using cultures grown at 30??C and labelled with 14N and 15N. For 10??C vs. 30??C experiments, protein quantities were normalised within each experiment using a multivariate lowess approach. Statistical significance was assessed by combining data from all experiments and applying a moderated t-test using the empirical Bayes method with the limma package in R. Proteins were ranked after calculating the B-statistic and the Storey-Tibshirani false discovery rate. 217 proteins (6% genome coverage) were determined to have significant quantitative differences. In achieving these outcomes a range of factors that impact on quantitative proteomics data quality were broadly assessed, resulting in the development of a robust approach that is generally applicable to quantitative proteomics of biological system.  The significantly differentially abundant proteins from the proteomics data provided insight into molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation in S. alaskensis. Important aspects of cold adaptation included cell membrane restructuring, exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, lipid degradation, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, and increased capacity of transcriptional and translational processes. A number of cold adaptive responses in S. alaskensis were novel, including a specific cold-active protein folding pathway, a possible thermally-controlled stringent response, and biosynthesis of intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate reserve material.  The overall study provided important new insight into the evolution of growth strategies necessary for the effective competition of S. alaskensis in cold, oligotrophic environments.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cold adaptation</field><field name="subject">Quantitative proteomics</field><field name="subject">Extremophiles</field><field name="subject">Mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Marine bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sampling the self: a fragmented landscape</field><field name="creator">Factor, Brenda Rochelle, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The central theme of Sampling the Self: A Fragmented Landscape is the notion of the fractured or fragmented self and its repeated reinvention through the context of artistic intervention. The aim of the studio research project has been to develop a body of work which functions as a vehicle for multiple readings of self and explores the notion of the fractured self - body and memory - via metaphoric devices such as fragmentation, repetition and reconfiguration.  In pursuing this theme I conceptualise a new visual vocabulary of self as fragmented, fluid, mutable and ultimately elusive. In my body of work I set out to create a dialogue of self &#150; self in some of its many manifestations &#150; that relies on multiple configurations of memory, body and identity. Repetition is used as a metaphor of both a fragmented memory and a fragmented self. Within the context of my installation works the multiple signifies loss or absence and functions as a memory fragment, a materialisation of how one event has so many differently remembered versions, within the archaeology of memory.  The final outcome of this research project is a coherent body of studio research; tangible artworks which are metaphoric, sometimes personal, at other time collective, explorations of the idea of the self and its many facets, and which were displayed at COFAspace in 2009. The purpose of this accompanying written research document is to provide a critical examination of the studio research produced for this Master of Fine Arts (MFA) project.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity.

In order to inform consumers about their products or services, marketers apply a variety of advertising strategies. One particular strategy is &#8220;contextual advertising&#8221;, which refers to the strategic placement of advertisements in an editorial environment whose theme is relevant for the promoted product or service (Belch &amp; Belch, 2009, p. 492). Also in advertising research, contextual advertising received a considerable amount of attention. Scholars have investigated the effectiveness of contextual advertising in online and offline media. Researchers as well as practitioners have particularly focused on content-based relationships between advertisements and the theme of the editorial environment in which the advertisement is placed. With a focus on online media, the present study aimed to investigate this content-based relationship but also to examine what other types of relationships between the different contents on a webpage the user constructs. Advertising has also been investigated in the area of semiotics. Several scholars analysed advertisements in order to reveal their meaning-affordances. A second interest in the present study derives from semiotic studies and theories, which emphasise the individual&#8217;s significance in the meaning-making process but also exclude the individual from their analysis. A potential contradiction could be seen here and by investigating how users interpret a particular webpage, this study aimed to examine what insights an analysis can provide that is solely focused on the webpage user. In order to capture users&#8217; interpretations of a webpage&#8217;s contents and to investigate what types of relationships between these contents users construct semi-structured interviews with six participants were conducted. The participants were invited to look at a webpage from the website www.healthyfood.co.nz. Following the interviews, the participants&#8217; responses were transcribed, categorised and analysed. Findings from the study revealed that several participants constructed relationships between advertisements and the editorial content based on content-similarity but also on design-similarity as well as their personal knowledge about sponsorship relationships and income-investment relationships. Personal knowledge also appeared to be important for the interpretation of the webpage. The participants&#8217; interpretation of the webpage were also guided by their personal interest in the contents, their individual contexts like socio-cultural background, experiences and beliefs as well as environmental factors such as time and the layout of the interview location. The results of the study support the significant role of the individual in the process of meaning making and further contribute to an extended understanding of contextual advertising. Practical suggestions for the advertising area and future research were also identified.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Online communication</field><field name="subject">Online advertising</field><field name="subject">Contextual advertising</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emergent design : explorations in systems phenomenology in relation to ontology, hermeneutics and the meta-dialectics of design</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Kent D</field><field name="description">A Phenomenological Analysis of Emergent Design is performed based on the foundations of General Schemas Theory. The concept of Sign Engineering is explored in terms of Hermeneutics, Dialectics, and Ontology in order to define Emergent Systems and Meta-systems Engineering based on the concept of Meta-dialectics. Phenomenology, Ontology, Hermeneutics, and Dialectics will dominate our inquiry into the nature of the Emergent Design of the System and its inverse dual, the Meta-system. This is an speculative dissertation that attempts to produce a philosophical, mathematical, and theoretical view of the nature of Systems Engineering Design. Emergent System Design, i.e., the design of yet unheard of and/or hitherto non-existent Systems and Meta-systems is the focus. This study is a frontal assault on the hard problem of explaining how Engineering produces new things, rather than a repetition or reordering of concepts that already exist. In this work the philosophies of E. Husserl, A. Gurwitsch, M. Heidegger, J. Derrida, G. Deleuze, A. Badiou, G. Hegel, I. Kant and other Continental Philosophers are brought to bear on different aspects of how new technological systems come into existence through the midwifery of Systems Engineering. Sign Engineering is singled out as the most important aspect of Systems Engineering. We will build on the work of Pieter Wisse and extend his theory of Sign Engineering to define Meta-dialectics in the form of Quadralectics and then Pentalectics . Along the way the various ontological levels of Being are explored in conjunction with the discovery that the Quadralectic is related to the possibility of design primarily at the Third Meta-level of Being, called Hyper Being. Design Process is dependent upon the emergent possibilities that appear in Hyper Being. Hyper Being, termed by Heidegger as Being (Being crossed-out) and termed by Derrida as Differance, also appears as the widest space within the Design Field at the third meta-level of Being and therefore provides the most leverage that is needed to produce emergent effects. Hyper Being is where possibilities appear within our worldview. Possibility is necessary for emergent events to occur. Hyper Being possibilities are extended by Wild Being propensities to allow the embodiment of new things. We discuss how this philosophical background relates to meta-methods such as the Gurevich Abstract State Machine and the Wisse Metapattern methods, as well as real-time architectural design methods as described in the Integral Software Engineering Methodology . One aim of this research is to find the foundation for extending the ISEM methodology to become a general purpose Systems Design Methodology. Our purpose is also to bring these philosophical considerations into the practical realm by examining P. Bourdieu?s ideas on the relationship between theoretical and practical reason and M. de Certeau?s ideas on practice. The relationship between design and implementation is seen in terms of the Set/Mass conceptual opposition. General Schemas Theory is used as a way of critiquing the dependence of Set based mathematics as a basis for Design. The dissertation delineates a new foundation for Systems Engineering as Emergent Engineering based on General Schemas Theory, and provides an advanced theory of Design based on the understanding of the meta-levels of Being, particularly focusing upon the relationship between Hyper Being and Wild Being in the context of Pure and Process Being.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280110 Systems Theory</field><field name="subject">280111 Conceptual Modelling</field><field name="subject">280112 Information Systems Development Methodologies</field><field name="subject">291899 Interdisciplinary Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">300899 Environmental Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">410401 Design Theory</field><field name="subject">410499 Design Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">440107 Metaphysics</field><field name="subject">440111 Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">440112 Hermeneutic Theory</field><field name="subject">Schemas Theory</field><field name="subject">Meta-systems</field><field name="subject">Methods</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Dialectics</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Technology</field><field name="subject">Quadralectics</field><field name="subject">Systems Theory</field><field name="subject">Systems Engineering</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/74458</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and application of ultrasound technology for treatment of organic pollutants</field><field name="creator">Thangavadivel, Kandasamy</field><field name="description">The necessity of cost effective, environmentally friendly technology has become increasingly important to remediate persistent organic pollutants in the environment. The emerging greener ultrasound technology has the potential to serve the remediation industry. In this study, the use of low power, high frequency (HF) ultrasound (1.6 MHz, 145 W/L) has been shown to effectively remediate DDT (90% of 8 mg/L) in water and sand slurries. Addition of iron powder accelerated DDT degradation in the sand slurry under ultrasonication. The potential of HF ultrasound (1.6 MHz, 160 W/L) in degradation of the non-volatile, polar model compound methylene blue (MB) was studied in MB spiked demineralised water and wastewater. A 70 % of 0.4 mg/L of MB was degraded in demineralised water whereas only 54% of MB degraded in MB spiked wastewater. There was a decrease in MB degradation rate with an increase in MB concentration. High power, low frequency (LF) ultrasound (20 kHz, 932 W/L) was used to desorb 400 mg/L of DDT added to three different natural soil slurries at 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt. % each. Each soil slurry was prepared in 0.1% v/v SDS surfactant solution, soaked for 30 min. and heated for another 30 min. at 40 oC before sonication. For the neutral pH soil slurry with higher dissolved organic carbon, the desorption efficiency achieved was over 80% in 30 s sonication. Alkaline soil with higher surface area than neutral soil indicated 60% desorption efficiency while the acidic soil, with the highest surface area and a higher amount of non-soluble organic matter, yielded 30% desorption efficiency under similar desorption conditions. Coconut fibre, used to biosorb the desorbed DDT in the decanted solution, was found to have over 25 g/kg of biosorption capacity for DDT. The surfactant SDS and associated DDT were completely separated from decanted liquid of the desorbed slurry with alum using adsorptive micellar flocculation in 60 min. settling. Acidic pH and molar concentration ratio of Al3+/SDS = 0.5 was used to completely remove the DDT. Using 20 kHz, 1125 W/L of sonication in an 80 mL reactor with air saturated 50 mg/L DDT at 20oC, the DDT removal efficiency achieved was 80% in 20 min. With zero valent iron addition, DDT removal efficiency in 15 min. is 100% with 15 and 22 mg/L of initial DDT concentrations. The settled DDT slurrywas remediated using 20 kHz at 240 W/L achieving DDT removal efficiency of 87% in 15 min. Also LF ultrasound was found to be effective in remediating chloroform (8 mg/L in 60 min) from spiked demineralised water and contaminated groundwater in both batch (120 W/L) and flow cell (6000 W/L) modes. Modeling and simulation of the ultrasonic reactor under 20 kHz ultrasonication was performed for various shape reactors using commercially available software. For almost all reactors, the highest ultrasonic intensity was observed near the transducer???s vibrating area. It was found that the highest acoustic pressure distribution, which is critical to the performance of the reactor, occurred in the conical reactor and flow cell configuration.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organic water pollutants</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Water quality management</field><field name="subject">Pollution control equipment</field><field name="subject">250399 Organic Chemistry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">291104 Environmental Technologies</field><field name="subject">ultrasound</field><field name="subject">persistent organic</field><field name="subject">DDT</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/93186</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous student success in secondary schooling : factors impacting on student attendance, retention, learning and attainment in South Australia</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Kiara</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates factors which impact on Indigenous student learning and success in secondary schooling in South Australia.

This is especially the case in mineral processing, where differences in surface hydrophobicity lie at the heart of the separation process of flotation. Chemicals are used to increase and decrease the natural hydrophobicity of minerals to attain a better separation between valuable and worthless material. Polymers are often used to reduce mineral surface hydrophobicity. Decades of empirically based decision making have produced a list of effective depressants. However the detailed study of how these polymer depressants affect surface hydrophobicity and mineral recovery lags behind applied investigations. The aim of this thesis was to study the adsorption of commonly used depressants on model surfaces and to interrogate the action of these polymers in reducing surface hydrophobicity. We have modelled the degree of hydrophobicity of common minerals in order to study polymer depressants with methods not commonly used in studies of surface characterisation in flotation. The model surfaces (self-assembled monolayers, SAMs) allowed us to use the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to study the adsorption of polymers. The QCM-D can be used to obtain adsorption isotherms, adsorption kinetics, water content of adsorbed layers, and information on the conformation of the adsorbed polymer. The results from the QCM-D were correlated with the contact angle data from the captive bubble measurements, with which we assessed the hydrophobicity of the surface before and after polymer adsorption. Three of the polymers layers were probed with dynamic dewetting studies, in order to test other modes of depressant action. Three types of polymers were studied - a polyacrylamide (Polymer-H), a polyelectrolyte CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) and a group of dextrins (Dextrin-TY, a phenyl succinate substituted dextrin (PS Dextrin) and a styrene oxide substituted dextrin (SO Dextrin)). These polymers are commonly used or have potential to be used in the depression of talc and graphite. Polymer-H was used to investigate the hydrophobic bonding between a non-ionic polymer depressant and chemically inert and non charged surfaces by probing the influence of substrate hydrophobicity on polymer adsorption and reduction of contact angle. Three different model surfaces were used (mixed self-assembled 0.5 SAM, 0.7 SAM or single self-assembled 1.0 SAM monolayers) with advancing contact angles between 75?? and 119??. The study of Polymer-H found that the substrate hydrophobicity is an important factor in adsorption of this polymer and the change in contact angle upon adsorption depends on adsorbed amount. The effectiveness of Polymer-H to reduce surface hydrophobicity was established to correlate with its conformation and morphology. CMC was investigated to find out how a stimulus responsive polymer depressant can be used in flotation. It was established that the adsorbed amount and rate of adsorption of CMC increase with decreasing of pH or increasing of ionic strength. It was shown that the surface hydrophobicity of a CMC pre-adsorbed layer changes with the environment and these alterations are fully reversible. A switch of ionic strength (from 10-2 M KCl to 10-1 M KCl) caused partial dehydration of the adsorbed layer and a decrease of the receding contact angle by 20??. A pH switch (pH = 9 to pH = 3) resulted in a 40?? change in receding contact angle. The CMC investigation showed that the use of a stimulus responsive polymer presents opportunities for exploiting solution conditions as a means to effect a better mineral separation in flotation The adsorption of three dextrin-based polymers on a model hydrophobic surface has been characterized using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The three polymers (one standard dextrin and two dextrins with different aromatic group substitutions) exhibited varying affinities and capacity for adsorption on the hydrophobic substrate. The effect of the three polymers on the static contact angle of the surface was studied using captive bubble contact angle measurements. The three polymers were seen to reduce the receding contact angle by similar amounts (approximately 14 degrees) in spite of having varying adsorbed amounts and differences in adsorbed layer water content. Although no differences were observed in the ability of the polymers to reduce the static contact angle, measurements of the dewetting dynamics between a rising air bubble and the polymer covered substrate yielded stark differences between the polymers, with one polymer slowing the dewetting dynamics by an order of magnitude more than the other two polymers. The differences in dewetting behaviour correlate with the adsorbed layer characteristics determined by QCM-D.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrophobic surfaces</field><field name="subject">Polymer solutions</field><field name="subject">Adsorption</field><field name="subject">249901 Biophysics</field><field name="subject">249903 Instruments and Techniques</field><field name="subject">250103 Colloid and Surface Chemistry</field><field name="subject">250204 Bioinorganic Chemistry</field><field name="subject">250405 Sensor (Chemical and Bio-) Technology</field><field name="subject">250599 Macromolecular Chemistry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">260101 Mineralogy and Crystallography</field><field name="subject">QCM-D</field><field name="subject">AFM</field><field name="subject">polymer depressant</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/92477</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:45799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perspective of the composer and performer: the interpretation and performance of selected flute works by Lowell Liebermann and Robert Beaser.</field><field name="creator">Zwar, Natalie</field><field name="description">This submission investigates the interpretation and performance of selected solo and chamber works for flute by American composers Lowell Liebermann (b.1961) and Robert Beaser (b.1954).

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of acquisition form, domestic liquidity costs for US cross-listed firms, and convergence in information environment : an investor protection perspective : a dissertation submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance, Department of Commerce, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nhut Hoang</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains three empirical studies that examine the effect of investor protection on three different aspects of corporate governance: mergers and acquisitions, US cross-listings, and convergence of information environment around the world.1 The first study investigates the relation between investor protection and the choice of acquisition form (partial versus full acquisition). I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liberal Islam in Indonesia - from revelation to reason and freedom: the Mu'tazilites, Harun Nasution and the Liberal Islam Network</field><field name="creator">Bool, Philip John Gill</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how reason and freedom have been expressed in Islam through a study of the Mu'tazilite movement in 8th century Persia, the Indonesian Islamic scholar and educator Harun Nasution and the Liberal Islam Network formed in Indonesia in 2001.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liberal Islam, Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the Clothing and Allied Trades Union</field><field name="creator">Ellem, B. L.</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the history of clothing trades' unionism in Australia from its origins in the nineteenth-century until 1967. From 1907 that history is the history of the Clothing and Allied Trades' Union, an organisation established in that year under the aegis of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.The Introduction establishes explicit organising questions and themes and locates them within current debates about labour history. The Introduction asks the question: 'what is the Clothing Trades' Union?' The thesis examines how this question has been answered by unionists themselves and it examines the circumstances under which those solutions have been conceived. This requires an analysis of the industry itself and of the economic and social structures of which it is a part.The first three chapters examine the origins of the Union. They show that at the very founding of the Union, there were tensions within the new structure and contradictions in the forces which shaped it. These are important because they are themes which are addressed in all the subsequent chapters. Although the Union was formally a law-made organisation, it was not only that. It was created by craft unions which had traditions of workshop control and resistance. These led to conflict with the needs of state-based arbitration. Second, the constituent unions were very different from each other. Although many craftsmen believed in the principle of amalgamation, there was neither a need nor a desire for a powerful Federal structure.A deeper series of contradictions lay in the nature of the industry. By 1907 the clothing trade was already overwhelmingly a female trade but the most durable unions were those of male artisans. They carried with them craft motifs of control and exclusivism which were directed as much against women as employers. Because of social practice, the nature of work and union traditions, women were poorly placed to exercise control within the Union.Chapters Four and Five show how industrial and political change led to conflicts about arbitration itself. The Union was torn between competing ideologies before the principle of Commonwealth arbitration was restored in 1919. Chapters Six and Seven deal with the inter-war years and they explain how, after a period of industrial militancy and political unity, the Union relied increasingly upon arbitration and was unable to develop policies to defend the mass of its membership. The Depression of the 1930s fractured what unity there was and the autonomy of the Branches again increased.The state gave greater impetus to centralism and" enhanced Federal Council's authority as against the Branches because of the needs of War-time planning. Chapter Eight discusses this trend and its reversal after 1945. The final chapter examines more explicitly than any other the question of the nature and purpose of unionism. It argues that this is largely how the split in the labour movement in the 1950s should be understood. Although the more radical groups triumphed, they did so on terms which meant that the Union's structure was little changed and that, indeed, the definition of trade union activity was no wider than in the past.The Union was and is a loose amalgamation of relatively autonomous State Branches under a weak and self-styled non-political Federal Council. The thesis concludes that this structure has its origins in the arbitration system and has been sustained by both the differences between Branches and the limitations to those differences. Industrial and social stability meant that the Union itself was stable. Underpinning and explaining the nature of union structure and practice is the tension between two forms of organisation: craft and industrial unionism.

Although not a prevalent illness, listeriosis has been identified as a significant public health problem during pregnancy because of its serious consequences for the baby and high fetal mortality rates. However, there is limited information available on the state of Listeria awareness among general public and health professionals in Australia and the sociocultural elements that influence both lay and professionals&#8217; approaches to food safety recommendations to avoid Listeria. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate Listeria knowledge and preventive food safety practices among pregnant women and to explore their understanding of the Listeria risk, how they positioned it among their other health concerns during pregnancy, and how they managed to avoid the risk based on the knowledge they gained from different sources of information. The study also explored midwives&#8217; perceptions of the Listeria risk and their approach to the provision of advice in this regard. The study was a mixed methods research carried out in one private and two major public hospitals in the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Services. Participants were pregnant women who attended antenatal clinic and/or classes in the study sites and midwives who provided antenatal services at the same sites. Pregnant women&#8217;s knowledge, practice and opinions with regard to Listeria were investigated through a survey using a self-administered questionnaire in which 586 women took part. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 26 pregnant women and 10 midwives to provide an in-depth understanding of the factors underpinning their Listeria prevention strategies and approaches to food safety recommendations. Survey results indicated that more than 40 percent of participants had not received any information on food safety issues during their pregnancy, and relied on their lay network as the major source of Listeria knowledge for pregnant women. Large proportions of participants were not aware of the risk associated with some of the high Listeria risk foods and continued the consumption of these foods during pregnancy. v Women&#8217;s level of knowledge of high risk foods was a major determinant of their eating practices/preferences. Unsafe food handling practices in keeping raw and cooked foods in the refrigerator, and keeping and reheating of leftovers were also reported by a large number of participants. Interview data were analysed using constant comparative method and within a broad sociological framework exploring the concept of risk in the context of food and pregnancy. For most participants the safety of food was not a concern. Food safety recommendations specific to pregnancy entered the dichotomised rules that women already employed to simplify their decisions about the safety of their food. Women&#8217;s accounts indicated that their strategies to avoid the Listeria risk were informed by their past experience with food related risks, the scientific knowledge that they gained in the course of their pregnancy, and the idea of maternal responsibility that dominated their discourses of pregnancy. The concepts of authoritative knowledge and cognitive authority were employed to investigate pregnant women&#8217;s perceptions of authority of different sources of Listeria knowledge. It was found that Listeria information based on scientific knowledge was the only perceived authoritative knowledge that influenced women&#8217;s food related decisions to avoid the Listeria risk. Interviews with midwives revealed that food safety education was a lower priority in their agenda for pregnancy care. Midwives had a range of approaches to Listeria education which was informed by their personal understandings of the risk based on their previous experience with cases of illness, and a general assumption that their clients were knowledgeable about food related risks and the ways of avoiding them. Findings of this research provide an important insight into the current position of food safety in the Australian antenatal care practice. It is anticipated that information from this study on pregnant women&#8217;s approaches to Listeria risk information and communication, as well as the lost opportunities within the antenatal system and the compromised role of health professionals in Listeria education during pregnancy would be beneficial in informing future educational initiatives for the prevention of listeriosis. It also will be of value to administrators and educators who are interested in creating an environment which is supportive of food safety education for the broader community</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A naturalistic enquiry into the day-to-day lives of obese children</field><field name="creator">Puglisi, Lauren M</field><field name="description">Childhood obesity has reached epidemic levels in both developed and developing countries, posing one of the greatest challenges to paediatric health in the 21st century. To date, interventions to prevent and treat child obesity have had moderate success, with many researchers advocating the need for individual and community programs combined with a better understanding of the contextual factors affecting children, in particular social and environmental aspects. Little has been documented about the daily experiences of an obese child and the context of their weight-related behaviours. Because of the sensitive nature of child obesity, few studies have employed participant observation methods or naturalistic paradigms to gather contextual information around this prominent health issue. The purpose of this current study was to explain the daily life of an obese child and then determine the context in which weight-related behaviours existed. This study was a naturalistic inquiry employing a multiple case-study design. It was conducted with six obese children and their families in their normal daily environments, including their home, school, and after-school and weekend settings. Participant observations took place from when the child woke in the morning until he/she went to bed at night. Field notes were taken, which were supplemented with digital recordings and casual conversations with key individuals. A number of dietary, physical activity, sedentary and personal factors affecting the weight status of all six children were identified. A cross-case analysis found that there were a number that were common for most children. Common dietary factors included: the consumption of high-sugar or energy-dense snacks; portion sizes; providing food choices; parental dietary patterns; eating in front of the television; and the options available at the school canteen. In relation to physical activity, frequent aspects were: perceived physical activity competence; physical difficulties; participation in a small amount of physical activity after school and on weekends: having people to play with; existence of sibling or parental role models; backyard size; school sport activities; and time available for unstructured physical activity in schools. There were also a number of common factors related to sedentary behaviours, including: enjoyment of these activities; time spent in small screen recreation; regularly reading books; availability of electronic media; friends&#8217; interests in small screen recreation; existence of rules; parental sedentary behaviour patterns; and parental use of small screen recreation as a babysitter. Personal characteristics affecting the weight status of most of the children in the study included: physical appearance self-concept; behavioural self-concept; and peer acceptance self-concept. These factors exerted their influence in a number of the normal day-to-day behaviour settings of these six children. These findings were compared retrospectively with the study&#8217;s theoretical framework, Davison and Birch&#8217;s Ecological Systems Model (Davison &amp; Birch, 2001), which explores factors affecting a child&#8217;s weight status within three broad categories: child characteristics and child risk factors; parenting styles and family characteristics; and community, demographic and societal characteristics. A number of similarities and differences were found between my study&#8217;s findings and those presented in Davison and Birch&#8217;s model. New risk factors, which were evident in this current study included: personal characteristics which suggested low levels of self-awareness in the social context; sedentary factors such as the enjoyment of the activity and the social inclusion it provided rather than the social exclusion and physical discomfort experienced through physical activity. Both Davison and Birch&#8217;s model and this study recognise that the aetiology of child obesity involves complex interactions between individuals and environments. In light of these findings, the development of childhood obesity involves a complex set of factors from a range of contexts that interact to place a child at risk of developing weight problems. It is not simply an imbalance in energy intake and energy expenditure. It is crucial that future interventions cater for risk factors at all three levels, including child, family and the community. Collecting both quantitative and qualitative data at both intraand extra-individual levels may help to reduce some of the methodological limitations associated with child obesity interventions such as using a &#8220;one-size fits all&#8221; approach, delivering interventions in highly resourced settings and failing to include the entire family and add greater depth to our knowledge of the experiences and characteristics of the obese child.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transport boundaries for pneumatic conveying</field><field name="creator">Yi, Jianglin</field><field name="description">Pneumatic conveying is being selected for an increasing number of industrial applications and products and is playing a more vital and integral role in the transportation of solid materials such as plastic pellets, grain and chemicals. However, despite all the minimum conveying velocity research (one of the operating boundaries for pneumatic conveying) that has been undertaken for several decades, the wide scatter and contradictions in the predictions of the minimum conveying velocity for dilute phase pneumatic conveying exist yet, determination of the operating boundaries for pneumatic conveying (mainly maximum conveying velocity for dense phase and minimum conveying velocity for dilute phase) still has been one of the most important tasks to be solved for the design, optimising and upgrade of pneumatic conveying systems as a consequence of that the mechanisms involved in the formation of boundaries between dilute-phase and dense-phase pneumatic conveying through a horizontal pipeline have not been well explored.Saltation velocity was investigated initially in this thesis and then the emphasis was placed on the transition between dilute-phase and dense-phase. With careful observations, it is found that pneumatic conveying of granular solid materials through a horizontal pipeline can exhibit five different flow modes (as the air velocity is decreased): fully suspended flow; strand flow; stable or unstable strand flow over a stationary layer for low solid mass flow rates; stable or unstable strand flow over a slowly moving bed for high solid mass flow rates; low-velocity slug-flow. The pressure fluctuations within the unstable zone result from the flow mode alternation between a strand flow over a stationary layer (or slowly moving bed) and slug flow starting at the inlet due to a decrease in air velocity. The first slug moves quickly at a relatively high velocity and picks up a relatively thick stationary layer in front of it but only deposits a small amount of the material behind it. The increase in slug length and large increase in pressure cause severe pressure fluctuations and pipeline vibrations. Two different flow modes may exist simultaneously in the conveying pipeline: strand flow over a stationary layer or slowly moving bed near the feed point followed by the dilute-phase (suspension) flow of particles. For the latter, material erodes away from the end of the stationary layer or slowly moving bed and is conveyed in the form of small dunes (or pulsating strand flow).Based on the mass balance, force balance, momentum balance and the unstable flow forming mechanism, a theoretical three-layer model for the prediction of the transition zone boundaries has been established. With stability analysis, the boundaries of the transition zone in the state diagram have been identified, and have been found to agree very well with experimental data. According to the model established, the discussion on the influence of design parameters of particle and bulk properties of the material being conveyed and pipe wall properties on boundaries in the state diagram has been conducted.The discussion on the operating boundaries for pneumatic conveying of granular materials has been extended to conveying of powder materials and a principle for classification of granular materials and powder materials, which have different flow mode in PCC, has been proposed.The research also has been carried out on the pressure drop prediction for pneumatic conveying of granular materials in the form of low-velocity slug-flow in order to have a perfect PCC state diagram. A new approach for the direct measurement of stress transmission factor has been developed in this thesis. The effect of the weight of the granular material in the slug on pressure drop is taken in account according to the experimental test results. The model for pressure drop prediction also includes a modified equation for the frontal force of the moving slug - allowing for momentum balance of accelerating particles and the additional force from the stationary layer to resist the movement. The modelling predictions agree very well with test results obtained on poly pellets conveyed through 98 mm and 60.3 mm ID horizontal stainless steel pipelines, each 21 m in length.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of imperfect mixing in suspended plant and animal cell cultures</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Caleb Kin Lok, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A common problem observed in large-scale cell cultivation is reduced culture performance compared with small-scale processes due to the existence of concentration gradients caused by poor mixing. Small-scale simulations using microbial cell suspensions have shown that circulation of cells through concentration gradients of oxygen, pH and glucose can result in reduction of cell growth and product formation similar to the effects observed in large-scale bioreactors. This study was aimed at using scale-down studies to investigate poor mixing in large-scale bioreactors used for suspended plant and animal cell culture. Two plant cell suspensions and a hybridoma cell line were used in this work. The range of oxygen transfer coefficients achieved in the hybridoma and plant suspensions were about 50???20 h-1 and 12???6 h-1, respectively. One-vessel simulation was developed to induce fluctuations of dissolved oxygen tension in a 2-L bioreactor using intermittent sparging of air and nitrogen. The effect of dissolved oxygen fluctuations on the cells was examined by comparing the performance of the cultures with those operated at constant dissolved oxygen tension. In the hybridoma suspension culture, only slight effects on cell growth were observed at circulation times above 300 s. No effect on the specific glucose uptake rate or antibody production was observed at the circulation times tested. Analysis of gene expression for selected hypoxia-related genes also suggested that the overall effect was limited. In plant cell suspensions, the specific growth rates and biomass yields on total sugar in the cultures under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension were essentially the same as those at constant dissolved oxygen tension for both transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Thalictrum minus. Under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension, no effect on antibody accumulation was observed in transgenic N. tabacum suspensions, but a decrease in berberine accumulation was observed in T. minus. From the results, it can be concluded that only minimal effects due to the development of concentration gradients would be expected in large-scale bioreactors used for the cultivation of the hybridoma and plant cell suspensions tested in this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Plant cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a validated falls risk assessment for use in clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Tiedemann, Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Falls risk factor assessment is the first step in the development of appropriate intervention strategies for the prevention of falls. However, few multifactorial, validated falls risk assessments exist which are suitable for use in busy clinical settings. This project aimed to develop a reliable and valid falls risk assessment that was feasible for use in various clinical settings. The QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment was developed and evaluated via four methods; a) the test-retest reliability of the measures was assessed with 30 community-dwelling older people, b) the concurrent validity of the measures was assessed by comparison with performance in the Physiological Profile Assessment, c) the predictive validity of the measures was assessed by comparison of performance with prospective falls in two studies involving large samples of community dwelling older people and d) the feasibility of the assessment was evaluated with 40 clinicians who trialled the assessment with their patients. The QuickScreen clinical falls risk assessment consists of eight measures, including previous falls, total medications, psychoactive medications, visual acuity, touch sensation, the sit to stand test, the near tandem stand test and the alternate step test. The test-retest reliability of the assessment measures was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.89) and the assessment measures discriminated between multiple fallers and non-multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. The clinicians that trialled the assessment reported that it was quick and easy to administer and that it assisted in the management of their elderly patients. These results show that the QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment has proven validity, test-retest reliability and is practical for use in a variety of clinical settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) in old age</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient computation of advanced skyline queries.</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Yidong, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Skyline has been proposed as an important operator for many applications, such as multi-criteria decision making, data mining and visualization, and user-preference queries.  Due to its importance, skyline and its computation have received considerable attention from database research community recently. All the existing techniques, however, focus on the conventional databases. They are not applicable to online computation environment, such as data stream. In addition, the existing studies consider efficiency of skyline computation only, while the fundamental problem on the semantics of skylines still remains open. In this thesis, we study three problems of skyline computation: (1) online computing skyline over data stream; (2) skyline cube computation and its analysis; and (3) top-k most representative skyline. To tackle the problem of online skyline computation, we develop a novel framework which converts more expensive multiple dimensional skyline computation to stabbing queries in 1-dimensional space.  Based on this framework, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the time complexity of online skyline computation is provided. Then, efficient algorithms are proposed to support ad hoc and continuous skyline queries over data stream. Inspired by the idea of data cube, we propose a novel concept of skyline cube which consists of skylines of all possible non-empty subsets of a given full space.  We identify the unique sharing strategies for skyline cube computation and develop two efficient algorithms which compute skyline cube in a bottom-up and top-down manner, respectively.  Finally, a theoretical framework to answer the question about semantics of skyline and analysis of multidimensional subspace skyline are presented. Motived by the fact that the full skyline may be less informative because it generally consists of a large number of skyline points, we proposed a novel skyline operator -- top-k most representative skyline. The top-k most representative skyline operator selects the k skyline points so that the number of data points, which are dominated by at least one of these k skyline points, is maximized.  To compute top-k most representative skyline, two efficient algorithms and their theoretical analysis are presented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Database management.</field><field name="subject">Database design.</field><field name="subject">Question-answering systems.</field><field name="subject">Natural language processing (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Semantics - Data processing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Arab as spectacle: race, gender and representation in Australian popular culture</field><field name="creator">Abood, Paula, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis, The Arab as Spectacle, is about representation. It is about the limits and the contradictions of representation. It is about the burden and the violence of representation. It is about the persistence of Orientalism and how the hierarchies of race and gender intersect with discourses on sexuality to inform and inflect the representation of Arabs in contemporary literary and media spheres of Australian popular culture. This thesis comprises two sections. Part One is a research dissertation that explores the strategies, devices and parameters of the representation of Arabic culture and identities through close readings of specific texts. This theoretical project inaugurates the second part of my study which takes up the question of the contradictions of representation through a collection of ficto-critical writings. Through these satirical narratives, I seek to expose and disrupt the hegemony of Orientalist representations that proliferate in English language literature and news media by bringing into focus the inherent paradox of representation, working within and against Orientalist representational traditions. In so doing, it is not my aim to 'correct' the Orientalist logic and imagery that I theorise in the first part of this thesis, but rather to undermine the spurious truth-value of Orientalist representations by deploying the literary weapons of satire, parody and irony. In this way, my fiction works to engage creatively and critically with the very tropes that I theorise in my research dissertation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orientalism.</field><field name="subject">Representation (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Arabs in popular culture -- Western countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function of ideas of reason in Kant???s political philosophy.</field><field name="creator">Keating, Paula, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the power of ideas in political philosophy and practice. It argues firstly that Kant???s ideas of reason, as he originally defines them as regulative in the First Critique, play an important role in his political philosophy and his dynamic approach to politics. Secondly, because it is fundamentally concerned with political transition and improvement, Kant???s approach to politics is therefore one that has continuing relevance. Evidence for this is provided via an examination of Rawls??? political liberalism and the manner in which the idea of the reasonable fulfils the role of an idea of reason. The thesis begins with an examination of the regulative use of ideas of reason in the Dialectic of the First Critique: the ideas of soul, world and God become guides for practice, insofar as they are not bearers of truth but instead create essential conditions necessary for human life and meaning. Chapter Two then demonstrates how ideas of reason figure in Kant???s political texts. They condition politics by inspiring the practice of their objects, for example, the establishment of a rightful condition, the security of private property, the perpetuation of peace. That they look to the status quo in order to effect politics, demonstrates their concern with social progress. Chapter Three argues that publicity forms the primary political idea of reason as it enables the polity to use ideas of reason. Because publicity provides the test of efficient and rightful politics, we can say that it is through publicity that Kant???s politics is grounded. Chapter Four investigates Rawls??? political liberalism and observes that the primacy of the idea of the reasonable in his theory works according to a system of ideas of reason as proposed by Kant. Chapter Five then makes a final comparison between Kant and Rawls to demonstrate that ideas of reason, in particular the pre-eminent political idea of public reason, is central to both their conceptions of the political condition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reason.</field><field name="subject">Political science.</field><field name="subject">Kant, Immanuel, 1724-1804.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theory-based description of Australian franchising regulation</field><field name="creator">Moore, Gregory Allison, Business Law &amp; Taxation, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This paper examines franchising regulation in Australia as a case study for the analysis of regulation based on established regulatory theory. A literature review is conducted to establish and critique the theory of regulation based on the four main areas of established theory; regulatory purpose, regulatory strategies, rulemaking and enforcement. Case study data is drawn from primary source material and academic commentary on franchising regulation and presented according to the eras of franchising regulation in Australia, moving from the first proposals for legislation in the 1970s to the prescribed mandatory Franchising Code of Conduct model adopted in 1998 and refinements made to that scheme up to 2006. An analysis is then conducted on each major aspect of Australian franchising regulation using the established theoretical principles and analytical constructs available in the literature. The study concludes that the Franchising Code of Conduct regime, as a culmination of the experience gained and study undertaken in the preceding eras, is characterised by the availability of a broad range of enforcement options from harsh deterrence-oriented measures to more gentle and cooperative compliance-oriented options constituting an effective regulatory pyramid. The effectiveness of the regime is further bolstered by the presence of a credible regulatory strategy pyramid which emphasises the real possibility of escalated intervention, coupled with skilful deployment by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as enforcement agency. The principal weakness of the scheme is identified as unnecessarily ambiguous drafting in some areas, which compromises the quality of the otherwise highly transparent ruleset. It is suggested that the choice of regulatory strategy, often a focus of superficial examinations of regulation, is largely irrelevant to the nature of the regulation, with other features such as enforcement strategy, legitimacy, and availability of credible sanctions proving much more important. A proposal for an analytical framework based on the established theory is developed based on the experience of applying that theory to the case study. While this outlined framework assists in broadening focus across the entire regulatory regime to encourage assessment of the component parts, a lack of cohesion and linkage amongst the components highlights a shortcoming in the development of regulatory theory and an opportunity for further research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Code of Conduct</field><field name="subject">Regulation</field><field name="subject">Franchising</field><field name="subject">Franchises (Retail trade) -- Law and legislation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Trade regulation -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"More than a liver" - the role of the social work practitioner in hepatitis C treatment centres</field><field name="creator">Mouton, Marlize, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hepatitis C is a fast growing infectious disease in Australia and is often associated with related psycho-social and mental health problems.  The conventional treatment process for hepatitis C is challenging due to a number of reasons.  This study explored social workers&#146; perceptions of the contribution of their role in hepatitis C treatment centres in relation to the treatment experience of patients.  The roles that social workers fulfill, their contribution to the multidisciplinary team and towards a culturally competent service, were explored.  Furthermore the knowledge, skills and values required for providing a competent service in a hepatitis C treatment setting was explored.  The broad theoretical frameworks that inform social work practice were considered, especially the biopsycho-social model, the strengths perspective, the critically reflexive approach and communications theory.  This qualitative study used a semi-structured interview method for data collection.  Ten social workers in hepatitis C treatment clinics participated in the study.  The findings highlight the needs of patients and how social worker participants described helping to address and meet these needs by employing their knowledge, skills and values through their social work roles and interventions in a team context in a multicultural and multi-faceted work environment.  A major challenge that social workers described was to keep patients on treatment despite debilitating side effects that diminish patients' motivation to complete treatment.  A shortcoming in the service was described to be the limited psychiatric support available at many treatment centres.  The findings lead to a number of recommendations to improve social work services in hepatitis C treatment settings.  More research was recommended in areas such as motivational techniques, psychiatric support, and effective group work strategies.  The need for increased funding for social work positions in the hepatitis C field was also highlighted.  It is anticipated that findings of this study can be applied to hepatitis C treatment in broader settings such as prisons, drug and alcohol settings and general practice.  This research will contribute to literature in the field of hepatitis C treatment models and in the field of social work practice in hepatitis C contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interferon treatment compliance</field><field name="subject">Social Work</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Treatment -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Multi disciplinary team</field><field name="subject">Chronic illness</field><field name="subject">Psycho social assessments</field><field name="subject">Social workers</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Australia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Patients</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assurance reporting and the communication process: impacts on report users' perceptions and decision-making</field><field name="creator">Pflugrath, Gary, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the effectiveness of communication between assurors and assurance report users, and the role that assurance reports play in this process. It comprises two behavioural experiments undertaken in the context of: (i) wording changes to the audit report (developed product) using shareholders as participants; and (ii) the role of assurance and type of assurance provider for corporate social responsibility reporting (evolving product), using financial analysts as participants. In both studies effectiveness of communication is examined in terms of report users?? perceptions and investment decision-making. The theoretical framework used in these studies is adapted from a communications model developed by Shannon and Weaver (1949), and supplemented by psychology research focused on source credibility (Birnbaum and Stegner, 1979). Two key elements of the communication process are recognised; the: (i) message transmitted; and (ii) source of the message. The first element is considered in the first experiment; the second element in the second study. Useful feedback is provided to standard-setters. From the first study, report users?? perceptions are not impacted by changes to the wording of the audit report. However, in the second experiment they are affected by differences in the source of the message. In terms of trustworthiness, financial analysts perceive the credibility of the source of corporate social responsibility information to be significantly greater when assured. For a company in an industry with stronger incentives to report positive corporate social responsibility information, they perceive the credibility (trustworthiness, overall credibility) of the source of the information to be significantly greater when assured. They also discern differences between types of assuror whereby the credibility (trustworthiness, expertise, overall credibility) of the source of information is perceived to be greater when assured by a professional accountant than a sustainability expert. A contribution of these experiments is the analysis of report users?? investment decision-making, as well as their perceptions. Differences in the message and source of the message for assurance reporting have no impact on report users?? investment decisions. Differences in characteristics of report users (familiarity with reports, extent to which reports are understandable) appear to impact report users?? perceptions and merits further examination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate Social Responsibility</field><field name="subject">Assurance Reporting</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geomorphology of Southeast Australian mountain streams</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Chris J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the morphology and sediment transport dynamics of mountain streams in southeast Australia. Mountain streams represent important geomorphological and ecological systems in Australia which have hitherto been poorly studied. The variability of mountain stream reach morphology was investigated at the regional scale using topographical surveys and sediment sampling techniques. Study sites were stratified by slope and local lithology. Eight channel-morphologies including Bedrock, Cascade, Step-pool, Planebed, Pool-Riffle, Cascade-pool, Riffle-step and Infilled, were identified using an objective statistical approach. Overall, channel types were found to correspond to existing reach-scale mountain stream templates. Five morphologies were associated with a specific lithology type which controlled the size and shape of grains supplied to the channels.  Differences in coarse sediment transport processes between morphologies were investigated using stream monitoring techniques and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Monitoring results from a 3 year period indicated that channel beds are resistant to entrainment with shear stress thresholds for bedload transport ranging between 64 to 74 N/m2. Transport of reach median grain sizes requires floods that exceed bankfull discharge. Existing competence equations were found to over-predict the hydraulic driving force and consequently, a modified entrainment model was used to account for the regional channel characteristics.   OSL dating was investigated as a tool to provide data on long-term sediment transport processes. Minimum age model results from the OSL dates show overall agreement with a selected entrainment model, and indicate differences in sediment transport dynamics between some reach morphology types. A regime model was used to quantify the physical domains of different channel morphologies. Limitations of the model were overcome by modifying the sediment supply surrogate to better reflect the dominant transported bedload size.

The distribution of channel morphology types within a series of catchments in southeast Australia was modelled within a GIS platform using the diagnostics of reach morphology derived from this study.

It is a problem largely created by humans as they transport and introduce species, deliberately and accidentally, from one part of the globe to another. The pressures exerted on biodiversity by international trade are one of the most serious aspects of the IAS problem. Although states are under obligations in international environmental law to prevent the entry of, and control, those alien species that threaten biodiversity, to date state practice has often been found wanting. In particular, quarantine regulation, which can be a state??s first line of defence against IAS, is mainly used by states to protect their farming and agricultural product sectors rather than biodiversity at large. The reasons for this include lack of domestic resources and lack of guidance at the international level. However, even if states were to expand the purview of quarantine, the question arises whether they would be able to use quarantine regulation to protect biodiversity from IAS while simultaneously fulfilling their international trade law obligations. This study seeks to answer this question by examining international environmental law and international trade law in their application to quarantine regulation. In doing so, the study identifies many areas of conflict. The different policies that underpin environmental and trade regimes mean that environmental concepts, such as the precautionary principle and the ecosystem approach, are difficult to apply within the international trade law regime. A way of achieving a more harmonized international response to the problem of IAS is suggested by incorporating environmental considerations into the international standards used by states to design and implement domestic quarantine measures. To facilitate the practical implementation of international standards the study further recommends appropriate financial and institutional capacity building mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SPS Agreement</field><field name="subject">Invasive Alien Species</field><field name="subject">Quarantine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defendants, mental illness and negligence law: a critique</field><field name="creator">Bromberger, Nikki, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">At common law, liability in negligence is based generally on an objective standard of reasonable care. As a consequence of this idea those who possess reduced capacities, as compared to the ordinary reasonable person, may be held to standards which they are incapable of reaching. Yet there are exceptions to this general rule. Children are not required to behave the way reasonable adults behave. Rather, when the defendant is a child, courts take into account the capabilities which are a concomitant of the defendant???s age. A defendant???s mental illness, on the other hand, is not considered by courts in Australia (or elsewhere) to be relevant when determining liability in negligence. It has been argued that in this regard the common law is incoherent and unfair. This thesis considers whether these claims of incoherence and unfairness can be substantiated. In so doing, it considers the philosophical underpinnings of tort law in order to explore possible bases for the current law. It also examines a number of more specific accounts which attempt to justify the present law as it relates to mental illness. It is argued that none of these discussions provide a convincing basis for the different treatment in law between child defendants and defendants with a mental illness. The discussion extends beyond the confines of tort law to criminal law for explanations for the apparent incoherence. It notes the suggestion that the criminal law???s response to defendants with a mental illness has been fuelled to some extent by a misunderstanding of mental illness and a fear of those suffering from such illnesses. The thesis examines whether this negative attitude towards mental illness, which some scholars have referred to as ???sanism???, is at work in the few Australian decisions which have considered the common law position in relation to mentally ill defendants. Possible changes to this area of law are then outlined and considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Racism, pluralism and democracy in Australia : re-conceptualising racial vilification legislation</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Tamsin, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australian debates about racial vilification legislation have been dominated by mainstream American First Amendment jurisprudence and popular American notions of 'free speech' to the exclusion of alternative Europeans models. This can be seen from notions of Australian racial vilification legislation as inconsistent with 'free speech' rights as well as the influence of some of the basic assumptions of First Amendment jurisprudence on political speech cases in the Australian High Court. Despite the widespread existence of legislation that penalises racial vilification at State and Federal levels, there has been a rise in Australia over the past 10 years of divisive 'race' politics. Against that background, this thesis considers the scope and limits of racial vilification legislation in Australia. It is argued that First Amendment jurisprudence is inadequate in the Australian context, because it is heavily dependent upon economic metaphors, individualistic notions of identity and outdated theories of communication. It assumes that 'free speech' in terms of lack of government intervention is essential to 'democracy'. It ignores the content, context and effect of harmful speech, except in extreme cases, with the result that socially harmful speech is protected in the name of 'free speech'. This has narrowed the parameters within which racial vilification is understood and hindered the development of a broader discourse on the realities of racist harms, and the mechanisms necessary for their redress. The author calls for the development of an Australian jurisprudence of harmful speech. Failing an Australian Bill of Rights, that jurisprudence would be grounded upon the implied constitutional right of free political speech, informed by an awareness that modern structures of public speech favour a very limited range of speech and speakers. The jurisprudence would take advantage of the insights of Critical Race Theory into the connections between racial vilification and racist behaviour, as well as the personal and social harms of racial vilification. Finally, it is argued that the concepts of human dignity and equality, which underpin European discrimination legislation and notions of justice, provide a way forward for Australian jurisprudence in this area.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Race discrimination</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Freedom of speech</field><field name="subject">Racism in language</field><field name="subject">Racism</field><field name="subject">Civil rights</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Codex : code X : a palimpsest reading of the book as a material object in a new media age</field><field name="creator">Lee, Penelope, School of Design, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the effects of new media technologies on the architecture of the book in the context of a New Media Age. The aim of the project was to develop a Conceptual Framework for the design and production of the contemporary book as a material object. The materiality of the contemporary book is examined by revisiting its historical origins in the Middle Ages, to discover the extent in which the ???new??? media technology of mechanical printing determined the design and production of the fifteenth century book. Parallels were then drawn between these effects and those of digital technology on the book in this current New Media Age. The results revealed the book as a palimpsest, where remnants of ???older??? media remain embedded in the design and form of the ???new.??? While fundamentally situated in the field of graphic design, the study also ventures into the disciplines of architecture and the semiotic theories of Umberto Eco and Gunther Kress. The design of the research includes historical and theoretical analysis, case studies of selected contemporary book objects and a series of studio investigations into the space, form, techniques, processes and materials of traditional and contemporary book construction. The theories and design practices of William Morris, implemented in the studio investigations, included researching the origins of book production in the fifteenth century and the traditional hand technologies of papermaking, printmaking and bookbinding. New media investigations included experimental work with laser etching and the embedding of printed, paper pages in porcelain. A synthesis of the theoretical and practical research findings, was then interpreted as semiotic conceptual matrices, from which a Conceptual Framework was constructed. Conclusions drawn from the study reveal the design of the book as a palimpsest of past technologies that remain embedded in the design of the contemporary book. As a material demonstration of the thesis, a series of threedimensional conceptual models were developed as reading sites informing the design of contemporary books as palimpsest readings of the book as a material object for the New Media Age.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Books</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of term structure of interest rates - theory, modelling and econometrics</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shuling, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the modelling of the term structure of interest rates, with a particular focus on empirical aspects of the modelling. In this thesis, we explore the ??-parameterised (?? being the length of time to maturity) term structure of interest rates, corresponding to the traditional T-parameterised (T being the time of maturity) term structure of interest rates. The constructions of Australian yield curves are illustrated using generic yield curves produced by the Reserve Bank of Australia based on bonds on issue and by constructed yield curves of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia derived from swap rates. The data used to build the models is Australian Treasury yields from January 1996 to December 2001 for maturities of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 years, and the second data used to validate the model is Australian Treasury yields from July 2000 to April 2004 for maturities of all years from 1-10. Both data were supplied by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Initially, univariate Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH), with models of individual yield increment time series are developed for a set of fixed maturities. Then, a multivariate Matrix-Diagonal GARCH model with multivariate asymmetric t-distribution of the term structure of yield increments is developed. This model captures many important properties of financial data such as volatility mean reversion, volatility persistency, stationarity and heavy tails. There are two innovations of GARCH modelling in this thesis: (i) the development of the Matrix-Diagonal GARCH model with multivariate asymmetric t-distribution using meta-elliptical distribution in which the degrees of freedom of each series varies with maturity, and the estimation is given; (ii) the development of a GARCH model of term structure of interest rates (TS-GARCH). The TS-GARCH model describes the parameters specifying the GARCH model and the degrees of freedom using simple smooth functions of time to maturity of component series. TS-GARCH allows an empirical description of complete interest rate yield curve increments therefore allowing the model to be used for interpolation to additional maturity beyond those used to construct the model. Diagnostics of TS-GARCH model are provided using Australian Treasury bond yields.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GARCH</field><field name="subject">Yields</field><field name="subject">Term structure of interest rates</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms and treatment strategies to overcome resistance to non-cytotoxic therapy in cancer</field><field name="creator">Kuljaca, Selena, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">As anti-cancer agents, retinoid induce cell growth arrest and differentiation, while HDACIs cause cell differentiation, growth inhibition, death and inhibit angiogenesis in many cancer types. However, a proportion of patients respond poorly to these therapies.  My studies, presented here, aimed to improve the anti-cancer effects of these agents by identifying key factors which mediate cancer cell sensitivity or resistance to their action. In this study I have found that the clinically used retinoid, 13-cis RA, exerts its anti-cancer signal in a manner similar to atRA, by modulating the transcriptional response of retinoid-regulated genes.  HDACI-induced cytotoxicity is significantly enhanced when combined with IFN&#945; in 8 out of 9 cancer cell lines from various organ origins. Sensitivity to the combination treatment correlated with an absence of basal p21 protein expression, and cell cycle arrest. Knocking-down p21 gene expression further sensitized cancer cells to the combination therapy. Moreover, IFN&#945; and HDACI co-operatively inhibited pro-angiogenic gene expression in cancer cells, and the combination therapy decreased endothelial cell migration, invasion, and capillary tubule formation.  Further experiments on p21 as a resistance factor to anti-cancer treatment demonstrated that conditioned media from breast cancer MCF-7 cells transfected with p21 siRNA, induced significantly less endothelial cell migration, invasion and vascular sprouting, compared with media from cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. LC/MS analysis of the conditioned media revealed that Trx secretion was significantly reduced after p21 knockdown. The reduction in Trx secretion following p21 knockdown was due to a direct effect of p21 siRNA on the expression of intracellular TBP2 in neuroblastoma, prostate and lung cancer cells. Consistent with this result, media from MCF7 cells transfected with TBP2-specific siRNA alone, promoted endothelial cell invasion and vascular sprouting, Trx knockdown resulted in opposite effects, and the anti-angiogenic effect of p21 siRNA was offset by simultaneous TBP2 siRNA transfection. ChIP assay revealed that p21 directly bound to an E2F1-bindng site in the TBP2 gene promoter. These data indicate that p21 promoted tumour-driven angiogenesis through transcriptional repression of TBP2. Collectively, my experiments indicate several potential treatment targets directed toward enhancing the effectiveness of HDACIs and retinoids.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Non-cytotoxic treatment</field><field name="subject">Angiogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Driving preferences for co-branded products: effects of extendibility, compatibility and uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Lin, Song, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Firms frequently use brand extension strategies to enter new product categories. Another type of entry strategy is co-branding by effectively exploiting the equity of both constituent brands. Co-branding may effectively drive consumer preferences if consumers believe the combination of two brands offers a better solution than either one separately. However, there is also the risk that consumers may get confused with the combination, or have perceptions of strengths regarding one of the brands diluted, leading to the failure of this strategy. While much has been written on brand-category extension, despite its prevalence, the use of co-brands to enter a new category has attracted relatively little attention. In this study, the author models the effects on consumer perceptions and preferences of combining two brand names for a new product. The proposed model provides a mechanism to represent how consumers&#146; prior attribute beliefs about constituent brands, the extendibility of the brands into the extension category, the compatibility between the constituent brands, and the uncertainty associated with them can jointly determine their preferences for the co-branded product. The contribution that this model enables is a means to study co-branding and new category entry simultaneously, by assessing the drivers of consumer preference for a co-brand in a new product category. An empirical study is designed to test the model, using real brands and hypothetical extensions and co-brands. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications of this study are discussed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New product</field><field name="subject">Co-branding</field><field name="subject">Brand extension</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of the flat panel display industry in Taiwan: the ???triple-alliance??? perspective</field><field name="creator">Liu, Jen Wei (John), Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines what role three institutions in Taiwan ??? state bureaucracy, local business groups and multinational corporations, played in the development of the flat panel display (TFT-LCD) technology. The thesis adopts the ???Triple-alliance??? conceptual framework to understand how these three institutions cooperated to develop TFT-LCD; it argues that it is vital to understand the interactions among these three institutions in order to map the development of a high technology industry in a late industrializing country. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are adopted in order to validate the utility of the ???Triple-alliance??? conceptual framework. The qualitative part of the study employed five semi-structured interviews to gain first hand understanding of the development of the TFT-LCD industry. The interviews were supplemented with secondary sources from annual reports, newspapers, and trade journals. In the quantitative part of the study, data was collected from 100 information technology related firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Hierarchal multiple regression analysis investigated the relationships between institutional factors and firm performance. The findings reveal that there exists a strong relationship between institutional alliances and firm performance. The positive relationship highlights the significance of the ???Triple-alliance??? framework in helping explain the institutional mechanism often adopted by late developing nations and firms to help develop indigenous technologies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A city within the suburbs - gender, modernity and the suburban shopping centre</field><field name="creator">Daborn, Shirley, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Notions of modernity as progress have traditionally excluded the significance of woman's societal participation. This thesis investigates the exclusion of woman from the rhetoric of modernity and modem living through her culturally defined role as the primary shopper. Entrenched ambiguities have helped sustain societal contradictions that have marred both the cultural identity of woman as primary shopper and the suburban shopping centre. This dissertation, therefore, analyses the mid-twentieth century suburban shopping centre in relation 10 retail practice and woman's cultural identity in relation to broader community change. Evolving from within the specific dynamics of modern living, the values of progress are coupled with tradition thereby creating a unique space that represents both change and stability. This dissertation grounds the progressive value of modernity within the cyclical traditions of everyday practice to construct an understanding of woman's cultural identity in relation to the demands of modem living. A critique of broader societal issues and retail development culminate in a focused analysis of the Roselands shopping centre in Sydney, Australia 1965. Acknowledging the importance of use in the construction of meaning recognises the woman as primary shopper as integral to the rhetoric of retail practice and societal progress. A gap emerges within woman's cultural identity because although she is culturally aligned with the traditions of domesticity her role as primary shopper also positions her as central to modem living. It is within this ideological gap that a movement of meaning occurs and situates the shopping centre as a site of cultural mediation. This dissertation concludes that issues of accessibility and everyday use positions the shopping space as an important site of social mediation that negotiates cultural change on a level of everyday practice and, importantly, acknowledges woman's presence and participation within modernity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of amines and imines organometallic catalysts</field><field name="creator">Rumble, Sarah Louise, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes investigations into the catalysed syntheses of amines and imines using organoiridium and organorhodium complexes with N-donor ligands as the catalysts. These catalysed syntheses were achieved via hydroamination, hydrosilylation, and hydrogenation reactions, as well as tandem hydroamination/imine reduction reactions. An in situ catalysis study found that the most active catalysts for the hydroamination of 4-pentyn-1-amine (1) to give 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (4) were formed from a combination of catalyst components that resulted in an electron deficient metal centre, indicating that an alkyne binding mechanism was most likely. The kinetics of the hydroamination of 4-pentyn-1-amine (1), catalysed by the complexes [Rh(bim)(CO)2][BPh4] (7), [Ir(bim)(CO)2][BPh4] (8), [Rh(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (9),and [Ir(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (10) (bpm = bis(1-pyrazolyl)methane and bim = bis(Nmethylimidazol- 2-yl)methane) were modelled and compared. The nature of the metal centre was found to have the most influence on the rate of the product release step, while the nature of the N-donor ligand was found to have the most influence on the rate of the substrate binding step. The investigation of the catalysed hydroamination of the phenyl substituted alkynylamines 5-phenyl-4-pentyn-1-amine (2), 4-phenyl-3-butyn-1-amine (13) and 2- phenyl-4-pentyn-1-amine (34) revealed a difference in catalytic activity between the rhodium and iridium complexes depending on the alkyne substituent. A series of novel rhodium(I) complexes were synthesised: [RhClCO(Mes-DAD(Me))] (38), [RhClCO(Mes-BIAN)] (22), [Rh(COD)(Mes-BIAN)][BF4] (39), [Rh2(COD)2(bmimen)](BPh4)2 (40) and [Rh2(CO)4(bmimen)](BPh4)2 (41), where Mes- DAD(Me) = biacetylbis(2,4,6-trimethylphenylimine), Mes-BIAN = bis(2,4,6- trimethylphenylimino)acenapthene and bmimen = 1,2-bis[(1-methyl-2- imidazolyl)methylene-amino]ethane. The cationic complex 40 was found to be an active hydroamination catalyst, while the neutral complexes 38 and 22 were only active in the presence of the tetraphenylborate counterion. A range of imines was found to be efficiently reduced to their respective amines via hydrosilylation or hydrogenation using the iridium(I) complex [Ir(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (10) as catalyst. The hydrosilylation reaction was found to be significantly faster in a protic solvent (methanol), giving the desilylated amines without the need for a desilylation step. The mechanism of this reaction was proposed to involve a monohydride iridium(I) complex as a key intermediate. The tandem hydroamination/hydrosilylation of a series of alkynylamine substrates was achieved using the iridium complexes 8 and 10, in which the iridium complex catalyses the two mechanistically distinct reactions in the one-pot. Catalysed tandem hydroamination/hydrogenation reactions were also achieved, but were less facile.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amines</field><field name="subject">organometallic catalysts</field><field name="subject">imines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of acquisition form, domestic liquidity costs for US cross-listed firms, and convergence in information environment : an investor protection perspective : a dissertation submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance, Department of Commerce, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nhut Hoang</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains three empirical studies that examine the effect of investor protection on three different aspects of corporate governance: mergers and acquisitions, US cross-listings, and convergence of information environment around the world.1 The first study investigates the relation between investor protection and the choice of acquisition form (partial versus full acquisition). I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Achieving harmony of mind : a grounded theory study of people living with HIV/AIDS in the Thai context : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Balthip, Quantar</field><field name="description">The aims in this Straussian grounded theory inquiry were to gain better understanding of the meaning of spirituality and of the process of spiritual development in people living with HIV/AIDS in the Thai context. In Western contexts, spirituality has been described as the essence of human existence. However, in the Thai context, where Buddhist teachings underpin the understanding of life as body and mind, rather than as body, mind and spirit, the concept of spirituality is little understood by lay people. This gap in understanding called for an inductive approach to knowledge generation. HIV/AIDS is a life-altering and deeply stigmatized disease that results in significant distress and calls into question the meaning and purpose of life for many who are diagnosed with the disease. Nevertheless, some Thai people living with the disease successfully adjust their lives to their situation and are able to live with peace and harmony. These findings raise questions firstly as to the process by which those participants achieved peace and harmony despite the nature of the disease and the limited access to ARV drugs at the time of that study; and secondly as to whether or not the peace and harmony that they described could be linked to the Western concept of spirituality. Data were gathered from 33 participants from the South of Thailand, who had lived with HIV/AIDS for 5 years or more, were aged 18 years or older, and were willing and able to participate in this study. Purposive, snowball and theoretical sampling techniques were used to select participants. Data collection using in-depth interviews and participant observation methods was undertaken over a nine-month period in 2006. The process of data analysis was guided by Strauss and Corbin&#8217;s grounded theory and resulted in the development of a substantive theory. The substantive theory of Achieving Harmony of Mind comprises two categories: struggling to survive and living life. Each category has two subcategories: encountering distress (tukjai) and overcoming distress (longjai), and accomplishing harmony in oneself and discovering an ultimate meaning in life respectively. The metaphor of &#8216;an eclipse&#8217; was used to describe the process of the development of mind of people living with HIV/AIDS and represents the extent to which the individual&#8217;s mind is overshadowed by the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS and its consequences. Diagnosis of this disease turns participants&#8217; lives upside down. Yet selective disclosure of one&#8217;s HIV status, resulting in the receiving of support and connectedness with others, enables participants to find meaning and purpose in life that enables them to recover the will to live and to attempt to stabilise their lives by learning to live with HIV/AIDS. Most participants were able to adjust their mind to accept their new situation and find new self value enabling them to feel free from the shadow of HIV/AIDS and live life with HIV/AIDS as normal. Fewer participants found an ultimate meaning in life &#8211; consistent with Buddhist teachings about suffering and uncertainty, and the impermanence of life that links with an understanding of &#8216;nonself&#8217; &#8211; that enabled them to obtain peace and harmony of mind (kwarmsa-ngobjai). It is this latter stage that represents spirituality in Buddhist terms. This form of spirituality differs significantly from that found in other religions because it does not involve an engagement with a divine and transcendent reality. The findings of this study enhance knowledge about spirituality in the Thai context, and provide a guide for health professionals and education curricula with the aim of achieving more holistic care for patients.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health and spirituality</field><field name="subject">Living with AIDS</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Spiritual development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial infection of avian eggs : a threat to all synchronously incubating species? Case study of New Zealand's little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Boyer, Anne-Sophie</field><field name="description">Microbial infection of eggs was originally investigated in terms of human health only. Recently, however, it was found that it can also cause early embryo mortality in birds, mainly through trans-shell infection prior to incubation. Trans-shell infection is highly dependent upon environmental conditions, egg temperature and egg properties such as shell quality and antimicrobial defences. Microbial infection of eggs is more likely to occur in synchronously incubating species as first laid eggs can be exposed for up to several days prior to full incubation. One example of a population that seems at particular risk of egg microbial infection is New Zealand&#8217;s little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) from Tiritiri Matangi Island. This bird lays two eggs on average three days apart, and is believed to begin full incubation only after the second egg has been laid. Both eggs are laid in particularly humid and soiled nests and contain only low levels of lysozyme, an important antimicrobial protein. The aims of this study were therefore to 1) obtain a first examination of the rates of shell and trans-shell microbial infection of chicken eggs in New Zealand and assess the effects of cleaning on those rates, 2) investigate the role of microbes in hatching failure of little blue penguin eggs and 3) investigate other factors affecting little blue penguin egg viability. This study revealed that shell infection in chicken eggs significantly increased with exposure and significantly decreased with cleaning; however, trans-shell infection was only marginally affected by exposure and cleaning. On Tiritiri Matangi Island, Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, nest type, egg order and shell cleaning did not affect hatching success, suggesting that nest conditions and microbial infection prior to incubation were not a major cause of egg mortality in this population. Temporary abandonment during incubation, however, was very frequent in the second half of the breeding season and fatal to most eggs. These temporary abandonments seemed to be caused by resource limitations, an aspect that should be investigated in future studies.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bird mortality</field><field name="subject">Penguins</field><field name="subject">Egg shell infection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Increasing the spectral efficiency of contunous phase modulation applied to digital microwave radio : a resource efficient FPGA receiver implementation : [a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Electronics and Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand ] EMBARGED UNTIL 1 JUNE 2012</field><field name="creator">Bridger, Andrew B.</field><field name="description">In modern point to point microwave radio systems used to backhaul cellular voice and data traffic, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is the norm. These systems require a highly linear power amplifier which is expensive and has relatively low power efficiency. Recently, continuous phase modulation (CPM) has been deployed in this market. The CPM transmitted waveform has a constant envelope and so a non-linear RF power amplifier can be used. This significantly reduces cost and improves power efficiency. Two important disadvantages of CPM are receiver complexity and inferior spectral efficiency compared to QAM. This thesis demonstrates a 50% spectral efficiency improvement over an existing CPM configuration without loss of detection efficiency. This is achieved by moving to coherent demodulation and extending the duration of the CPM phase pulse to 3 symbol periods. This new CPM configuration of h=1/4, M=4, L=3, is evaluated against ETSI requirements for a 28 MHz channel carrying 24 E1 circuits. Simulation of the receiver floating point model demonstrates all requirements are met. The detection efficiency requirement is exceeded by 4.7 dB. Carrier recovery, phase and timing synchronisation are assumed to be ideal. The 50% increased symbol rate, coherent reception and a longer smoother phase pulse, conspire to increase receiver complexity substantially. The Viterbi algorithm is used to perform maximum-likelihood detection resulting in a 128 state trellis. This application has a stringent cost requirement that limits the implementation target to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) costing less than US$30. To demonstrate this demanding cost target is met, the two most computationally expensive receiver functions, the branch metric unit and path metric processing unit, are implemented in VHDL and targeted to a Xilinx Spartan 3A-DSP 1800 FPGA. The implementation uses 67% of the available logic resources, thus meeting the cost requirement. The branch metric unit is implemented using a distributed arithmetic technique that performs the equivalent of 27.6 giga-multiplies/s, consuming only 23% of the available FPGA logic cells. This is very efficient compared to a conventional approach using all the FPGA&#8217;s embedded multipliers which combined can only achieve 21 giga-multiplies/s. The Viterbi path metric processing unit is implemented using a more conventional state-parallel architecture. To reduce state metric routing complexity, states are grouped into radix-4 units comprising dual add-compare-select (ACS) units. By utilising a spare cycle in the deep ACS pipeline, each ACS unit processes two output state metrics, thus halving the number of ACS units required. This implementation uses 44% of the available FPGA resources and meets timing at 204.5 MHz, exceeding the throughput requirement of 54 Mbit/s.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microwave radio systems</field><field name="subject">Field Programmable Gate Array</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biodegradation of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins [Dha[to the power of 7]]MC-LR and MC-LR by natural aquatic bacteria : a thesis submitted for fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology, Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, College of Sciences, Massey University at Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Somdee, Theerasak</field><field name="description">The aims of this doctoral study were to: isolate naturally occurring bacteria, able to degrade microcystins (MCs), from New Zealand waterbodies; to understand the biological processes of microcystin degradation by bacteria; and to develop small scale biofilm technology for testing the effectiveness of bacteria for microcystin degradation and/or remediation. A significant amount of microcystins were required for biodegradation experiments. A modified method, using DEAE and Strata-X cartridge chromatography, was optimized for purifying microcystin variants from lyophilized bloom samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, collected en masse from Lake Horowhenua. Seven microcystin variants, MC-RR, MC-dMe-RR, MC-YR, MC-LR, [Dha7]MC-LR, MC-FR, and MC-AR were purified by chromatography and then identified by reverse-phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV detector (UVD) and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A mixture of [Dha7]MC-LR and MC-LR, the main microcystin variants present, was used for examining biodegradation of microcystins by degrading bacteria. Three isolates of bacteria&#8212;NV-1, NV-2 and NV-3&#8212;purified from Lake Rotoiti, New Zealand were capable of degrading [Dha7]MC-LR and MC-LR. Among these isolates, NV-3 demonstrated the strongest degradative activity and was identified as a member of the genus Sphingomonas. On the basis of 16S rRNA sequencing, and 100% nucleotide sequence homology, it aligned most closely to strain MD-1. Based on the detection of two intermediate by-products (linearized peptides and a tetrapeptide) and the identification of four genes (mlrA, mlrB, mlrC and mlrD), that encode four putative proteins (enzymes) involved in microcystin degradation, it was suggested that the degradation of [Dha7]MC-LR and MC-LR by the Sphingomonas isolate NV-3 occurred by a similar mechanism previously described for Sphingomonas strain MJ-PV (ACM-3962).  The bacterium Sphingomonas isolate NV-3 was examined for its ability to inhibit the growth of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa strain SWCYNO4. It was found that the bacterium did not have any significant affect on the growth of the cyanobacterium, either by means of secretion of bacterial extracellular products or cell-to-cell contact between bacterial and cyanobacterial cells. It was established that Sphingomonas isolate NV-3 was a moderate biofilm former, based on two types of biofilm formation assays, namely, microtiter plate assays and coupon biofilm assays. This was carried out in preparation for using the bacterium in a bioreactor for biodegradation of [Dha7]MC-LR and MC-LR. The bacterium attached most effectively to ceramic, followed by PVC, polystyrene, stainless steel, and finally glass coupons. Biodegradation of MCs by the bacterium, in an internal airlift loop ceramic honeycomb support bioreactor (IAL-CHS bioreactor), was established in batch and continuous-flow experiments. In the batch experiment, NV-3 degraded a combination of [Dha7]MC-LR and MC-LR at an initial concentration of 25 &#181;g/ml at 30 degrees C in 30 hours, whereas in the continuous-flow experiment, NV-3 degraded the same concentration of [Dha7]MC-LR and MC-LR in 36 hours with an hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 hours. This study has demonstrated that microcystin-degrading bacteria are present in New Zealand waterbodies and that these bacteria could be used, potentially on a larger scale, for removing microcystins from water.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microcystins</field><field name="subject">Biodegradation</field><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Water purification</field><field name="subject">Lake Rotoiti</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270307 Microbial ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A transformational model to understand the impact of enterprise systems for business benefits : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Technology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mathrani, Sanjay</field><field name="description">Over the years many organizations have implemented an enterprise system (ES), also called enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, to streamline the flow of information and improve organizational effectiveness to produce business benefits which justify the ES investment. The effectiveness of these systems to achieve benefits is an area being proactively researched by both professionals and academia. However, most of these studies focus on &#8216;what ESs do&#8217; rather than &#8216;how ESs do it&#8217;. The purpose of this study is to better understand how organizations derive benefits from utilization of an ES and its data. This study utilizes a transformational model of how ES data are transformed into knowledge and results to evaluate the impact of ES information on organizational functions and processes and how this can lead to business benefits. The linkage between expected outcomes, utilization of ES data in decision-making processes, and realized or unrealized benefits provides the reason for this study. Findings reveal that the key benefits commercial firms seek from an ES include improving information flow and visibility, integration and automation of functions, cost reductions by reducing inventory, and achieving process efficiencies for both internal and external operations. The various tools and methods businesses use for transforming ES data into knowledge include the use of data warehouses and business intelligence modules that assist in extraction and manipulation of data, and reporting on particular data objects. Web portals are actively utilized to collaborate between stakeholders and access real-time information. Business tools such as KPI reporting, balanced scorecards and dashboards are used to track progress towards realizing benefits and establishing analytical decision making. Findings emphasize that benefit realization from an ES implementation is a holistic process that not only includes the essential data and technology factors, but also includes other factors such as business strategy deployment, people and process management, and skills and competency development. Findings reveal that business organizations generally lack in producing value assessments that often lead to weak business cases and insufficient benefit models which cannot be used for benefit tracking. However, these organizations are now realizing that it is not enough to put in an ES and expect an automatic improvement. Organizations are now establishing analytical and knowledge-leveraging processes to optimize and realize business value from their ES investment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enterprise system</field><field name="subject">Enterprise resource planning system</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Organisational effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model for managing intellectual capital to generate wealth : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Business, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Helen J</field><field name="description">In an increasingly competitive environment an organisation&#8223;s intellectual capital is the key to its ability to generate wealth. The intangibility of intellectual capital makes it difficult to replicate and therefore it is a crucial differentiator in the business environment. The objective of the research was to develop and test a model for the managing of intellectual capital. An examination of the literature provided the foundation for developing a model to illustrate the various facets an organisation must consider when managing intellectual capital. The Intellectual Capital Management Model specifies that management of intellectual capital is derived from the corporate vision and strategy. Three sources of intellectual capital &#8211; human capital, internal capital and external capital &#8211; contribute to the outcomes essential to differentiate the organisation in the marketplace. Within each of the three sources of intellectual capital, aspects of intellectual capital management were identified and described, according to the research literature. A case study approach was used to assess the extent to which an organisation was managing its intellectual capital. Nine chief executives of the independent business units in a large New Zealand company were interviewed to understand why and how they managed the company&#8223;s intellectual capital. Additionally, 18 employees were interviewed and 44 employees were surveyed in a questionnaire, to determine their views about issues relating to intellectual capital, especially sharing knowledge within the company. Findings indicated that although most of the aspects of the Model were present in the company, conscious management of intellectual capital was not occurring. Metrics was one characteristic frequently mentioned in the literature, but not evident in practice. Behavioural changes and socialisation were two characteristics that emerged strongly from the interviews, but were not widely addressed in the literature. From the perspective of the theoretical model greater attention should be given to behavioural changes and the importance of socialisation; and from the view of the practice model, management needs to address the issue of metrics.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual capital</field><field name="subject">Human capital</field><field name="subject">Internal capital</field><field name="subject">External capital</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community participation in education : does decentralisation matter? An Indonesian case study of parental participation in school management : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fitriah, Amaliah</field><field name="description">A prominent idea in the decentralisation and development literature is that decentralisation leads to deeper and stronger community participation. This thesis seeks to examine this argument by investigating the practice of community participation in the Indonesian decentralisation context, focusing on parental participation through access to and control over school financial resources. Drawing on a case study in Depok city, the practice of parental involvement has been explored by identifying the characteristics and the extent of parents&#8217; participation in school management. School Committees (SCs), as a mechanism of community involvement provided by the decentralised education policy, were also examined in this research to develop an understanding of parental representation in school management. The study found that the characteristics and the extent of parents&#8217; participation in school management have changed and decreased significantly as a result of a new Free School Programme (FSP) introduced by the government in 2009 which freed parents from school operational cost. Prior to FSP, parents actively participated in terms of supplying resources and involvement in school meetings, had some access to financial information, and had limited engagement with school budgeting through representation in SCs. However, the new absence of financial contribution by parents has affected parental participation by transforming it into a weaker form of participation where parents act as mere beneficiaries. The study also revealed that in the Indonesian context, the SCs, as institutional channels for community involvement in education provided by the education decentralisation policy, are not effective in terms of representing and engaging parents in school management. Based on the evidence above, this thesis concluded that in the context of the Indonesian education system, decentralisation has not necessarily enhanced community participation. In this respect, decentralisation is not the only possible answer for achieving a meaningful and empowering parental participation in education. Furthermore, other contextual factors surrounding participation also have to be taken into account. While FSP brings the benefit of allowing students to access education freely, the absence of parental financial contribution has been proved to impact parental participation in a way that is contradictory to one of the purposes of decentralisation policy, which is to engage the community in educational management.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School management</field><field name="subject">Free School Programme, Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Educational decentralisation</field><field name="subject">Indonesian education system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Case study : the experience of managers : the how of organisational learning after patient incidents in a hospital</field><field name="creator">Mok, Yin Shan Joyce</field><field name="description">This case study describes the learning capability of a hospital after patient incidents. The theoretical framework is based on Carroll, Rudolph and Hatakenaka&#8217;s model of four stages of organisational learning. Ten managers were interviewed and documents such as incident management policy, quality plans and incident reports were examined. The ten participants include five clinical managers who are responsible for investigating incidents and five unit managers who are responsible for signing off incident reports. This study found that incident investigations generated valuable learning for the participants. Being the learning agent, they also appeared to influence and lead team learning and, to some extent, organisational learning. Most of the participants appeared to be practising between the constrained stage and the open stage of learning. This study uncovers the concepts of preparedness, perception and persistence. The application of these exemplary concepts has strengthened the learning capability of some participants and distinguishes them as practising at the open stage of learning. By employing these concepts, The Hospital can also gain leverage to progress from the constrained stage to the open stage of learning that supports a systems approach, advocates double-loop learning and facilitates the culture of safety. This case study has found that The Hospital assumes a controlling-orientation to ensure staff&#8217;s compliance with policies and procedures to prevent patient incidents. However, it also advocates a safety culture and attempts to promote learning from patient incidents. This impetus is inhibited by the obstacles in its incident management system, the weak iii modes of transfer of learning and hindering organisational practices. Three propositions are offered to overcome these barriers. Firstly, revolutionise the incident management system to remove obstacles due to the rigid format of Incident Forms, the difficulty in retrieving information and the lack of feedback. Secondly, provide regular, safe, transparent and egalitarian forums for all staff to learn from patient incidents. Facilitated incident meetings have been shown to be more effective platforms for learning than a bureaucratic approach via policies, procedures, training and directive decisions delivered during departmental meetings or by written communications. Thirdly, attain a balance between controlling and learning to mitigate the effects of bureaucratic process and the silo phenomenon.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational learning</field><field name="subject">Organisational procedures</field><field name="subject">Incident management</field><field name="subject">Hospital management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The unique experiences of Maori adoptive mothers in the 'closed stranger' adoption system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology, Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Perkins, Valerie Maruru</field><field name="description">'Closed stranger' adoption in Aotearoa / New Zealand from approximately 1940 to 1990 involved the practice of a complete break between the birth mother and her child and the legal transfer of the child to adoptive parents. In Aotearoa / New Zealand between 1940 and 1990, 108,899 adoptions took place, and most consisted of &#8216;closed stranger&#8217; adoptions. These adoptions have caused much joy as well as some heartache for parties involved in the experience namely, birth mothers, adoptees and adoptive mothers and their wh&#257;nau. This thesis reports original research which aims to investigate the unique experiences of M&#257;ori adoptive mothers in the 'closed stranger' adoption period and enable the impact of legal adoption on these M&#257;ori women who have not previously warranted research, to be valued. A qualitative methodology, M&#257;ori-centred research and unstructured kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face) interviews were utilized to gather data from six M&#257;ori adoptive mothers. The intention of M&#257;ori centred research as its name suggests, is to locate M&#257;ori people and M&#257;ori knowledge at the centre of the research action. A thematic analysis utilizing interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used. The unique experiences of M&#257;ori women legally adopting in the &#8216;closed stranger&#8217; adoption system were about wh&#257;nau business, and grouped under that superordinate theme were experiences of &#8216;not blood&#8217;, land succession, naming and caring for wh&#257;nau. The stigma of adoption resonated throughout the women&#8217;s narratives.

This substantial body of literature has consistently revealed that sports-media continues to be viewed as an exclusively masculine domain, where women remain under- and misrepresented. While content analyses are important in revealing the sexist portrayal of sportswomen in the media, they do little to provide guidance to sociologists on why this continues to occur. Looking behind the scenes into how sports-media content is produced has rarely been explored internationally, and not at all in France, yet is integral to understanding the process through which gendered coverage is sustained. The aim of this exploratory case study was to redress the deficit of sports-media research in France by undertaking a study of those responsible for the production of sports media content. It was guided by the central question: what role do sports-media producers play in perpetuating dominant ideologies in sport? The nine participants were drawn from experienced male and female sports content decision makers (editors and higher) from the major, national television and print media in France. Data was collected through individual semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews and open coded using NVivo 8. The analysis, based around five themes (ideal profile, feedback, sport selection, women&#8217;s sport, blame), revealed that the patterns of sport media decision-making in France show many similarities and some differences to those observed in other countries, but that the end result is the same: sports media content remains dominated by men&#8217;s sport. Findings indicate that women&#8217;s sport is subject to much harsher editorial selection criteria. Conclusions were drawn on what role the makers of sports media content in France have in reproducing this hegemonic masculinity so inherent in sports coverage. The findings will enable stakeholders such as sociologists, journalism academics, sport media management and sports organisations to consider ways through which hierarchical values and accepted patriarchal practices in the sports-media industry can be transformed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sportswomen in the media</field><field name="subject">Patriarchy in sports</field><field name="subject">Women's sport</field><field name="subject">Sports coverage</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Packaging sterilization : aseptic filling technology : a report presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Food Technology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Yin</field><field name="description">Xenos Ltd. is a technology driven food company, that specializes in aseptic processing and packaging beverage products in bottles. Their aseptic filling technology is based on packaging sterilization with combined treatments of oxidizing agents and Ultraviolet radiation. Recent research studies have suggested that there is a synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide (0.5 &#8211; 1 %) plus UV on inactivation of microorganisms including spores. Advantages of the combined treatment include rapid inactivation, minimum hydrogen peroxide residue in products, with the method being applicable to a wide range of packaging types. Based on this principle, a unique aseptic packaging technique has been developed by Xenos Ltd., which utilizes the combination of vaporized Perform (a commercial sterilizing agent manufactured by Orica Chemnet containing 25% hydrogen peroxide and 5% peracetic acid) and UV radiation at 7.5 &#8211; 12.5 W/m2. The aim of the project was to improve and validate the effectiveness of the packaging sterilization process through challenge tests. Challenge tests were conducted using Bacillus subtilis spores as the test microorganism to determine the log reductions delivered by the packaging sterilization system. The tests were firstly carried out on a pilot plant scale aseptic filling machine, in order to test the sterility of the small scale system, and investigate processing parameters (operational conditions) which could affect and improve sterility. The established operational conditions for achieving target sterility were used for designing and modifying an upgrade aseptic packaging system. Finally validation of the upgrade packaging sterilization system was conducted through challenge tests to prove sterility. It is highly recommended that in order to ensure sterility, the packaging sterilization system with vaporized Perform plus UV treatment must meet the requirements listed below during the sterilization process: &#61548;	Hydrogen peroxide concentration of Perform condensate on bottles (after steaming) is best within 0.5 &#8211; 1 %; &#61548;	Perform loading level should be minimum 300 mg/bottle after vaporized Perform treatment; &#61548;	UV treatment time applied is greater than 2 seconds during UV treatment; &#61548;	At least 20 seconds of penetration time (time between Perform treatment and UV treatment) should be allowed.   The upgrade sterilization system used by Xenos Ltd. has been improved to meet the above operational conditions. With spore loading level of 106 per bottle and 105 per cap, the system is able to deliver at least a 6 log reduction of B. subtilis spores on PET or glass bottles and a 5 log reduction on bottle caps. Moruzzi et al. (2000) stated that at least a 4 log reduction is commercially required for an aseptic packaging process. Therefore, the system&#8217;s sterility would meet the commercial acceptable sterility.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Packaging sterilisation</field><field name="subject">Aseptic packaging</field><field name="subject">Food technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memory processes in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Lucy Margaret, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current theories of PTSD propose that impaired retrieval of trauma memories may impede processing of these memories and subsequent trauma recovery. This thesis investigated memory retrieval processes in trauma survivors with and without symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and in non-traumatised individuals exposed to a highly arousing event. Study 1 examined deliberate avoidance of unwanted memories in recent trauma survivors. The results indicated that attempts to forget were associated with poorer recall of forgotten information, but the size of this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Study 2 investigated automatic retrieval inhibition in trauma survivors with or without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The results suggested that repeated retrieval of trauma-related information by individuals with PTSD can cause inhibition of related, but unpractised information. Studies 3 and 4 examined the relationship between the vantage point of trauma memories, avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. The findings indicated that recalling a traumatic event from an observer perspective is associated with post trauma avoidance. They also showed that an observer vantage point in the initial few weeks after trauma is associated with poorer long-term post trauma adjustment. Studies 5, 6 and 7 were analogue studies which analysed the impact of heightened arousal on memory retrieval in novice skydivers. The results suggested that elevated arousal can interfere with retrieval of information related to the arousal-inducing event. Study 7 also indicated that autobiographical memory for the event may be impaired. Finally, Study 8 examined the qualities of trauma memories that were accessed via different modes of retrieval. The results provided evidence that intrusive memories were experienced as more realistic and with more intense affect than memories for the same event that were deliberately retrieved. Together, the findings of this program of research extend current  theories of PTSD by highlighting the mechanisms through which retrieval of trauma memories may be impaired. The results suggest that the quality of trauma memories is affected by avoidance processes, elevated arousal and level of conscious control the individual exerts over retrieval.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychic trauma</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delineating the source, geochemical sinks and aqueous mobilisation processes of naturally occurring arsenic in a coastal sandy aquifer</field><field name="creator">O???Shea, Bethany Megan, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Elevated arsenic concentrations have been reported in a drinking water and irrigation-supply aquifer of Stuarts Point, New South Wales, Australia. Arsenic occurrence in such aquifers is potentially a major issue due to their common use for high yield domestic and irrigation water supplies. Ten multi-level piezometers were installed to depths of approximately 30 m in the sand and clay aquifer. Sediment samples were collected at specific depths during drilling and analysed for chemical and mineralogical composition, grain size characteristics, potential for arsenic release from solid phase and detailed microscopic features. From this data, a full geomorphic reconstruction allowed the determination of source provenance for the aquifer sediments. The model proposed herein provides evidence that the bulk of the aquifer was deposited under intermittent fluvial and estuarine conditions; and that all sediments derive from the regional arsenicmineralised hinterland. More than 200 groundwater samples were collected and analysed for over 50 variables. The heterogeneity of the aquifer sediments causes redox stratification to occur, which in turn governs arsenic mobility in the groundwater. The bulk of the aquifer is composed of fluvial sand deposits undergoing reductive dissolution of iron oxides. Arsenic adsorbed to iron oxide minerals is released during dissolution but re-adsorbs to other iron oxides present in this part of the aquifer. The deeper, more reducing fluvial sand and estuarine clay groundwaters have undergone complete reductive dissolution of iron oxides resulting in the subsequent mobilisation of arsenic into groundwater. Some of this arsenic has been incorporated into iron sulfide mineral precipitates, forming current arsenian pyrite sinks within the aquifer. The extraction of groundwater from the aquifer for irrigation and drinking water supply induces seawater intrusion of arsenic-rich estuarine water, bringing further dissolved arsenic into the aquifer. A greater understanding of the source, sinks and mobilisation of arsenic in this aquifer contributes to our broad understanding of arsenic in the environment; and allows aquifer specific management procedures and research recommendations to be made. Any coastal or unconsolidated aquifer that has sediments derived from mineralised provenances should consider monitoring for arsenic, and other potentially toxic trace elements, in their groundwater systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquifers - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Groundwater - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a validated falls risk assessment for use in clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Tiedemann, Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Falls risk factor assessment is the first step in the development of appropriate intervention strategies for the prevention of falls. However, few multifactorial, validated falls risk assessments exist which are suitable for use in busy clinical settings. This project aimed to develop a reliable and valid falls risk assessment that was feasible for use in various clinical settings. The QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment was developed and evaluated via four methods; a) the test-retest reliability of the measures was assessed with 30 community-dwelling older people, b) the concurrent validity of the measures was assessed by comparison with performance in the Physiological Profile Assessment, c) the predictive validity of the measures was assessed by comparison of performance with prospective falls in two studies involving large samples of community dwelling older people and d) the feasibility of the assessment was evaluated with 40 clinicians who trialled the assessment with their patients. The QuickScreen clinical falls risk assessment consists of eight measures, including previous falls, total medications, psychoactive medications, visual acuity, touch sensation, the sit to stand test, the near tandem stand test and the alternate step test. The test-retest reliability of the assessment measures was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.89) and the assessment measures discriminated between multiple fallers and non-multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. The clinicians that trialled the assessment reported that it was quick and easy to administer and that it assisted in the management of their elderly patients. These results show that the QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment has proven validity, test-retest reliability and is practical for use in a variety of clinical settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) in old age</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of personality on responses to stressors: an examination of the Grossarth-Maticek personality inventory</field><field name="creator">Caponecchia, Carlo, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Grossarth-Maticek and colleagues presented longitudinal evidence for personality Type being related to disease. Type 1s (cancer prone) and Type 2s (CHD prone) were proposed to be dependent on others, in contrast to the autonomous Type 4s, who had a lower mortality rate at follow-up. Stress was the mechanism proposed to account for the effects of personality on disease, yet this claim has not been systematically investigated. Four studies compared responses of Type 1, 2 and 4 individuals to stress and non-stress tasks. Types 1 and 2 showed increased salivary cortisol responses to an uncontrollable maths stress task (relative to control) compared to Type 4s, and scored higher on perceived stress, state-anxiety, and measures of negative mood, consistent with the implications of the Grossarth-Maticek hypothesis. No significant differences were evident between the Types in response to progressive muscle relaxation, suggesting stress is necessary for Type differences to emerge. Further, Types 1 and 2 responded differently to different stressors (maths vs. exam), arguing against criticisms that Types 1 and 2 are indistinguishable. The relation between Grossarth-Maticek Type subscales was further clarified through their correlations with each other (controlling for mood, stress and social desirability), and with the Lifestyle Defense Mechanisms (LDM) inventory, a psychometric refinement of the Grossarth-Maticek scales. A prospective study examining mortality rates in a sample exposed to environmental noise stressors revealed no prediction of death or cause of death by Grossarth-Maticek Type. This may have been due to the relative youth of the sample, short (7 year) follow-up period, and consequently low death rate. The current research is the first to show different responses to different stressors between Types 1 and 2, and revealed converging evidence for the claim that stress is the mechanism for Type effects on disease. Additionally, theoretical issues in conceptions of stress, and models of the relation between the Types, stress and disease were considered. This project suggests that after a history of criticisms, the Grossarth-Maticek typology should be re-considered for its public health implications, and along with the LDM inventory, should be considered for further investigation of the relation between personality variables and disease.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personality tests</field><field name="subject">diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct shear behaviour of steel fibres in a cementitious matrix.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Gregory G, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An experimental investigation into the direct shear behaviour of steel fibre reinforced composites utilising discrete fibres at pre-defined angles and fibres randomly distributed is described. The direct shear tests encompassed the complete range of loading from its initial application to failure of the double L-shaped push-off specimens. Hooked-ended and straight steel fibres were used in the tests with the fibres oriented at angles of ??75??, ??60??, ??45??, ??30??, ??15?? and 0?? with respect to a plane normal to the loading direction. The embedment lengths of the fibres, related to the total fibre length lf , each side of the shear plane were 0.5lf :0.5lf and 0.25lf :0.75lf . In addition to the single fibre tests, tests were conducted on randomly oriented steel fibre reinforced composites with fibre volumes of 0.005, 0.010, 0.015, and 0.020 with hooked-ended and straight steel fibres.  In addition to the tests outlined above, a series of non-destructive tests employing radiographic techniques was carried out to produce photographic images of events taking place of fibres pulling out from a cementitious element. The tests consisted of hooked-ended steel fibres oriented at angles of -60??, -30??, 0??, +30?? and +60?? to the cracking plane and straight fibres oriented at angles of -60??, 0?? and +60??. The non destructive technique allowed the internal behaviour occurring within the specimen along the shear plane to be investigated without impacting on the direct shear tests.  The angle of the fibre to the interface plane is an important parameter in determining the behaviour of the fibres under load and for the mode of failure; viz fibre pullout or fibre fracture. The effect of the end hook on behavioural aspects becomes increasingly less significant for more acute fibre angles where bending and snubbing effects become increasingly influential on the load versus displacement behaviour and mode of failure.  Contrary to expectations, the fibre embedment length had little influence over the peak loads attained for the discrete fibre tests and, in a number of specimens, fibres pulled out from the longer embedded side. This observation is contrary to the generally accepted assumption that a fibre remains rigidly embedded on the long side and pulls out from short side. The traditional role that uniform bond stresses along a fibre length and friction have played in the description of fibre behaviour is not as significant as previously reported, other effects such as snubbing are more important in anchoring a fibre. Various models need to be revised with this observation in mind.  The experimental results and observations from the discrete hooked-ended and straight steel fibres investigation are incorporated in the development of a behavioural model, the Variable Engagement Model II (VEMII). The VEMII describes the behaviour of randomly oriented discontinuous steel fibre reinforced composites loaded in shear. The model is verified against a series of randomly distributed fibre reinforced mortar specimens carried out in this study. Two forms of models are analysed: 1) a model based on the observation of lumped shear stresses at the fibre hook and in the snubbing zone; and 2) a uniform fibre bond stress applied along the embedded part of the fibre. The lumped bond stress approach and the uniform approach were found to give reasonable comparisons with the test data for the hooked-ended fibres but were conservative for the straight fibres. The VEMII confirms the applicability of the uniform bond approach adopted by previous researchers even though it does not correspond to the observations of fibre pullout behaviour of single fibres. The VEMII model provides a versatile approach that can also be applied to hybrid fibre combinations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Fibers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function of ideas of reason in Kant???s political philosophy.</field><field name="creator">Keating, Paula, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the power of ideas in political philosophy and practice. It argues firstly that Kant???s ideas of reason, as he originally defines them as regulative in the First Critique, play an important role in his political philosophy and his dynamic approach to politics. Secondly, because it is fundamentally concerned with political transition and improvement, Kant???s approach to politics is therefore one that has continuing relevance. Evidence for this is provided via an examination of Rawls??? political liberalism and the manner in which the idea of the reasonable fulfils the role of an idea of reason. The thesis begins with an examination of the regulative use of ideas of reason in the Dialectic of the First Critique: the ideas of soul, world and God become guides for practice, insofar as they are not bearers of truth but instead create essential conditions necessary for human life and meaning. Chapter Two then demonstrates how ideas of reason figure in Kant???s political texts. They condition politics by inspiring the practice of their objects, for example, the establishment of a rightful condition, the security of private property, the perpetuation of peace. That they look to the status quo in order to effect politics, demonstrates their concern with social progress. Chapter Three argues that publicity forms the primary political idea of reason as it enables the polity to use ideas of reason. Because publicity provides the test of efficient and rightful politics, we can say that it is through publicity that Kant???s politics is grounded. Chapter Four investigates Rawls??? political liberalism and observes that the primacy of the idea of the reasonable in his theory works according to a system of ideas of reason as proposed by Kant. Chapter Five then makes a final comparison between Kant and Rawls to demonstrate that ideas of reason, in particular the pre-eminent political idea of public reason, is central to both their conceptions of the political condition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reason.</field><field name="subject">Political science.</field><field name="subject">Kant, Immanuel, 1724-1804.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface grafting of polymers via living radical polymerization techniques; polymeric supports for combinatorial chemistry</field><field name="creator">Zwaneveld, Nikolas Anton Amadeus, Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of living radical polymerization methods has shown significant potential to control grafting of polymers from inert polymeric substrates. The objective of this thesis is to create advanced substrates for use in  combinatorial chemistry applications through the use of g-radiation as a radical source, and the use of RAFT, ATRP and RATRP living radical techniques to control grafting polymerization. The substrates grafted were polypropylene SynPhase lanterns from Mimotopes and are intended to be used as supports for combinatorial chemistry. ATRP was used to graft polymers to SynPhase lanterns using a technique where the lantern was functionalized by exposing the lanterns to gamma-radiation from a 60Co radiation source in the presence of carbon tetra-bromide, producing short chain polystyrene tethered bromine atoms, and also with CBr4 directly functionalizing the surface. Styrene was then grafted off these lanterns using ATRP.  MMA was graft to the surface of SynPhase lanterns, using g-radiation initiated RATRP at room temperature. It was found that the addition of the thermal initiator, AIBN, successfully increased the concentration of radicals to a level where we could achieve proper control of the polymerization.  RAFT was used to successfully control the grafting of styrene, acrylic acid and N,N???-dimethylacrylamide to polypropylene SynPhase Lanterns via a -initiated RAFT agent mediated free radical polymerization process using cumyl phenyldithioacetate and cumyl dithiobenzoate RAFT agents.  Amphiphilic brush copolymers were produced with a novel combined RAFT and ATRP system. Polystyrene-co-poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) created using gamma-radiation and controlled with the RAFT agent PEPDA was used as a backbone. The VBC moieties were then used as initiator sites for the ATRP grafting of t-BA to give a P(t-BA) brush that was then hydrolyzed to produce a PAA brush polymer.  FMOC loading tests were conducted on all these lanterns to assess their effectiveness as combinatorial chemistry supports. It was found that the loading could be controlled by adjusting the graft ratio of the lanterns and had a comparable loading to those commercially produced by Mimotopes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ATRP</field><field name="subject">RAFT</field><field name="subject">Radiation</field><field name="subject">polymerization</field><field name="subject">grafting</field><field name="subject">living radical polymerization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33361</field></doc></add>
